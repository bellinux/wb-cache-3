In the episode [...] "Four Star Spectacular!", [...] "Adam Strange in Worlds War" [...] Kanjar Ro planned to vaporize all sentient life on Rann then conquer the universe. Strange and a stray dog managed to defeat Kanjar Ro. Strange used his Energi-Rod to teleport Kanjar Ro and an active <b>Negaton</b> Bomb to a nearly deserted planet.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Strange {{appears in}} the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode [...] "Mystery in Space", voiced by Michael T. Weiss. Batman is called over to Adam's home planet and he brings Aquaman as well. All three {{alongside}} Adam Strange's wife Alanna go in to stop the Gordanians led by General Kreegaar from obtaining the Eye of Zared {{from the bottom of}} Rann's oceans. Before he can get his wife away from the Gordanians, the effects of the Zeta Ray wears off sending him to Earth. He had to trace another one to get back to Rann only to find out that Rann is now in danger. After the enemy successfully gets the Eye of Zared and starts attacking, Adam Strange starts to have his doubts. His confidence is rekindled by Aquaman, and he goes in to save Alanna, and buy Aquaman and Batman some time to create a solar eclipse to stop the Eye of Zared forcing General Kreegaar's army to surrender. In the series' third season, Adam appears in one of four vignettes in [...] "Four Star Spectacular!", titled [...] "World's War." [...] He is preparing to return to Rann with an anniversary present for his wife when he witnesses dozens of Zeta Beams strike Gotham City. Adam allows himself to be teleported and discovers that Kanjar Ro plans to intercept a Zeta Beam, teleport a <b>negaton</b> bomb to Rann, wipe out the population, and use the planet as a base of operations. The hero manages to teleport Kanjar Ro and his bomb to a swamp world, and the space pirate disarms the bomb just in time, only to run afoul of an alien monster.|$|E
5000|$|Kanjar Ro {{appeared}} in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Marc Worden. He was enemies with the Blue Beetle {{years ago and}} managed to defeat the alien using a sonic-emitting Gamma Gong that the Scarab is vulnerable to. In the episode [...] "The Rise of the Blue Beetle!", {{he returns to the}} same planet to capture the Gribble aliens because their bodies can apparently be used as fuel. During the fight against Batman and the new Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes), he managed {{to find a way to}} get the scarab off of Jaime and wear it in his next fight against Batman. Kanjar Ro was beaten by Reyes after Batman fought and distracted him, letting Jaime use the Gamma Gong to remove it from the space pirate. In the opening of [...] "The Super-Batman of Planet X", Kanjar Ro appears along with his bounty of Space Pirates. They were stopped by Batman, Will Magnus and the Metal Men. Kanjar Ro appears at the beginning of [...] "Night of the Batmen" [...] where he attempts to destroy a planet for profit. He and his robot army is stopped by Batman, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Captain Marvel and Martian Manhunter but Batman is injured when attempting to disarm the bomb. He {{appeared in}} [...] "Four Star Spectacular!" [...] in the [...] "World's War" [...] vignette where he tries to take over Rann by attempting to teleport a <b>negaton</b> bomb, but was foiled by Adam Strange and a puppy after he made several failed attempts to teleport the bomb to the right planet, then was teleported with the bomb he promptly shut down and is last seen eaten to death by a creature.|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{generalized}} Wronskian (Casorati) determinant {{solutions are}} constructed for continuous and discrete soliton equations [33 – 39]. Besides soliton solutions, a broader class of solutions such as rational solutions, <b>negatons,</b> positons and complexitons solutions are {{obtained from the}} generalized Wronskian (Casorati) determinant solutions [33 – 38]. In [39], a general Casoratian formulation is presented for the two-dimensional Toda lattice equation from which various examples of Casoratian type solutions are derived. It is interesting for us to construct the two-dimensional Toda lattice equation with self-consistent sources having a generalized Casorati determinant solution via the source generation procedure. This will bring us a broader class of solutions such as <b>negatons,</b> positons, and complexiton type solutions of the two-dimensional Toda lattice equation with self-consistent sources.|$|R
40|$|We give a {{systematic}} classification and a {{detailed discussion of}} the structure, motion and scattering of the recently discovered <b>negaton</b> and positon solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. There are two distinct types of <b>negaton</b> solutions which we label [S n] and [C n], where (n + 1) is {{the order of the}} Wronskian used in the derivation. For negatons, the number of singularities and zeros is finite and they show very interesting time dependence. The general motion is in the positive x direction, except for certain negatons which exhibit one oscillation around the origin. In contrast, there is just one type of positon solution, which we label [˜ Cn]. For positons, one gets a finite number of singularities for n odd, but an infinite number for even values of n. The general motion of positons is in the negative x direction with periodic oscillations. Negatons and positons retain their identities in a scattering process and their phase shifts are discussed. We obtain a simple explanation of all phase shifts by generalizing the notions of “mass ” and “center of mass ” to singular solutions. Finally, it is shown that <b>negaton</b> and positon solutions of the KdV equation can be used to obtain corresponding new solutions of the modified KdV equatio...|$|E

For our results, when choosing different λ, whether we can get the <b>negatons,</b> positons and complexitons may need further investigation. In what follows, we mainly consider multi-soliton solutions and the solitonic interaction of Eq. (1), this is the topic that we would like to address in this paper.|$|R
3000|$|From (35), we can {{see that}} {{solution}} (36) is a solution in terms of determinants [38, 39]. Here we obtain the solutions in determinant form of NDDEs. However, in [42], a set of coupled conditions consisting of NDDEs is presented for Casorati determinants to solve the Toda lattice equation. The resulting set of eigenfunctions leads to complexitons through the Casoratian formulation, a feasible way has been presented to construct a broad class of Casorati determinant solutions including complexitons and generalized Casorati determinant solutions of the Toda lattice equation. Ma and a co-worker [42] also indicate that integrable equations can have three different kinds of explicit exact transcendental function solutions: <b>negatons,</b> positons and complexitons. Solitons are usually a specific class of <b>negatons.</b> Roughly speaking, <b>negatons</b> and positons are solutions which involve exponential functions and trigonometric functions of space variables, respectively, and they are all associated with real eigenvalues of the associated spectral problems. But complexitons are different solutions which involve both exponential and trigonometric functions of space variables, and they are associated with complex eigenvalues of the associated spectral problems [42]. It is worth pointing out that our results seem to be different from those reported in [42] considering determinant form, but Ma and a co-worker [42] pointed out that the Casorati determinant solution has actually resulted from the Darboux transformation of the Toda lattice equation. Hence we think that these solutions may be the same as Casorati determinant solutions in essence, they may be different only in form, of course, the relation between two kinds of determinant solutions is worthwhile to be studied further. However, {{we should point out that}} there are some differences between our method and [42]. Firstly, the Lax pairs are different, one is the matrix form, the other is the operator form; secondly, the deducing steps are different, comparing with [42] we directly construct the Darboux matrix [...]...|$|R
