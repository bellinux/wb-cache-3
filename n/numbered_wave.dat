30|$|Distinction between mode types {{is quite}} artificial, when we study thermoelastic waves in {{anisotropic}} plates, as the equation for thermal and elastic wave modes, i.e., quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse and shear horizontal modes, will generally be coupled with quasi-thermal modes. Also, for wave propagation {{in the direction}} of symmetry, some wave types revert to pure modes, leading to a simpler characteristic equation of lower order. A consequence of thermoelastic anisotropy in media is the loss of pure wave modes for general propagation direction. At low <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> limits, modes are found to highly influence and they vary with the thermal relaxation times. At relatively low values of the <b>wave</b> <b>number,</b> little change is seen in these values. As the <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> increases, other high modes appear; one of the modes seems to be associated with quick change in the slope of the mode. It is also observed that with changes in thermal relaxation times, lower modes have more influence whereas a small variation is noticed in the high modes. From these figures, it is observed that at low <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> limits, although <b>wave</b> speed modes are dispersive, but are different from the coupled case. Thus, in generalized thermoelasticity, at low values of the <b>wave</b> <b>number,</b> only the lower modes get affected and the little change is seen at relatively high values of the <b>wave</b> <b>number.</b> The low-value region of the <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> is found to be of more physical interest in generalized thermoelasticity. Further, since high <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> limits have no effect in generalized thermoelasticity, then the second sound effects are short lived.|$|R
