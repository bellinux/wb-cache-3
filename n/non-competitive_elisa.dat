30|$|Like biotin, {{streptavidin}} {{binding peptide}} (SBP) has a binding affinity to streptavidin (SA), and this property was exploited to fuse {{it to the}} antigen molecule. The resulting fusion protein binds to the HRP-labeled streptavidin (HRP-SA) with high affinity, forming an HRP-conjugated antigen complex with both antigenicity and enzymatic activity. By avoiding conjugating the HRP to antigen directly, the diagnostic sensitivity is improved since {{the structure of the}} antigen is less affected and steric hindrance between antigen and antibody is decreased. By <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> the affinity constant Ka of the reaction between SBP-Cap∆ 41 and HRP-SA was found to be 8.3  ×  108 M− 1; i.e., higher than that of most immune reactions between antigens and antibodies (Braden and Poljak 1995; Loomans et al. 1995; Zheng et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|In {{the group}} of 73 {{patients}} with recurrent spontaneous abortions, which they had a personal history {{of at least one}} thrombophilic disposition, either congenital acquired mutation of factor V Leiden in heterozygous form, or 20210 mutation in the gene of factor II in heterozygous form or mutation in the gene for MTHFR 677 T or 1298 C in heterozygous or homozygous form, or they had acquired thrombophilic disposition of antiphospholipid syndrome, or hyperhomocysteinemia, we studied the level-progress of blood coagulation parameters during the entire pregnancy. During this period, blood samples were taken from the patients on a regular basis. By some patients the parameters were examined even before pregnancy. Patients were getting nadroparin (Fraxiparine) in the 25 th - 43 rd week of pregnancy, alternatively enoxaparin (Clexane) who had showed allergic reaction. With the indirect detection method using a chromogenic substrate for the analyzer Sysmex CA- 1500 (Sysmex-TOA) we evaluated functional activity of plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor and α 2 -antiplazmin. With the direct <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> method, we found out a quantitative amount of antigen plasminogen tissue activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor and trombomodulin. We documented that the levels of trombomodulin and plasminogen [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We studied 32 {{patients}} with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IHP), 19 {{patients with}} organ-specific autoimmune diseases (OSAD) without IHP, 50 normal controls and a known serum with anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA). Patients' sera were {{tested by the}} classical indirect immunofluorescent technique and by the indirect immunofluorescent complement fixation technique on unfixed cryostat sections of normal human parathyroid, pancreas, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and rat kidney. Five out of 32 patients with IHP, three out of 19 patients with OSAD without IHP and one out of 50 normal controls revealed a bright reactivity against oxyphil cells and a weak reactivity against chief cells of normal parathyroid. These sera also brightly reacted with mitochondria-rich cells and weakly with the remaining cells of only human tissues. The absorption of positive sera with human mitochondria completely abolished this positivity but the absorption with rat mitochondria failed to prevent this reaction. This reactivity was due to an anti-human mitochondrial autoantibody (AHMA) of IgG class. By <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> and Western blot we also demonstrated that every AHMA-positive serum mainly reacted against a human mitochondrial membrane-bound protein of approximate mol. wt. of 46 kd, while the AMA-positive serum reacted against different mitochondrial antigens. The present study shows that a specific parathyroid autoantibody was not detectable in patients with IHP...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} different formats of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detection of virus-specific antibodies {{and focuses on}} factors that may influence the diagnostic reliability of such tests. Newly developed and well-established ELISAs for detection of infections of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) are used as examples. Differences between competitive and <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISAs</b> are described, with special reference {{to the influence of}} the antigen, the conjugated antibody and the test sample on the test results. Attention is drawn to interference, which may result in false positive or false negative test results, with special emphasis on the 'bridging' phenomenon. The use of monoclonal antibodies and discriminatory tests are briefly discussed. Diagnostic reliability is described for tests that are used in monitoring or eradication programmes, emphasising the consequences of false negative and false positive test results. Finally, reducing assay-time and functional quality control for such tests are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} highly {{sensitive}} and specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system {{for analysis of}} p 53 protein in cancer lysates. METHODS: The anti-p 53 monoclonal antibodies DO 7, 1801, BP 53. 12, and 421, and anti-p 53 polyclonal antiserum CM 1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to identify those most suitable for determining p 53 status of cancer cells. Antibodies with desired characteristics were used to develop a <b>non-competitive</b> sandwich type <b>ELISA</b> system for analysis of p 53 expression in cancer cytosols. Using the ELISA, p 53 protein concentrations were measured in a small series of breast cancers, and the quantitative values compared with p 53 immunohistochemical data of the same cancers. RESULTS: DO 7 and 1801 gave the most specific and reliable results on immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Using these two antibodies, a <b>non-competitive</b> sandwich type <b>ELISA</b> system was developed to analyse p 53 quantitatively. Analysis of the breast cancer series showed a good correlation between immunohistochemistry and the ELISA-tumours were generally positive using both techniques. Discrepancies were noted however: some cancers were immunohistochemically negative but ELISA positive. One explanation for this {{may be that the}} ELISA is more sensitive than immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: The p 53 ELISA system is a non-competitive double monoclonal antibody sandwich method, using DO 7 and 1801 which {{have been shown to be}} highly specific for p 53 protein by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The lower threshold of the assay is 0. 1 ng/ml analyte in an enriched recombinant p 53 preparation. As p 53 is now regarded as a protein associated with prognosis in breast and other cancers, the assay may have clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Activated {{complement}} factors {{within the}} lung may induce several local biological effects. In order to investigate local complement activation {{we have developed}} <b>non-competitive</b> two-site <b>ELISAs</b> of C 3 a and total C 3 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). For the assay of C 3 a, both C 3 and C 3 (H 2 O) {{were removed from the}} samples by precipitation with polyethylene glycol. It was necessary to add carrier proteins to BALF to remove C 3 and C 3 (H 2 O) fully. The ELISA of C 3 a has the lowest limit of detection reported thus far, namely 0. 045 nM (= 0. 405 ng/ml). In BALF from healthy persons (n = 9) the C 3 a concentration was 0. 20 nM (0. 12 - 0. 31 nM) (median, range). C 3 a was higher in BALF from patients with asthma or with sarcoidosis; asthma (n = 10), 0. 45 nM (0. 20 - 5. 79 nM); sarcoidosis (n = 19), 1. 31 nM (0. 095 - 5. 65 nM) (Mann-Whitney U test, p less than 0. 005). In BALF from patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis (n = 10) the C 3 a concentration was 0. 18 nM (0. 07 - 0. 57 nM). C 3 a concentrations in BALF may reflect local complement activation in the lung and/or diffusion into the lumen. This was studied by normalizing C 3 a concentrations in BALF into values for epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and calculating serum-to-ELF quotients of C 3 a, and C 3 a/total C 3 quotient...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Two facts must {{be taken}} into {{consideration}} when quantifying fibronectin in biological samples: the sensitivity of the assay method and the appropiate handling of samples. A three-antibody, <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> was used in the present study. This procedure offers a simple, inexpensive and very sensitive technique for evaluating fibronectin: reproducible Standard curves in the ränge 5 — 100 g/l, 3 % variability in the assay, and a detection limit of 0. 5 ng/well that allows accurate measurement of fibronectin in segmental bronchoalveolar lavage and in ascites liquid samples. Typical dilution ranged from 1 / 10000 for plasma to 1 / 100 for bronchoalveolar lavages. For long-term storage of samples two procedures are recommended. First, a rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen, storage at — 20 °C and thawing once at 37 °C avoiding re-freezing. Losses of immunoreactive fibronectin after 35 days storage were 15, 15 and 22 % in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavages and ascites fluid, respectively. Alternatively, samples can be stored äs ammonium sulphate precipitates. This allows the easy availability of the samples when assays have to be repeated, and avoids fractionation in vials and freeze-thawing cycles. Using this storage procedure, losses are, however, slightly higher (22, 25, 25 %, respectively, after 35 days) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Using {{purified}} {{recombinant human}} ventricular myosin light chain 1 (HVMLC 1) as the antigen, three monoclonal antibodies, designated C 8, C 9 and B 12, were prepared. Immunoblot experiments demonstrated that all monoclonal antibodies could react with the ventricular myosin light chain 1 isolated from different sources, such as human, rat or pig. It was also demonstrated that C 8 was {{directed against the}} NN part of the N-fragment (amino acid 1 − 40) of HVMLC 1, and both C 9 and B 12 against the C-fragment (amino acid 99 − 195). The affinity constants of C 8, C 9 and B 12 were 3. 20 × 108, 8. 60 × 107 and 1. 77 × 108 M− 1, respectively, determined by <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA.</b> The isotype of B 12 was determined as IgG 2 a, whereas the isotype of both C 8 and C 9 were IgG 1. In the presence of C 9 or B 12, the actin-activated Mg 2 +ATPase activity of myosin was greatly inhibited, but {{there was almost no}} effect on the Mg 2 +ATPase activity for C 8. B 12 and C 9 also inhibited the superprecipitation of porcine cardiac native actomyosin (myosin B) and reconstituted actomyosin, but C 8 did not. The results indicate that all three monoclonal antibodies could bind the intact myosin molecule, but B 12 and C 9 might more easily react with epitopes located in the C-fragment of HVMLC 1. The inhibitory effects of B 12 and C 9 on ATPase activity and superprecipitation assays show that light chain 1, particularly the C-fragment domain, is involved in the modulation of the actin-activated Mg 2 +ATPase activity of myosin and, as a consequence, plays an essential role in the interaction of actin and myosin...|$|E
40|$|Vibrio mimicus is a {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} ascites disease in fish. We have previously {{demonstrated that the}} outer membrane protein U (OmpU) is an important adhesin in V. mimicus. Here eight specific OmpU-binding phage clones, which presented three different OmpU-binding peptides (designated P 1, P 2, P 3), were screened from a commercially available phage displayed 12 -mer peptide library using rOmpU protein as target. Then, synthetic OmpU-binding peptides were measured for their adhesion antagonistic activity and binding affinity via adhesion inhibition test and <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA,</b> respectively. The results showed that after co-incubated with the mixture of rOmpU and P 3, visible green fluorescence could be observed on the epithelioma papulosum cyprinidi (EPC) cells surface; while the EPC cells co-incubated with the mixture of rOmpU and P 1 /P 2 exhibited little green fluorescence. The average adhesion number of V. mimicus 04 - 14 isolate before and after treatment with peptide was 21. 4 ± 1. 5, 20. 8 ± 0. 8 (irrelevant peptide), 20. 2 ± 0. 5 (P 3), 5. 1 ± 0. 7 (P 1) and 3. 4 ± 0. 8 (P 2), respectively. There was {{a significant decrease in}} the adhesive level of 04 - 14 isolate treated with P 1 / P 2 compared to the untreated isolate (p< 0. 01). The affinity constants of P 1 and P 2 were (6. 17 ± 0. 19) × 108 L/mol and (1. 24 ± 0. 56) × 109 L/mol, respectively. Furthermore, protective effects of P 1 and P 2 on grass carps challenged with V. mimicus were preliminary detected. It was found there was delayed death of fish in the groups treated with P 1 /P 2, and the survival rate of challenged fish improved with the increase of the dose of adhesion antagonistic peptide. Taken together, two novel OmpU-binding peptides, which possessed adhesion antagonistic activity, high affinity and a certain degree of antibacterial activity against V. mimicus, were screened and identified...|$|E
40|$|Simple and {{cost-effective}} methods with sufficient sensitivities for preliminary screening of cyanobacterial toxins are {{in high demand}} for assessing water quality and safety. We have recently developed a highly sensitive and rapid time-resolved fluorometry based non-competitive immunoassay for detection of microcystins and nodularins. The assay {{is based on a}} synthetic broad-specific anti-immunocomplex antibody SA 51 D 1 capable of recognizing the immunocomplex formed by a generic anti-Adda monoclonal antibody (mAb) bound to either microcystins or nodularins. Using the same antibody pair, here we describe a very simple and cost-efficient <b>non-competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> test for microcystins and nodularins based on conventional alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity measurement. The recombinant SA 51 D 1 single-chain fragment of antibody variable domain (scFv) was produced as a fusion with bacterial alkaline phosphatase in Escherichia coli. After one step affinity purification through His-tag, the scFv-AP fusion protein could directly be used in the assay. For the assay, toxin standard/sample, biotinylated anti-Adda mAb and the scFv-AP were incubated together for one hour on streptavidin-coated microtiter wells, washed and AP activity was then measured by incubating (1 h at 37 ˚C) with chromogenic substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). The assay was capable of detecting all the eleven tested toxin variants (microcystin-LR, -dmLR, -RR, -dmRR, -YR, LA -LY, -LF -LW, -WR, and nodularin-R) below WHO guide line value of 1 µg L- 1. The detection limit (based on blank+ 3 SD response) for microcystin-LR was ~ 0. 2 µg L- 1. The assay was verified using spiked (0. 25 - 4 µg L- 1 of microcystin-LR) tap, river and lake water samples with recoveries from 64 to 101 %. The assay showed good correlation (r 2 > 0. 9) with four reference methods for its performance in detecting extracted intracellular microcystin/nodularin from 17 natural surface water samples. The described easy-to-perform assay has a high potential to be used in resource-poor settings as quantitative measurements can be obtained using a simple ELISA reader or easy-to-interpret qualitative results by visual readout. Based on the non-competitive format, the assay does not need any chemical toxin conjugates and offers robustness as compared to the currently available competitive format assays...|$|E
