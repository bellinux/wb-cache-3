40|$|Nitrogen is a main {{contaminant}} of wastewater worldwide. Novel {{processes for}} nitrogen removal {{have been developed}} {{over the last several}} decades. One of these is the partial <b>nitritation</b> process. This process includes the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite without the generation of nitrate. The partial <b>nitritation</b> process has several advantages over traditional nitrification-denitrification processes for nitrogen removal from wastewaters. In addition, partial <b>nitritation</b> is required for anammox elimination of nitrogen from wastewater. Partial <b>nitritation</b> is affected by operational conditions and substances present in the influent, such as quinolone antibiotics. In this review, the impact that several operational conditions, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, hydraulic retention time and solids retention time, have over the partial <b>nitritation</b> process is covered.

A <b>nitritation</b> sequential batch reactor (<b>nitritation</b> SBR) and an anoxic up-flow sludge bed (AnUSB) reactor were applied for effective <b>nitritation</b> and denitritation, respectively. Above 75 % nitrite was accumulated in the <b>nitritation</b> SBR with an influent ammonia loading rate of 0. 43 [*]kg N/d/m 3. During Nitritation-TDD operation, particle sizes (d 50) of the sludge decreased from 406 to 225 [*]um in <b>nitritation</b> SBR and from 327 – 183 [*]um in AnUSB reactor. Pyrosequencing tests revealed that ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) population was stabilized at approximately 7. 0 % (calculated as population of AOB-related genus divided by the total microbial population) in the <b>nitritation</b> SBR.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} <b>nitritation</b> and {{phenolic compounds}} removal using aerobic granular reactors in continuous mode was studied in this thesis. The study {{is divided into}} two main subjects. The first one is devoted to the modeling of nitritatiori, while the other part is dedicated to the experimental study of simultaneous <b>nitritation</b> and phenolic compounds removal. In the modeling study, a mathematical biofilm model was developed to describe <b>nitritation</b> in aerobic granular reactors operating in continuous mode. The model incorporated a [DO]/[TAN] ratio control strategy to maintain the proportion between the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in the reactor effluent to a desired value. The model was validated with a large set of experimental results previously reported in the literature, as well as, data gathered from laboratory and pilot plant granular reactors treating reject water. The model was used to study the effect of a) DO and TAN setpoints, b) operating temperature, c) biofilm characteristics (granules size, density) and d) ammonium concentrations in the influent on the achievement of full <b>nitritation.</b> The results indicated that full <b>nitritation</b> was stably maintained and enhanced by applying the [DO]/[TAN] ratio control strategy in the operation of aerobic granular sludge reactors. Moreover, the model predicted that aerobic granules size larger than 1. 5 mm and high ammonium concentrations in the influent enhanced the achievement of stable full <b>nitritation.</b> Furthermore, at low temperature, full <b>nitritation</b> with granular reactors was demonstrated to be possible. On the contrary, poor influence of the biofilm density on the achievement of full <b>nitritation</b> was found with the simulation study. In the experimental study, an airlift reactor was employed. The airlift reactor was inoculated with granular sludge performing biological nutrient removal. A synthetic wastewater containing a high-strength ammonium concentration (950 ± 25 mg N U 1) was fed into the airlift reactor that was operated until partial <b>nitritation</b> was obtained. Once partial <b>nitritation</b> was achieved, the airlift reactor was bioaugmented with p-nitrophenol (PNP) -degrading activated sludge to enhance the growth of phenols-degraders in the nitrifying granules. Immediately, o-cresol (up to 100 mg L') or PNP (up to 15 mg U') were progressively added to the high-strength ammonium influent with the objective of studying the simultaneous partial <b>nitritation</b> and phenols removal. In the study of simultaneous partial <b>nitritation</b> and o-cresol removal, stable partial <b>nitritation</b> process was maintained for more than 100 days of operation. Moreover, full biodegradation of o-cresol was achieved during the whole experimental period. Also, o-cresol shock load events were applied and the partial <b>nitritation</b> process was kept stable and unaffected during these events. The achieved nitrogen loading rate (NLRv) and o-cresol loading rate (oCLRv) were ca. 1. 1 g N L 1 d 1 and 0. 11 g o-cresol Ld', respectively. Analysis of fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that Acinetobacter genus, betaproteobacterial ammoniaoxidizing bacteria (f 3 AOB) and Nitrobacter sp. were identified into the granules. The operation of the reactor was continued to perform an experiment devoted to assessing its performance under three sequentially alternating pollutant (SAP) scenarios. In each one of the SAP scenarios, 15 mg U' of a secondary phenolic compound (i. e. p-nitrophenol (PNP), phenol or 2 -chlorophenol (2 CP)) was added to the regular influent composed of ammonium and o-cresol (the primary phenolic compound) {{for a short period of}} time (between 20 to 25 days). The results illustrated that partial <b>nitritation</b> and o-cresol biodegradation were maintained without exhibiting any sign of inhibition by the presence of PNP or phenol.

However, the <b>nitritation</b> {{is limited by}} the low growth rates of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In this study, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated for 300 days to assess its <b>nitritation</b> performance and the shift of microbial community. Results showed that the reactor obtained satisfying <b>nitritation</b> after a startup period of 50 days, which finally achieved ammonium conversation rates of about 0. 8 kg N/m(3) /d. The apparent half-saturation constant (K-m) and maximum ammonium oxidation rate (r(max)) of the AOB-enriched culture were determined to be 6. 1 mg N/L and 1. 1 kg N/g-VSS/d, respectively. In addition, lower fouling rates were found in the initial operating days that the reactor was fed with lower ammonium loads (day 0 -day 150). However, the increased ammonium loads (> 0. 6 kg N/m(3) /d) in the following 150 days resulted in increases in extracellular polysaccharides, leading to much higher fouling rates. 16 S rRNA high-throughput sequencing analysis showed clear changes in the microbial community populations during the MBR operation. Results also showed that ordinary heterotrophic organisms and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were successively inhibited; finally Nitrosomonas dominated in the <b>nitritation</b> MBR, with relative abundance of 40 - 46 %. Moreover, the AOB-enriched culture was of higher microbial diversity than the seeding sludge.

Three different set-ups with different reactor capacities were used (3, 110, and 150 L). High strength synthetic wastewaters and reject water were tested with similar performance.

In a {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) with Kaldnes ® biofilm carriers, we stabilised urine as a 1 : 1 ammonium nitrate solution. The maximum nitrification rate was 380 gN/m 3 /d corresponding to 1. 7 gN/m 2 biofilm/d. Nitrite ammonium solutions were produced in a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with 4. 8 days sludge retention time (SRT) at 30 °C and in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with more than 30 days SRT. Nitrate build-up was negligible in both reactors. <b>Nitritation</b> rates were 780 gN/m 3 /d in the CSTR and 280 gN/m 3 /d in the SBR, respectively.

Increased load, stricter effluent regulations, and demands for reduced resource and energy consumption present new challenges for the {{wastewater treatment plants}}. One option when upgrading a wastewater treatment plant is to treat the sludge liquor produced when dewatering digested sludge separately. The aim of this thesis was to analyse and evaluate the operational aspects of two nitrite accumulated systems, <b>nitritation</b> and nitritation-denitritation, in a full-scale sequencing batch reactor at Sjölunda Wastewater Treatment Plant in Malmö, Sweden. Other aims were to quantify nitrogen oxides emissions in the off-gas from the SBR, {{as well as to}} evaluate the dynamics of these emissions. Finally, to get an overall view of the chosen processes and configuration, another part of the aim was to compare these to other methods for sludge liquor treatment in terms of operational, financial and environmental aspects. High ammonium removal and removal rates are possible in a <b>nitritation</b> system treating sludge liquor at a constant low pH (6. 8) and at high nitrite concentrations (around 800 mg NO 2 [...] N/L), i. e. in conditions with high free nitrous acid concentrations.

The model confirmed that the decrease of the NO/N 2 O ratio can be explained by an increase of the ND pathway {{to the detriment of the}} NN pathway. The ND pathway was systematically the predominant pathway during <b>nitritation.</b> The combined effect 2 of nitrite (or free nitrous acid) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on the contribution of each pathway was in agreement with practical observations and the literature...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{removal from}} sludge reject water was {{obtained}} by oxygen-limited partial <b>nitritation</b> resulting in nitrite accumulation in a first stage, followed by autotrophic denitrification of nitrite with ammonium as electron donor (similar to anaerobic ammonium oxidation) in a second stage. Two membrane-assisted bioreactors (MBRs) were used in series to operate with high sludge ages and subsequent high volumetric loading rates, achieving 1. 45 kg N m- 3 day- 1 for the partial <b>nitritation</b> MBR and 1. 1 kg N m- 3 day- 1 for the anaerobic ammonium oxidation MBR. Biomass retention in the <b>nitritation</b> stage ensured flexibility towards loading rate and operating temperature. Nitrite oxidisers were out-competed at low oxygen and high free ammonia concentration. Biomass retention in the second MBR prevented wash-out of the slowly growing bacteria. Nitrite and ammonium were converted to dinitrogen gas in a reaction ratio of 1. 05, thereby maintaining nitrite limitation to assure process stability. The anoxic consortium catalysing the autotrophic denitrification process consisted of Nitrosomonas-like aerobic ammonium oxidizers and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria closely related to Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. The overall removal efficiency of the combined process was 82 % of the incoming ammonium according to a total nitrogen removal rate of 0. 55 kg N m- 3 day- 1, without adding extra carbon source...|$|E
40|$|As {{the first}} step in {{intended}} nitrogen removal by combination of <b>nitritation</b> and ANAMMOX process, the paIiial <b>nitritation</b> of simulated leachate was studied in lab-scale reactor using acryl resin fiber as the biomass carrier. The influent had ammonium concentration up to 240 mgN/L, TOCINH 4 -N ratio of about 0. 1 and quite high concentration of inorganic ions (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Fe 2 +, cr, sol-, [...] .). After start-up time, the reactor was put into operation at HRT of 6 h, volumetric loading rate up to 1. 0 kg NH 4 -N/m 3. d. The effects of operating factors (e. g. temperature, pH and air flowrate) on responses including ammonium conversion percentage, effluent N 02 -NINH 4 -N ratio and effluent N 03 -N were assessed by statistical screening experimental design. The preliminary results showed that in the experimental circumstance, air flowrate was the most significant factor affecting to the targets and it could get a controllability of partial <b>nitritation.</b> The ammonium conversion of 52 - 54 %, effluent N 02 -NINH 4 -N ratio of about 1. 0 and effluent nitrate fraction of about 10 % were obtained. These results are well expected for next step of ANAMMOX process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] Ammonia {{biofiltration}} performance under shock loads episodes was {{studied in}} a reactor packed with coconut fiber as carrier material. Periodical gas and leachate samplings were analyzed {{and used to}} characterize the biofilter performance in terms of removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC). Nitrogen fractions in the leachate were quantified to identify the experimental rates of <b>nitritation</b> and nitratation [...] In a primary experiment a sudden increment of ammonia load was applied for 1 day by changing the ammonia inlet load from 5. 2 to 29. 1 g N. m- 3. h- 1. Even though stable operation was obtained (RE of 99. 9 %), a notable accumulation of nitrite was verified in the leachate. Experimental rates showed that <b>nitritation</b> increased at the same the same ratio that ammonia load was varied. However the nitratation seemed to be largely affected by high ammonia and nitrite concentration. In a subsequent experiment varying the inlet ammonia load, the system was rapidly recovered by increasing the watering rate. Since ammonia was partially removed by physicochemical process as observed in previous experiments, a final experimental was conducted to improve the <b>nitritation</b> capacity. The addition of inorganic carbon source demonstrated to enhance {{the capacity of the}} biofilter to degrade a higher amount of ammonia...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of partial <b>nitritation</b> and anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) has been mainly {{applied to the}} treatment of wastewaters with high ammonium concentration and low content of biodegradable organic carbon. So far, only few studies have focused on the application of partial nitritation-anammox process {{to the treatment of}} ammonium-rich wastewaters characterized also by a high organic carbon to nitrogen ratio (Corg/N), {{as well as by the}} presence of toxic substances: in this study, an anammox reactor was started-up and fed with the effluent from a partial <b>nitritation</b> reactor treating IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) wastewater, in order to evaluate its feasibility as an alternative to the currently applied chemical-physical-biological treatment. A sequencing batch reactor was inoculated with granular anammox biomass and run at controlled temperature (35 ± 0. 5 °C) and pH (7. 7 ± 0. 3). The synthetic influent containing NH 4 -N (up to 250 mg/L) and NO 2 -N (up to 330 mg/L) was progressively replaced by the IGCC wastewater, which had been pre-treated in the lab-scale partial <b>nitritation</b> reactor. When the reactor was fed with the synthetic medium at the target nitrogen loading rate (NLR, 0. 350 gN/L·d), the observed NH 4 -N removal efficiency was 93 ± 5...|$|E
40|$|In {{most modern}} {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTP) nitrogen, which is generally {{in the form of}} ammonium or organic nitrogen, is removed by biological nitrification - denitrification. This process consists of two steps: nitrification, where ammonium is oxidized to nitrate and denitrification, in which the formed nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas under anoxic conditions by means of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) (Metcalf and Eddy 1991). However, there are some serious disadvantages: aeration costs, excessive sludge production and dependence on (external) carbon source. A new process for high loaded nitrogen streams, including partial <b>nitritation</b> and Anammox (ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation), eliminates these disadvantages. Half of the incoming ammonium is transformed to nitrite in the first step (partial <b>nitritation,</b> rate NH 4 +/NO 2 - = 1). Next, the formed nitrite and the remaining ammonium is converted into nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions (Anammox). This process can be applied to treat ammonium-rich wastewater, for instance water from a sludge digester at a WWTP (Mulder et al. 2001; Hellinga et al. 1998). The drawback of the Anammox bacteria is their slow growth rate, which has a negative effect on the start-up time of such reactor, making experimental studies difficult. As a consequence, preventing the wash out of these organisms is in this case very important (Strous et al. 1998; Jetten et al. 1998). The goal of this thesis was testing different reactor configurations in order to analyze the influence of varying parameters on these systems. The three elaborately tested CASR reactors (Conventional Activated Sludge Reactor) are an oxygen limited partial <b>nitritation</b> reactor, an Anammox reactor and a combination of partial <b>nitritation</b> and Anammox in one single reactor. All three were tested under different parameter settings of temperature, pH, biomass retention, nitrogen load, COD and HRT (Hydraulic Retention Time). The software program WEST® (MOSTforWATER) was used to obtain the results of this modeling study...|$|E
40|$|Nitrification via nitrite was {{studied in}} two aerobic {{reactors}} treating wastewater from an aminoplastic resin producing factory at HRT varying between 1. 37 - 1. 89 and 2. 45 - 3. 63 days. Both reactors were fed with concentrations of 366, 450, 1099 and 1899 mg N-NH 4 +/L. In {{general in the}} reactor operated at a lower HRT, the <b>nitritation</b> percentage decreased from 87. 2 to 21. 6 %, while the nitratation percentage remained always lower than 2. 5 % (except in the last period) when the ammonium concentration was increased. This behaviour {{could be due to}} the inhibition of the ammonium and nitrite oxidation produced by high free ammonia concentrations up to 179. 3 mg N-NH 3 /L. In the reactor operated at a higher HRT, the <b>nitritation</b> percentage decreased and the nitratation percentage increased from 88. 6 to 39. 6 % and from 0. 65 to 35. 7 %, respectively, due to an increase of the dissolved oxygen concentration from 0. 76 to 1. 02 mg O 2 /L. However, when ammonium was fed at a concentration of 1898. 7 mg N-NH 4 +/L, the <b>nitritation</b> increased and the nitratation decreased, probably {{as a result of the}} accumulation of free ammonia up to 2. 04 mg N-NH 3 /L, meaning that nitrite oxidizers were inhibited. Nitrite build-up was observed after each modification of ammonium concentration in the feed...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} removal via nitrite {{may represent}} a promising process for the optimization of nitrogen removal, in particular {{in the presence of}} a low biodegradable COD/TKN ratio. In the present study a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was monitored for approximately 2 years to evaluate the use of dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as monitoring parameters in order to optimize nitrogen removal via nitrite from leachate generated in old sanitary landfills. The SBR manifested a nitrification efficiency exceeding 99 % whereas, due to the low biodegradability of the organic matter presents in the leachates, COD removal reached approximately 40 % and the addition of external COD was required to accomplish denitrification process. Moreover, the results demonstrate that DO, pH and ORP are reliable parameters for use in the monitoring of <b>nitritation</b> and denitritation processes in SBRs treating landfill leachates. Through manual modification of the length of the SBR phases to achieve nitrogen removal via nitrite, the <b>nitritation</b> and denitritation processes were rendered unstable leading to the saving of 20 % in addition of external COD, almost half the theoretically achievable value. Furthermore, the low dissolved oxygen concentration applied during the oxic phases in an attempt to increase the <b>nitritation</b> process would appear to cause the settling characteristics of the activated sludge to deteriorate...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{nitrification}} to nitrite (<b>nitritation)</b> can {{be achieved}} in a continuous process without sludge retention by wash out of nitrite oxidising bacteria (NOB) while retaining ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB), at elevated temperatures (the SHARON process) and, as demonstrated in this paper, also at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Enriched AOB was attained at a low DO concentration (0. 4 mg l(- 1)) and a dilution rate of 0. 42 day(- 1) in a continuous process. A higher oxygen affinity of AOB compared to NOB seemed critical to achieving this. This was verified by determining the oxygen half saturation constant, K-o, with similar oxygen mass transfer resistances for enriched AOB and NOB as 0. 033 +/- 0. 003 mg l(- 1) and 0. 43 +/- 0. 08 mg l(- 1), respectively. However, the extent of <b>nitritation</b> attained {{was found to be}} highly sensitive to process upsets...|$|E
