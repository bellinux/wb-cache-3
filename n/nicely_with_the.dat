He laid out Washington Avenue parallel to the river, with other streets running parallel to and perpendicular to Washington. He later questioned his decision, thinking he should have run the streets directly east-west and north-south, but it ended up aligning <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plat of St. Anthony. The wide, straight streets, with Washington and Hennepin Avenue being [...] wide and the others being [...] wide, contrasted with Saint Paul's streets that were [...] wide.|$|E

500|$|In {{his junior}} year, Petoskey {{was one of}} the {{favorite}} pass receivers for [...] quarterback Harry Newman, who won the Douglas Fairbanks trophy as the Most Valuable Player in college football. [...] Coach Harry Kipke shifted Petoskey to fullback midway through the 1932 season, and he scored two touchdowns in a 32–0 win over Illinois. [...] The United Press noted: [...] "A running attack which featured Ted Petoskey, converted from an end to a fullback in the last week by Coach Harry Kipke dovetailed <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wolverine aerial play to produce the touchdowns. [...] With Petoskey plunging the line and sweeping inside the ends for many sizeable gains, the Michigan eleven showed power through the line {{for the first time this}} season." [...] An Associated Press writer warned opponents to watch out for Petoskey: [...] "It is about time for grid foeman to wake up when Ted Petoskey, end and fullback on the University of Michigan football team, gets to dreaming. [...] Petoskey's dreams have a habit of coming true, and happily for Petoskey, most of his dreams are good ones." ...|$|E

But I'd say it fits in <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general run of {{competency}} to excellence we've been seeing so far this season. It was modestly funny, a little sweet, and not at all horrible." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – which is pretty much what happened." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed the subplots commenting that Tracy's [...] "played well" [...] and Jenna and Paul's [...] "was both sweet and ridiculous". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student said it was [...] "a ton of fun to watch" [...] all the subplots play out and considered [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] as [...] "probably one of the two or three best episodes of the season thus far. In fact... {{it may have been the}} best Christmas episode of 30 Rock yet." [...] Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline enjoyed Stritch and Alda's [...] "wonderfully funny roles".|$|E

2500|$|The Henry IV cycle {{was planned}} to be {{composed}} of scenes from the king's military career. [...] The violence of these images would contrast <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> relative peace and regal quality of the scenes in the Marie de' Medici cycle. The Battle of Ivry on the East Wall of the gallery is a scene of Henry's most decisive battle to unify the city of Paris. Primarily gray, the sketch shows the king in crimson velvet to stand out in [...] "the most famous of all the battles of Henry IV." [...] He {{is shown in the}} center of the scene raising a flaming sword. His victorious army rushes in chaotically behind him; horses rearing and riders falling.

2500|$|The Historia Brittonum gives {{a list of}} 33 ancient {{cities of}} Britain, among them 'Cair Peris', its {{location}} unspecified. It also contains {{a reference to the}} Picts and Orkney and a place 'ultra mare Frenessicum'. [...] The 'Cair' in 'Cair Peris' is reasonably taken to be Welsh 'Caer' (fort), while 'Peris' is a matter of speculation and conjecture, including the supposition that it is a reference to 'Frisians'. In the context of the Historia, the 'mare Frenessicum' coincides <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Firth of Forth. While the Historia is often useful to scholars, it is also the source of storyline details that have no discernible provenance. It was written more than 500 years after the last unambiguous reference to the ancient Frisii (the Panegyrici Latini in c. 297), {{and at a time when}} medieval Frisia and the Frisians were playing a dominant role in North Sea trade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion that}} viruses were {{particles}} {{was not considered}} unnatural and fitted in <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> germ theory. It is assumed that Dr. J. Buist of Edinburgh {{was the first person}} to see virus particles in 1886, when he reported seeing [...] "micrococci" [...] in vaccine lymph, though he had probably observed clumps of vaccinia. In the years that followed, as optical microscopes were improved [...] "inclusion bodies" [...] were seen in many virus-infected cells, but these aggregates of virus particles were still too small to reveal any detailed structure. It was not until the invention of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska (1906–1988) and Max Knoll (1887–1969), that virus particles, especially bacteriophages, were shown to have complex structures. The sizes of viruses determined using this new microscope fitted in well with those estimated by filtration experiments. Viruses were expected to be small, but the range of sizes came as a surprise. Some were only a little smaller than the smallest known bacteria, and the smaller viruses were of similar sizes to complex organic molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the harsh}} {{extremes}} in temperature on the Indian Subcontinent, the sari fills a practical role {{as well as}} a decorative one. It is not only warming in winter and cooling in summer, but its loose-fitting tailoring is preferred by women who must be free to move as their duties require. For this reason, it is the clothing of choice of air hostesses on Air India. This led to a professional style of draping a sari which is referred to [...] "Air-Hostess style sari". An air hostess style sari is tied in just the same way as a normal sari except that the pleats are held together quite <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of pins. A bordered sari will be just perfect for an Air-Hostess style drape where the pallu is heavily pleated and pinned on the shoulder. Even the vertical pleats that are tucked at the navel are severely pleated and pressed. Same goes for the pallu pleats that are pinned at the shoulder. To get the perfect [...] "Air-hostess" [...] a complimentary U-shaped blouse that covers the upper body completely is worn which gives a very elegant and formal look. Mastering the [...] "Air-hostess" [...] style drape helps to create the desired impact in a formal setting like an interview or a conference.|$|E

Kalaua, Kea, {{and the native}} {{servants}} were none of them loitering about on the verandah or in the sitting-room, where they generally lounged. I {{seemed to be in}} sole possession of the establishment, and I hobbled out by myself a little way on to the platform in front of the house, wondering what on earth could have become of all the inhabitants in a body together.

60|$|The countenance of Captain Borroughcliffe, {{when the}} {{sentinel}} admitted {{him to the}} apartment he had selected, was in that state of doubtful illumination, when looks of peculiar cunning blend so <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stare of vacancy, that the human face is rendered not unlike an April day, now smiling and inviting, and at the next moment clouded and dreary. It was quite apparent that the soldier had an object for his unexpected visit, by the importance of his air and the solemnity of the manner with which he entered on the business. He waved his hand for the sentinel to retire, with lofty dignity, and continued balancing his body, during {{the closing of the}} door, and while a sound continued audible to his confused faculties, with his eyes fixed {{in the direction of the}} noise, with that certain sort of wise look that in many men supplies the place of something better. When the captain felt himself secure from interruption, he moved round with quick military precision, in order to face the man of whom he was in quest. Griffith had been sleeping, though uneasily and with watchfulness; and the Pilot had been calmly awaiting the visit which it seemed he had anticipated; but their associate, who was no other than Captain Manual, of the marines, was discovered in a very different condition from either. Though the weather was cool and the night tempestuous, he had thrown aside his pea-jacket, with most of his disguise, and was sitting ruefully on his blanket, wiping, with one hand, the large drops of sweat from his forehead, and occasionally grasping his throat with the other, with a kind of convulsed mechanical movement. He stared wildly at his visitor, though his entrance produced no other alteration in these pursuits than a more diligent application of his handkerchief and a more frequent grasping of his naked neck, as if he were willing to ascertain, by actual experiment, what degree of pressure the part was able to sustain, without exceeding a given quantity of inconvenience.|$|E
