25|$|The Loire hosts about 64% of <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> {{species of}} France, that is 164 species, of which 54 are water birds, 44 species are common for managed forests, 41 to natural forests, 13 {{to open and}} 12 to rocky areas. This {{avifauna}} has been rather stable, at least between the 1980s and 2000s, with significant abundance variations observed only for 17 species. Of those, five species were growing in population, four declining, and other eight were fluctuating. Some of these variations had a global nature, such as {{the expansion of the}} Mediterranean gull in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Rancho Guadalupe Dunes County Park {{is located}} at the {{southern}} end of the dunes and is owned by the Santa Barbara County Parks and leased to the Center for Natural Lands Management. In comparison to other areas of the Dunes, Rancho Guadalupe Dunes County Park is the least damaged by introduced invasive plant species. For visitors, the Park offers bird and whale watching, fishing, hiking areas, picnic area (no BBQs/cooking permitted), interpretive kiosk and trailer. Seasonal restrictions during the <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> season (Mar 1 - Oct 1) apply and are posted on site.|$|E
25|$|Rats were {{probably}} introduced via shipwrecks; supposedly, a coal boat that sank offshore {{was the first}} culprit and caused great harm to the <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> populations, with the puffins proving vulnerable {{to the extent of}} extinction as breeding birds. After a long campaign using pioneering techniques, the rats were eradicated in 1991, and now puffins are once again raising young on the island with many other benefits occurring to both the fauna and the flora. It is thought that the puffins recolonised Ailsa Craig from Glunimore and Sheep Islands.|$|E

25|$|This stork shows unique nesting {{behaviours}} {{not observed}} {{in many other}} storks and that may reflect its adaptation to nesting on the ground. For example, {{it is one of}} a minority of stork species to perform a distinct Nest Covering Display to protect nestlings from potential predators. During this display, the nesting stork droops its wings along its sides with a strongly cocked tail and erect feathers on the head and neck; accompanied by a clattering of the bill that is pointed almost vertically downward. Another nesting behaviour apparently unique to the maguari stork is the Mock Resting display. Here, during the presence of an intruder near the nest, the individual stands motionless with its back strongly arched, neck retracted, and wings and bill folded almost vertically downward. This behaviour likely evolved as an adaptation to ground nesting in dense vegetation because the posture maintained by the <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> amongst the grass and reeds may render it difficult to see by the intruder; and at the same time, the bird is poised ready to attack.|$|E
2500|$|Today, Pelican Island is also {{threatened}} by shoreline development. [...] Shoreline development has many negative impacts associated with it. [...] Shoreline development {{can reduce the}} water quality by increasing the runoff of sediments, fertilizers, and pesticides. [...] These runoffs will cause decline in water quality, and this can directly affect the food base that sustains the islandâ€™s <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> colonies. [...] Waterfront development will also lead to more boat traffic. [...] This extra boat traffic will also negatively affect the birds on the coast. [...] Not only this, development of the shorelines of Pelican Island will permanently flaw the pristine character of this unique National Historic Landmark.|$|E
2500|$|The maguari stork is {{primarily}} a colonial nester, although it also less frequently nests solitarily. Solitary nests {{are found to be}} less successful than colonial nests in terms of survival of the young, but survival rates in the former appear to be more consistent. Colonies typically consist of 5-15 nests, some of which are within 50cm apart in tree colonies, but at different heights. One colony from a study on the llanos comprised as many as 40 nests. Colonial and solitary nesters also differ in the way they defend their nests. Colonial nesters are more aggressive than solitary nesters and physically attack intruders with bill jabbing. Contrarily, solitary nesters use a [...] "lead-away" [...] strategy, in which the <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> walks up behind the intruder with threatening bill clattering, and ceases to clatter its bill when the intruder moves away from the nest.|$|E
