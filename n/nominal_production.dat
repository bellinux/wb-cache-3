40|$|We {{explain the}} puzzling {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} investory accounting choice through a management signaling argument. We assert that firms with lower <b>nominal</b> <b>production</b> costs than other firms have relatively less to gain from the tax advantages assocaited with LIFO adoption. For these firms, future <b>nominal</b> <b>production</b> costs are lower due to increased efficiency or technological improvements. Because of asymmetric information about future costs, and the moral hazard problem of direct communication, the managers of the more efficient firms are able to credibly communicate their production superiority by using the FIFO accounting method. We show in this paper that, if firms can choose the fraction of their inventory which is allocated to FIFO and LIFO, then a separating equillibrium exists in which firms with lower production costs signal their greater efficiency by allocating a higher fraction of their invetory to FIFO...|$|E

40|$|In an assemble-to-order system, a {{wide variety}} of {{products}} are rapidly assembled from component inventories, in response to customer orders. Orders must be filled within a product-specific target leadtime. In the event that some of the components required to fill an order are out-of-stock, these components are expedited at a high cost per unit. The objective is to minimize the expected infinite horizon discounted cost of <b>nominal</b> component <b>production</b> and expediting. This discounted formulation captures financial inventory holding costs. The levers for control are (1) sequencing orders for assembly (2) component production (3) component expediting. Under the assumption that expedited components have zero leadtime, the multi-dimensional assemble-to-order control problem separates into single-item inventory control problems. The optimal production and expediting policy for each component is independent of all other components. Hence the literature on single-item inventory management with expediting or lost sales is directly relevant to the control of assemble-to-order systems.

30|$|To make a trustful {{decision}} {{about the future}} field development plans of the cyclic CO_ 2 -assisted gravity drainage (GAGD) process, two different successive uncertainty quantification approaches were conducted to obtain the true optimal solution of oil recovery in the South Rumaila oil field. Given the base reservoir model of <b>nominal</b> <b>production</b> controls, the uncertainty was first quantified in terms of geological parameters. Therefore, nine realizations for each of permeability and anisotropy ratio were created and systematically simulated into the compositional reservoir model for geological uncertainty assessment. More specifically, DoE was adopted to create 81 distinct reservoir models honoring these nine realizations for each property to obtain the reservoir flow response of oil recovery. There was a significant impact of the geological uncertainties on the reservoir flow response as there was an important gap between the least-likely and most-likely field cumulative oil production.|$|E

In principle, the <b>nominal</b> <b>production</b> recipe assumes an optimum balance between quality and costs for batches of products.

The framework considers a batch recipe model that interacts with a plant-wide model to constitute the so-called flexible recipe model. First, the potential use of this framework is shown by integrating a general multipurpose batch process scheduling algorithm into a general linear recipe model. Next, this framework is illustrated in practice using a real industrial scenario that exhibits complex recipe behavior. Finally, the benefits of considering the flexible recipe concept for the scheduling of batch {{processes are}} discussed. 1...|$|E

The solar-assisted multi-effect distillation system comprises 849 m 2 of evacuated-tube collectors, 280 m 3 water storage tanks, auxiliary heater, and six effects and a condenser. The present analysis employs a baseline configuration, namely; (i) the local solar insolation input (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), (ii) a coolant flow rate through the headers of collector based on ASHRAE standards, (iii) a heating water demand, and (iv) the augmentation of water temperature by auxiliary when the supply temperature from the solar tank drops below the set point. It is observed that the annual collector efficiency and solar fraction decrease from 57. 3 to 54. 8 % and from 49. 4 to 36. 7 %, respectively, with an increase in the heating water temperature from 80 to 90 °C.

Attention is focused on that phase in the design process in which variants are developed and evaluated with emphasis on the evaluation. The proposed evaluation procedure combines an economic evaluation with {{an evaluation of the}} hydraulic qualities- The economic evaluation implicates the determination of the internal rate of return but reduces to the determination of the net present value of the cost if no agricultural production level can be defined- The evaluation of the hydraulic qualities involves the steady and non-steady design criteria for various land uses or for various return periods. The evaluation is presented in a balance sheet where the economic evaluation can be balanced against {{the degree to which the}} design fulfils the design criteria. This enables the designer to develop various variants while evaluating.

40|$|Government {{intervention}} in product and factor markets generally leads to trade distortions. Conventional measures of government intervention, {{such as the}} Producer Subsidy Equivalent and the Nominal Rate of Protection, are often {{used to compare the}} effects of alternative policies on trade. This chapter demonstrates that the size of a trade distortion is often not closely linked to the level of producer support or protection but is closely related to a more fundamental variableâ€”the economic efficiency of a government program. The trade-distorting policies can generally be ranked; the least efficient policies are the most trade distorting, and the most efficient policies are the least trade-distorting. An empirical examination of several important policies in Canada and the United States reveals that the efficiency criteria we propose can consistently rank policies according to their trade-distorting effects whereas more conventional measures, such as the Producer Subsidy Equivalent and <b>Nominal</b> Rate of <b>Production,</b> often fail to measure trade distortions. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper tests some {{empirical}} {{implications of}} a theoretical model which proposes {{that the relationship between}} growth and its uncertainty depends fundamentally on whether the stochastic shocks causing fluctuations are real or nominal and on the presence of nominal rigidities in the economy. Shock uncertainty associated with cyclical variation is captured by a dynamic conditional variance model that estimates the time-varying, unpredictable volatility of nominal and real shocks and their effects on growth. In the context of a bivariate GARCH-in-Mean model we test the empirical conditional mean and variance relationships of <b>nominal</b> money and <b>production</b> growth rates in the G 7 countries. We find that growth uncertainty has an insignificant effect but nominal money shock uncertainty exerts a negative and significant influence on growth for some of the G 7. This is considered as supportive empirical evidence of the theoretical model predictions particularly on the link between nominal shock uncertainty and output growth. Another implication of the theoretical model that gains empirical support is that an increase in the average rate of money growth has a positive effect on the average output growth rate. growth uncertainty, learning-by-doing, monetary uncertainty, multivariate GARCH-in-mean, nominal rigidity...|$|R
