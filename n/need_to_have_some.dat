25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

2500|$|Nungesser {{complained that}} he had not been allowed to {{introduce}} Facebook messages as evidence. Nungesser and Sulkowicz exchanged several messages {{in the days and weeks}} after the alleged rape. In one message, two days after the alleged rape, Sulkowicz accepted an invitation to a party from Nungesser, writing: [...] "I feel like we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> real time where we can talk about life and thingz, because we still haven't really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr." [...] Sulkowicz says she sent the messages because she was upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Nungesser {{presented}} Facebook messages sent August 29, 2012 {{two days}} after the alleged rape where Sulkowicz responded to a party invitation with [...] "lol yussss.

Sulkowicz confirmed the authenticity and time stamps of the messages, but included her annotations. Sulkowicz believed that Paul sent the message to avoid suspicion and said her response was so that Nungesser would not be scared to discuss the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Lost in Time {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} 1970s soul music. For the album, Benét sought {{to expand on}} the classicist soul style of his previous album's title track, [...] "Love & Life", and produce an album-length homage to 1970s-era R Benét said of the album's style in a press release, [...] "People just <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> feel good R in their lives. I want people to remember what music can feel like, and that desire took {{me all the way}} back to that time. My development as an artist is a direct result of being immersed in that era [...] When it comes to something that resonates in your soul, you have to have something constructed with live musicians".

50|$|This {{demonstrates}} that this ancient period {{had a sense}} of the afterlife, though archaeological evidence may show the average person had little chance of getting into it. This may be because admission required that the deceased must be able to serve a purpose there. The pharaoh was allowed in because of his role in life, and others <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> role there.|$|R

50|$|One {{response}} to this question was suggested in 1929 by Leó Szilárd and later by Léon Brillouin. Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell's demon would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy.|$|E
50|$|The tactile {{system is}} the sense of touch. Someone with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may have {{symptoms}} {{of not being able to}} process any form of physical connection.

50|$|In {{order for}} close range {{marketing}} to work effectively, a person <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of application installed to his mobile device that accepts push notifications.

25|$|One more {{issue is}} that some complex {{instructions}} are difficult to restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), {{but in many cases}} this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> hidden state <b>to</b> remember which parts went through and what remains to be done. With a load/store machine, the program counter is sufficient to describe the state of the machine.|$|R
5000|$|This opening aphorism confronts us {{with the}} {{multiplicity}} of meanings that the ascetic ideal has for different groups: (a) artists, (b) philosophers, (c) women, (d) physiological casualties, (e) priests, and (f) saints. The ascetic ideal, we may thus surmise, means very little in itself, other than as a compensation for humanity's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> goal or other. As Nietzsche puts it, man [...] "will rather will nothingness than not will".|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of mental disorders over the lifetime, {{it has been argued}} that everyone will either develop one of these disorders themselves or have close contact with someone else who does. Consequently, members of the public <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> knowledge to allow them to recognize, prevent and seek early help for mental disorders. They also need to have the skills to support other people in their social network who develop a mental disorder.|$|E
50|$|It {{would appear}} that gynodioecy should not persist. In order {{for it to be}} maintained, the females <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of a {{reproductive}} advantage over the hermaphroditic population, known as female compensation or female advantage. Female advantage includes an increase in saved energy from not producing pollen and making seedlings of higher quality, since hermaphrodite seedlings are susceptible to homozygous deleterious alleles. Additional advantages include more flowers, higher fruit set, higher total seed production, heavier seeds, and better germination rates.|$|E
30|$|Another {{utility of}} {{microchannel}} {{is that because}} of laminar flow, the transportation of liquids is predictable and can be easily observed thanks to the transparent nature of microchips. Microfluidic ecosystem <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> basic parts which include inlet for fluids, a pump system to move these fluids through the microchips along with sensors to determine the pressure and flow rates at inlet and outlet of the microchips. The whole environment <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be performed very delicately and in a controlled manner.|$|R

The more reluctant of the two is persuaded with dubious reassurances ("You will feel as if you were falling off a scaffolding").

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{researchers}} had underestimated the profound difficulty of word-sense disambiguation. In order to translate a sentence, a machine <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{idea what the}} sentence was about, otherwise it made mistakes. An anecdotal example was [...] "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak." [...] Translated {{back and forth with}} Russian, it became [...] "the vodka is good but the meat is rotten." [...] Similarly, [...] "out of sight, out of mind" [...] became [...] "blind idiot". Later researchers would call this the commonsense knowledge problem.|$|R
