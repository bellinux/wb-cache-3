In the Paper is presented that one basis pulse {{in connection with a}} <b>needle</b> <b>pulse</b> an improved roughness can be achieved.

40|$|Time-domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{methods used}} {{for measuring the}} dielectric properties of materials mostly utilize step or <b>needle</b> electrical <b>pulses</b> of constant amplitudes and shapes. Our novel approach enables determining the dielectric relaxation time of a sample using {{the analysis of the}} amplitudes of reflected pulses of two widths, in addition to bulk dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity commonly obtained by the TDR technique. The method was developed for various values of electrical conductivity and relaxation time using numerical simulations of a five-rod probe placed in a material with complex dielectric permittivity described by the Debye model with an added electrical conductivity term. The characterization of amplitudes of two pulses of selected widths was done with regard to the dielectric parameters of simulated materials. The required probe parameters were obtained solely from numerical simulations. Verification was performed for the probe placed in aqueous KCl solutions with 14 different electrical conductivity values. The determined relaxation time remained roughly constant and independent of electrical conductivity. The obtained electrical conductivity agreed with the reference values. Our results indicate that the relaxation time, dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of the tested solutions can be simultaneously determined using a simple analysis of the amplitude and reflection time of two <b>needle</b> <b>pulses</b> of different widths...|$|R

40|$|Summary: There is an {{increasing}} need for accurate and rapid thermal measurement of food products. Recently, a Dual <b>Needle</b> Heat <b>Pulse</b> (DNHP) probe has been developed with capability to determine simultaneously specific heat capacity (Cp), thermal conductivity (k) and thermal diffusivity (D) of foods. Existing equipment such as the differential scanning calorimeters are expensive, and thermal conductivity probes uniquely measure thermal conductivity. The dual needle heat-pulse sensor consists of two needles spaced 6 mm apart. One needle is a line heat source {{and the other is}} a thermocouple. A short duration pulse is applied to the heater and the thermocouple’s temperature response to the heat pulse is used to simultaneously determine Cp, k and D of the sample. The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the DNHP probe for the measurement of Cp, k and D of selected foods: 'Red Delicious' apple, beef eye-round steak, egg yolk and egg white. These results were within 7 % with respect to published data. This novel DNHP probe provides a rapid, accurate and economic means for measuring not only k but also Cp and D in food, simultaneously.

40|$|The {{embedment}} of bender-extender {{elements in}} cement-based materials for {{assessment of the}} early development of mechanical properties is a relatively unexplored field. This technique provides the opportunity of embedding piezoelectric elements (emitter and receiver) into the tested material at the fresh state, generate waves and assess the velocity of propagation. It has the interesting feature of allowing distinct frequencies of wave to be explored at the several stages of stiffening of the testing material, thus maximising signal intensity and facilitating the identification of velocities. This paper presents an exploratory application of bender- extender elements to cement paste specimens, in parallel with other established experimental techniques, such as the Vicat <b>needle,</b> ultrasound <b>pulse</b> velocity measurements (with external probes), measurement of E-modulus through cyclic compressive testing and continuous assessment of the E-modulus of the cement paste through EMM-ARM.

This paper discusses partial discharge (PD) in palm oil under sinusoidal voltages and the comparison with mineral oil. PD was generated using a needle-plane electrode configuration which is enable enhancing electric field at the <b>needle</b> tip. PD <b>pulses</b> were detected using RC detector and they were measured using a Computer-based partial discharge measurement system. The results showed that PD activities in both oils are similar. The PD was initiated at the negative polarity of applied voltage. The discharges took place in both polarity’s of applied voltage with PD number was higher at negative one. Several discharges phenomena showed the presence of space charge which changed electric field and governed PD activities besides the main field introduced by voltage application...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{land use}} change near fragile {{ecosystems}} {{can affect the}} ecosystem energy balance leading to increased global warming. One component of surface energy balance is soil storage heat flux. In past work, a complex thermal behavior was noticed in the shrink-swell sediment of the upper Nueces Delta (upper Rincon) during summer months as it dried. Soil storage heat flux was found to first increase, then decrease, as the soil dried. It was suggested that the complex behavior {{was due to the}} relationship between thermal diffusivity and soil moisture, where thermal diffusivity increases to a local maximum before decreasing with respect to decreasing soil moisture. This study explores the observed phenomenon in a controlled laboratory environment by relating the sediment shrinkage curve to changing heat transfer properties. Due to the complicated nature of the drying-shrinking sediment, it was necessary to measure the sediment shrinkage curve and heat transfer properties in separate experiments. The shrinkage curve was found by correlating measured sample volume with gravimetric moisture content. Heat transfer properties were found using a single <b>needle</b> heat <b>pulse</b> probe. A normalized gravimetric moisture content was used as a common variable to relate the shrinkage curve and heat transfer data. Data suggests that the shrink-swell Rincon sediment portrays different behavior in drying than that which occurs for a non-shrink-swell soil. For the shrink-swell Rincon sediment, thermal conductivity is seen to increase with decreasing moisture, the suggested mechanism being increased surface area contact between particles as the shrinking sediment dries...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of skull bone thickness {{would be helpful}} for {{a great variety of}} surgical interventions of the head. Ultrasound (US) can offer this information intraoperatively in real time. A-mode US measurements of skull bone thickness were performed with different pulse characteristics: 1) in water and 2) by directly coupling a 2. 25 -MHz US transducer integrated in a handpiece with a soft delay line using coded excitation (CE) (Sono-Pointer). Mechanical measurements by calipers served as controls. The specimen were 16 nonselected human cadaveric skull bones preserved with formaldehyde. The average difference between the bone thickness measured by the SonoPointer and the mechanical control measurements was 0. 04 +/- 0. 62 mm. The 95 % limits of agreement between the two methods were - 1. 18 and 1. 25 mm. However, even the gold standard of two repeated caliper measurements had limits of agreement of - 0. 4 and 0. 42 mm. Using a standard US pulse in water, only 62. 5 % sample points were measurable, whereas the SonoPointer produced the thickness measurement in 97. 9 % of points. CE proved to be superior to single burst or <b>needle</b> US <b>pulses.</b> A-mode US measurements of skull bone thickness using the SonoPointer are feasible. It may provide valuable information on skull bone thickness, e. g., for osteosynthesis, calvarial split bone harvesting, implantation of hearing devices, osseointegrated titanium fixtures, and skull base surgery...|$|R

40|$|The {{patient was}} a 28 -year-old man in police cus-tody arrested for illegal {{possession}} of drugs by customs agents in a Chicago airport who con-fessed to swallowing several “bags of coke ” prior to boarding his plane in Colombia. The patient was agitated and complained of chest pain. His pupils were equal and reactive, lungs clear to ausculta-tion, and skin diaphoretic and warm to touch, with no cyanosis or <b>needle</b> tracks. His <b>pulse</b> was 140 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 28 breaths per minute; blood pressure, 220 / 130 mm Hg; and temperature, 39. 6 °C (103. 2 °F). The patient’s abdomen {{was soft and}} non-tender with normal bowel sounds. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with large 5 -mm ST segment elevation in the anterior leads, consistent with acute myocardial infarction. Otherwise, the patient was healthy and had no previous cardiac disease. The chest radiograph showed no infil-trates or pulmonary edema; a plain radiographic film of the abdominal area (kidney, ureter, and bladder) revealed multiple radio-opaque packets throughout the gastric and intestinal tract. Suspecting ingestion of a sympathomimetic drug, the physician ordered the tests in Table 1 and then gave the patient large doses of benzodi-azepines for sedation and nitroglycerin for chest pain. Because of the acute myocardial infarction, the cardiologist elected to give thrombolytics. However, because thrombolytics were adminis-tered, the general surgeon refused to perform an exploratory laparotomy and removal of the “cocaine packets ” because of the increased risk of bleeding. The patient subsequently developed generalized seizure activity, worsening hyperther-mia, rhabdomyolysis, and intracranial hemor-rhage. He died 48 hours after admission. The sympathomimetic amines and sympath-omimetic-like drugs mimic {{the actions of the}} endogenous neurotransmitters that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. Stimulation of the peripheral nervous system occurs via receptors (alpha or beta) on neurons that involve either adrenergic (epinephrine) or noradrenergic (nor-epinephrine) neurons. 1, 2 Stimulation of the cen-tral nervous system (CNS) occurs via neurons that involve dopamine and serotonin receptors. Some of the sympathomimetic drugs act directly with receptors on the neurons of the sympathetic ner-vous system to elicit a pharmacologic response...|$|R
