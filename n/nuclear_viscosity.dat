They define 'radiative equilibrium' for a star, {{taken as a whole}} and not confining attention only to its atmosphere, when the rate of transfer as heat of energy from <b>nuclear</b> reactions plus <b>viscosity</b> to the microscopic motions of the material particles of the star is just balanced by the transfer of energy by electromagnetic radiation from the star to space. This is a way of using the words 'radiative equilibrium' that is contrary to the above-mentioned usages. They note that a star that is radiating energy to space cannot be in a steady state of temperature distribution unless there is a supply of energy, in particular they have in mind a steady supply of energy from nuclear reactions within the star, to support the radiation to space. Likewise the condition that is used for the above definition of pointwise radiative equilibrium, namely, [...] at every point of the region that is in radiative equilibrium, cannot hold throughout a star that is in a steady state of temperature distribution, without an energy supply. Cox and Giuli's definition allows them to say {{at the same time that}} a star is in a steady state of temperature distribution and is in 'radiative equilibrium'; they are assuming that all the radiative energy to space comes from within the star, the very opposite assumption to the one made by the above-mentioned users of the concept 'global radiative equilibrium'.|$|R

Delivery of drug molecules to distant tumor tissue in the body is the highest challenge in any types of cancer therapies, and this goal was approached from two aspects {{in the first half of}} the study, namely using worm-like shaped drug delivery vehicle or Filomicelle and adding protein CD 47 to the vehicle surface, which can send a stop signal to macrophage phagocytosing a foreign material. Drug-loaded Filomicelles applied for brain tumor treatment in combination with radiation therapy to obtain the access inside brain tissue by disrupting blood brain barrier. CD 47 -attached particle was tested for accumulation in tumor tissue, followed by subcutaneous tumor shrinkage study. Second half of the study focuses on cell nuclear physics in the context of cell migration and tumor progression as a physiological example where cell migration plays an essential role for progression. Nuclear stiffness was controlled by changing the expression of Lamin-A,C, a protein forming mesh struture underneath inner nuclear membrane to give a physical strength the nucleus. Relative expression of Lamin-A,C to its isoform Lamin-B nicely predicts behavior of nuclear shape after stress application and importantly cell migration sensitivity against Lamin-A,C change through physically constraining environment.

Quasiparticle generation and coupling of the two-quasiparticle modes of the system are included automatically and provide contact with the Landau-Zener formula. The single-particle potential is related to nuclear shapes generated by viscous hydrodynamical calculations of a fissioning 236 U nucleus. We attempt to determine the energy dissipated between the saddle point and scission point by requiring that at the scission point the energy dissipated in the microscopic calculations equal that dissipated in the macroscopic hydrodynamical calculations. This procedure leads to 34 MeV of dissipated energy, which is almost twice the value of 18 MeV obtained from macroscopic hydrodynamical calculations that reproduce experimental fission-fragment kinetic energies. The corresponding value of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficient determined from the microscopic calculations is 0. 04 TP, compared to 0. 015 ± 0. 005 TP obtained from the macroscopic hydrodynamical calculations.
