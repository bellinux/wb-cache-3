5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the <b>nostril,</b> which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the <b>nostril</b> which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the <b>nostril</b> lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|The front toes {{are long}} with small webs at their bases {{and are not}} adapted to grasping. The opening of the <b>nostril</b> is {{longitudinal}} and set in a soft cere, and the <b>nostril</b> lack a septum. Like all New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture lacks a syrinx, and is therefore unable to make any sound other than grunts or a low hiss.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left <b>nostril</b> becoming the blowhole and the right <b>nostril</b> becoming the phonic lips.|$|E
50|$|Like other tetrapods, {{humans have}} two {{external}} <b>nostrils</b> (anterior nares) and two additional <b>nostrils</b> {{at the back}} of the nasal cavity, inside the head (posterior nares, posterior nasal apertures or choanae). Each choana contains approximately 1000 strands of nasal hair. They also connect the nose to the throat (the nasopharynx), aiding in respiration. Though all four <b>nostrils</b> were on the outside the head of our fish ancestors, the <b>nostrils</b> for outgoing water (excurrent <b>nostrils)</b> migrated to the inside of the mouth, as evidenced by the discovery of Kenichthys campbelli, a 395-million-year-old fossilized fish which shows this migration in progress. It has two <b>nostrils</b> between its front teeth, similar to human embryos at an early stage. If these fail to join up, the result is a cleft palate.|$|R
5000|$|Oxygen {{administration}} {{began with}} a metal forked device in the <b>nostrils,</b> it is now administered through thin plastic tubes in the <b>nostrils</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Early {{bony fishes}} (~420 mya) had two pair of <b>nostrils,</b> one pair for {{incoming}} water (known as the anterior or incurrent <b>nostrils),</b> {{and a second}} pair for outgoing water (the posterior or excurrent <b>nostrils),</b> with the olfactory apparatus (for sense of smell) in between. In the first tetrapodomorphs (~415 mya) the excurrent <b>nostrils</b> migrated {{to the edge of}} the mouth, occupying a position between the maxillary and premaxillary bones, directly below the lateral rostral (a bone that vanished in early tetrapods).|$|R
5|$|Sharks {{have the}} ability to {{determine}} the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each <b>nostril.</b> This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.|$|E
5|$|The front toes {{are long}} with small webs at their bases {{and are not}} adapted to grasping. The opening of the <b>nostril</b> is longitudinal, and the {{nostrils}} lack a septum. Like all New World vultures, the lesser yellow-headed vulture lacks a syrinx, and is therefore unable to make any sound other than a low hiss.|$|E
5|$|Nose {{piercing}} {{also has}} a long history. c. 1500 BCE, the Vedas refer to Lakshmi's nose piercings, but modern practice in India {{is believed to have}} spread from the Middle Eastern nomadic tribes by route of the Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It remains customary for Indian Hindu women of childbearing age to wear a nose stud, usually in the left <b>nostril,</b> due to the nostril's association with the female reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E
50|$|Kenichthys is {{important}} {{to the study of the}} evolution of tetrapods due to the nature of its <b>nostrils.</b> Most non-tetrapod vertebrates (e.g. actinopterygians) possess two sets of <b>nostrils,</b> one set at either end of the nasal cavity, and both sets of which are external. These <b>nostrils</b> play no part in respiration, instead serving an olfactory role. However, in all crown group tetrapods and many stem tetrapods one set of <b>nostrils</b> is found exteriorly, and another interiorly, in the roof of the palate. This arrangement means that the nasal passage leads from the outside of the body into the mouth. The ‘inner set’ of <b>nostrils</b> are known as choanae, and allow tetrapods to breathe through their nose.|$|R
50|$|The upwards wiping of {{the nose}} and <b>nostrils</b> allows for running mucus to be wiped off quickly and easily. Also, as the <b>nostrils</b> are being pushed up the air {{passages}} through the nose become temporarily propped open. This is especially beneficial if the air passages are swollen and the <b>nostrils</b> are itchy due to irritations such as allergic rhinitis.|$|R
5000|$|According to Mukti Bodhananda finds, {{the second}} part {{introduces}} types of swaras arising out of Nadis, here three kind of swaras {{are said to be}} present. and each results of swaras are also noted here. [...] Swarodaya Yoga’ has three types of breathing systems - Ida (Inhaling & exhaling from our left side of the <b>nostrils),</b> Pingla (inhaling & exhaling from our right side of the <b>nostrils)</b> and Sushmana (inhabling & exhaling {{from both sides of the}} <b>nostrils).</b> We mostly breathe in & out from either Ida or Pingla but sometimes we breathe from both the <b>nostrils</b> Nadis.|$|R
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each <b>nostril</b> is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the <b>nostril</b> and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{suggests}} {{breathing exercises}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as breathing with one <b>nostril</b> and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis (blood vessels), improves digestive powers, stamina, leanness and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (clarified butter), cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{detecting}} facial components in thermal imagery (specifically eyes, <b>nostrils</b> and mouth). One of the immediate goals is to enable the automatic registration of facial thermal images. The detection of eyes and <b>nostrils</b> is performed using Haar features and the GentleBoost algorithm, which are shown to provide superior detection rates. The detection of the mouth {{is based on the}} detections of the eyes and the <b>nostrils</b> and is performed using measures of entropy and self similarity. The results show that reliable facial component detection is feasible using this methodology, getting a correct detection rate for both eyes and <b>nostrils</b> of 0. 8. A correct eyes and <b>nostrils</b> detection enables a correct detection of the mouth in 65 % of closed-mouth test images and in 73 % of open-mouth test images. 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{horse with}} small <b>nostrils</b> or small nares {{can be found}} in any breed and often accompanies a narrow jaw and muzzle. Small <b>nostrils</b> limit the horse's ability to breathe hard while exerting itself. This {{especially}} affects horses in high-speed activities (polo, racing, eventing, steeplechase) or those that need to sustain effort over long duration (endurance, competitive trial, combined driving). Horses with small <b>nostrils</b> are therefore best used for pleasure riding or non-speed sports.|$|R

5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open <b>nostril</b> and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} <b>nostril,</b> defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or two teeth at the symphysis (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark is a slender-bodied {{species with}} a fairly long, pointed snout. The leading margin of each <b>nostril</b> is {{enlarged}} into a narrow, pointed lobe. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes, and behind them {{are a series of}} prominent pores. The mouth bears short furrows at the corners and contains 13–15 tooth rows on either side of both jaws (usually 14 upper and 13 lower). The upper teeth are tall and triangular with strong serrations, becoming increasing oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are comparatively narrower and more upright, with finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the <b>nostrils.</b> This contradicts other accounts that mention that the <b>nostrils</b> were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape of the head and <b>nostrils</b> as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|R
5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and <b>nostril,</b> was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is fairly}} narrow-bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head lack distinct lobes. The eyes are oval and widely spaced; closely behind are crescent-shaped spiracles with large, boxy projections inside their anterior rims. Each <b>nostril</b> is large and preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels; the outer barbel is thin, while the inner barbel has a spoon-like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base. The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners. There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws, separated by a gap in the middle; the teeth are small, narrow, and pointed. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each <b>nostril</b> is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The snout of Ankylosaurus was arched and {{truncated}} at the front, and the <b>nostrils</b> were elliptical, {{and they}} were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the <b>nostrils</b> were not visible from the front, because the sinuses were expanded {{to the sides of}} the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae, strap-like, side osteoderms of the snout, completely roofed the enlarged opening of the <b>nostrils.</b> The <b>nostrils</b> also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities or chambers of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the snout into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the choanae (internal <b>nostrils).</b>|$|R
5|$|If other {{interventions}} have failed, several {{operations have}} been reported to provide benefit. One is septal dermoplasty or Saunders' procedure, in which skin is transplanted into the <b>nostrils,</b> and the other is Young's procedure, in which the <b>nostrils</b> are sealed off completely.|$|R
6000|$|The {{respiration}} {{is likewise}} affected; the chest heaves, and the dilated <b>nostrils</b> quiver.[5] As Tennyson writes, [...] "sharp breaths of anger puffed her fairy <b>nostrils</b> out." [...] Hence {{we have such}} expressions as breathing out vengeance," [...] and [...] "fuming with anger."[6] ...|$|R
5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The <b>nostril</b> is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E
5|$|The crestless {{skull of}} Eolambia {{has a similar}} overall shape to those of Equijubus and Probactrosaurus. The front of the snout is highly roughened, being punctuated by many foramina. At the tip of each premaxilla, there are two tooth-like {{structures}} known as denticles, which is also seen in its closest relative Protohadros. Further back, the rear portion of the lower branch of the premaxilla abruptly projects upwards, closing off the <b>nostril</b> at the rear as in Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. This part joins with the two finger-like processes of the maxilla, {{which is similar to}} Protohadros. The body of the maxilla itself does not bear a recess or any indication of an antorbital fenestra, like Equijubus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. One of the characteristics used to distinguish Eolambia is the concave profile of the tooth row of the maxilla when viewed from the side, which is like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Protohadros.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not protruding from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each <b>nostril</b> may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E
50|$|One {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Macrauchenia is that, unlike most other mammals, the openings for <b>nostrils</b> on its skull were atop the head, leading some early scientists to believe that, {{much like a}} whale, it used these <b>nostrils</b> {{as a form of}} snorkel. Soon after some more recent findings, this theory was rejected. An alternative theory is that the ungulate possessed a trunk, perhaps to keep dust out of the <b>nostrils.</b> Macrauchenias trunk may be comparable to that of the modern Saiga antelope.|$|R
5000|$|The nasalis is a sphincter-like muscle of {{the nose}} whose {{function}} is to compress the nasal cartilages. It is the muscle responsible for [...] "flaring" [...] of the <b>nostrils.</b> Some people {{can use it to}} close the <b>nostrils</b> to prevent entry of water when underwater.|$|R
