40|$|Queueing {{models have}} been used {{extensively}} {{in the design of}} call centres. In particular, a queueing model will be used to describe a help desk which is a form of a call centre. The design of the queueing model involves modelling the arrival an service processes of the system. Conventionally, the arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and <b>service</b> <b>times</b> are assumed to be exponentially distributed. But it has been proposed that practically these are seldom the case. Past research reveals that the log-normal distribution can be used to model the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> in call centres. Also, services may involve stages/tasks before completion. This motivates the use of a phase-type distribution to model the underlying stages of service. This research work focuses on developing statistical models for the overall <b>service</b> <b>times</b> and the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> by job types in a particular help desk. The assumption of exponential <b>service</b> <b>times</b> was investigated and a log-normal distribution was fitted to <b>service</b> <b>times</b> of this help desk. Each stage of the service in this help desk was modelled as a phase in the phase-type distribution. Results from the analysis carried out in this work confirmed the irrelevance of the assumption of exponential <b>service</b> <b>times</b> to this help desk and it was apparent that log-normal distributions provided a reasonable fit to the <b>service</b> <b>times.</b> A phase-type distribution with three phases fitted the overall <b>service</b> <b>times</b> and the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> of administrative and miscellaneous jobs very well. For the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> of e-mail and network jobs, a phase-type distribution with two phases served as a good model.

In previous work of the authors, a distributed MAC scheme has been proposed to achieve guaranteed priority and enhanced fairness performance. For a wireless network, the <b>service</b> <b>time</b> distribution at the MAC sub-layer is important for performance analysis (e. g., in terms of packet delay, packet dropping rate, and admission region) at the network layer, because the network layer performance is largely dependent on the high-order time-domain statistics of the service provided by the MAC sub-layer. This paper presents a <b>service</b> <b>time</b> distribution analysis of the previously proposed distributed MAC scheme.
