This plot the king knows--I had it from one of his women, who is my sister--and he is very wroth, yet he dare do little, for he grows old and timid, and seeks rest, not war. Yet he is minded, if he can find the heart, to go back upon the law and to name Nodwengo as his heir before all the army at the feast of the first-fruits, which shall be held on the third day from to-night. This Hafela knows, and Nodwengo knows it also, and each of them has summoned his following, numbering thousands {{and tens of thousands of}} spears, to attend this feast of the first-fruits. That feast may well be a feast of vultures, my father, and when the brothers and their regiments rush together fighting for the throne, what will chance to the white man who comes at such a moment to preach a faith of peace, and to his servant, one John, who led him there?" ...|$|E

The problem on which research is beginning to focus <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> theoretical possibility of having constructive content present in classical proofs, established in old and well known results, but the practical applicability of such results.

40|$|Although density anomaly {{of liquid}} water {{has long been}} studied by many {{different}} authors up to <b>now,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> still cleared what thermodynamic mechanism induces the anomaly. The thermodynamic properties of substances are determined by interparticle interactions. We analyze what characteristics of pair potential cause the density anomaly {{on the basis of}} statistical mechanics and thermodynamics using a thermodynamically self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation (SCOZA). We consider a fluid of spherical particles with a pair potential given by a hard-core repulsion plus a soft-repulsion and an attraction. We show that the density anomaly occurs when the value of the soft-repulsive potential at hard-core contact is in some proper range, and the range depends on the attraction. Further, we show that the behavior of the excess internal energy plays an essential role in the density anomaly and the behavior is mainly determined by the values of the soft-repulsive potential, especially near the hard core contact. Our results show that most of ideas put forward up to <b>now</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> direct causes of the density anomaly of liquid water...|$|R

40|$|Participation {{is viewed}} as an {{important}} means for promoting the sustainable management of natural resources. However, participation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always successful. Conflicting values and power inequalities are all factors that can severely undermine participatory processes. Where so far {{the main focus of}} research has been on power imbalances and conflicting interests, this article focuses on another source of conflict, i. e. differing views of reality and underlying cultural biases. Research states that cultural theory (CT), which subdivides the divergent notions of reality into four worldviews (hierarchism, individualism, egalitarianism, fatalism), could be a useful tool to gain insight in conflicting views of reality and the consequences of these conflicting views for participatory processes. To investigate the value of CT for participation, a study in Java (Indonesia) was carried out to determine to what extent worldviews can be used to predict preferred strategies in forestry problems. The results show that an empirical identification of worldviews was possible. These worldviews however do not automatically explain how individuals address forestry problems. This might be because of the difficulty of measuring worldviews in relation to individuals' strategies. It might also be that CT's explanatory capacity is overestimated. In either case, we can conclude that CT the way it <b>is</b> used <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> instrument that will help us solving the problems in participatory processes...|$|R
