5|$|An event from April 1 to May 5, 2010 allowed {{players of}} Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a route on the Pokéwalker which solely {{contained}} Pikachu which knew attacks {{that they were}} <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> compatible with, Surf and Fly. Both of these attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} does <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> {{occur in}} humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis {{of the liver}} in persons who have inherited two defective genes.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, populations {{can expand}} rapidly {{after a series}} of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an {{increase}} of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> breed.|$|E
5|$|Gemological {{laboratories}} {{make use}} of spectrophotometer machines that can distinguish natural, artificial, and color-enhanced diamonds. The spectrophotometers analyze the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled with liquid nitrogen to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> discernible.|$|E
5|$|IIH does <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> affect life expectancy. The major {{complications}} from IIH arise from untreated or treatment-resistant papilledema. In various case series, the long-term risk of ones vision being significantly affected by IIH {{is reported to}} lie anywhere between 10 and 25%.|$|E

5|$|In the 1570s, {{a survey}} {{recommended}} that four brass artillery guns be kept at the castle. The range of artillery guns soon increased, however, making it unnecessary to have armed forts {{on both sides}} of the river and, by the end of the 16th century, the castle's military utility had lessened and it was <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> manned.|$|E
5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> {{considered}} part of the Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> noticeable from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, {{carrying the}} observer through {{the cycles of}} sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion {{against the background of}} fixed stars.|$|E

5|$|Zino's petrel, {{like its}} relatives, feeds on small squid and fish. The vomited stomach {{contents}} of one bird contained cephalopods, the bioluminiscent fish Electrona risso and small crustaceans. Like other small petrels, Zino's does <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> follow ships.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> {{behave as}} acids in water, but the {{presence}} of a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|Although Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are {{father and}} daughter, Violeta {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space. Although they played characters of similar ages, they rarely have joint scenes. Julieta Ortega said that she has nothing in common with her character in the series. Juan Gil Navarro, who appeared in the television drama La Dueña at the same time, said that although he does <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> appear in comedies he followed his wife's suggestion.|$|E

5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Bikinis {{have become}} a major {{component}} of marketing various women's sports. It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports. Sports bikinis have gained popularity since the 1990s. However, the trend has raised some criticism as an attempt to sell sex. Female swimmers do <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> wear bikinis in competitive swimming. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to prohibit female swimmers from racing in bikinis in its meeting at Rome in 1960.|$|E

50|$|Rhagoletis pomonella is {{significant}} evolutionarily {{in that the}} race of this species that feeds on apples spontaneously emerged from the hawthorn feeding race in the 1800 - 1850 AD time frame after apples were introduced into North America. The apple feeding race does <b>not</b> now <b>normally</b> feed on hawthorns and the hawthorn feeding race does <b>not</b> now <b>normally</b> feed on apples. This constitutes a possible example of an early step towards {{the emergence of a}} new species, a case of sympatric speciation.|$|R

Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved the lives of women and children. Women of her own social class did <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> work after they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is <b>not</b> <b>normally</b> transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
