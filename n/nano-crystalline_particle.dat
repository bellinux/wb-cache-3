40|$|Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs) {{have a variety}} of excellent properties compared with the majority of conventional crystalline alloys. However, they exhibit limited global plasticity at room temperature because of shear banding. Several methods have been proposed to improve the limited ductility of BMG; one method is the homogeneous distribution of crystalline particles. However, our understanding of the interaction between the crystalline particles and shear bands (SB) is not sufficient. Here, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of mode II deformation of a notched BMG plate and BMG plates containing one <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>particle</b> ahead of the notch bottom. To compare the effect of crystalline particle size on the resistance to SB propagation, we used the J-integral. By comparing J–R curves and the deformation behavior of the BMG plates with and without nano-crystalline particles, we found that the resistance to shear banding is efficiently improved by introducing crystalline particles with sufficient size, compared to the SB width...|$|E

30|$|The {{enhanced}} biological {{behavior of}} osteoblasts on ZrO 2 films {{may be due}} to the surface properties of the amorphous ZrO 2 films. The surface charge of the ZrO 2 is generally regarded to be negative [22, 45]. Filtered cathodic arc deposition is a very efficient method for producing nanostructured films and the AFM result indicated that the TiO 2 and ZrO 2 films deposited by filtered cathodic arc deposition have a nanostructured surface. Previous research has found finer <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>particles</b> have higher surface charge densities than larger ones [46]. Thus, the nanostructured surface of the amorphous ZrO 2 film may have higher negative surface charge. Proteins that have a number of positively/negatively charged residues are expected to show a high affinity for the negatively/positively charged surface of a material. Han et al. [47] found that negatively charged TiO 2 coating has beneficial effect on cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Zhang et al. [48] also found that negatively charged phosphate groups developed on zirconia surface by hydrothermal treatment in phosphoric solutions could enhance marrow cell response. Therefore, in this work, the nanostructured surface of the amorphous ZrO 2 film may be the key factor to promote the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts.|$|R

The characterizations using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N 2 ad-desorption, and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) showed that the TiO 2 -xNx is typical mesopores anatase nanocrystalline. The nitrogen dopant causes the absorption edge of TiO 2 shift to a lower energy region that enhances its visible light absorption. Under visible light irradiation, the TiO 2 -xNx exhibits higher activity than commercial P 25 but similar activity in decoloration of methylene blue under UV irradiation. There have been great interests in porous titania for its potential application in photocatalysis, sensor, and photovoltaics.

The combination of the template-free solvothermal synthesis of TiO 2 -ST and post-ammonolysized TiO 2 -xNx-ST is an effective method for preparing mesoporous N-doped TiO 2.

The X-ray diffraction {{results showed that}} the best garnet phase appeared when the sintering temperature was 800 °C. <b>Nano-crystalline</b> <b>particles</b> with high purity and sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm were obtained. It was found that the aluminum substitution had resulted in a sharp fall of the d-spacing when x = 2, which we speculated is due to the preference of the aluminum atoms to the smaller tetrahedron and octahedron sites instead of the much larger dodecahedron site. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) patterns showed single crystal nanoparticles were obtained from this method. The magnetic measurement gave moderate values of initial permeability; the highest value of 5. 3 was shown by sample Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 at more than 100 MHz which was attributed to the morphology of the microstructure which appeared to be homogeneous. This had resulted in an easy movement of domain walls. The substitution of aluminum for yttrium is speculated to cause a cubic to rhombodedral structural change and had weakened the super-exchange interactions thus a fall of real permeability was observed.

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of typical samples revealed that the shapes and the sizes of the particles were not much affected after Eu doping in the studied range though Eu doping resulted in agglomerations of nanoparticles.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of metallic glasses are quite distinct from their crystalline counterparts, {{which makes them}} attractive for several applications. Since metallic glasses exhibit high strength, hardness, and large elastic strain limits, {{they are expected to}} show superior wear resistance. The low viscosity in the super-cooled liquid region is exploited for the fabrication of metallic glasses in various shapes, for example, as high precision gears. Enhancements in the wear {{properties of}} metallic glasses are considered in this dissertation by partial devitrification and suitable micro alloying. Partial devitrification following controlled heat treatment of bulk metallic glass (BMG) provides an opportunity for microstructure control and thereby for optimizing the wear properties. There are studies showing that a small suitable alloying addition of few at. % (micro alloying) to the BMG results in an increase of the glass forming ability and also the mechanical properties, but studies on the effect of minor-alloying on wear characteristics are scarce. The focus of this dissertation is directed towards designing an optimal microstructure for enhanced wear resistance of Cu 50 Hf 41. 5 Al 8. 5 BMG and Fe 48 Cr 15 Mo 14 C 15 B 6 Er 2 BMG. The effect of yttrium micro alloying in the Cu-based BMG (Cu 50 Hf 41. 5 −xAl 8. 5 Y x, x = 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 15 at. %) and the erbium micro alloying in the Fe-based BMG (Fe 50 –xCr 15 Mo 14 C 15 B 6 Erx, x = 1, 2 at. %) on wear properties has been studied. The role of toughness and hardness on the sliding wear properties of these metallic glasses has been examined. A critical load for crack nucleation and propagation has been computed and compared with the applied load during wear. An emphasis is also placed on the occurrence of dynamic effects such as sliding-induced crystallization and their role on the wear behavior of these metallic glasses. ^ In summary, for Cu 50 Hf 41. 5 Al 8. 5 BMG, annealing at 510 °C for 300 min rendered a structure consisting of an amorphous matrix with uniform distribution of <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>particles</b> with a size of 20 - 30 nm, revealed the best wear resistance. Sliding-induced crystallization was observed in the as-cast and structurally relaxed Cu 50 Hf 41. 5 Al 8. 5 BMG, which resulted in an improvement of wear behavior. Up to 5 at. %° of Y additions in Cu 50 Hf 41. 5 –xAl 8. 5 Yx resulted in improvement of wear resistance and further additions of Y, deteriorated it. In the Fe-based BMG, addition of Er up to 2 at. % resulted in the enhancement of wear resistance and the Fe 48 Cr 15 Mo 14 C 15 B 6 Er 2 BMG sample, annealed for 10 min at 580 °C exhibited the best wear resistance. There was no evidence of sliding wear induced crystallization but a shear band formation was observed for the Fe-based BMG, indicating a good thermal stability of the alloy. The results demonstrate that suitable micro-alloying is an useful approach for improving the wear resistance of bulk metallic glasses and that the combination of micro-alloying and annealing can substantially improve the wear resistance. ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the long}} list of {{solid-state}} hydrogen storage materials, magnesium hydride stands out for its relatively high hydrogen storage capacity of 7. 7 wt%, combined with the low cost and abundance of magnesium. For practical applications however, issues such as the slow kinetics and the high stability of magnesium hydride must be resolved {{in order to reduce the}} potential operating temperatures of a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage system. Catalysis has been widely used to improve the hydrogen storage kinetics and thin film techniques have been used to explore novel structures and combinations of materials in order to improve both the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogen storage in magnesium. The original contribution to knowledge of this work lies in the study and understanding of the evolution of a range of novel thin film multilayer coatings and the effect of the structure, structural evolution and materials on the hydrogen storage properties of these materials, each consisting of 150 layers of magnesium, < 20 nm thick, separated by < 3 nm thick layers of a nickel-rich, iron-based transition metal mix, chromium and vanadium. The samples, as well as a non-catalysed control sample, were produced by means of magnetron-assisted physical vapour deposition and delaminated from the substrate for volumetric, gravimetric and calorimetric hydrogen cycling measurements. The coatings were analysed both before and after hydrogen cycling to understand the structural evolution of the coatings from highly structured thin film multilayers to flaky thin film particles containing finely distributed <b>nano-crystalline</b> catalyst <b>particles.</b> The formation of the intermetallic Mg 2 Ni in one of the samples was found to be beneficial for the hydrogenation kinetics, whilst the dehydrogenation kinetics were found to be affected mostly by the nano-crystalline transition metal phases that formed in the catalysed samples during hydrogen cycling. This resulted in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of magnesium hydride in less than 4 and 13 minutes at 250 °C with activation energies as low as 60. 6 ± 2. 5 kJ mol- 1.

40|$|An ideal {{engineered}} scaffold {{should support}} the regeneration of natural extracellular matrix; for bone this is principally Type I collagen and hydroxyapatite. The present work investigated the fabrication and characterisation of scaffolds comprised of (a) PCL or (b) Type I collagen +/- PDLLA produced via electrospinning and studied {{their influence on}} osteogenic regeneration. A parallel study examined the cellular response of human bone marrow stromal cells to <b>nano-crystalline</b> hydroxyapatite <b>particles</b> in a foamed PDLLA scaffold. Both the influence of particle size and chemical substitution were considered. Characterisation of materials involved scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, atomic force microscopy and histology. Electrospun PCL nanofibrous scaffolds potentially supported osteogenic regeneration. However, the scaffolds had to be treated post- spinning with NaOH and fetal calf serum {{to make them more}} hydrophilic to support cell attachment. With a view to producing a biomimetic material and knowing that hydrophobicity is not an issue for Type I collagen, rat-tail derived Type I collagen was selected for further studies. A number of solvents were explored to successfully electrospin the collagen. Although the wet stability of resultant scaffolds was poor, crosslinking improved scaffold stability, particularly the use of glutaraldehyde vapour. The observed denaturation. of collagen was determined to be a consequence of conformational changes rather than scission of collagen polypeptides, indicating that the electrospun collagen was not a simple analogous to gelatin. An alternative approach to stabilisation involved electrospinning collagen with a co-polymer, PDLLA, which successfully stabilised the fibrous scaffolds in the ratio ranges of 40 - 60 wt% PDDLA: 60 - 40 wt% collagen. Future work will combine these materials with the optimised apatite filler to produce a composite material since the parallel study on cell culture of minerallPDLLA composites suggested that incorporation of mineral components did indeed enhance the alkaline phosphatase activity of human bone marrow stromal cells. Strontium substituted hydroxyapatite introduced potential benefits on alkaline phosphatase activity of bone derived cells in basal media.
