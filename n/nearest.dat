5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer <b>nearest</b> neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three <b>nearest</b> neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two <b>nearest</b> neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one <b>nearest</b> neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of <b>nearest</b> neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the new concept of {{relative}} <b>near</b> PS-compactness in L-fuzzy topological spaces is introduced. The relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is described with a-net, r-ps-cover, r-finite intersection property. The relationship between relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness and <b>near</b> PS-compactness is in vestigated. It is found that <b>near</b> PS-compactness implies relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness and every LF-set of <b>near</b> PS-compact space is relative <b>near</b> PS-compact. The relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness possess the following properties:the union of two arbirtrary relative <b>near</b> PS-compact sets is relative <b>near</b> PS-compact;the intersection {{of a family}} relative <b>near</b> PS-compact sets is also relative <b>near</b> PS-compact. Finally, it is proved that the relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is invariant under the PS-continuous maps. This relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is defined for arbitrary L-fuzzy subsets, and it preserves many good properties of compactness in general topological spaces...|$|R

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} <b>nearest</b> neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of <b>nearest</b> neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of <b>nearest</b> neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero <b>nearest</b> neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of <b>nearest</b> neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E
