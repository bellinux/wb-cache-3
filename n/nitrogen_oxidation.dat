40|$|L-arginine is {{required}} for the fungistatic action of murine macrophages in vitro. To further investigate this requirement, L-arginine metabolism by macrophages was measured under conditions where fungistasis either succeeded or failed. Macrophage fungistasis correlated with metabolism of L-arginine to citrulline, nitrite, and nitrate. The metabolic rate was dependent on extracellular L-arginine concentration, reaching a maximum of 67 nmol nitrite/h per mg protein. It accounted for one-third of arginine consumed by fungistatic macrophages. Equimolar amounts of citrulline and total nitrite plus nitrate accumulated in medium. This was consistent with the hypothesis that one of the equivalent guanidino nitrogens of L-arginine was oxidized to both nitrite and nitrate leaving L-citrulline as the amino acid reaction product. The analogue, NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine, selectively inhibited <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> and it was shown previously that it inhibited fungistatic capability. Resident macrophages were not fungistatic and their <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> was low. Once macrophages began producing nitrite/nitrate, protein synthesis was not required during the next 8 h for either fungistasis or <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Two-thirds of L-arginine consumption was due to macrophage arginase yielding L-ornithine and urea, which accumulated in medium. This activity was dissociated from macrophage fungistasis. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> metabolism by macrophages is linked to a mechanism that inhibits proliferation of fungi. This may involve synthesis of an intermediate compound(s) that has antimicrobial properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this report were aimed at determining whether L-arginine (L-arg) -derived <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> products (nitric oxide, nitrous acid, nitrites) {{are involved in the}} intracellular killing of Leishmania parasites by activated murine macrophages in vitro. Peritoneal or bone marrow-derived macrophages were infected with 1 _. enriettii or L major, then activated by exposure to recombinant murine interferongamma or to macrophage activating factor (MAF) -rich media in the presence of Iipopolysaccharide. Activation of macrophages in regular (i. e., arginine-containing) culture medium led to complete destruction of the microorganisms within 24 h (L. enriettii) or 48 h (L. major), concomitant with accumulation of nitrites (N 02) in the culture fluids. When macrophage activation was carried out in L-arg-free medium, however, neither parasite killing nor N 02 production was obtained. A similar inhibition of macrophage leishmanicidal activity and of N 02 release was observed using media treated with arginase (which converts L-arg to urea and ornithine), or supplemented with NG-monomethyl-L-arg or guanidine (which inhibit the conversion of L-arg to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> products).

3000|$|The {{study of}} dynamic {{processes}} in stable soluble forms of nitrogen by laboratory simulations demonstrates diminishing braking effect of nitrification {{processes in the}} Nistru River caused, perhaps, by decreasing toxicity {{in the presence of}} anionic SAS-Ct (Fig.  2). The cause of this effect may be explained by the fact of the complex [anionic SAS (SAS-An) * cationic SAS (SAS-Ct)] formation. On the contrary, the toxicity of cationic surfactants amplifies with increasing water hardness (Lechuga et al. 2016; Thomas et al. 2009). The phenomenon of the nitrification braking in the presence of CaCO 3 is characteristic for the water in sections downstream of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of cities. In the presence of mixtures of cationic and anionic surfactants, the preferential binding of anionic surfactants to calcium carbonate particles has been found (Cui et al. 2010; Cui et al. 2012). Consequently, it can be assumed that the decomposition of the complex of anionic and cationic surfactants contributes to the braking of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Soluble surface-active cationic substances, which have bactericidal effect, remain. Enzyme concentration, which accelerates <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation,</b> decreases. Thus, the CaCO 3 influence can be understood.

40|$|Mouse macrophages {{activated}} by interferon-gamma kill intracellular Leishmania {{by a process}} {{that depends on the}} generation of L-arginine-derived <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> products. Interferon-induced intracellular killing can be mimicked by exposure of macrophages to the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. The mechanisms of this effect were therefore investigated. Destruction of the parasite was accompanied by accumulation of nitrite in the macrophage culture fluids. Leishmanicidal activity and nitrite production in cultures stimulated with ionophore A 23187 and lipopolysaccharide were abrogated when cells were activated in medium containing arginase or the L-arginine analogues L-canavanine, guanidine or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. L-Arginine was required during the lipopolysaccharide-induced triggering phase only. Indeed, macrophage priming with ionophore A 23187 in L-arginine-depleted medium led to full microbicidal activity and nitrite generation provided that L-arginine was present during subsequent triggering by lipopolysaccharide. Addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine to ionophore-activated macrophages increased O 2 - production on phorbol myristate stimulation, while inhibiting glucose oxidation through the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway. Leishmanicidal activity and nitrite production were also inhibited when ionophore-treated cultures were incubated with excess iron, implying a role for iron as a defence mechanism against the toxicity of nitrogen derivatives. These results indicate that the ionophore-induced leishmanicidal activity occurs through a process similar to that evoked by interferon-gamma, i. e. the production of L-arginine-derived <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> products...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of heat treatment (HT) on CoTAA supported on SX Ultra samples {{before and after}} electrochemical tests has been investigated using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique and cyclic voltammetry, The heat treated sample configuration was also scrutinized by two different surface spectroscopic techniques: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). After a 100 h polarization period at 500 mV (RHE) (diffusion activation domain), optimal performances were found to occur with the 600 degrees C heat treated samples (HT 600). However, the most salient feature was the observation of a fair activity and stability for the 800 degrees C heat treated samples (HT 800). Similar behavior was exhibited both with H 2 SO 4 and Nafion(R) electrolytes. Collected data could be interpreted {{on the basis of}} RDE and cyclic voltammetry theories, suggesting a fast dioxygen mass transfer within the catalytic material in comparison with interfacial process kinetics. After these electrochemical tests a complete demetallation was taking place, as seen by XPS within the HT 800 samples. A protonation process was also clearly identified on the nitrogen ions. An attempt has been made to propose a catalytic cycle in which variations of the different <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidation</b> states are occuring.
