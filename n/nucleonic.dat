Due to its simplicity, BeH is expected to be present in astronomical contexts such as exoplanetary atmospheres, cool stars, and the interstellar medium, but so far has only been found on our Sun.

50|$|On December 17, 1987 an {{incident}} (INES 1) occurred: Coworkers overlooked a stop valve {{that had not}} been closed. In order to close the armature a valve was opened. The Radioactive primary cooling agent discharged for a short time into the annular space. Because the discharge of the reactor cooling water took place outside of the reactor containment, there was no feedback from the sump over the safety feeding pumps and/or cooling pumps. The incident became public one year later, when an article in an American technical periodical (<b>Nucleonic</b> Weeks) was published. There have been other incidents afterwards, none of which has been rated over 1 on INES scale.|$|E

50|$|He {{has made}} {{significant}} contribution to the discovery of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) in the laboratory. This state of matter existed in the first few microsecond old Universe. In such matter, quarks and gluons are de-confined and move freely in volumes much larger than <b>nucleonic</b> scales. In order to achieve such matter in the laboratory, temperatures of the order of 1012 degrees Kelvin need to be created. The quark-gluon plasma allows for studying transport properties like viscosity, thermal conductivity, opacity and diffusion co-efficient of QCD matter. Dr. Mohanty has several significant papers on signatures that experimentally confirm the existence of QGP, related to observation of strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching effect, and partonic collectivity.|$|E
5000|$|According to The Original Series (TOS) writers' guide, the {{effective}} {{range of a}} transporter is 40,000 kilometers, although thick layers of rock can reduce this range (TNG: [...] "Legacy").

Transporter operations have been disrupted or prevented by dense metals (TNG: [...] "Contagion"), solar flares (TNG: [...] "Symbiosis"), and other forms of radiation, including electromagnetic (TNG: [...] "The Enemy"; TNG: [...] "Power Play") and <b>nucleonic</b> (TNG: [...] "Schisms"), and affected by ion storms (TOS: [...] "Mirror, Mirror").

40|$|The {{isothermal}} compression of a dilute <b>nucleonic</b> gas invoking cluster {{degrees of freedom}} is studied in an equilibrium statistical model; this clusterized system {{is found to be}} more stable than the pure <b>nucleonic</b> system. The equation of state (EoS) of this matter shows features qualitatively very similar to the one obtained from pure <b>nucleonic</b> gas. In the {{isothermal compression}} process, there is a sudden enhancement of clusterization at a transition density rendering features analogous to the gas-liquid phase transition in normal dilute <b>nucleonic</b> matter. Different observables like the caloric curves, heat capacity, isospin distillation, etc. are studied in both the models.

We show that the diffractive contribution is important for the adequate description of the <b>nucleonic</b> and hadronic fluxes in the atmosphere. 1 It is well known that the evolution of the <b>nucleonic</b> cosmic ray component is controlled by two physical quantities related to high energy hadron interactions: the interaction mean-free-path λ p−air in, which is inversely proportional to the inelastic proton-air cross section, σ p−air in, and the average elasticity 〈x 〉 p−air, the fraction of energy retained by the incident particle after a collision. It was shown in Refs.

40|$|The {{relativistic}} neutrino emissivity of the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA {{processes in}} neutron star matter are investigated within the relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation. We study particularly {{the influences of}} the tensor couplings of vector mesons ω and ρ on the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA processes. It is found that {{the inclusion of the}} tensor couplings of vector mesons ω and ρ can slightly increase the maximum mass of neutron stars. In addition, the results indicate that the tensor couplings of vector mesons ω and ρ lead to obvious enhancement of the total neutrino emissivity for the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA processes, which must accelerate the cooling rate of the non-superfluid neutron star matter. However, when considering only the tensor coupling of vector meson ρ, the neutrino emissivity for the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA processes slightly declines at low densities and significantly increases at high densities. That is to say that the tensor coupling of vector meson ρ leads to the slow cooling rate of a low-mass neutron star and rapid cooling rate of a massive neutron star...|$|E
