40|$|In 1989 the EC {{announced}} its so called "New Mediterranean Policy". Thls article seeks {{to identify the}} main challenges which the European Community and the non-Member states of the Mediterranean region face and whether the policy as announced is capable of achieving meaningful results. The Mediterranean is perhaps ranked second in the league of importance for the European Community, after Central and Eastern Europe. However, the dangers that still lurk in the mare nostrum could still have sizeable negative effects on the Community. While attention has been riveted on Central and Eastern Europe the Mediterranean cannot be ignored. This paper will argue that all the initiatives taken in the Mediterranean by the Community from the launching of the so called global approach in around 1972, have regularly been overtaken by events and that the same {{has happened in the}} case of the so called <b>New</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Policy.</b> N/...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) {{has brought}} the Mediterranean region back to the {{political}} agenda. This volume provides, for the first time, a comprehensive overview and comparative analysis of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> of governmental and non-governmental actors, from above and below. It includes case studies on the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies</b> of numerous southern and eastern Mediterranean States, various EU Member States, and the EU itself. The case studies explain how and why these States, all participating in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, now UfM, are according a particular importance to the Mediterranean region within their foreign policies. The case studies on civil society groups or social movements such as informal or formal human rights networks, women’s networks, migrant networks, or entrepreneurs provide a broad overview of the multifaceted and dynamic civil society landscape in the Euro-Mediterranean region. Bringing together well-known scholars and experts from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, the book explores the questions of why and how the forms, the intensity, and the efficiency of interactions and articulations between the above and the below are developing within <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} analysis of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), launched in 2008 amid great controversy within the European Union. Affected from the start by negative fallout from the failure of Middle East peace initiatives, its inadequacies have been underlined by the popular movement for regime change in the Arab world. Leading experts provide here the first integrated analysis of the significance and shortcomings of the UfM. Beginning with critical questioning of the motives and institutional logics informing this venture, the collection proceeds to analyse its key actors, as well as major policy dossiers such as energy and development. The book explains how and why an initiative aiming to depoliticize Euro-Mediterranean relations in fact proved wide open to political discord, bringing huge disruption to UfM activity. While some aspects are found to have merit, the volume is critical {{of the way in}} which EU <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policy</b> became driven by a narrow range of national interests, lost sight of the political objectives of the preceding Barcelona Process and became overwhelmingly bilateral in approach, at the expense of more ambitious region-building efforts. It concludes by highlighting the need to reform the EU <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policy</b> framework in the light of the Arab uprisings of 2011.

25|$|Her {{principal}} achievement {{as ambassador}} {{was to play}} a vital role in negotiating a peaceful solution to the Trieste Crisis of 1953–1954, a border dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia that she saw as potentially escalating into a war between East and West. Her sympathies throughout were with the Christian Democratic government of Giuseppe Pella, and she was influential on the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policy</b> of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, another anticommunist. Although Luce regarded the abatement of the acute phase of the crisis in December 1953 as a triumph for herself, the main work of settlement, finalized in October 1954, was undertaken by professional representatives of the five concerned powers (Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Yugoslavia) meeting in London.|$|R

Allusions to the past were often avoided, with preference to looking towards the future as a stimulus for regional cooperation. Nevertheless, Spanish foreign policy converged with the French and Italian outlook in grounding the European Union Mediterranean agenda on a shared historical discourse. However, the development of such discourse would not match the ultimate goal of enhancing regional cohesion, weakened the Barcelona Process itself, and undermined the European Union’s legitimacy as international actor in the Mediterranean.  </div...|$|R

40|$|On 8 February 1937 the 23 -year-old Albert Camus gave an inaugural lecture {{for a new}} Maison de la culture, or {{community}} arts centre, in Algiers. Entitled 'La nouvelle culture méditerranéenne' ('The <b>New</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Culture'), Camus's lecture has been interpreted in radically different ways: while some critics have dismissed it as an incoherent piece of juvenilia, others see it as key to understanding his future development as a thinker, whether as the first expression of his so-called 'Mediterranean humanism' or as an early indication of what is seen as his essentially colonial mentality. These various interpretations are based on reading the text of 'The <b>New</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Culture' in a single context, whether that of Camus's life and work as a whole, of French discourses on the Mediterranean or of colonial Algeria (and French discourses on that country). By contrast, this study argues that Camus's lecture - and in principle any historical text - needs {{to be seen in}} a multiplicity of contexts, discursive and otherwise, if readers are to understand properly what its author was doing in writing it. Using Camus's lecture as a case study, the book provides a detailed theoretical and practical justification of this 'multi-contextualist' approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the EMP in two respects. The {{first is the}} way European {{security}} concerns led to initiatives towards the Mediterranean.

The EMP, however, has shown a recent interest in `soft security' issues, especially after 9 / 11. The second respect {{is the type of}} values and norms enshrined in the EMP and the way that they are promoted by the EU.

Moreover, the literature about persuasion might be relevant here, to highlight how values are transmitted to Mediterranean partners...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>policy</b> of the European Union (EU) is in crisis. Ever more experts {{stress the}} {{importance}} of a interrelation of the three –economic, political and social– pillars of the Barcelona Declaration. Thus far, these three baskets have always been treated separately. This paper analyzes the relationship and causality among these three pillars and the strategy the EU is pursuing toward the so-called Non-Community Mediterranean Countries (NCMC). Based on a synthesis of the concepts of “perpetual peace” from Kant and of the “security community” from K. W.
