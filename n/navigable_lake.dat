50|$|There is an {{abundance}} of coastal and lake waterways. In the central areas there are no <b>navigable</b> <b>lakes</b> or rivers. There is a strong maritime tradition going back centuries.

Swahili traders used dhows to conduct trade though many ports along the coast. This tradition continues today with motorized craft.

5000|$|The South American rubber boom ended {{because of}} {{competition}} from Asian producers and synthetic rubber, and the railroad became redundant. Initially, the Brazilian government {{was forced to}} maintain the superfluous facilities because of its obligations under the Treaty of Petrópolis.
