500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E

People kept {{saying he would}} have to die before I could be released, and I did not want my release from prison to be {{dependent}} on somebody, on something happening to somebody else, so I wanted him to live to be 100.” (2007) ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was {{released}} from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore has stated that she regrets the assassination attempt, saying she was [...] "blinded by her radical political views". Moore {{was released}} under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, [...] "I am very glad I did not succeed. I know <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong to try." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. I had discovered that publicly performing my own work placed me in an exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> basically uncommitted to my work and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions. [...] I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked. [...] When the audience and my peers turned on me, I picked up my marbles and went home. [...] I just decided to stop making work.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E
