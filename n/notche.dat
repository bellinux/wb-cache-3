40|$|Noise-power ratio (NPR) {{testing is}} a {{performance}} test technique {{in which a}} notched noise-band {{is applied to the}} input of the DUT, and the output of the DUT is connected to a selective level meter whose bandwidth is less than that of the notch in the noise spectrum.

40|$|For 714 {{consecutive}} {{patients who}} underwent autoge-nous patellar tendon graft {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstructions we intraoperatively measured inter-condylar notch width. We prospectively recorded height, weight, sex, and which patients subsequently tore their contralateral anterior cruciate ligament or the 10 -mm autograft. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups based on notch width (group 1, # 15 mm; group 2, $ 16 mm). The mean notch width was 13. 9 6 2. 2 mm for women and 15. 9 6 2. 5 mm for men. There was no statistically significant difference in notch width be-tween height groups for women or men. Analysis showed that, with height and weight as covariates, women had statistically significantly narrower <b>notche...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{safety assessment}} of ancient timber structures requires {{the evaluation of}} the mechanical properties of their elements and joints. As Building Codes focus mainly in common modern industrialized joints [1], they usually provide little guidance to designers regarding traditional timber carpentry joints, being necessary to establish reliable behaviour models, set detailing rules and provide useful recommendations for future rehabilitation or strengthening interventions in timber structures. Carpentry joints connect timber elements, usually subjected to compressive axial loads, often without any other devices but notches in the connected members. These joints rely on the compression internal forces to keep facing surfaces in close contact and seldom in metal fasteners (more common in Western cultures than in Oriental joint craft [2]). A widespread classic connection at the heel joint in timber trusses is the front <b>notche...</b>|$|E
40|$|Girth welds {{of modern}} line pipe steel, such as X 100, issued from a pulsed {{automatic}} {{gas metal arc}} welding, were tested to check their performance in artic temperature conditions. It is shown that an impact specimen at – 20 °C with a notch placed {{in the middle of}} the fusion line could break at low energy (< 40 J). The brittle zone is located in the coarse-grained heat-affected zone of the weld. The reproduction of two heat-affected zones with a thermal-mechanical simulator, Gleeble 1500, allows to determine the mechanical behaviour of representative microstructures of the welded joint. Tension tests with or without notch and impact tests are performed between – 196 °C and 20 °C. This experimental database is used to fit materials constitutive equations which are used in a finite element code to predict the fracture of the welded joint.

40|$|Stress {{concentration}} {{factors and}} generalised stress intensity factors of round bars weakened by {{different kind of}} notches are analysed under torsion loading An exact closed-form relationship correlating the generalised stress intensity factors of classic notches (parabolic semi-elliptic and hyperbolic) characterized by an exact mathematical profile and pointed V-notches is obtained by using in combination the analytical expressions already available in the literature and some new equations developed in the present contribution Afterwards this link is discussed with reference to U- and blunt V-shaped notches This allows us to provide a new analytical relationship between the generalised notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) and the maximum shear stress at the notch tip By {{taking advantage of the}} new developed frame simple but accurate expressions for the stress concentration factors valid for a large bulk of different configurations changing the notch acuity from shallow to deep are developed For some opening angles an explicit comparison between the new expressions and those proposed by Noda and Takase (Int J Fatigue 2006 28 151 - 163) has been carried out considering deep and shallow <b>notche...</b>|$|E
40|$|Low-cycle {{fatigue tests}} of {{rotating}} cantilevered notched beams under deflection controlled conditions are conducted on four grades of high strength medium alloy steel of hardness 280, 310, 350 and 380 HB. The cyclic stress-strain response and strain-life fatigue curves are determined. The effects of hardness, prestraining and machine allowance after heat treatment, on the fatigue life {{have also been}} studied. A numerical methodology derived from a recent theoretical analysis is utilised which permits the determination of cyclic stress-strain response (n ' and k') and strain-life curve of any material from its measured rotating bending data, namely: the nominal bending stress and both the vertical and horizontal deflections. The cyclic strain-hardening exponent, fatigue strength exponent and fatigue ductility exponent {{were found to be}} almost constants, being 0. 104, 0. 074 and 0. 68, respectively, on the average. In notch fatigue tests under conditions of rotating bending, the actual measured lives in notched specimens for the four investigated materials were five times greater, on the average, than the predicted lives based on crack initiation model. Furthermore, abolishing the machine allowance after heat treatment for the <b>notche...</b>|$|E
40|$|In August 1977 {{excavation}} {{was conducted}} at the Big Creek Lake site - 24 RA 34 - at the outlet of the 91 g Creek Lakes, Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, Ravalli County, Montana. The site contained shallow, disturbed deposits and lacks any statisgraphic separation. One of these occupations was identified by a projectile point type not previously reported from the area. This was termed Big Creek Corner Notched and its temporal affiliation is not precisely known. Comparative material from Colorado and Alberta suggest either Early Archaic or Late Archaic affiliation. The occupations exemplified by Big Creek Corner Notched points and by Pelican Lake-Elko points (Late Archaic 1000 B. B – A. D. 200) were the most prevalent at the site. Less intensive occupations are by ·Middle Plains Archaic McKean points and Late Prehistoric small side <b>notche</b> arrow points. Microscopic analysis of tool working edges shows several of the projectile point forms were used as multi-functional implements. especially as butchering tools. Many {{of the types of}} chipped stone recovered from the site are from known sources in western Montana; indicating group movements within the eastern portion of the Intermountain region. Based on the numerous projectile points and cutting tools, the site is interpreted as a seasonally occupied base camp for hunters...|$|E
