It was performed at the Apollo Theater and was modeled after young black children’s imitations of cows stuck in the mud. In the 1960s, Black Bottom was demolished during the city's urban renewal program and replaced by what is currently known as Lafayette Park.|$|E

40|$|Paul Coldwell uses {{everyday}} {{objects and}} materials to create sculptures that embody notions of experience, {{memory and the}} passing of time. Such ideas are recorded within the environment. The physical form {{and shape of the}} work seem to present a ‘slice’ of geological or archaeological evidence. The assembly of the bricks evokes strata, layers of rock or soil that have been laid down by natural forces. The identification of these layers is based on fossil evidence and can help derive a sequence of time and geologic history of the Earth. However Coldwell has tamed the geology. Its construction brings to mind a man-made wall which is particularly suggested by the highly finished top left section. This implies that these notions of experience and memory, however natural, are in fact constructions and subject to change with each individual. This reflects the artist’s concern that ‘at any time, one might have to uproot, move on, and find some <b>place</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> be'. The title of this sculpture, 'Bouquet', suggests that it commemorates a particular occasion or feeling. The permanence of the natural materials is at odds with the momentary celebrations by which we, as humans, mark the passing of our lives. Similarly the solidity of the materials contrasts with the piece’s delicate construction. This addresses the divided nature of life: permanence is always in conflict with the fragility of life...|$|R

Mallet established a relief service for needy children. The Sisters also provided a home for orphan children, as well as aged and infirm people.

With <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> turn, Price created his own release, Parkhurst International, only available in the European markets. Some of the highlights from the 1995-96 Parkhurst set can be found in Series II, including the first card of Wayne Gretzky in a St. Louis Blues uniform. Although the controversy of this card was that Wayne Gretzky's face was superimposed over previous captain Shayne Corson's body, it was not correct. Wayne Gretzky was also featured on another card in the Series II set, but this time, it was on the back. Kevin Stevens was featured in Series II {{as a member of the}} Los Angeles Kings. On the back of the card is a picture of Kevin Stevens and Wayne Gretzky wearing the Los Angeles Kings' third jersey.
