5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit for Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|Grace was {{seventh in}} the overall {{national}} batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above him were John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms of runs scored, Grace {{was one of only}} two players to complete 1,000. The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two.|$|E

Brian notices this, and tells Peter that crack is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> substitute for drinking. As a result, Peter sees a hypnotherapist, who helps him discover that Francis was not his biological father.

5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E

Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October.

5|$|Gilchrist {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos in February 1965, but the Bills {{continued}} to win, ending with a 10–3–1 record and winning the AFL championship {{for the second year in}} a row. In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when offensive linemen Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped the Bills win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who had said he was indecisive, did not use his players properly and was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> play-caller.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> conductor of heat or electricity. It has a low melting point (640°C) and an unusually high boiling point (3,228°C).|$|E

At Maldegem, 16 aircraft were destroyed, and at Ursel only six were lost. The claims of I./JG 1 were actually more in line with British total losses at both Maldegem and Ursel. No. 131 Wing RAF / Polish Wing lost 13 Spitfires plus two damaged beyond repair, a total of 15 lost. At Ursel, six aircraft were destroyed, including, a B-17, two Lancasters and a Mosquito.

The matched finished 2–2 after extra time and as so was decided in a penalty shoot-out; the first in Stockport's history. Stockport went on to lose 3–0 on penalties. The introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Conference was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sign for Stockport, and in 1986–87 they had just six points from 13 games and faced a real prospect of non-League football, exemplified by being eliminated from the FA Cup by Caernarfon Town.

5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
