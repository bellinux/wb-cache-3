40|$|The X- 33 {{technology}} demonstrator is a suborbital {{precursor to the}} Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) with first flight planned for summer of 1999. The flight test program will include about 15 flights originating from Edwards Air Force Base, California, each with widely varying flight profiles {{in order to test}} new thermal protection system (TPS) materials, structures, and linear aerospike engines. The first flights will be relatively short range flights with about a 300 nmi range, maximum Mach number of 7, maximum altitude of 190, 000 feet, whereas the latter flights will cover about 800 nmi range, with max altitude of about 260, 000 feet and max Mach of about 15. The guidance algorithms must be flexible enough to accommodate these various profiles and to adapt to severe off-nominal dispersions, such as early engine failure (partial or total) where possibly more than half the thrust is lost. An onboard real-time performance monitor will be used to assess the viability of the <b>nominal</b> landing <b>site</b> as well as alternate landing sites that would potentially be used in extreme off-nominal conditions. During ascent, a single entry guidance-related parameter, which is easy to calculate, is used to assess the viability of the <b>nominal</b> landing <b>site</b> as well as alternate landing sites.

We have examined high-quality, single-crystal Na 0. 5 Bi 0. 5 TiO 3 using transmission electron microscopy and have used digital electron diffraction to observe the symmetry of defect-free regions of material on length scales of a few nanometers. This unequivocally demonstrates that the material is rhombohedral with space group R 3 c on this length scale. We find that a model that allows disordered displacements of Bi atoms from their <b>nominal</b> <b>sites</b> in the R 3 c symmetry, while retaining this symmetry on average, gives a very significant improvement in fit to simulations. We use conventional transmission electron microscopy to enumerate the different types of defects that are observed in other regions of the crystal and find a complex microstructure of antiphase boundaries, domain walls, and tetragonal platelets. Their interaction leads to the formation of very high densities of nanotwins.

It is {{primarily}} a technology demonstration to test the feasibility of a direct entry-delivery system, but carries a nominal scientific payload that includes rover-lander and instrumentation for limited mineralogical analysis. The nominal landing site was selected by the Pathfinder Team under the leadership of Dr. Matthew Golombek (JPL) based input from 60 participants at a Landing Site Workshop held last Spring at the Lunar Planetary Institute in Houston. The mission constraints for the landing site were 0 - 30 deg. N latitude, and below the 0. 0 elevation datum. Over 20 landing sites were proposed and a <b>nominal</b> <b>site</b> was selected on southern Chryse Planitia near the terminae of the Ares and Tui outflow channels. In part, the decision to land at this location was based on the opportunity to sample a potentially large number lithologies in a small area (the rover will have a range of a few tens of meters from the lander). The purpose here is to review the general geological context of the landing site and the rationale for Exobiology's recommendation of the Ares site given at the workshop last spring. Because Ares and Tui Valles are sourced within terranes that may have originated by thermokarst processes, hydrothermal processes could have operated there for some time. Hydrothermal systems are presently regarded as important sites for a fossil record on Mars. Models for the formation of the outflow channels suggest that thermal spring sinters and associated aqueous mineral deposits, high priority targets for Mars Exopaleontology, could have formed in association with thermokarst processes and subsequently been delivered to the landing site in large quantities during the periodic cataclysmic outflows that created the channels...|$|E

Magnetization, x-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction studies {{have been carried out}} on a series of compounds with x = 0. 0 – 0. 6. The superconducting transition temperature Tc, determined from magnetization measurements, increases with increasing Ca 2 + substitution. Neutron diffraction studies reveal that these compounds crystallize in a tetragonal structure (space group P 4 /mmm). A detailed analysis of the neutron diffraction data reveals that Ca and La ions are intermixed at the nominal Ba and Nd sites. While a major fraction of Ca ions occupy the usual Nd site, a small fraction occupies the Ba site. Consequently, the corresponding amount of La substitutes at the <b>nominal</b> Nd <b>site.</b> The intermixing of Ca and La sites randomizes the chain site oxygens leading to a tetragonal structure despite an oxygen content close to 7. 0 for all the Ca doped samples.

40|$|Suramin, a {{synthetic}} polysulfonated compound, developed initially {{for the treatment}} of African trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis, is currently used {{for the treatment of}} several medically relevant disorders. Suramin, heparin, and other polyanions inhibit the myotoxic activity of Lys 49 phospholipase A 2 analogues both in vitro and in vivo, and are thus of potential importance as therapeutic agents in the treatment of viperid snake bites. Due to its conformational flexibility around the single bonds that link the central phenyl rings to the secondary amide backbone, the symmetrical suramin molecule binds by an induced-fit mechanism complementing the hydrophobic surfaces of the dimer and adopts a novel conformation that lacks C 2 symmetry in the dimeric crystal structure of the suramin–Bothrops asper myotoxin II complex. The simultaneous binding of suramin at the surfaces of the two monomers partially restricts access to the <b>nominal</b> active <b>sites</b> and significantly changes the overall charge of the interfacial recognition face of the protein, resulting in the inhibition of myotoxicity.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} nonstoichiometry on the half-metallic character of the Heusler alloy Co 2 MnSi (CMS) through the Mn composition (alpha) dependence of the saturation magnetization per formula unit (mu(s)) of Co 2 Mn alpha Si beta thin films and the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of CMS/MgO/CMS magnetic tunnel junctions (CMS MTJs) having Co 2 Mn alpha Si beta electrodes. As a basis for understanding the effect of nonstoichiometry in CMS, we developed a generalized form of the site-specific formula unit (SSFU) composition model, which assumes the formation of only antisite defects, not vacancies, to accommodate nonstoichiometry. The alpha dependence of mu(s) was well explained by density functional calculations with the coherent potential approximation based on the SSFU composition model for alpha {{up to a certain}} critical value (alpha(c)) > 1. 0. The mu(s) data for Mn-deficient films deviated from the Slater-Pauling predicted data for half-metals due to Co atoms at the <b>nominal</b> Mn <b>sites</b> (Co-Mn). The theoretical spin polarizations, obtained from only the s- and p-orbital components, Pth(sp), were found to qualitatively explain the alpha dependence of the TMR ratio except for alpha > alpha(c). This is in contrast to the theoretical spin polarizations obtained from the s-, p-, and d-orbital components, Pth(spd). A decrease in the TMR ratio observed for CMSMTJs having Mn-deficient electrodes was ascribed to small s- and p-orbital components of the local density of minority-spin in-gap states at the Fermi level that appeared for both antisite Co-Mn atoms and Co atoms at the regular sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} smart {{materials}} such as the piezo-impedance transducer (lead zirconate titanate, PZT) and optical fiber (FBG) has ushered {{in a new era}} in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM) based on non-destructive evaluation (NDE). So far, successful research and investigations conducted on the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique employing a piezo-impedance transducer are often laboratory based and mainly theoretical. Real-life application of the technique, especially under harsh environments, has frequently been questioned. In this research project, investigative studies were conducted to evaluate the problems involved in real-life applications of the EMI technique, attempting to reduce the gap between theory and application. This two-part paper presents a series of experimentation (part I) and numerical verification (part II) on various issues related to real-life application, including the durability of PZT transducers, and the effects of bonding and temperature under conceivable <b>nominal</b> construction <b>site</b> conditions. The repeatability of electrical admittance signatures acquired from the PZT patches surface bonded on aluminum structures was found to be excellent up to a period of one and a half years. Experimental investigations revealed that the bonding thickness should preferably be thinner than one-third of the patch to avoid any adverse effect caused by the PZT patch 2 ̆ 7 s resonance on the admittance signatures which reflect the host structural behavior. On the other hand, the effect of temperature on the admittance signatures was found to be closely related to the thickness of bonding, as an increase in temperature would reduce the stiffness of the bonding layer, thus affecting strain transfer. It was concluded that PZT patches with thick bonding thickness and high frequency of excitation are undesirable, especially at elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the factors that}} critically affect the half-metallicity of the quaternary Heusler alloy Co 2 (Mn, Fe) Si (CMFS) by examining the film composition dependence of the saturation magnetization per formula unit, mu(s), of CMFS thin films and the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of CMFS/MgO/CMFS magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We also {{investigated the}} origin of the giant TMR ratio of up to 2610 % at 4. 2 K (429 % at 290 K) obtained for CMFS MTJs with Mn-rich, lightly Fe-doped CMFS electrodes. Co antisites at the <b>nominal</b> Mn/Fe <b>sites</b> (Co-Mn/Fe antisites) can consistently explain the mu(s) for (Mn + Fe) -deficient CMFS thin films being lower than the half-metallic Z(t) - 24 value and the TMR ratio for MTJs with (Mn + Fe) -deficient CMFS electrodes being lower than that for MTJs with (Mn+ Fe) -rich CMFS electrodes. It was revealed that the Co-Mn/Fe antisite is detrimental to the half-metallicity of the CMFS quaternary alloy, {{as it is in the}} Co 2 MnSi (CMS) ternary alloy. It was also shown that (Mn + Fe) -rich compositions are critical to suppressing these harmful antisites and to retaining the half-metallic electronic state. In addition, a relatively small Fe ratio, rather than a large one, in the total (Mn + Fe) composition led to a more complete half-metallic electronic state. Half-metallicity was more strongly enhanced by increasing the Mn composition in Mn-rich, lightly Fe-doped CMFS than in Mn-rich CMS. This phenomenon is the cause of the giant TMR ratio recently reported for CMFS MTJs. Our findings indicate that the approach to controlling off-stoichiometry and film composition is promising for fully utilizing the half-metallicity of quaternary CMFS thin films as spin source materials...|$|R

It is shown that bipartites are not simply adverbs, for {{which they have been}} taken so far, but they can serve in a variety of functions, some of them typical for adjectives, such as attributive modifier or predicative use. That predicative use, especially in secondary predication, is then in the focus of the rest of this work. The morphosyntactic composition of secondary predication is discussed in detail, showing that lexically secondary predicates involve both adjectives and nouns (to a much lesser extent). Structurally, secondary predicates are divided into bare ones, consisting of an adjective or noun, and prepositional ones, involving bipartites, and thus consisting of a combination of a preposition and adjective or noun. Semantically, secondary predicates can be depictive or resultative. It is also illustrated that although secondary predicates fall into the category of adjuncts, they must be clearly distinguished from adverbials, attributives, interjections and absolutes. The second part of this study concentrates on the syntax of secondary predication. It shows that secondary predicates are best described as small clauses with a predicator serving as Pr head. Three attachment sites are proposed that allow for unambiguous subject and object control, as well as separation of depictives and resultatives from circumstantials. Secondary predicates can both agree and not agree with controlling NPs. Cases are discussed where agreement is obligatory, optional or blocked. In order to account for this variety, two types of Pr head (small clause head) are assumed: the full one blocks agreement and may assign its own case, the defective one allows agreement. The agreement involves both Agree and feature sharing between the controlling NP and secondary predicate. Finally, long distance control of secondary predicates in non-finite constructions and verbal nouns is explained. Additional to dichotomy depictive vs. resultative, a third group, the co-called circumstantials, is identified which differs significantly from the former ones not only in semantics, but also in lexical composition (they are predominantly <b>nominal)</b> and attachment <b>site</b> (inside NP) ...|$|R
