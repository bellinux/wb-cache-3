2500|$|Abel Linares offered Paige $100 {{per game}} to play winter ball for the Santa Clara {{team in the}} Cuban League. Gambling on {{baseball}} games in Cuba was such a huge pastime that players {{were not allowed to}} drink alcohol, so they could stay ready to play. Paige—homesick for carousing, hating the food, despising the constant inspections and being thoroughly baffled by the language—went 6–5 in Cuba. He left Cuba abruptly {{before the end of the}} season, with several stories told about the circumstances. Paige told one version in which the mayor of a small hamlet asked him, in Spanish, if he had intentionally lost a particular game. Paige, not understanding a word the man said, <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> thinking the man was fawning over him, and then had to flee from the furious mayor. Another version, also told by Paige, says that when he called on an attractive local girl at her home, she and her family interpreted his attentions as an official engagement and sent the police to enforce it, leading Paige to flee the island with police in pursuit. A third version, told by the general manager of the Santa Clara Leopards, says that he left Cuba in haste after legal charges were brought against him regarding an amorous incident with [...] "a young lady from the provincial mulatto bourgeoisie." ...|$|E
60|$|Barnet <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> again; but {{his smile}} was sadder than hers.|$|E
60|$|William <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> {{after the}} manner of an angel {{surprised}} in a good deed.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Ballingford {{glanced around}} the table and was rewarded by <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> of approval.|$|R
60|$|Then he tramped away to {{join his}} mate, turning now <b>and</b> then to <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> show a ruddy face full of happiness, while the family watched him out of sight with mingled hopes and doubts and fears.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke from}} {{him with a}} little cry, but when she turned round again it was to <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> to him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> and {{was very}} busy about {{purchasing}} boric acid. He stared after her, and slipped away.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Cyrilla <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> good-humouredly, and Lucy Rose, {{though she}} privately held {{to her own}} opinion, had to smile too.|$|E
60|$|Jenny <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> in mysterious silence, {{as though}} the subject of her health were a secret {{that could not be}} {{publicly}} divulged.|$|E
60|$|I turned round <b>and</b> saw, <b>nodding</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiling</b> {{at me with}} inveterate civility, a tall man, {{dressed in}} a frogged and braided surtout.|$|R
60|$|Bobus gave a <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile,</b> {{which his}} mother {{understood}} {{only too well}} as intimating acquiescence with wishes which he deemed feminine and conventional.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bagnet in the {{meantime}} has shaken hands with his old comrade and with Phil, on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good-humoured <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Curtis calmly {{folded the}} paper, <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> his thanks to Red Wolf, and then lifting his hand he signed to the policeman, {{in full view}} of all the dancers: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Real friends {{should have}} {{everything}} in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> and felt {{very proud of}} having a friend with such noble ideas.|$|E
6000|$|The girl's lips moved. [...] "Arthur! Arthur!... Arthur's ship!" [...] A deep sigh. She clenched her hands. [...] "He is coming?" [...] Hilda <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> {{holding her}} breath with suspense.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I dare say, ma'am,' pursued Mr Boffin, while Mrs Boffin added confirmatory <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiles,</b> 'you are {{not very}} much {{inclined}} to take kindly to us?' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{drove off}} in a little fiacre, <b>nodding</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiling</b> at Sir John, who {{remained}} upon the Avenue. He too, when she had disappeared, called a carriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it of all things," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "There is nothing I enjoy more than taking aim--and hitting," [...] she ended, {{with a pretty}} <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
60|$|The farm-girl {{came out}} leading the horse, {{and as the}} two young things passed they <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> at each other, with the {{delicate}} tangle of the hop-vines at their feet.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked up}} sharply {{at the doctor}} from such pensive embroidery, and found him {{as far away as}} I. He <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> and we shook hands on the bank in the thick mist.|$|E
6000|$|... "To what base uses may we come," [...] quoted Emily, as {{they all}} <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> upon the victim as he looked back from the barn-yard, where he was clamorously welcomed by his new charges.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{not much}} to be {{gathered}} from [...] "ho!" [...] but the <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> proved to Nelly that the intruder was indeed none other than her old friend Wapaw.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, there will; see {{if there}} is n't," [...] cried Polly, <b>nodding</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiling,</b> for Fan had confided to her that she meant to try it after her friend had gone.|$|R
60|$|His nurses {{looked on}} with great satisfaction, and when Wapaw glanced up {{from time to}} time in their faces, he was advised to {{continue}} his meal with <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> of goodwill.|$|R
60|$|Master Brunny Lynam {{ran across}} the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial {{into the mouth of}} the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> and walked along Mountjoy square east.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{when she}} looked up and saw him coming toward her flower-garden, she <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> to him, and the big bluff Squire rode up to her side, and looked down with a smile at her flowers.|$|E
6000|$|Nan strolled {{the length}} of the street, startling those natives who had {{formerly}} known her, Ingua <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> at everyone. Mary Ann Hopper called, as they passed her: [...] "Hullo, Ingua. Where'd ye git the new duds?" ...|$|E
60|$|With <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiles</b> {{to right}} <b>and</b> left--a queen dismissing her court--she {{passed on the}} captain's arm through the little crowd that gave way before her dismayed and intrigued, and so away.|$|R
6000|$|And she {{continued}} to <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> make-believe to hear with more demonstration of face and cap than ever. After all, her total loss of hearing made little difference, her sentiments being what Bobby Frog in his early days would have described in the words, [...] "Wot's the hodds so long as you're 'appy?" ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not have}} half time enough with her, for a bell rang, and away she skipped, looking back to <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> at the queer lady who had taken a fancy to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' {{replied the}} monkey; but, instead, he <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> and said: 'I hope your {{industry}} may be rewarded as it deserves.' The men thanked him heartily, let him pass on, and the puma followed behind him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{waited with}} {{immovable}} patience. At intervals, he <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> and whispered to himself, [...] "Something to frighten Mr. Armadale in that!" [...] But {{he made no}} further attempt, by word, look, or action, to hurry his son.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is!" [...] and David <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> himself, as {{he handed}} her {{two or three of}} the finest, as if it was as natural a thing as to put a sprig of mignonette in his own button-hole.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was good}} to see him square his broad {{shoulders}} and throw back {{his head as he}} said that; and pretty to see Letty <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> with sincerest pleasure in his success, as she said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Boffin adding her <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> {{of welcome}} to Mr Boffin's words, Bella took her book {{to a chair}} in the fireside corner, by Mrs Boffin's work-table. Mr Boffin's station was on the {{opposite}} side.|$|R
60|$|Then Mr Garland having alighted {{and gone}} up-stairs, Sampson would <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> to Kit from the window, and {{presently}} walk {{out into the}} street to greet him, when some such conversation as the following would ensue.|$|R
