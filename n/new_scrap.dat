50|$|There {{are several}} chronicles of Portuguese India written by contemporaries and historians, which provide {{substantive}} {{descriptions of the}} various armadas. João de Barros's Décadas da Ásia and Damião de Góis's royal chronicles (Crónica do Felicíssimo Rei D. Manuel, 1566-67 and Crónica do Principe D. João, 1567) were official chronicles. As a result, while comprehensive, they have the drawbacks of being carefully censored and consciously propagandistic. Both Barros and Gois constructed their accounts primarily from archives in Lisbon although Barros's vast work was far more comprehensive and more conscientiously faithful to accuracy (Góis's was an unabashed hagiography, whereas Barros frequently updated his account on the discovery of any <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> of information).

40|$|Life cycle {{analysis}} {{is an appropriate}} way to clear obscure facts about an element. Gallium is a critical element which is used in many technologies these days and therefore quantification of main global cycles of gallium, production, consumption and end of life products, also investigation about recycled gallium content and potential recycling possibilities are investigated in this paper. First a qualitative substance flow for gallium is designed similar to other metal cycles with regards to exclusive characteristics of gallium flows itself. USGS and World Mining Data are mainly used to get information about gallium production, main gallium consumptions and end of life products. Subsequently a quantitative model in STAN should unlock many uncertainties. Substance flow analysis and material flow analysis give {{a better understanding of}} unknown gallium flows with their uncertainties and meanwhile major applications, concentration of gallium in different products, waste flows, landfills and present recycling technologies are detailed. Consequently STAN model asserts that main gallium flows are primary gallium production and refined gallium production in production process, Integrated Circuit board fabrication, Light Emitting Diodes, Photovoltaic and recycled <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> flow in manufacturing process. A significant amount of gallium is collected as stock in consumption process. Also current gallium recycling facilities are limited as recycling is not economically justified. Moreover main part of recycled gallium content is collected from <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> which is formed through manufacturing process. Finally gallium consumption in Photovoltaic and Light Emitting Diodes industry increases rapidly and sustainability demand cost efficient methods for gallium recycling from solar cells, diodes and other end of life products...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{a growing}} {{need for more}} {{efficient}} use of raw materials as well as recovering of waste streams generated by the manufacturing sector can be observed. Industrial activities often produce large amounts of relatively uniform waste flows, allowing cost effective utilization and alternative recycling routes. This paper presents an approach for resource efficient and closed loop recycling of manufacturing waste streams. This approach seeks to minimize the need for primary material flows and to reduce the related environmental impact. Furthermore, it examines opportunities to reduce or avoid raw material use by transforming under-valued waste streams into feedstock and divert it to the same or other processes. The focus {{of this paper is}} on aluminium <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> streams, especially in light-gauge scrap for which the standard End-of-Life treatment has a significant energy and resource demand.

This study conducts accounting and scenario analysis on the life cycle of vanadium metabolism in China. Based on the characteristics of vanadium life cycle and substance flow analysis (SFA) framework, we present a quantitative evaluation of a static anthropogenic vanadium life cycle for the year 2010. Results show that anthropogenic vanadium consumption, stocks, and new domestic scrap are at 98. 2, 21. 2, and 4. 1 kt, respectively; <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> is usually discarded. The overall utilization ratio of vanadium is 32. 2 %. A large amount of vanadium is stockpiled into tailings, debris, slags, and other spent solids. A scenario analysis was conducted to analyze the future developmental trend of vanadium metabolism in China based on the SFA framework and the qualitative analysis of technology advancement and socio-economic development. The baseline year was set as 2010. Several indicators were proposed to simulate different scenarios from 2010 to 2030. The scenario analysis indicates that the next 20 years is a critical period for the vanadium industry in China.

We find that the IO-MFN approach has the following advantages: (1) it helps to uncover the network of material flows in the manufacturing stage in the life cycle of metals; (2) it provides a method that may be less time-consuming but more complete and accurate in estimating <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> generation, process loss, domestic final demand, and trade of final products of metals, than existing material flow analysis approaches; and, most importantly, (3) it enables the analysis of the material flows of metals in the U.

40|$|The Autonomous Power System (APS) {{project at}} NASA LeRC is {{designed}} to demonstrate the applications of integrated intelligent diagnosis, control, and scheduling techniques to space power distribution systems. The project consists of three elements: the Autonomous Power Expert System (APEX) for Fault Diagnosis, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR); the Autonomous Intelligent Power Scheduler (AIPS) to efficiently assign activities start times and resources; and power hardware (Brassboard) to emulate a space-based power system. The AIPS scheduler was tested within the APS system. This scheduler is able to efficiently assign available power to the requesting activities and share this information with other software agents within the APS system in order to implement the generated schedule. The AIPS scheduler is also able to cooperatively recover from fault situations by rescheduling the affected loads on the Brassboard {{in conjunction with the}} APEX FDIR system. AIPS served as a learning tool and an initial scheduling testbed for the integration of FDIR and automated scheduling systems. Many lessons were learned from the AIPS scheduler and are now being integrated into a new scheduler called SCRAP (Scheduler for Continuous Resource Allocation and Planning). This paper will service three purposes: an overview of the AIPS implementation, lessons learned from the AIPS scheduler, and a brief section on how these lessons are being applied to the <b>new</b> <b>SCRAP</b> scheduler...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{economic}} principles {{can provide}} useful {{insights into the}} behavior of metal markets. In applying these principles, however, the analyst {{must take into account}} technology, market structure, government policies, and other institutional factors influencing the nature of metal supply and demand. Knowledge of both economics and the metal markets is essential. One without the other is likely to lead to sterile or even misleading results. In support of the above conclusion, this study examines the nature of metal supply and demand in the immediate run (when output is fixed), in the short run (when capacity is fixed), in the long run (when technology and known deposits are fixed), and in the very long run (when nothing is fixed). The first section considers how a metal's own price, the prices of substitutes and complements, income, and other factors determine its demand. Metal demand functions, demand curves, and demand elasticities are investigated. The second section focuses on metal supply. It contrasts the nature of supply for metals mined as individual and main products, recovered as byproducts and coproducts, and recycled from old and <b>new</b> <b>scrap.</b> The third and final section applies the concepts introduced in the first two sections. It analyzes the causes and consequences of the instability that plagues metal markets, the impact of public stockpiling on metal markets, and the conditions needed to use the "incentive price" technique to forecast long run metal prices...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} department at Electrolux cooking plant, Dudley Park, Adelaide, Australia has {{over the past}} thirty years evolved into a reactive rather than proactive department with respect to equipment reliability. Therefore ABB was engaged in a benchmarking study where 13 different areas were found in need for improvement. Implementation of Overall Equipment Effectiveness was found as one important area to change and is the scope for this Masters Thesis. Overall Equipment Effectiveness, OEE, is a key performance index for machine utilisation and takes into consideration three different factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality. There is also focus on removing the Six Big Losses in order to improve the OEE-numbers. As a method and help in finding the losses and remove those permanently Root Cause Failure Analysis have been used and a causal tree over the biggest problem area has been created. The area chosen as a pilot area where to try out OEE was the Side Panel Machine, SPM, which produces side panels for upright cookers which is {{regarded as one of the}} biggest future bottleneck. The biggest problem area with the SPM was the second station, Notch and Pierce and panels not leaving to the roll former station. OEE was implemented with cross functional meetings and meeting attendants from all departments involved in the Side Panel Machine: tooling, production, maintenance, and engineering. As a result from the meetings the machine was rebuilt and improved during the Christmas break. The OEE team also put in big efforts to try and mount a camera to record breakdowns at the Side Panel Machine. The collection of production data was improved with a new OEE- sheet for the operator to fill in time losses and a <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> audit sheet to fill in quality losses. The recommendations for Electrolux are to continue working with OEE. To do this they need to find a new driving force, educate OEE teams about OEE and RCFA and focus on the collection of accurate production data. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} {{of solid waste}} has become an urgent problem in nations with a great population density. Accordingly, waste reduction through source reduction and recycling has become increasingly important. Our purpose is to show how prevention, recycling and disposal of waste {{could be part of}} a theory of the firm. We first derive efficient production functions from production processes with waste as a by-product. Waste obtained as <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> can partially be recycled by using additional inputs in order to cut back the purchase of virgin material. Waste not completely recyclable will leave the firm as disposal which also entails cost to the firm. We use the dual cost function approach to develop a theory of the firm under solid residual management. Since the producer does not bear the full cost of disposal, there will be a bias toward virgin materials and away from recycling. The goal of the government is to stimulate the firms to recycle with respect to the preservation of exhaustible resources. An incentive to recycle is a tax on resources or on waste. In order to determine the tax levels the government maximizes welfare subject to the dynamic constraint for decumulation of land fill for waste deposits. This gives the user cost and its time profile for taxing waste disposal or virgin material. In a comparative statics analysis we compare the effect of taxes on waste vs. virgin material on effort to produce in a resource saving manner, on the quantity of recycled material, on output, and on the reduction of waste. Since the impact of environmental regulation on employment is important, our model detects seven effects on labor demand as part of resource conservation policy. We finally carry out a comparative statics analysis of waste intensive firms operating in different market structures. Of interest is the impact of a resource or waste taxation on market volume, on the number of firms, on resource saving effort, and on profit.

40|$|Gallium and gallium {{compounds}} {{are more}} frequently used in future oriented {{technologies such as}} photovoltaics, light diodes and semiconductor technology. In the long term the supply risk {{is estimated to be}} critical. Germany {{is one of the major}} primary gallium producer, recycler of gallium from <b>new</b> <b>scrap</b> and GaAs wafer producer. Therefore, new concepts for a resource saving handling of gallium and appropriate recycling strategies have to be designed. This study focus on options for a possible recycling of gallium from waste electric and electronic equipment. To identify first starting points, a substance flow analysis was carried out for gallium applied in integrated circuits on printed circuit boards and LED used for background lighting in Germany in 2012. Moreover, radio amplifier chips (integrated circuits) were investigated in detail to deduct first approaches for a recycling of such components. An analysis of recycling barriers was carried out in order to investigate general opportunities and risks for the recycling of gallium from chips and LED. Results show, that significant gallium losses arose during the production and the waste management. 93 ± 11 %, equivalent to 43, 000 ± 4, 700 kg of the total gallium potential were lost over the whole process until applied in electronic goods. The largest share of 14, 000 ± 2, 300 kg gallium was lost in the primary production process. The refining process was connected to additional 6, 900 ± 3, 700 kg and the chip and wafer production to 21, 700 ± 3, 200 kg lost gallium. Due to low collection rates, further 400 ± 200 kg of gallium were not recycled. Due to the fact, that no recycling of gallium from WEEE exists, all gallium is lost in the current waste management system. A thermal pre-treatment of the chips, followed by a manual separation allowed an isolation of gallium rich fractions, with mass fractions up to 35 %. Here, gallium loads per Chip were between 0. 9 and 1. 3 mg. Copper, gold and arsenic were determined as well. The pyrometallurgical copper route might be an option for gallium recycling. A recovery of gold and gallium in combination with copper is possible due to a compatibility with this base-metal. But, a selective separation prior to this process is necessary. Diluted with other materials, the gallium content would be too low and the recovery not feasible any more. The recycling of gallium from chips applied on printed circuit boards and LED used for background lighting is technically complex. Recycling barriers exist over the whole recycling chain. A forthcoming commercial implementation is not expected in nearer future. This applies in particular for gallium bearing chips...|$|E
