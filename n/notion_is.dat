5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E

50|$|A <b>notion</b> in {{philosophy}} <b>is</b> a {{reflection in the}} mind of real objects and phenomena in their essential features and relations. <b>Notions</b> <b>are</b> usually described in terms of scope and content. This <b>is</b> because <b>notions</b> <b>are</b> often created in response to empirical observations (or experiments) of covarying trends among variables.|$|R

5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

25|$|A related, but weaker, <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> {{that of a}} preregular space. X is a preregular space if any two topologically {{distinguishable}} points can {{be separated}} by neighbourhoods. Preregular spaces are also called R1 spaces.|$|E

25|$|A simplicial {{commutative}} ring is a simplicial {{object in}} the category of commutative rings. They are building blocks for (connective) derived algebraic geometry. A closely related but more general <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> that of E∞-ring.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{well-developed}} {{example of this}} general <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> the subfield of abstract algebra called representation theory, which studies the representing of elements of algebraic structures by linear transformations of vector spaces.|$|E
25|$|This <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> {{present in}} C and Perl, among others. Note that as in earlier {{languages}} such as Algol 60 and FORTRAN, spaces are allowed in identifiers, so that half pi {{is a single}} identifier (thus avoiding the underscores versus camel case versus all lower-case issues).|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between A-theorists and B-theorists {{is often described}} as a dispute about temporal passage or 'becoming' and 'progressing'. B-theorists argue that this <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> purely psychological. Many A-theorists argue that in rejecting temporal 'becoming', B-theorists reject time's most vital and distinctive characteristic. It is common (though not universal) to identify A-theorists' views with belief in temporal passage.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{and more}} {{specifically}} in general topology, compactness is a property that generalizes {{the notion of a}} subset of Euclidean space being closed (that is, containing all its limit points) and bounded (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples include a closed interval, a rectangle, or a finite set of points. This <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> defined for more general topological spaces than Euclidean space in various ways.|$|E
25|$|Philo's <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> {{even more}} {{abstract}} {{than that of}} the Monad of Pythagoras or the Good of Plato. Only God’s existence is certain, no appropriate predicates can be conceived. Following Plato, Philo equates matter to nothingness and sees its effect in fallacy, discord, damage, and decay of things. This view enables Philo to combine the Jewish belief in creation with the Greek conviction about the formation of all things from the permanent matter.|$|E

25|$|Sake is a brewed rice {{beverage}} {{that typically}} contains 15%–17% alcohol and {{is made by}} multiple fermentation of rice. At traditional formal meals, it is considered an equivalent to rice and is not simultaneously taken with other rice-based dishes, although this <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> typically no longer applied to modern, refined, premium ("ginjo") sake, which bear {{little resemblance to the}} sakes of even 100 years ago. Side dishes for sake are particularly called sakana or otsumami.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{algorithm}} {{is also used}} to define the notion of decidability. That <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.|$|E
25|$|Dews play {{a crucial}} role in the cosmogonic drama of the Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian view of {{creation}} completed in the 12th century. In this text, the evil spirit Ahriman (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of dews to counter the creation of Ormuzd (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> already alluded to in the Vendidad (see Younger Avestan texts above), but only properly developed in the Bundahishn. In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six dews that in Zoroastrian tradition are the antitheses of the Amahraspands (Avestan Amesha Spentas).|$|E

25|$|Many critics {{tied the}} album's {{conceptual}} roots with its sound; it {{was described as}} “ a sense of creeping voyeurism”. Some noted, though, that this <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> ‘subverted’ by the album's sound. As Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound explains in a glowing review, “ a misleading title; nothing terrifying emerges from the multiple layers of sound. Indeed, as far as Isis records go, this is positively joyous”. Similarly, its feel, likened to contemporaries Pelican's 2005 record The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, is described by Andrew Bonazelli as ‘triumphant’.|$|E
25|$|Claims from {{scientific}} research on {{sex differences in}} intelligence, quite independently of their scientific validity, can have self-fulfilling effects and therefore sustain the very sex differences they seek to explain. Psychologist Barry Schwartz extended the concept of idea technology to convey {{the point that the}} ideas and concepts produced by science and technology, just like the tangible products, can affect our lives. This <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> also described as looping effects or feedback effects in cognition and culture, whereby the causal understanding of a particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} potential location of Tacitus's account of Nerthus as {{on the island of}} Zealand in Denmark. The reasoning behind this <b>notion</b> <b>is</b> the linking of the name Nerthus with the medieval place name Niartharum (modern Nærum) located on Zealand. Further justification is given in that Lejre, the seat of the ancient kings of Denmark, is also located on Zealand. Nerthus is then commonly compared to the goddess Gefjon, who is said to have plowed the island of Zealand from Sweden in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning and in Lejre wed the legendary Danish king Skjöldr.|$|E
