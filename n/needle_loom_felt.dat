40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{fabric filter}} plants normally utilize bags manufactured from Polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Although these bags are cheaper than high temperature bags, manufactured from Polyphenylenesulphide (PPS), they {{are prone to}} shrinkage. Shrinkage in a fabric filter plant is problematic {{in the sense that}} it not only affects the performance of the bags, but indeed, of the whole gas cleaning system. Some of the areas affected are permeability, cleanability and strength. The shrinkage can be chemical of nature. This is related to the cyclisation of the PAN fibers due to heat or chemical attack. The shrinkage could also be physical of nature, which means the shrinkage is caused by the elastic memory of the fibers and stresses induced in the felt during manufacturing. Heat setting of the fabric is very important and differences of parameters during the heat setting process are responsible for differences in the shrinkage behaviour of adjacent bags in the same bag house, constructed of the same fibre and in the same <b>needling</b> <b>loom.</b> This paper deals with the reasons for bag shrinkage and how it could be managed...|$|R

I am not a singer (I wish I was) but people who do sing tell me how up lifting and happy it makes them feel. There {{can be no doubt that}} singing and the feel good factor are synonymous with a sense of wellbeing and good health. Indeed, Carolan et al (2011) provide extensive supporting literature of the positive effects of maternal singing and music therapy on infants and of note the benefits to preterm infants within their paper (p 2). So I present to you for this issue of research unwrapped a detailed appraisal of the above research paper alongside a warm gesture of respect for those of you who can sing...|$|R

A soft summer afternoon; the mild beam still gilding the tranquil scene; a river, green meads full of kine, woods vocal with the joyous song of the thrush and the blackbird; and in the distance, the lofty breast of the purple moor, still blazing in the sun: fair sights and renovating sounds {{after a day of}} labour passed in walls and amid the ceaseless and monotonous clang of the spindle and the <b>loom.</b> So Gerard <b>felt</b> it, as he stretched his great limbs in the air and inhaled its perfumed volume.|$|R
40|$|Morrales or net {{bags are}} an {{important}} man’s accessory in rural Guatemala, and many are made from maguey fibers using the ancient techniques of thigh spinning, and simple looping. Adaptations to these styles probably began when neighboring Mayan and Xinca tribes exchanged ideas as they {{came in contact with}} each other in times of trade and conflict. With Spain’s colonization, new tools such as spinning wheels, knitting <b>needles,</b> and <b>looms,</b> along with their uses, were incorporated into bag construction. The sailors who transported these early explorers likely introduced the strap methods of braiding, and knotwork, and with the introduction of horses there became a demand for horse gear, such as saddlebags. One community abandoned their ancestral homeland for the present one, and brought unique bag making skills with them. More recently, missionaries, and international aid workers living in remote communities have introduced new techniques, and styles, while globalization has brought additional products and materials into these same villages. Movement of people {{as a result of the}} recent civil war, and economics has also affected morral making. Even a researcher such as myself can influence the production of bags made in the republic. All of these events have transformed morrales, and today besides being looped, bags are woven, knit, crocheted, and linked. From the first people to the present, learn what morrales can reveal about Guatemala’s unique land, its people and their history...|$|R
60|$|He {{began to}} think over {{his plans for the}} morrow. He {{imagined}} the scene with Madam Gadow, and then his departure to find bachelor lodgings once more. He debated in what direction he should go to get, suitable lodgings. Possible difficulties with his luggage, possible annoyances of the search <b>loomed</b> gigantic. He <b>felt</b> greatly irritated at these minor difficulties. He wondered if Ethel also was packing. What particularly would she do? He listened, but he could hear nothing. She was very still. She was really very still! What could she be doing? He forgot the bothers of the morrow in this new interest. Presently he rose very softly and listened. Then he sat down again impatiently. He tried to dismiss his curiosity about the silence by recapitulating the story of his wrongs.|$|R
40|$|Site Construction' is Jenny Dunseath’s {{large-scale}} solo exhibition. Across the space, self-supporting {{sections of}} steel piping reach above {{and over the}} gallery’s I-beams. Cylindrical columns of jilted orientation litter the space; some stack high above us and some lay vacantly, adorned with brightly coloured nylon jackets. Four monitors, sat on the gallery’s mezzanine, continually loop frantic displays of revolving cement mixers and digital animations. Dunseath has presented us with a scenario comprised of seemingly impaired approximations of apparatus. Sharply rendered but dumb, these suggestions of semi-industrial equipment, lead us toward a negotiation {{of the relationship between}} architecture and sculpture. Utilitarian materials operate ambiguously as their original behavioural traits are reduced to mere aesthetic. Unlike her earlier works, in which Dunseath knowingly exposes evidence of the production process,Site Construction employs an aesthetic that deliberately detaches the artist. Through the employment of raw, unadulterated material, these new works pose as pre-production stock, provoking notions of construction and development whilst allowing for the implied potential of the materials to permeate. This in turn evokes a sense of potential activity that lingers, leading an audience into a state of expectancy. The effect of the elevated monitors is that of a foreman - their presence is <b>felt,</b> <b>looming</b> authoritatively above the rest of the work and, more importantly, the audience. They display working machinery and abstract geometric collages, all revolving with entrancing effect. The animations, garish and constant, mimic broadcasting logos and continue as if in endless introduction. Through directly referencing notions of production, both anticipated and active, these films provide the show with a carefully placed conceptual heading...|$|R
60|$|What {{manner of}} men they were {{it is hard}} to say, so few details are left to us. But we may {{conceive}} them as a tall, fair-haired people, clothed in shirts and smocks of embroidered linen, and gaiters cross-strapped with hide; their arms and necks encircled with gold and silver rings; the warriors, at least of the upper class, well horsed, and armed with lance and heavy sword, with chain-mail, and helmets surmounted with plumes, horns, towers, dragons, boars, and the other strange devices which are still seen on the crests of German nobles. This much we can guess; for in this way their ancestors, or at least relations, the War-Geats, appear clothed in the grand old song of Beowulf. Their land must have been tilled principally by slaves, usually captives taken in war: but the noble mystery of the forge, where arms and ornaments were made, was an honourable craft for men of rank; and their ladies, as in the middle age, prided themselves on their skill with the <b>needle</b> and the <b>loom.</b> Their language has been happily preserved to us in Ulfilas' Translation of the Scriptures. For these Goths, the greater number of them at least, were by this time Christians, or very nearly such. Good Bishop Ulfilas, brought up a Christian and consecrated by order of Constantine the Great, had been labouring for years to convert his adopted countrymen from the worship of Thor and Woden. He had translated the Bible for them, and had constructed a Gothic alphabet for that purpose. He had omitted, however (prudently as he considered) the books of Kings, with their histories of the Jewish wars. The Goths, he held, were only too fond of fighting already, and 'needed in that matter the bit, rather than the spur.' He had now a large number of converts, some of whom had even endured persecution from their heathen brethren. Athanaric, 'judge,' or alderman of the Thervings, had sent through the camp--so runs the story--the waggon which bore the idol of Woden, and had burnt, with their tents and their families, those who refused to worship.|$|R
6000|$|Over the sea, past Crete, on the Syrian {{shore to}} the southward, Dwells in the well-tilled lowland a dark-haired AEthiop people, Skilful with <b>needle</b> and <b>loom,</b> {{and the arts}} of the dyer and carver, Skilful, but feeble of heart; for they know not the lords of Olympus, Lovers of men; neither broad-browed Zeus, nor Pallas Athene, Teacher of wisdom to heroes, bestower of might in the battle; Share not the cunning of Hermes, nor list to the songs of Apollo. Fearing {{the stars of the}} sky, and the roll of the blue salt water, Fearing all things that have life in the womb of the seas and the livers, Eating no fish to this day, nor {{ploughing}} the main, like the Phoenics, Manful with black-beaked ships, they abide in a sorrowful region, Vexed with the earthquake, and flame, and the sea-floods, scourge of Poseidon. [...] Whelming the dwellings of men, and the toils of the slow-footed oxen, Drowning the barley and flax, and the hard-earned gold of the harvest, Up to the hillside vines, and the pastures skirting the woodland, Inland the floods came yearly; and after the waters a monster, Bred of the slime, like the worms which are bred from the slime of the Nile- bank, Shapeless, a terror to see; and by night it swam out to the seaward, Daily returning to feed with the dawn, and devoured of the fairest, Cattle, and children, and maids, till the terrified people fled inland. [...] Fasting in sackcloth and ashes they came, both the king and his people, Came to the mountain of oaks, to the house of the terrible sea-gods, Hard by the gulf in the rocks, where of old the world-wide deluge Sank to the inner abyss; and the lake where the fish of the goddess, Holy, undying, abide; whom the priests feed daily with dainties. There to the mystical fish, high-throned in her chamber of cedar, Burnt they the fat of the flock; till the flame shone far to the seaward. Three days fasting they prayed; but the fourth day the priests of the goddess, Cunning in spells, cast lots, to discover the crime of the people. All day long they cast, till the house of the monarch was taken, Cepheus, king of the land; and the faces of all gathered blackness. Then once more they cast; and Cassiopoeia was taken, Deep-bosomed wife of the king, whom oft far-seeing Apollo Watched well-pleased from the welkin, the fairest of AEthiop women: Fairest, save only her daughter; for down to the ankle her tresses Rolled, blue-black as the night, ambrosial, joy to beholders. Awful and fair she arose, most like in her coming to Here, Queen before whom the Immortals arise, as she comes on Olympus, Out of the chamber of gold, which her son Hephaestos has wrought her. Such in her stature and eyes, and the broad white light of her forehead. Stately she came from her place, and she spoke {{in the midst of the}} people. [...] 'Pure are my hands from blood: most pure this heart in my bosom. Yet one fault I remember this day; one word have I spoken; Rashly I spoke on the shore, and I dread lest the sea should have heard it. Watching my child at her bath, as she plunged in the joy of her girlhood, Fairer I called her in pride than Atergati, queen of the ocean. Judge ye if this be my sin, for I know none other.' She ended; Wrapping her head in her mantle she stood, and the people were silent. [...] Answered the dark-browed priests, 'No word, once spoken, returneth, Even if uttered unwitting. Shall gods excuse our rashness? That which is done, that abides; and the wrath of the sea is against us; Hers, and the wrath of her brother, the Sun-god, lord of the sheepfolds. Fairer than her hast thou boasted thy daughter? Ah folly! for hateful, Hateful are they to the gods, whoso, impious, liken a mortal, Fair though he be, to their glory; and hateful is that which is likened, Grieving the eyes of their pride, and abominate, doomed to their anger. What shall be likened to gods? The unknown, who deep in the darkness Ever abide, twyformed, many-handed, terrible, shapeless. Woe to the queen; for the land is defiled, and the people accursed. Take thou her therefore by night, thou ill-starred Cassiopoeia, Take her with us in the night, when the moon sinks low to the westward; Bind her aloft for a victim, a prey for the gorge of the monster, Far on the sea-girt rock, which is washed by the surges for ever; So may the goddess accept her, and so may the land make atonement, Purged by her blood from its sin: so obey thou the doom of the rulers.' [...] Bitter in soul they went out, Cepheus and Cassiopoeia, Bitter in soul; and their hearts whirled round, as the leaves in the eddy. Weak was the queen, and rebelled: but the king, like a shepherd of people, Willed not the land should waste; so he yielded the life of his daughter. [...] Deep in the wane of the night, as the moon sank low to the westward, They by the shade of the cliffs, with the horror of darkness around them, Stole, as ashamed, to a deed which became not the light of the sunshine, Slowly, the priests, and the queen, and the virgin bound in the galley, Slowly they rowed to the rocks: but Cepheus far in the palace Sate in the midst of the hall, on his throne, like a shepherd of people, Choking his woe, dry-eyed, while the slaves wailed loudly around him. They on the sea-girt rock, which is washed by the surges for ever, Set her in silence, the guiltless, aloft with her face to the eastward. Under a crag of the stone, where a ledge sloped down to the water; There they set Andromeden, most beautiful, shaped like a goddess, Lifting her long white arms wide-spread to the walls of the basalt, Chaining them, ruthless, with brass; and they called on the might of the Rulers. [...] 'Mystical fish of the seas, dread Queen whom AEthiops honour, Whelming the land in thy wrath, unavoidable, sharp as the sting-ray, Thou, and thy brother the Sun, brain-smiting, lord of the sheepfold, Scorching the earth all day, and then resting at night in thy bosom, Take ye this one life for many, appeased by the blood of a maiden, Fairest, and born of the fairest, a queen, most priceless of victims.' [...] Thrice they spat as they went by the maid: but her mother delaying Fondled her child to the last, heart-crushed; and the warmth of her weeping Fell on the breast of the maid, as her woe broke forth into wailing. [...] 'Daughter! my daughter! forgive me! Oh curse not the murderess! Curse not! How have I sinned, but in love? Do the gods grudge glory to mothers? Loving I bore thee in vain in the fate-cursed bride-bed of Cepheus, Loving I fed thee and tended, and loving rejoiced in thy beauty, Blessing thy limbs as I bathed them, and blessing thy locks as I combed them; Decking thee, ripening to woman, I blest thee: yet blessing I slew thee! How have I sinned, but in love? Oh swear to me, swear to thy mother, Never to haunt me with curse, as I go to the grave in my sorrow, Childless and lone: may the gods never send me another, to slay it! See, I embrace thy knees--soft knees, where no babe will be fondled-- Swear to me never to curse me, the hapless one, not in the death-pang.' [...] Weeping she clung to the knees of the maid; and the maid low answered-- 'Curse thee! Not in the death-pang!' The heart of the lady was lightened. Slowly she went by the ledge; and the maid was alone in the darkness. [...] Watching the pulse of the oars die down, as her own died with them, Tearless, dumb with amaze she stood, as a storm-stunned nestling Fallen from bough or from eave lies dumb, which the home-going herdsman Fancies a stone, till he catches the light of its terrified eyeball. So through the long long hours the maid stood helpless and hopeless, Wide-eyed, downward gazing in vain at the black blank darkness. Feebly at last she began, while wild thoughts bubbled within her-- 'Guiltless I am: why thus, then? Are gods more ruthless than mortals? Have they no mercy for youth? no love for the souls who have loved them? Even as I loved thee, dread sea, as I played by thy margin, Blessing thy wave as it cooled me, thy wind as it breathed on my forehead, Bowing my head to thy tempest, and opening my heart to thy children, Silvery fish, wreathed shell, and the strange lithe things of the water, Tenderly casting them back, as they gasped on the beach in the sunshine, Home to their mother--in vain! for mine sits childless in anguish! O false sea! false sea! I dreamed what I dreamed of thy goodness; Dreamed of a smile in thy gleam, of a laugh in the plash of thy ripple: False and devouring thou art, and the great world dark and despiteful.' [...] Awed by her own rash words she was still: and her eyes to the seaward Looked for an answer of wrath: far off, in the heart of the darkness, Blight white mists rose slowly; beneath them the wandering ocean Glimmered and glowed to the deepest abyss; and the knees of the maiden Trembled and sunk in her fear, as afar, like a dawn in the midnight, Rose from their seaweed chamber the choir of the mystical sea-maids. Onward toward her they came, and her heart beat loud at their coming, Watching the bliss of the gods, as they wakened the cliffs with their laughter. [...] Onward they came in their joy, and before them the roll of the surges Sank, as the breeze sank dead, into smooth green foam-flecked marble, Awed; and the crags of the cliff, and the pines of the mountain were silent. Onward they came in their joy, and around them the lamps of the sea-nymphs, Myriad fiery globes, swam panting and heaving; and rainbows Crimson and azure and emerald, were broken in star-showers, lighting Far through the wine-dark depths of the crystal, the gardens of Nereus, Coral and sea-fan and tangle, the blooms and the palms of the ocean. [...] Onward they came in their joy, more white than the foam which they scattered, Laughing and singing, and tossing and twining, while eager, the Tritons Blinded with kisses their eyes, unreproved, and above them in worship Hovered the terns, and the seagulls swept past them on silvery pinions Echoing softly their laughter; around them the wantoning dolphins Sighed as they plunged, full of love; and the great sea-horses which bore them Curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of the maidens, Pawing the spray into gems, till a fiery rainfall, unharming, Sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the nymphs, and the coils of the mermen. [...] Onward they went in their joy, bathed round with the fiery coolness, Needing nor sun nor moon, self-lighted, immortal: but others, Pitiful, floated in silence apart; in their bosoms the sea-boys, Slain by the wrath of the seas, swept down by the anger of Nereus; Hapless, whom never again on strand or on quay shall their mothers Welcome with garlands and vows to the temple, but wearily pining Gaze over island and bay for the sails of the sunken; they heedless Sleep in soft bosoms for ever, and dream of the surge and the sea-maids. [...] Onward they passed in their joy; on their brows neither sorrow nor anger; Self-sufficing, as gods, never heeding the woe of the maiden. She would have shrieked for their mercy: but shame made her dumb; and their eyeballs Stared on her careless and still, like the eyes in the house of the idols. Seeing they saw not, and passed, like a dream, on the murmuring ripple. [...] Stunned by the wonder she gazed, wide-eyed, as the glory departed. 'O fair shapes! far fairer than I! Too fair to be ruthless! Gladden mine eyes once more with your splendour, unlike to my fancies; You, then, smiled in the sea-gleam, and laughed in the plash of the ripple. Awful I deemed you and formless; inhuman, monstrous as idols; Lo, when ye came, ye were women, more loving and lovelier, only; Like in all else; and I blest you: why blest ye not me for my worship? Had you no mercy for me, thus guiltless? Ye pitied the sea-boys: Why not me, then, more hapless by far? Does your sight and your knowledge End with the marge of the waves? Is the world which ye dwell in not our world?' ...|$|R
