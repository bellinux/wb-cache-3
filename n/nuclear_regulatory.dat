5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University, the Idaho National Laboratory, and other colleges beginning in 2000. At the time, Oregon State's nuclear department had been developing passive water-circulation techniques for cooling in nuclear plants. The research grant ended in 2003, but {{a group of scientists}} at Oregon State University continued the work. They built a test lab at one-third the actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007, in exchange for a small equity in the company. NuScale was founded that same year. Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum.

5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package.

5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's <b>nuclear</b> <b>regulatory</b> agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner.

The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Regulatory</b> Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

Collected the peripheral detection of <b>nuclear</b> factor-κB, <b>regulatory</b> cells and transforming growth factor beta levels, and compared them between two groups. Results: The percentage of CD 4 +, CD 25 + T cells in the case group was significantly lower than that {{in the control group}} (P   . 05); The levels of TGF - beta and NF - kappa B in the case group were higher than those in the control group, and {{the difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant (P < . 05); The levels of ESR, CRP and RF in the case group were higher than those in the control group (P < . 05). There was a negative correlation between the expression of nuclear factor-κB, transforming growth factor-β and RF level in RA patients by pearson correlation analysis, r = − 0. 652, P < . 05. Conclusion: The expression levels of CD 4 +, CD 25 + T cells in patients with RA are significantly decrease, which has a negative correlation with RA activity index RF, and showed that the pathogenesis of RA is related to the regulation of immune system...|$|R
