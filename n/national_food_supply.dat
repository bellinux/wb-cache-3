40|$|The {{narrowing}} {{of diversity in}} crop species contributing to the world s <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> has been considered a potential threat to food security. However, changes in this diversity have not been quantified globally. We assess trends over the past 50 y in the richness, abundance, and composition of crop species in <b>national</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> worldwide. Over this period, <b>national</b> per capita <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> expanded in total quantities of food calories, protein, fat, and weight, with increased proportions of those quantities sourcing from energy-dense foods. At {{the same time the}} number of measured crop commodities contributing to <b>national</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> increased, the relative contribution of these commodities within these supplies became more even, and the dominance of the most significant commodities decreased. As a consequence, <b>national</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> worldwide became more similar in composition, correlated particularly with an increased supply of a number of globally important cereal and oil crops, and a decline of other cereal, oil, and starchy root species. The increase in homogeneity worldwide portends the establishment of a global standard <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> which is relatively species-rich in regard to measured crops at the national level, but species-poor globally. These changes in <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> heighten interdependence among countries in regard to availability and access to these food sources and the genetic resources supporting their production, and give further urgency to nutrition development priorities aimed at bolstering food security.

Wheat is cultivated in 20 percent of the total cultivated land area and contributes 18.8 percent to the total national cereal production. Per capita wheat consumption has increased from 17.4 kg in 1972 at the time of NWRP establishment to 60 kg in 2007.

We used county crop acreage to evaluate the landscape resistance to transmission—the degree to which host availability limits spread in any given region—for pests or pathogens dependent on each crop. For organisms that can disperse under conditions of lower host availability, maize and soybean are highly connected at a national scale, compared with the more discrete regions of wheat and cotton production. Determining the scales at which connectivity becomes disrupted for organisms with different dispersal abilities may help target rapid-response regions and the development of strategic policies to enhance agricultural landscape heterogeneity...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which, if any, bacteria, especially Salmonella species, are present in and on hens’ eggs. Representative bacterial colonies were confirmed with Gram staining and then identified using the MALDI-TOF Biotyper assay.

Raw hens’ eggs and products containing raw hens’ eggs may contain pathogenic bacteria, thereby exposing a large number of consumers to the risk of contracting food poisoning when undercooked or uncooked hens’ eggs are consumed. Significance: Enterobacteriaceae counts are used as an indicator to evaluate the hygienic quality of food.

40|$|Consumption {{of added}} sugars in Canada is often {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted <b>national</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> (availability) data as actual consumption data.

Such difficulties include estimating waste adjustment factors to determine apparent consumption from food availability data; missing availability data for some sources of added sugars (notably corn sweeteners); and the lack of a comprehensive database of added sugars content in foods. In this article, the available literature and various reports are used to provide the best estimates of added sugars consumption in Canada.

Significant maternal and child health costs result from children's premature weaning onto formula or solid food.

40|$|Although the {{diversification}} of <b>national</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies</b> (DFS) {{is a necessary}} (but not sufficient) condition for the {{diversification of}} diets and for reductions in undernutrition in poor countries, little previous research has analyzed how DFS varies across countries and regions, how rapidly it has changed over time, and what economic, social, and agroecological factors may be driving these observed patterns and trends in DFS. The study addresses those questions through a cross-country analysis. We first review economic theory and evidence on the diversification of production and diets in developing countries, particularly the importance of economic growth and other structural transformation processes, {{as well as the}} scope for agroecological factors to shape consumption outcomes in the presence of market imperfections, such as high transport costs. We then construct and analyze a rich cross-country dataset linking a simple DFS indicator—the share of calories supplied by nonstaple foods—with a wide range of economic, social, infrastructural, and agroecological indicators. Descriptive evidence and regression analyses show that several indicators of structural transformation (economic growth, urbanization, and demographic change) are strong predictors of DFS within countries. However, the results also suggest that time-invariant agroecological factors are significantly associated with DFS, such that some countries have exceptionally low or high DFS relative to their level of economic development. We discuss the implications of these findings for food and nutrition strategies, particularly the challenge of accelerating dietary diversification in the absence of sustained and very rapid economic growth and structural transformation, especially in countries where agroecological conditions additionally hinder access to a more diverse food basket.
