2500|$|The digital EEG {{signal is}} stored {{electronically}} {{and can be}} filtered for display. [...] Typical settings for the high-pass filter and a low-pass filter are 0.5–1Hz and 35–70Hz respectively. The high-pass filter typically filters out slow artifact, such as electrogalvanic signals and movement artifact, whereas the low-pass filter filters out high-frequency artifacts, such as electromyographic signals. An additional <b>notch</b> <b>filter</b> is typically used to remove artifact caused by electrical power lines (60Hz in the United States and 50Hz in many other countries).|$|E
2500|$|A {{feedback}} suppressor detects unwanted audio feedback and suppresses it, typically by automatically inserting a <b>notch</b> <b>filter</b> into the signal {{path of the}} system, which prevents feedback [...] "howls" [...] from occurring. Audio feedback can create unwanted loud, screaming noises which are disruptive to the performance, and which can damage performers' and audience members' ears and speakers. Audio feedback from microphones occurs when a microphone [...] "hears" [...] the sound it is picking up through the monitor speakers or the main speakers. While microphone audio feedback is almost universally regarded as a negative phenomenon, in hard rock and heavy metal music, electric guitarists purposely create guitar feedback to create unique, sustained sounds with their guitar and guitar amplifier. This type of feedback is sought out by guitarists, so the sound engineer does not try to prevent it.|$|E

The disturbing signal is suppressed using an optimal <b>notch</b> FIR <b>filter</b> with tunable <b>notch</b> frequency. The tuning of the filter preserves its selectivity, most importantly the specified attenuation at the notch frequency. One example and two Matlab functions demonstrate the performance, robustness and usefulness of the proposed procedure for the design and tuning of optimal <b>notch</b> FIR <b>filters</b> suitable in the real time <b>notch</b> <b>filtering...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A high-pass (low-cut) and/or {{low-pass}} (high-cut) filter {{may also}} be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low frequency sound signals (termed infrasonic, or subsonic, a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can be hard on the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. [...] If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and low-pass filters function as end-cut filters. [...] A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or <b>notch</b> <b>filter</b> which includes a microprocessor to detect the onset of [...] feedback [...] "howls" [...] and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.|$|E

40|$|In this letter, the {{performance}} of multicarrier code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems is studied {{in the presence of}} narrowband interference for future ultra-wideband (UWB) communications. A Nakagami fading channel is assumed, and <b>notch</b> <b>filters</b> along with diversity techniques are used in the multicarrier CDMA receiver. A complete performance analysis of error probability is given. It is shown that when the number of subcarriers jammed by narrowband interference is small, the multicarrier receiver without <b>notch</b> <b>filters</b> can work well, due to the gain of frequency diversity from nonjammed subcarriers. On the other hand, when the number of subcarriers jammed by the narrowband interference is large, using <b>notch</b> <b>filters</b> can improve the multicarrier system performance significantly. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive <b>notch</b> <b>filters</b> {{have been}} the focus of intense {{research}} for more than three decades. Low computational requirements and good performance make them attractive for tracking frequency modulated signals. Despite the extensive literature on adaptive <b>notch</b> <b>filters,</b> algorithm extensions and new models for describing the dynamics of the notch frequency continue to be proposed. In this paper, the equivalence between adaptive <b>notch</b> <b>filters</b> using a Plain Gradient (PG) algorithm and Frequency Lock Loops (FLLs) with exponential filtering is established. FLL theory is then used to analyse the noise performance and signal tracking capabilities of adaptive <b>notch</b> <b>filters.</b> A linear model describing the dynamics of the filter adaptation process is derived and the concepts of loop and Doppler bandwidths are introduced. Criteria based on the loop and Doppler bandwidths are suggested to set the PG adaptation step. Finally, algorithm extensions based on the FLL theory are suggested. Theoretical results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations which show the validity of the analysis performed. JRC. G. 5 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R

In order to remove those {{deceptive}} targets, one method based on signal jittering, data fusion and fake target <b>notch</b> <b>filtering</b> is proposed in this paper. Multiple orthogonal binary phase codes {{are used as}} transmitted signals, before each time of transmission each transmitter will choose one signal from all the orthogonal codes, images of echoes {{of all kinds of}} codes are detected with constant false alarm rate.

5000|$|Analog {{technology}} allowed cable {{providers to}} offer standardized subscription packages using low-pass <b>filters</b> and <b>notch</b> <b>filters.</b> A low-pass filter lets lower frequency signals pass while removing higher frequency signals. Using such filtering, the cable provider offered [...] "economy basic" [...] subscriptions (local channels only- these {{appear at the}} lowest frequency signals, denoted by the lowest channel numbers) and [...] "basic" [...] subscriptions (local channels plus a handful of national channels with frequencies just higher than the local stations). <b>Notch</b> <b>filters</b> were used to filter out a [...] "notch" [...] of channels from an analog cable signal (for example, channels 45-50 could be [...] "notched" [...] out and the subscriber still receives channels below 45 and above 50).

40|$|We {{examined}} {{contrast sensitivity}} and suprathreshold apparent contrast with natural images. The spatialfrequency components within single octaves {{of the images}} were removed (<b>notch</b> <b>filtered),</b> their phases were randomized, or the polarity of the images was inverted. Of Michelson contrast, root-mean-square (RMS) contrast, and band-limited contrast, RMS contrast was the best index of detectability. Negative images had lower apparent contrast than their positives. Contrast detection thresholds showed spatial-frequency-dependent elevation following both <b>notch</b> <b>filtering</b> and phase randomization. The peak of the spatial-frequency tuning function was approximately 0. 5 – 2 cycles per degree (c/deg). Suprathreshold contrast matching functions also showed spatial-frequency-dependent contrast loss for both notch-filtered and phase-randomized images. The peak of the spatial-frequency tuning function was approximately 1 – 3 c/deg. There was no detectable difference between the effects of phase randomization and <b>notch</b> <b>filtering</b> on contrast sensitivity. We argue that these observations are consistent with changes in the activity within spatial-frequency channels caused by the higher-order phase structure of natural images {{that is responsible for}} the presence of edges and specularities...|$|R

Since decision delay is acceptable in many practical applications, the proposed bias/delay trade-off is an attractive alternative to the classical bias/variance compromise. 1...|$|R
