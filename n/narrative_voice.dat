There is also a suggestion of a communal <b>narrative</b> <b>voice,</b> as Ngugi draws on the mythic past of Kenya to place the novel in a wider context than simply the colonial.

25|$|The Scottish {{literary}} Renaissance was {{an attempt}} to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national literature. In its early stages the movement was mainly focused on poetry, but increasingly concentrated on the novel, particularly after the 1930s when its major figure Hugh MacDiarmid was living in isolation in Shetland and its leadership moved to novelist Neil Gunn (1891–1973). Gunn's novels, beginning with The Grey Coast (1926), and including Highland River (1937) and The Green Isle of the Great Deep (1943), were largely written in English and not the Scots preferred by MacDiarmid, focused on the Highlands of his birth and were notable for their narrative experimentation. Other major figures associated with the movement include George Blake (b. 1922), A. J. Cronin (1896–1981), Eric Linklater (1899–1974) and Lewis Grassic Gibbon (1901–35). There were also a large number of female authors associated with the movement, who demonstrated a growing feminine consciousness. They included Catherine Carswell (1879–1946), Willa Muir (1890–1970), Nan Shepherd (1893–1981) and most prolifically Naomi Mitchison (1897–1999). All were born within a fifteen-year period and, although they cannot be described as members of a single school, they all pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. Physician A. J. Cronin is now often seen as sentimental, but his early work, particularly his first novel Hatter's Castle (1931) and his most successful The Citadel (1937) were a deliberate reaction against the Kailyard tradition, exposing the hardships and vicissitudes of the lives of ordinary people, He was the most translated Scottish author in the twentieth century. George Blake pioneered the exploration of the experiences of the working class in his major works such as The Shipbuilders (1935). Eric Linklater produced comedies of the absurd including Juan in America (1931) dealing with prohibition America, and a critique of modern war in Private Angelo (1946). Lewis Grassic Gibbon, the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell, produced {{one of the most important}} realisations of the ideas of the Scottish Renaissance in his trilogy A Scots Quair (Sunset Song, 1932, Cloud Howe, 1933 and Grey Granite, 1934), which mixed different Scots dialects with the <b>narrative</b> <b>voice.</b> Other works that investigated the working class included James Barke's (1905–58), Major Operation (1936) and The Land of the Leal (1939) and J.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to study the {{multitude}} of <b>narrative</b> <b>voices</b> {{and how they are}} used describing the evolution in the diasporic feminine identity in How the García Girls Lost Their Accents by Julia Alvarez. The study aims to determine the difficulties in developing and emerging into the North American society with a Dominican culture, including a fusion of cults and a different linguistic background. The first objective has been to identify the different constellations of the feminine voices and then to see how they are developed along the plot. Theories about the narrative discourse in line with Genette and Calatrava have been used as well as the conception about identity according to Hall. Although the purpose has been reached, by the fulfilling and identifying of the main feminine <b>narrative</b> <b>voices</b> in the novel, a possible and satisfying investigation for the future would be including the missing masculine <b>narrative</b> <b>voices...</b>|$|R

Eugenides gave his protagonist a mostly male outlook, justifying his treatment with the reasoning that Cal or Callie {{was a man in}} terms of appearance, sexual desires, and the brain.

500|$|The Hobbit takes {{cues from}} {{narrative}} models of children's literature, {{as shown by}} its omniscient narrator and characters that young children can relate to, such as the small, food-obsessed, and morally ambiguous Bilbo. The text emphasizes the relationship between time and narrative progress and it openly distinguishes [...] "safe" [...] from [...] "dangerous" [...] in its geography. Both are key elements of works intended for children, as is the [...] "home-away-home" [...] (or there and back again) plot structure typical of the Bildungsroman. While Tolkien later claimed to dislike the aspect of the <b>narrative</b> <b>voice</b> addressing the reader directly, the <b>narrative</b> <b>voice</b> contributes significantly {{to the success of}} the novel. Emer O'Sullivan, in her Comparative Children's Literature, notes The Hobbit as one of a handful of children's books that has been accepted into mainstream literature, alongside Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World (1991) and J.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to analyze the {{representation}} of the mythic timelessness and the religious subversion in the novel Pedro Páramo (1953) by the Mexican writer Juan Rulfo. The novel is analyzed from a narratological perspective based on the concept of focalization proposed by the French theoretician Gérard Genette. According to Genette it is possible to identify different levels of focalization depending on the position of the <b>narrative</b> <b>voices.</b> The key question in this investigation is if any salvation is possible in the universe of Pedro Páramo and how the mythic timelessness and the religious subversion are represented in the textual intentionality through the <b>narrative</b> <b>voices.</b> The main conclusion {{is that there is no}} possible salvation in the fictional universe of Pedro Páramo. The collective sin is so vast that the intermediation between God and the inhabitants of Comala does not work anymore. Thus, the only possible ”salvation” consists in the separation of the soul from the body the people of Comala experience after death. In Pedro Páramo the dead body is liberated from remorses, but - contrary to the Catholic concepts - becomes a conscious materia sentenced to remember eternally.

500|$|Julie Barak {{emphasizes}} {{the significance of}} [...] "one other stylistic idiosyncrasy {{of the work that}} adds to the sophistication of [...] artistry" [...] as there is a marked transition from third to first person narration for each girl in the last section of the novel. Luis describes this shift as a pivotal moment after which the events assume a chronological order and time accelerates, illuminating life in such a manner that it suddenly makes sense. The manner in which Alvarez alters the <b>narrative</b> <b>voice</b> is a stylistic expression {{of the extent to which}} each one of the girls [...] "wants to be in control of her own version of her history... These first person narratives in the last section become, in effect, a defense offered by each girl in her own words, an explanation of who they have become in the present, of why they 'turned out' the way they have." [...] The transition of <b>narrative</b> <b>voice</b> [...] "changes the dynamic of the reader-character-author triad" [...] and allows for the reader, who has been kept at a distance by the third person narrator, to relive [...] "the memory with the character, closely connected to her, developing a strong empathy with a unified character".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the novel, the omniscient <b>narrative</b> <b>voice,</b> {{alongside}} {{a series of}} footnotes, reflect with an objective tone {{on a number of}} plot devices: the author's difficulty controlling the characters; the conventions that are expected of a [...] "Victorian novel"; and, analyses of differences in 19th-century customs and class.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{challenges}} of rapid social change and growing cultural hybridisation, psychologists must find new ways to study personality processes unconstrained by older Enlightenment models that promote self-contained individualism. This research aims to contribute to that challenge. In trying {{to come to terms with}} issues surrounding the meaning of 'self' and 'identity' in a postmodern landscape, I have developed and refined a method for mapping the multiplicity of the self. The Personality Web protocol combines structured interviewing and qualitative analyses with multidimensional scaling statistical methods. The goal is to map the history and development of an individual's life-world from the viewpoint of alternative <b>narrative</b> <b>voices</b> which constitute a polypsychic self. The method of analysis is described here with reference to the case study of Sean, a former addict. Sean's story provides a powerful illustration of opposing <b>narrative</b> <b>voices</b> in the self. It is argued that dialogical oppositions in the self are defined by moral concerns, and by a matrix of social, political and cultural positioning...|$|R
