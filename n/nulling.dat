5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, <b>nulling</b> Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of <b>nulling.</b> [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] <b>Nulling</b> is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E
2500|$|The School of Physics {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the development of radio astronomy in particular: Ruby Payne-Scott conducted the first interferometric observations in radio astronomy with the sea-cliff interferometer at Dover Heights; alumnus Ron Bracewell proposed the <b>nulling</b> interferometer to image extrasolar planets, made contributions to the theory of the Fourier Transform and X-ray tomography, and proposed the idea of the Bracewell probe in SETI; and alumnus Bernard Mills led the construction of the Mills Cross Telescope and Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope in the ACT. School of Physics alumnus and Crafoord Laureate Edwin Salpeter discovered the form of the initial mass function of stars, the importance of beryllium-8 in stellar nuclear fusion, and independently with Yakov Zel'dovich proposed the black hole accretion disk model of active galactic nuclei. The Apollo 14 Mission Scientist Philip K. Chapman and the first Australian-born astronaut to fly in space Paul Scully-Power are both alumni of the University.

50|$|The <b>NUL</b> {{termination}} {{has historically}} created security problems. A <b>NUL</b> byte {{inserted into the}} middle of a string will truncate it unexpectedly. A common bug was to not allocate the additional space for the <b>NUL,</b> so it was written over adjacent memory. Another was to not write the <b>NUL</b> at all, which was often not detected during testing because a <b>NUL</b> was already there by chance from previous use of the same block of memory. Due to the expense of finding the length, many programs did not bother before copying a string to a fixed-size buffer, causing a buffer overflow if it was too long.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} a C string is found by searching for the (first) <b>NUL</b> byte. This can be slow as it takes O(n) (linear time) {{with respect to the}} string length. It also means that a <b>NUL</b> cannot be inside the string, as the only <b>NUL</b> is the one marking the end.|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempted}} to ascertain what {{knowledge and skills}} are required for <b>NUL</b> librarians to meet the information needs of humanities undergraduate students in the digital era academic library environment.

The study was supported by organizational learning theory. It employed a convergent parallel mixed methods approach within a pragmativist paradigm for the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data to respond to the research questions guiding the study. A case study design was adopted in identifying humanities undergraduate students' information needs and concurrently ascertaining knowledge and skills requirements of <b>NUL</b> librarians. The target population included <b>NUL</b> librarians and humanities undergraduate students. Non-probability purposive sampling was employed to collect qualitative data (from the librarians) whist probability stratified random sampling was adopted to obtain quantitative data (from humanities undergraduate students). Data were collected via face-to-face semi-structured interviews with librarians and a structured questionnaire for students. In concluding, the study presents, inter alia, a blend of required disciplinary, generic and personal competencies for <b>NUL</b> librarians to meet the library related information needs of humanities undergraduate students in the current digital age. It recommends, inter alia, the adoption of effective organizational learning to build on <b>NUL</b> librarian's existing knowledge and skills so that they may more easily adapt to rapidly evolving technology and more fully meet the information needs of humanities undergraduate students...|$|R
