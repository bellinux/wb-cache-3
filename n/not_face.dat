5|$|Although their {{suspected}} {{white supremacist}} affiliations led federal authorities to investigate possible ties {{to a larger}} group, authorities later downplayed the trio as drug addicts who had little chance of actually carrying out the plot.

5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would <b>not</b> <b>face</b> the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{played two}} matches, with three points awarded for a win, one {{point for a}} draw and none for a loss. An {{additional}} point is awarded for every goal scored. Arsenal did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> RB Leipzig, and Benfica did not play against Sevilla. On {{the first day of}} the Emirates Cup, Sevilla defeated RB Leipzig by a single goal, while Arsenal came from behind to beat Benfica 5–2. Although Sevilla were victorious against Arsenal and took maximum points, the hosts won the competition due to scoring more goals over the two days. RB Leipzig beat Benfica by two goals to finish in third place.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Xingzong died in 1055. His eldest son, Yelü Hongji (who {{would later}} be known by the name Emperor Daozong of Liao), assumed the throne having already gained {{experience}} in governing while his father was alive. Unlike his father, Emperor Daozong did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> a succession crisis. While both Ji Dian and Zhong Yuan remained alive, and both had the political influence {{to interfere with the}} succession process, neither did.|$|E

5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do <b>not</b> <b>face</b> many doubts or unknown details. Most of the {{information}} was properly recorded {{at the time and}} was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events, rather than in the accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Emirates Cup {{took place}} on 28 July and 29 July 2007 and was well {{attended}} with over 110,000 people filling the stadium across the two-day tournament. Each club played two sides; Valencia and Arsenal did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> each other, and Inter did not play against Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal won the first tournament, having beaten their French opponents 2–1 and defeated Inter by the same scoreline, courtesy of a late Robin van Persie strike. The following year Hamburg made an appearance alongside Real Madrid and Juventus, and won the tournament as they finished two points clear of second-place Real.|$|E
5|$|When Operation Bagration {{commenced}} in the Vitebsk {{region on}} 22 June 1944, {{it was decided}} that female snipers would be withdrawn. They voluntarily continued to support the advancing infantry anyway, and despite the Soviet policy of sparing snipers, Shanina asked to be sent to the front line. Although her request was refused, she went anyway. Shanina was later sanctioned for going to the front line without permission, but did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> a court martial. She wanted to be attached to a battalion or a reconnaissance company, turning to the commander of the 5th Army, Nikolai Krylov. Shanina also wrote twice to Joseph Stalin with the same request.|$|E

5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does <b>not</b> <b>face</b> any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} {{that a strong}} conservative would run in the 1980 Republican primary, Mathias did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> any major opposition for his seat. He easily won his party's nomination, and was re-elected by a substantial margin in November. His Democratic counterpart in the election, Edward T. Conroy, positioned himself as more conservative than Mathias. Conroy also made national defense the primary issue of his campaign, where he accused Mathias of being weak. Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion in defense spending during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland Republican to win election to a third Senate term, and also the only Republican to win the city of Baltimore up to that point. He also secured support from several precincts of Baltimore's Democratic political machine, and several labor unions.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do <b>not</b> <b>face</b> fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E

5|$|Owen Hart {{challenged}} Bret Hart to a match after Survivor Series, but Bret {{refused to}} fight his brother. The two reunited to face The Quebecers for the Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury during the match, which forced the referee {{to stop the}} match. Owen blamed Bret for the loss and attacked him after the match. They faced each other at WrestleMania X, where Owen defeated Bret. The rivalry continued, however, and the brothers feuded throughout 1994 and into 1995. Bret's feud with Lawler remained, but the two did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> each other again until In Your House 1 in May 1995. The feud was reignited at that time, and they feuded at several pay-per-view events in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Committee {{also played}} an {{important}} political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium {{from being able to}} use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to the passive resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> major food riots or other disruption that might have arisen if the Germans had had to feed the population of the occupied territories. The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{army had}} taken up a {{position}} near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, the Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos River, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The Greek line, which was about 2.5 miles in length, was thus secure on both flanks. Moreover, the Greek line seems to have slanted north-eastwards across the plain in between, so that it did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> the direction of Macedonian advance full-square. This prevented Philip from attempting to concentrate his force on the Greek right wing, since the advanced position of the Greek left wing would then threaten Philip's right. Although Philip could attempt to concentrate his force against the Greek left, the troops there occupied high ground, and any attack would be difficult. Since the Greeks could remain on the defensive, having only to prevent Philip's advance, their position was therefore strategically and tactically very strong.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{follows a}} point scoring system {{much like the}} Amsterdam Tournament, whereby each team plays two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. An additional point is awarded for every goal scored. Arsenal did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> Valencia, and Inter did not play against Paris Saint-Germain. On {{the first day of}} the Emirates Cup, Valencia beat Inter Milan by two goals, while Arsenal defeated Paris Saint-Germain 2–1. Valencia's loss to Paris Saint-Germain on day two meant Arsenal needed to beat Inter Milan in order to finish top of the group. They went a goal behind in the second half, but goals from Alexander Hleb and Robin van Persie secured the cup win. The tournament was well attended with over 110,000 filling the Emirates Stadium across the two-day tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments, and Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will <b>not</b> <b>face</b> any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E
5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did <b>not</b> <b>face</b> any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E
50|$|Once again {{a number}} of aldermen who had <b>not</b> <b>faced</b> the {{electorate}} were elected. C.M. Williams and J.T. Morgan were elected aldermen for a third term (although the latter had <b>not</b> <b>faced</b> the electorate since 1889) and T.H.R. Hughes and James James for a second term. James James had been elected, from outside the Council,to an aldermanic vacancy in 1895 and so had never faced an election. David Lloyd, previously an alderman from 1889 until 1892 was elected for a second term. The other four aldermen were new appointments, including one Conservative, Colonel J.R. Howell.|$|R

The other five aldermen were new appointments, including Thomas Morris who had not contested the election. Peter Jones (an alderman since 1889 although he had always sought re-election) and J.M. Howell (an alderman since 1898) were two prominent figures who were re-elected as councillors but not as aldermen.|$|R
