25|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} the risk of developing panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and panic attacks; smoking started in adolescence or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder. While the mechanism of how smoking increases panic attacks is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to panic attacks by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling short of breath). These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of panic attacks, as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high levels of anxiety, which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to panic attacks, and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder. Nicotine, a stimulant, could contribute to panic attacks. However, <b>nicotine</b> <b>withdrawal</b> may also cause significant anxiety which could contribute to panic attacks.|$|E
30|$|Athletes’ {{beliefs are}} that {{consumption}} of nicotine/smokeless tobacco proves ergogenic by preventing xerostomia [6], weight control [2], improving reaction time and concentration [13], helping relaxation and desirable arousal-attention [8].

The results are noteworthy as included studies were not confounded by <b>nicotine’s</b> <b>withdrawal</b> effects, lack of a placebo control, patient group deficit or elderly decline in cognition and therefore likely represent true performance enhancement. However, {{there are reports that}} a dose–response relationship exists whereby lower doses prove nootropic whilst higher doses do not [25, 26], this is perhaps due to the known pharmacological and physiological action of low-dose nicotine as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant whilst at high doses, a depressant or relaxant effect occurs [18, 28].|$|R

25|$|A growing {{literature}} is demonstrating {{the importance of}} emotion regulation {{in the treatment of}} substance abuse. Considering that nicotine and other psychoactive substances such as cocaine activate similar psychopharmacological pathways, an emotion regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array of substance abuse. Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on negative reinforcement as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the undesirable effects of <b>nicotine</b> <b>withdrawal</b> or other negative moods. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance abuse, including the treatment of poly-substance abuse and cigarette smoking. Mindfulness programs that encourage patients to be aware of their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts, appear to prevent impulsive/compulsive responses. Research also indicates that mindfulness programs can reduce the consumption of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes and opiates.|$|E

40|$|Tobacco {{addiction}} {{is a complex}} form of dependence process that leads high relapse rates in people seeking to stop smoking. Nicotine elicits its primary effects on neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs), alters brain reward systems, and induces long-term changes during chronic <b>nicotine</b> use and <b>withdrawal.</b> We analysed the effects of chronic <b>nicotine</b> treatment and <b>withdrawal</b> on the mesocorticolimbic pathway (a brain reward circuit in which addictive drugs induce widespread adaptations) by analysing the expression of nAChRs in the midbrain, striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice receiving intravenous infusions of nicotine (4 mg/kg/h) or saline (control) for 14 days and mice sacrified two hours, and one, four and 14 days after treatment withdrawal. We biochemically fractionated whole tissue homogenates {{in order to obtain}} crude synaptosomal membranes. Western blotting analyses of these membrane fractions, ligand binding and immunoprecipitation studies, showed that chronic nicotine up-regulates heteromeric β 2 ∗nAChRs in all three mesocorticolimbic areas, and that these receptors are rapidly removed from synapses upon the cessation of nicotine treatment. The extent of nicotine-induced nAChR up-regulation, and the time course of its reversal were comparable in all three areas. We also analysed the expression of glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs) and scaffold proteins, and found that it was altered in an area-specific manner during <b>nicotine</b> exposure and <b>withdrawal.</b> As the functional properties of GluRs are determined by their subunit composition, the observed changes in subunit expression may indicate alterations in the excitability of mesocorticolimbic circuitry, and this may underlie the long-term biochemical and behavioural effects of nicotine dependence...|$|R
50|$|Nicotine, a key {{ingredient}} in e-liquids, {{is a highly}} addictive substance, on a level comparable to heroin and cocaine. Nicotine stimulates regions of the cortex associated with reward, pleasure and reducing anxiety. When <b>nicotine</b> intake stops, <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms include cravings for nicotine, anger/irritability, anxiety, depression, impatience, trouble sleeping, restlessness, hunger or weight gain, and difficulty concentrating. It {{is not clear whether}} e-cigarette use will decrease or increase overall nicotine addiction, but the nicotine content in e-cigarettes is adequate to cause or sustain nicotine dependence.|$|R
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of <b>nicotine</b> cravings and <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|R
50|$|Tobacco {{contains}} nicotine. Smoking cigarettes {{can lead}} to nicotine addiction. The addiction begins when nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid.

40|$|Nicotine {{influences}} cognition and behavior, but {{the mechanisms}} by which these effects occur are unclear. By using positron emission tomography, we measured cognitive activation (increases in relative regional cerebral blood flow) during a working memory task [2 -back task (2 BT) ] in 11 abstinent smokers and 11 ex-smokers. Assays were performed both after administration of placebo gum and 4 -mg nicotine gum. Performance on the 2 BT did not differ between groups in either condition, and the pattern of brain activation by the 2 BT was consistent with reports in the literature. However, in the placebo condition, activation in ex-smokers predominated in the left hemisphere, whereas in smokers, it occurred in the right hemisphere. When nicotine was administered, activation was reduced in smokers but enhanced in ex-smokers.

40|$|Causation by {{omission}} is instantiated when {{an effect}} occurs from an absence, as in The absence of <b>nicotine</b> causes <b>withdrawal</b> or Not watering the plant {{caused it to}} wilt. The phenomenon has been viewed as an insurmountable problem for process theories of causation, which specify causation in terms of conserved quantities, like force, but not for theories that specify causation in terms of statistical or counterfactual dependencies. A new account of causation challenges these assumptions. According to the force theory, absences are causal when the removal of a force leads to an effect. Evidence {{in support of this}} account was found in 3 experiments in which people classified animations of complex causal chains involving force removal, as well as chains involving virtual forces, that is, forces that were anticipated but never realized. In a 4 th experiment, the force theory’s ability to predict synonymy relationships between different types of causal expressions provided further evidence for this theory over dependency theories. The findings show not only how causation by omission can be grounded in the physical world but also why only certain absences, among the potentially infinite number of absences, are causal...|$|R

50|$|<b>Nicotine</b> <b>withdrawal</b> is {{the effect}} that nicotine-dependent {{individuals}} experience after they discontinue or decrease nicotine use. Nicotine is an addictive substance found most commonly in tobacco and tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, snus, snuff, and most e-cigarettes. Withdrawal is the body’s reaction to not having the nicotine it had become accustomed to. Withdrawal is most common and intense in cigarette smokers and intermediate in smokeless users. The symptoms of <b>nicotine</b> <b>withdrawal</b> usually appear 2-3 hours after last intake of nicotine and peak in 2-3 days. In a minority of smokers, cravings may last for years. <b>Nicotine</b> <b>withdrawal</b> causes few physical signs and is not life-threatening but associated cravings can be as severe as withdrawal from other drugs.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the changes in {{mechanical}} withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal with-drawal latency (TWL) in a rat model of incisional pain with <b>nicotine</b> dependence and <b>withdrawal.</b> Twelve Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control and a withdrawal group, with 6 rats per group. In the control group, the rats were raised in normal conditions for 7 days without any treatment. A model of plantar incisional pain was established in the right lower extremity and changes in the plantar MWT and TWL of the healthy and operative sides were observed for 7 successive days. In the withdrawal group, the rats were raised in normal conditions and treated with a subcutaneous injection of pure nicotine (3 mg/kg), 3 times each day for 7 days. The model of plantar incisional pain in the right lower extremity was established, and changes in bilateral plantar MWT and TWL were observed for 7 days. The operative side plantar MWT and TWL in the withdrawal group were significantly lower than those in the control group on postoperative days 1 - 7, respectively (P< 0. 05). Compared with the healthy side in the control group, the healthy plantar MWT was significantly reduced on postoperative days 1 - 7 (P< 0. 05) and TWL was significantly decreased in postoperative days 1 - 6 (P< 0. 05) in the withdrawal group.

40|$|Introduction: The {{ability of}} nicotine, the primary psychoactive {{substance}} in tobacco smoke, to regulate appetite and body weight {{is one of}} the factors cited by smokers that prevents them from quitting and is the primary reason for smoking initiation in teenage girls.

Discussion: We will briefly describe the primary anatomical and functional features of the input, output, and central integration structures of the neuroendocrine systems that regulate energy homeostasis. Then, we will describe the nAChR subtypes expressed in these structures in mammals to identify the possible molecular targets for nicotine.

40|$|Rationale Electronic {{cigarettes}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular among smokers worldwide. Commonly reported reasons for use include the following: to quit smoking, to avoid relapse, to reduce urge to smoke, or as a perceived lower-risk alternative to smoking. Few studies, however, have explored whether electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) deliver measurable levels of nicotine to the blood. Objective This study aims to explore in experienced users the effect of using an 18 -mg/ml nicotine first-generation e-cigarette on blood <b>nicotine,</b> tobacco <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, and urge to smoke. Methods Fourteen regular e-cigarette users (three females), who are abstinent from smoking and e-cigarette use for 12 h, each completed a 2. 5 h testing session. Blood was sampled, and questionnaires were completed (tobacco-related withdrawal symptoms, urge to smoke, positive and negative subjective effects) at four stages: baseline, 10 puffs, 60 min of ad lib use and a 60 -min rest period. Results Complete sets of blood were obtained from seven participants. Plasma nicotine concentration rose significantly from a mean of 0. 74 ng/ml at baseline to 6. 77 ng/ml 10 min after 10 puffs, reaching a mean maximum of 13. 91 ng/ml {{by the end of}} the ad lib puffing period. Tobacco-related withdrawal symptoms and urge to smoke were significantly reduced; direct positive effects were strongly endorsed, and there was very low reporting of adverse effects. Conclusions These findings demonstrate reliable blood nicotine delivery after the acute use of this brand/model of e-cigarette in a sample of regular users. Future studies might usefully quantify nicotine delivery in relation to inhalation technique and the relationship with successful smoking cessation/harm reduction...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 200 {{million men}} and 100 million women smoke worldwide. In the United States, an {{estimated}} 25. 9 million men (23. 9 percent) and 20. 7 million women (18. 1 percent) are smokers. The commencement of smoking {{at a young}} age is thought to increase addiction liability, decrease the probability of successful cessation, and correlate with a higher number of cigarettes smoked per day. Studies from the World Health Organization indicate that between 80, 000 and 100, 000 children start smoking every day worldwide. These statistics suggest that adolescence is a critical phase for developing nicotine dependence. The work in this dissertation contributes to the further understanding of this unique developmental period. Our research shows that various aspects of nicotine dependence are both age- and sex-dependent. We observed age- and sex-related differences in both <b>nicotine</b> reward and <b>withdrawal</b> models that imply a heightened vulnerability for adolescents. In addition, we have investigated possible behavioral and molecular mechanisms which may underlie the elevated vulnerability to dependence. The data illustrate that while behavioral mechanisms only play a minor role in the differences seen in reward and withdrawal, molecular mechanisms appear to have a greater contribution. Specifically, increased nicotinic receptor function {{is likely to be a}} substantial contributor to age-related disparities. In addition, nicotine is one of the first and most commonly abused drugs in adolescence and is known to be a strong predictor of subsequent alcohol and other drug abuse. Our research investigated the effects of adolescent nicotine exposure on both nicotine and cocaine dependence in adulthood. We found that exposure to nicotine during the early phase of adolescence affects both <b>nicotine</b> reward and <b>withdrawal</b> in adulthood. Moreover, this exposure also bears impact on other drugs of abuse such as cocaine. In summary, our data suggest that early adolescence is the most critical period for becoming dependent to nicotine and that early experimentation with nicotine may lead to enhanced vulnerability to dependence on more illicit drugs of abuse. It is imperative that we understand why adolescents have a heightened susceptibility to nicotine dependence so that better smoking cessation therapies and prevention messages can be developed for this age group...|$|R
50|$|Various causes {{have been}} {{proposed}} to explain the causes of <b>nicotine</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Nicotine binds to nicotinic {{receptors in the brain}} that, in turn, cause an increase in dopamine.

The onset of this opposing force {{and the fact that the}} brain becomes used to and dependent on nicotine to function normally is known as physical dependence. When nicotine intake is decreased, the brain's opposing force is now unopposed and this causes withdrawal symptoms.

40|$|Neuronal nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs) are {{a family}} of ligand-gated ion channels present in the central and peripheral nervous systems, that are permeable to mono- and divalent cations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nicotine {{replacement}} therapy (NRT) helps smokers quit smoking, but trials {{indicate that there}} is no evidence that it is effective during pregnancy. As metabolism increases during pregnancy, NRT may deliver insufficient <b>nicotine</b> to alleviate <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms.

METHODS: We analyzed data on 33 pregnant participants from the NRT arm of a randomized control trial who had stopped smoking and were still using 15 mg/ 16 hr nicotine patches 1 month after quitting. Salivary cotinine levels when smoking at baseline were compared with levels on NRT at 1 month using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Cotinine levels were a median of 98. 5 ng/ml while smoking and 62. 8 ng/ml while using NRT and remaining abstinent (p =. 045). Participants with the highest cotinine measurements when smoking also tended to have the steepest reduction in cotinine levels while using NRT.
