It {{is always going to be}} there. It is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>away.</b> No way at all." [...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, [...] "They were my father." ...|$|E

Dean {{dropped out of the}} race at a rally in Burlington, Vermont, saying [...] "I am no longer actively pursuing the presidency". Dean continued to advise his supporters to fight on saying [...] "Sending delegates to the convention only continues to energize our party. Fight on in the caucuses; we are on the ballots.

2500|$|The {{interest}} {{created by}} the documentary highlighted a need for increased scientific research, as well as caution against [...] "bad medicine" [...] and raising false hopes: Ed Maa, a specialist in epilepsy, stated: [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>away.</b> ...I think {{it needs to be}} studied vigorously and very quickly."

I do know that {{for the amount of}} stuff we're putting in here, it is certainly not a bad deal. There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game. It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March? We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>away,</b> and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, but sometimes they can't." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic."

[...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>away</b> to detox.

2500|$|The Hunger Games {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with praise for its themes and messages, {{as well as}} Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss, though there was criticism of the film's use of shaky cam in the action sequences.

Collins stated {{in an interview that}} her novel and screenplay drew on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus, Roman gladiatorial games, reality television, and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war, not to think as just an audience member, [...] "Because those are real people on the screen, and theyâ€™re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>away</b> when the commercials start to roll." [...] The song [...] "Safe & Sound" [...] won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. For her performance, Lawrence won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Actress and was also nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.|$|E

60|$|The doctor's chief {{prescription}} was horse exercise; {{but what}} would a constitutional canter be to one accustomed to free rides through the Bush?
