40|$|The memory {{resources}} {{required by}} network sim-ulations can grow quadratically with {{size of the}} sim-ulated network. In simulations that use routing ta-bles at each node to perform per-hop packet forward-ing, the storage required for the routing tables is O (N 2), where N {{is the number of}} simulated network nodes in the topology. Additionally, the CPU time required in the simulation environment to compute and populate these routing tables can be excessive and can dominate the overall simulation tame. W e propose a new routing technique, known as Neighbor-Index Vectors, or NIx-Vectors, which eliminates both the storage required for the rout-ing tables and the CPU time required to compute them. We show experimental results using NIx-Vector routing in the popular network simulator <b>ns.</b> <b>With</b> <b>our</b> technique, we achieve a near order of mag-nitude increase in the maximum size of a simulated network running ns on a single workstation.

40|$|AbstractOptimization of {{injection}} well placement deserves careful and thoughtful consideration {{to achieve the}} higher safety of CO 2 geological storage. In this study, a storage safety is quantified {{as a proportion of}} the immobile and dissolved CO 2 to the total injected amount. Here we revisit the definition of immobile CO 2 from a standpoint of long-term CO 2 migration. Owing to the irreversibility of relative permeability curves, a fraction of CO 2 which is displacing brine will eventually become trapped as residual CO 2 when the switchover from drainage to imbibition process takes place. From this observation, we propose a new definition for immobile CO 2, which is preferred as a measure of long-term storage safety. Using the above quantitative measure of storage safety as an optimality criterion, we attempt to optimize an {{injection well}} placement. We combine the popular numerical simulator TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 <b>N</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> recently-proposed derivative-free global optimization algorithm, and search an optimal well placement for a realistic heterogeneous reservoir model.
