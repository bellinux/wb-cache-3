5|$|The {{design was}} reimagined in 1944, {{intended}} to operate {{along with the}} s and proposed aircraft carriers to make up powerful task forces able to challenge the American fleet. In this role it would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more powerful ship than the original design, taking over for the now-cancelled Kronstadts. They were intended to fend off enemy attacks and protect the carriers when bad weather prevented flying. A series of at least four were planned, and Stalingrad finally began construction in 1951. Supported primarily by Joseph Stalin and opposed by a considerable part of the naval staff, the project {{came to an abrupt}} end with his death in 1953. By this time a second example was under construction and abandoned on the slipway, while a third was never started. The partially completed Stalingrad ended as a target ship for testing anti-ship missiles, before being broken up around 1962.|$|E
5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. The cheese would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> harder one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as Welsh rabbit as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the Welsh term caws pobi. Welsh folk rarely ate rabbit due to the cost and as land owners would not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E
5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to fit {{as much information as}} they could, saying that it would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 Oppenheimer {{attempted}} to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher {{to work at}} the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.|$|E
5|$|Nebula Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> member. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then reach the final ballot in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary ballot for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} July, Villeroi {{sent the}} king a request for supplies, {{compiled}} by his master of artillery. He evaluated that 12 cannons, 25 mortars, 4000 cannonballs, 5000 explosive shells, {{a large amount of}} gunpowder, lead shot, grenades and fuses, and 900 wagons for transport would be necessary. In addition, there would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> baggage train capable of supplying arms and provisions to an army of nearly 70,000 men. The supplies and troops were largely taken out of French garrisons and strongholds in the region, and on August 7, Villeroi left Mons for Brussels with a baggage train of nearly 1500 carts.|$|E
25|$|Earthenware {{has been}} {{developed}} in many areas. The Labu Sayong is a gourd-shaped clay jar that holds water. Perak is famous for these. Also used to store water is the angular Terenang. The belanga is a clay bowl used to cook, with a wide base that allows heat to spread easily. Carved wood is used as ornamentation for many items, such as doors and window panels. Woodcarving was never an industry, but an art. Traditional woodcarvers spent years simply preparing the wood, due to a belief that woodcarvers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> perfect match with their wood. The wood also had to match the buyer, so woodcarving was a very ritualised task.|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, Transit New Zealand {{noted that}} the more than 160 options had been narrowed down to only two alignments. The first {{possible}} alignment (of approximately 4.5km length) would be a parallel link several hundred meters directly {{to the east of}} the existing bridge (either as a bridge or a tunnel), while the second alignment (of approximately 6.5km length) would start in the same general environs in North Shore City, but travel diagonally southeastwards to link up with the motorway at Grafton Gully, east of the Auckland CBD. The second option, due to the need to cross shipping lanes, would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tunnel. It could also possibly be connected to the CBD via a side branch tunnel (for use by public transport only). North Shore City has noted that it would prefer a tunnel option for aesthetic reasons, and to potentially emplace light rail within the tunnel at a future stage.|$|E
25|$|Queen Helena of Adiabene {{converted}} to Judaism. When her son went to war, she vowed {{that if he}} returned in peace, {{she would be a}} nazirite for seven years. Her son did return, and she observed her nazirite vow for seven years. At the end of the seven years, she went to the Land of Israel and the House of Hillel ruled that she had to be a nazirite for seven more years. Towards the end of this seven years, she contracted ritual defilement, and so altogether she was a nazirite for 21 years. Rabbi Judah said that she was a nazirite for only 14 years (plus 30 days). If a person vowed a naziriteship of long duration and completed it and then arrives in the Land of Israel, the House of Shammai taught that the person would then <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> nazirite for 30 more days, but House of Hillel taught that the person's naziriteship began for its full term again as at the first.|$|E

Fabiański left with 78 appearances and 25 clean sheets for Arsenal, as well as a winner's medal on his final appearance for the club. The 2014 FA Cup Final also turned out to be the final appearance for Bacary Sagna for Arsenal, as he agreed to join Manchester City upon the completion of his contract. Sagna had an illustrious seven-year period with the club, making 284 appearances for club with the Frenchman becoming an integral part of the Arsenal defence following his transfer from Auxerre. Unfortunately, Sagna did have to respond to distaste from some club supporters over the nature of his move to a Premier League rival, citing the move on the need to boost his career as a player, as opposed to the monetary incentives claimed.|$|E
