5|$|If <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, {{subcutaneous tissue}} and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|They can be playful {{with other}} dogs, and {{get along with}} horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that shyness {{be treated as a}} fault, although it states that this {{should not be confused with}} submissiveness which is <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E

5|$|Contreras' unit {{arrived in}} Northern Africa on January 27, 1943, and {{rendered}} overseas duties in Algiers within General Dwight D.

They did not receive overseas payment nor could they receive government life insurance. They had no protection if they became ill, wounded or captured. She served until 1945 and earned the European-African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 2 Battle Stars, World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Women's Army Corps Service Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help {{children with autism}} gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> as a disorder.|$|E

5|$|Galerina marginata is {{widespread}} in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> rapidly. About ten poisonings {{have been attributed to}} the species now grouped as G.marginata over the last century.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E

Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> as seabirds.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The NSPCC {{reported}} that the Savile scandal had resulted {{in an increase in}} overall reports of sexual abuse by 81%. This was measured by comparing the years immediately before and after broadcasting of the Exposure documentary. A subsequent NSPCC report was commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and published in January 2014. It reported on interviews with 26 individuals, a number of whom were abused in hospitals. Upon reporting abuse to staff at the time, they felt that their concerns were <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> sincerely.|$|E

5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is the virus that – when the infection is <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} {{is subject}} to indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 the Queen has paid income tax and capital gains tax on personal income.

Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is £334 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If <b>not</b> <b>treated,</b> ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if <b>not</b> <b>treated</b> promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
