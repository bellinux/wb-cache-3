40|$|Abstract Background The Accra {{climate change}} talks held from 21 – 27 August 2008 in Accra, Ghana, {{were part of}} an ongoing series of {{meetings}} leading up to the Copenhagen meeting in December 2009. During the meeting a set of options for accounting carbon sequestration in forestry on a post- 2012 framework was presented. The options include gross-net and <b>net-net</b> <b>accounting</b> and approaches for establishing baselines. Results This article demonstrates the embedded consequences of Accra Accounting Options for the case study of German national GHG accounting. It presents the most current assessment of sequestration rates by forest management for the period 1990 – 2007, provides an outlook of future emissions and removals (up to the year 2042) as related to three different management scenarios, and shows that implementation of some Accra options may reverse sources to sinks, or sinks to sources. Conclusion The results of the study highlight the importance of elaborating an accounting system that would prioritize the climate convention goals, not national preferences. </p...|$|E
40|$|The present {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to the international debate on the compensation mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD). Since its inception, the debate has constantly widened its scope to now cover deforestation, degradation and forest management. In order to avoid methodological complexities and inconsistencies in carbon reporting and accounting, the authors promote a unifi ed accounting system that does not distinguish between industrialized and developing countries. Such a system has been created for Annex-I countries with the Kyoto Articles 3. 3 and 3. 4. It allowed for a stepwise implementation and recognized the need for capacity building and “learning-by-doing ” for the fi rst commitment period. If this system serves as a blueprint, the main difference will be that industrialized countries have overall targets, while developing countries would determine a sectoral reference level for land use emissions, against which emission reductions in the land use sector are to be measured. As developing countries take over wider climate commitments in the future, this will not affect reporting for land use uptakes and emissions. In order to develop a comprehensive system, article 3. 3 and 3. 4 need revision concerning the accounting modalities, i. e. Annex I countries would have to switch to <b>net-net</b> <b>accounting.</b> The way REDD has been conceived in Bali, it is restricted to developing countries ’ forest sector only. If this REDD mechanism were to be the future, it would create methodological hurdles and provide ammunition for opponents against enhanced responsibilities by developing countries within the climate regime...|$|E
