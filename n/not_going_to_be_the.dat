25|$|Soon {{into the}} {{development}} of powered flight, some manufacturers were beginning to consider the use of metal in airframes to replace wood. Metal structures, even fabric-covered metal frames, offered greater robustness for handling and transportation as well as better resistance to tropical climates, and some designers could see the possibilities of metal skinning, stressed or not, for aerodynamically-clean cantilever wings and advanced monocoque fuselages. There was a realisation too, that mild steel, familiar from bicycle manufacture but with a low strength-to-weight ratio, was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> material of choice once the problems of joining aluminium alloy members together and preventing their corrosion had been solved. Vickers in the UK {{were one of the}} first to make steel-framed and sparred aircraft that flew, with their series of R.E.P-type monoplanes no.s 1-8 produced between 1911 and 1913. In Germany, Junkers produced the first true all-metal (for years, aircraft with fabric-clad metal frames were described as all-metal, but the Junkers was steel-skinned as well) aircraft, the Junkers J.1, flown in 1915. Bristol's first draft designs for metal aircraft date from 1914, but it was not until the increase of aircraft production during the First World War began to put pressure on the supply of high-grade timber that there was official interest. During 1916 Bristol's designer, Frank Barnwell submitted a design for a metal two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, the M.R.1 (M.R. for Metal Reconnaissance) and gained a contract for two evaluation aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, British Eagle's {{unhappiness}} at the Government's {{refusal to}} exempt it from paying duty on its new Boeing 707-365Cs {{led to a}} decision to postpone from February to December 1967 delivery of the first aircraft, swapping the second aircraft's delivery position {{for the first and}} arranging to take delivery of the second in mid-1968. The airline estimated that this delay had cost it US$1m in lost North Atlantic revenue. It also pointed out that this would have been enough to pay for the duty. The unresolved dispute between British Eagle and the BOT over the payment of import duty on two new 707-365Cs held up the first aircraft's delivery at the beginning of February 1968, with HM Customs demanding payment of £440,000 before releasing the aircraft. The dispute was resolved with the airline agreeing to pay the duty once the Bermudan-registered aircraft was operating in British Eagle livery. This was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case for at least another year as the aircraft had been wet-leased to Middle East Airlines (MEA) as of 1 March. British Eagle had made operating the aircraft in its own colours dependent on the outcome of the applications to the ATLB for licences to operate scheduled and non-scheduled services between London and New York as well as London, Bermuda and Nassau from 1 April 1969. The airline had held out the prospect of placing a follow-on order for an additional two 707-365Cs in the case of these applications being approved and relevant licences awarded.|$|E

500|$|During production, new {{gameplay}} {{options were}} implemented {{in order to}} [...] "keep up with fresh action games"; among these is the Devil Bringer's ability to bring enemies towards the characters. Unlike Dante's progress in Devil May Cry 3, Nero was designed to become stronger by upgrading his Devil Bringer ability instead of receiving new weapons after defeating boss characters. During development, the production team noted several aspects of the game, including that Nero {{would be one of}} two main characters and that Dante was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only character from previous entries in the series to appear. Producer Hiroyuki Kobashi noted prior to the release of that game that they wanted to make Dante seem significantly more powerful than Nero. This was done in order to create an evident difference between the strength of a [...] "veteran" [...] when compared to a [...] "rookie". Unlike Devil May Cry 3, the game's difficulty would be the same in both the Japanese and European versions as in the one released in North America.|$|E

If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play tomorrow is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same game that you just played."

500|$|When the Tea Room {{was closed}} by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, {{officials}} said they did so {{because of the potential}} fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it [...] "may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations," [...] the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were [...] "disappointed" [...] by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that [...] "The mansion is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> site of any food operation," [...] but has made no further comment since then.|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in that this was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] {{want to do is}} keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He {{went on to say that}} this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite another lockout {{beginning}} on 15 September 2012, the Sedins {{decided that they}} would only return to Modo, now managed by former teammate Markus Näslund, if the entire 2012–13 season wound up cancelled. Instead, the shortened season begun on January 2013, and during it Henrik passed Näslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer with 757 points. After scoring the record-setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes, the play stopped and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Näslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. In {{the final game of}} the season, Head Coach Alain Vigneault wanted to rest his regulars ahead of the playoffs. However, he played Henrik in the game though only for 22 seconds; he left the bench after just one shift. For his part, Henrik told Vigneault that [...] "he would be okay with sitting out the game" [...] and to him the streak is just [...] "a number in the paper." [...] Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that [...] "he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one that breaks the streak", and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. Henrik finished the season with 11 goals and 45 points in 48 games.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} game as a Canuck, Roy tallied an assist helping Vancouver to a 4–0 win. The win moved the Canucks passed Minnesota for the {{division}} lead. The shutout marked Schneider's fourth of the season, which doubled his career total. Two games later, Schneider registered his fifth shutout {{of the season in}} a 2–0 over the Coyotes, tying him for the League lead. The game also marked the return of Kesler, who scored the game-winning goal. Minnesota slumped {{towards the end of the}} season and the Canucks won their fifth-straight Northwest Division title with a 2–1 victory over the Blackhawks. In the game, Schneider suffered a groin injury and was unable to play the last two games of the season; he was listed by the Canucks as day-to-day with a [...] "body" [...] injury. With Schneider out, the Canucks lost their final two regular season games. In their final loss, Vigneault rested many of his regulars, though he received criticism for playing Henrik Sedin for only 22 seconds. Furthermore, Sedin left the bench after his one shift. The Los Angeles Times Helene Elliott called it a cheap way of keeping Sedin's ironman streak intact. For his part, Henrik Sedin told Vigneault that [...] "he would be okay with sitting out the game" [...] and to him the streak is just [...] "a number in the paper." [...] Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that [...] "he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one that breaks the streak," [...] and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. By season's end, the Sedin twins' point production dropped from the previous years. Henrik's point points-per-game average was the lowest it had been since 2007–08, while Daniel's was his worst since 2003–04. The Cauncks' power play also struggled throughout the year dropping from fourth in 2011–12 to 23rd in the League.|$|E
