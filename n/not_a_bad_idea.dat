500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea,</b> much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

[...] Because the album is self-titled, many fans refer to it as [...] "Avocado" [...] or [...] "The Avocado Album." [...] The cover was named in Pitchfork Media's top 25 worst album covers of 2006. The liner notes art features footage from the [...] "Life Wasted" [...] music video, directed by artist Fernando Apodaca. The photographs involve the band members with their skin decaying and animals crawling in and out of it, as Apodaca felt the songs, [...] "Life Wasted" [...] in particular, fit [...] "my interpretation of the how fragile life is". The album was also issued on a double vinyl.|$|E

According to Pyotr Kozlov, who traveled in the Kham region in 1900-1901, Tibetans, {{who did not have}} any vegetables other than turnips, would often dig out roots of Argentina anserina(whose local name he gave as djüma), which could be easily dried and stored for later use.

30|$|Sometimes {{students}} {{tried to}} evaluate their ideas quickly, at an early stage. However, presenting an idea too early seemed to tie the idea to a development {{that it would not}} have followed naturally. A fast-born <b>idea</b> is <b>not</b> necessarily <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> as Raami for example argues. Intuitive thinking is a developmental skill or ability that is useful for getting glimpses of a new idea and futures or a solution to be developed more consciously on. Typically, a person thinks intuitively first and rationally after that. In decision-making, intuition can be highly useful, accurate and in some situations superior to rational reasoning. Raami has noticed that students often fear that their intuition is wrong or that it might lead to poor decisions. These doubts may be relevant since in formal education, intuitive faculties are seldom developed. [21] This study showed that students need encouragement in trusting their intuition.|$|R
