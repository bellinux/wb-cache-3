The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the role of Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region and its extent in differentiating benign and malignant lesions, particularly with respect to follicular neoplasms of the thyroid. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, cross sectional study which included 110 patients presenting with thyroid swelling. The fi ne needle aspiration smears were studied by conventional methods and silver staining for Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region. In 50 cases, diagnosis was confi rmed by histopathology. The Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region count was done and the mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region count per nucleus was calculated along with pattern of distribution. Results: Mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region count was higher in neoplastic as compared to non-neoplastic and infl ammatory lesions. Papillary carcinoma had the highest mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region count (5. 40 ± 0. 86) and the lowest count was seen in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (2. 10 ± 0. 36). Higher mean Argyrophilic <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer</b> region count was recorded in follicular carcinoma (4. 84 ± 1. 42) as compared to follicular adenoma (3. 5 ± 0. 27) which was found to be statistically signifi cant (P< 0. 05).

Ectopic expression of RasL 11 a enhanced pre-rRNA levels in cells, whereas RasL 11 a knockdown had the opposite effect. In transient transfection experiments, RasL 11 a enhanced the transcriptional activity of an RNA polymerase I-specific reporter controlled by the rDNA enhancer/promoter region.

There are no "classical" fibrillar centers in D. nasutum nucleoli. The spatial distribution of nucleolar chromatin bodies, which play the role of <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizers</b> in the macronucleus of D. nasutum, was studied using 3 D reconstructions based on serial ultrathin sections.

However, the relative number of nucleolar chromatin bodies in different regions of the same convoluted nucleolus is approximately the same. This finding suggests equal activity {{in different parts of the}} nucleolar domain and indicates the existence of some molecular mechanism enabling it to synchronize this activity in D. nasutum nucleoli.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the extrachromosomal nucleolar material in oocytes of two insect species with different ovary types, the house cricket Acheta domesticus (panoistic ovary) and the water beetle Dytiscus marginalis (meroistic ovary), was studied with light and electron microscopic techniques. Stages early in oogenesis were compared with fully vitellogenic stages (mid-to-Iate diplotene). The arrangement of the nucleolar material undergoes a marked change from a densely aggregated to a dispersed state. The latter was characterized by high transcriptional activity. In spread and positively stained preparations of isolated nucleolar material, a high frequency of small circular units of transcribed rDNA was observed and rings with small numbers (1 - 5) of pre-rRNA genes were predominant. The observations suggest that the "extra DNA body" observed in early oogenic stages of both species represents a dense aggregate of numerous short circular units of nucleolar chromatin, with morphological subcomponents identifiable in ultrathin sections. These apparently remain in close association with the chromosomal <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizer(s).</b> The observations further indicate that the individual small nucleolar subunit circles dissociate and are dispersed as actively transcribed rDNA units later in diplotene.

40|$|Nucleoli, nuclear organelles {{in which}} ribosomal RNA is {{synthesized}} and processed, emerge from <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizers</b> (NORs) located in distinct chromosomal regions. In polytene nuclei of dipterans, nucleoli of some species {{can be observed}} under light microscopy exhibiting distinctive morphology: Drosophila and chironomid species display well-formed nucleoli {{in contrast to the}} fragmented and dispersed nucleoli seen in sciarid flies. The available data show no apparent relationship between nucleolar morphology and location of NORs in Diptera. The regulation of rRNA transcription involves controlling both the transcription rate per gene as well as the proportion of rRNA genes adopting a proper chromatin structure for transcription, since active and inactive rRNA gene copies coexist in NORs. Transcription units organized in nucleosomes and those lacking canonical nucleosomes can be analyzed by the method termed psoralen gel retarding assay (PGRA), allowing inferences on the ratio of active to inactive rRNA gene copies. In this work, possible connections between chromosomal location of NORs and proportion of active rRNA genes were studied in Drosophila melanogaster, and in chironomid and sciarid species. The data suggested a link between location of NORs and proportion of active rRNA genes since the copy number showing nucleosomal organization predominates when NORs are located in the pericentric heterochromatin.

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} {{activity during}} meiotic prophase in the mouse testis is studied with light microscopy and high-resolution autoradiographic techniques using [3 H]uridine as a labeled precursor. In the present study, {{two types of}} RNA synthesis are detected during meiotic prophase: an extranucleolar RNA synthesis of perichromosomal localization and a nucleolar RNA synthetic activity. In some of the autosomes {{and close to the}} basal knobs, the activity of the <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizers</b> is evidenced by the incorporation of [3 H]uridine into nucleolar masses from zygotene on and at earlier labeling times. The evolution of nucleoli and the formation of a nucleolus attached to the sex pair are described during the different meiotic stages. Perichromosomal labeling, from leptotene on, reaches a maximum during middle pachytene and falls progressively to a low level at longer incorporation times. Sertoli's cell, the most active RNA synthetic cell in the seminiferous epithelium, rises to a maximum of labeling and drops at earlier times compared with the meiotic prophase cells. The condensed sex chromosomes show some scattered silver grains especially at middle pachytene. The axial chromosome cores and synaptonemal complexes are devoid of silver grains during the meiotic prophase. The observations suggest that a control mechanism operates during meiotic prophase to regulate transcriptional activity in the sex chromosomes and to provide differential RNA synthesis in autosomal bivalents at various stages of prophase and within certain segments of the chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|The endoreplication {{of the two}} <b>nucleolar</b> <b>organizers</b> (NOs) of the diploid genome {{has been}} {{examined}} in individual polyploid nuclei of the dipteran Calliphora erythrocephala. Crosses between two strains with diagnostic nontranscribed spacer polymorphisms in their rRNA genes were used to provide progeny with distinguishable NOs, and single nuclei of two highly polyploid cell types [...] salivary gland and nurse cells [...] were examined from individual F 1 animals. Initially {{the representation of the}} two NOs in total polyploid tissue DNA was determined. This revealed that, although the NO regions present in one of the strains (Tom) were very similar in spacer composition, they displayed two types of behavior in the hybrids containing the single NO region typical of the second strain (Karla). In TW phenotype F 1 progeny, very little replication of the Tom NO relative to the Karla NO occurred, whereas in TS phenotype progeny replication of the Tom and Karla NOs was approximately equivalent. When individual polyploid nuclei of the TS phenotype animals were examined, however, the relative replication of the Tom and Karla NOs was found not to be a fixed genetic property but to vary dramatically from cell to cell. This was true even for the nurse cell nuclei within a single ovarian follicle, which are the products of only four mitotic divisions of a single germ-line cell. These findings indicate that for NOs of similar replicative competence, a stochastic mechanism governs the relative usage of each NO for endoreplication and that the relative activity of the two NOs is not stably determined through the mitotic divisions preceding polyploidization. Stochastic selection after mitotic DNA replication could be a general phenomenon governing the relative usage (transcription) of different, but equally competent, alleles of any gene in individual cells, if the required factors are in short supply...|$|R
