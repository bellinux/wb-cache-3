"In the Protestant cantons you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> such {{poverty and}} dirt and squalor {{as you do}} in this Catholic one; you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> the lanes and alleys flowing with foulness; you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> such wretched little sties of houses; you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> an {{inverted}} tin turnip {{on top of a}} church for a dome; and as for a church-bell, why, you never hear a church-bell at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> him," [...] Davidson had {{to confess}} to his owner, who would peer at him silently through round, horn-rimmed spectacles, several sizes too large for his little old face. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> him." ...|$|R

5|$|Fischer played 1.c4 (instead of 1.e4) {{for only}} {{the third time in}} a serious game. With 3.d4 the game {{transposed}} to the Queen's Gambit, surprising many who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> Fischer play the White side of that opening. In fact, he had previously openly condemned it.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E

5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion.

5|$|In 1903, three kakapo {{were moved}} from Resolution Island {{to the nature}} reserve of Little Barrier Island {{north-east}} of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the kakapo were <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> again.

5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{in any of the}} other cards.

The card broke apart, and as a result, the card was dismissed as a fake.|$|E

5|$|In Yao's {{first game}} in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an Asian {{cultural}} stereotype. Yao was not {{angry with the}} promotion {{because he was not}} familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.|$|E
5|$|In another study, synesthetes were {{prompted}} to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time {{too short to}} account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
