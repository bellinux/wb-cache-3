5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree <b>netting,</b> both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree <b>netting</b> products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the <b>netting</b> without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe <b>netting</b> products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reconfigurable Object <b>Nets</b> (RONs) {{have been}} {{implemented}} in our group to support the visual specification of controlled rule-based transformations of marked place/transition (P/T) <b>nets.</b> RONs are high-level <b>nets</b> (system <b>nets)</b> with two types of tokens: object <b>nets</b> (P/T <b>nets)</b> and <b>net</b> transformation rules. System <b>net</b> transitions can be of different types to fire object <b>net</b> transitions, move object <b>nets</b> through the system <b>net,</b> or to apply a <b>net</b> transformation rule to an object <b>net.</b> The disadvantage of the RON approach and tool is the limitation of object <b>nets</b> to P/T <b>nets</b> and the limitation of the underlying semantics of RONs due to the fixed types for system <b>net</b> transitions. Often, a more general approach is preferred where the type of object <b>nets</b> and the behavior of reconfigurations may be defined in a more flexible way. In this paper, we propose to use Algebraic High-Level <b>nets</b> with in-dividual tokens (AHLI <b>nets)</b> as system <b>nets.</b> In this more general approach, tokens may be any type of Petri <b>nets,</b> defined by the corresponding algebraic signature and algebra. To support this general approach, a development environment for AHLI <b>nets</b> is currently implemented which allows the user to edit and simulate AHLI <b>nets.</b> We present the formalization of RONs as special AHLI <b>nets</b> and describe {{the current state of}} the AHLI <b>net</b> tool environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{main idea}} behind Reconfigurable Object <b>Nets</b> (RONs) is the {{integration}} of transition firing and rule-based <b>net</b> structure transformation of place/transition <b>nets</b> during system simulation. RONs are high-level <b>nets</b> with two types of tokens: object <b>nets</b> (place/transition <b>nets)</b> and <b>net</b> transformation rules (a dedicated type of graph transformation rules). Firing of high-level transitions may involve firing of object <b>net</b> transitions, transporting object <b>net</b> tokens through the high-level <b>net,</b> and applying <b>net</b> transformation rules to object <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> transformations include <b>net</b> modifications such as merging or splitting of object <b>nets,</b> and <b>net</b> refinement. This approach increases the expressiveness of Petri <b>nets</b> and is especially suited to model mobile distributed processes. The paper presents a visual editor for RONs which has been developed in a student project at TU Berlin in summer 2007. The visual editor itself has been realized as a plug-in for ECLIPSE using the ECLIPSE Modeling Framework (EMF) and Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) plug-ins...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} is to give an overview of constructions and results for Petri <b>net</b> transformations in the ≫Petri <b>Net</b> Baukasten ≪ developed by the “DFG-Forschergruppe Petrinetz-Technologie”. The two main concepts of Petri <b>net</b> transformations considered in this context are <b>net</b> class and <b>net</b> model transformations. In both cases we present first the relevance of transformations in the application developer view and them the technical constructions and results in the expert view of the ≫Petri <b>Net</b> Baukasten≪. <b>Net</b> class transformations are transformations between different Petri <b>net</b> classes, like elementary <b>nets,</b> place/transition <b>nets</b> and algebraic high-level <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> model transformations {{on the other hand}} are transformations of the <b>net</b> structure for <b>nets</b> within one Petri <b>net</b> class, like place or transition refinement. The main technical results are concerning the preservation of safety resp. liveness properties of <b>net</b> model transformations and compatibility results between <b>net</b> class and <b>net</b> model transformations. The relevance of the constructions and results for the application developer view is demonstrated by a small case study modeling the interaction of a buffer, a printer and a communication unit consisting of secure and non-secure channels. Finally we give an overview of other concepts of transformations: On one hand, transformations between Petri <b>nets</b> and other system modeling techniques, {{and on the other hand}} transformations between different <b>net</b> representation formats using XML-schemes and DTD-standards. ...|$|R
