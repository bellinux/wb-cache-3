2500|$|A mooring used {{to secure}} a small boat (capable of being beached) at sea {{so that it is}} {{accessible}} at all tides. [...] Making a Travelling Mooring involves (1) the sinking of a heavy weight to which a block (<b>pulley</b> <b>wheel)</b> is attached at a place where the sea is sufficiently deep at low tide, (2) fitting a block / <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> to a rock or secure point above the high tide mark, and (3) running a heavy rope with marker buoy between these blocks.|$|R
50|$|A damaged {{conveyor}} {{supported on}} a steel frame made of angle iron {{starts at the}} bottom of the crushing plant and slopes upward to end in mid-air above the remains of a screening plant. The belt of the conveyor is missing except for a portion at the upper end. This is draped over a wide <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> at the very end of the conveyor. The <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> is powered via a chain (still extant) and an electric motor mounted on a frame above it.|$|R
50|$|The odontophore is {{the tongue}} of flesh {{underlying}} the radular membrane, and controls the organ's protrusion and return. It can be likened to a <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> {{over which the}} radular 'string' is pulled.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contain the}} process of {{creating}} a modular and mechanical landmine clearing tool for NMBU`s agricultural robot, Thorvald 2. In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A winch lifts the load up and keeps it in the air. A clutch disconnects the drum {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> at the top. The scaffold and the <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> are designed and placed so that the <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the load and the winch via the <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel.</b> The clutch is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox. Simulations done by FFI gives reason for optimism for the continuation of the project. A prototype is yet to be completed...|$|R

50|$|In 1979 a {{memorial}} was dedicated and unveiled by the Yorkshire NUM president Arthur Scargill. The memorial included a commemorative plaque and half <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> in what became Athersley Memorial Park, Royston Carlton Boundary Walk. (SE436409). The Commission: To commemorate a mining accident, 6 August 1936, in which 58 men were killed.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 Barnsley Councillor Len Picken (Councillor Picken was the Mayor of Barnsley for the {{municipal}} year 2007/2008) successfully campaigned {{to have the}} old half <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> moved to a more prominent location {{at the entrance of}} the Wharncliff Business Park. There was a public appeal that went out via local news media including the BBC. The new memorial was a more emotive piece of work that included the half <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel,</b> a stone frieze, sculptured by Harry Malkin, carved in brick supplied and fired by Ibstock brick company Nostel, Wakefield that depicts two miners searching for their lost colleagues and stands about ten feet by eight. It also includes local news reports {{from the time of the}} accident, an information board by local historian Brian Elliot and the names of the Woodmoor victims. The ceremony was led by Councillor Picken and Councillor Roy Butterfield. More than 100 people attended, including numerous relatives and descendants, some with Welsh origins, and representatives from the NUM.|$|R
2500|$|The wood of Nyssa sylvatica is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and {{difficult}} to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making mauls, <b>pulleys,</b> <b>wheel</b> hubs, agricultural rollers, bowls, and paving blocks. [...] The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, {{it has been used}} for shuttles in weaving.|$|R
50|$|The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, {{powerful}} and compact. It had one front wheel, with solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, by evaporation. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> {{on the left}} hand side allowed it {{to be used as}} a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was £300.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the steam}} engine and {{transmission}} are now removed, {{the plan and}} construction of the mill reveal their former location. The boiler and engine sheds are extant, the latter containing {{the foundations of the}} steam engine. Power was transmitted to the saws and saw sharpening grinder from the steam engine via transmission shafts, belts and <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels.</b> The original transmission shafts and pulleys, though removed from the shed, remain on the site.|$|R

50|$|In 1833 Steenke built a canal, the Seckenburger Kanal, in the Memel (Klaipėda) area. He {{designed}} the Oberländischer Kanal (now called Elbląg Canal), {{which was built}} between 1844 - 58 from the Drausensee (Drużno) to the Drewenz (Drwęca) River. Inaugurated in 1860, it connected the cities of Deutsch Eylau (Iława), Osterode (Ostróda), and Elbing (Elbląg). It connected territories with about 100 yards differences in heights by putting ships on carriage carts on tracks and using <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels</b> and cables to have the ships glide up the hills.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Martin cane lift is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The lift at Mount Martin is a highly intact example of the derrick type and includes <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels,</b> cable, hook and access ladder. The ladder is a typical feature {{of this type of}} lift and was fitted to permit access {{to the top of the}} derrick for maintenance purposes.|$|R
50|$|Hawaiian Falls Roanoke {{is located}} in Roanoke, Texas. The park was {{announced}} on November 22, 2010, and opened on Memorial Day Weekend 2011. It became home of the world’s largest aqua play structure which will include a three-lane racer, a family raft ride with several exciting body slides, one 500-gallon and one 1,000-gallon dump bucket, numerous interactive <b>pulleys,</b> <b>wheels</b> and much more. The park was built by David Busch of Hawaiian Falls Waterparks in a joint public/private venture with the City of Roanoke. Ground broke for Hawaiian Falls Roanoke on November 22, 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Leap cane lift is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The lift at The Leap is a highly intact example of the latter type and includes <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels,</b> cable, hook and winch. Its location near a cane tramway reflects the predominate use {{of this type of}} lift for loading tram wagons. The derrick type was used predominately for loading main line railway wagons.|$|R
5000|$|Four Porter-Allen {{steam engines}} drove the armory’s machine tools {{through a maze}} of shafts and belts. Mark Twain, who lived in the nearby Mark Twain House, visited Colt's armory in 1868 and {{described}} it thus: [...] "It comprises a great range of tall brick buildings, and on every floor is a dense wilderness of strange iron machines… a tangled forest of rods, bars, <b>pulleys,</b> <b>wheels,</b> and all the imaginable and unimaginable forms of mechanism… It must have required more brains to invent all those things than would serve to stock 50 Senates like ours." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{individual}} cases {{it is possible}} that the construction cranes for a tower or building were left in place and used after the structure was completed. A picture in the Weltchronik by Rudolf von Ems (1340) shows two such load-carrying cranes. One is being worked using a winch, the other using a <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel.</b> A medieval construction crane with a pulley was reconstructed at the Alsace castle of Fleckenstein and set on an eleveted opening in the rock face of the inner ward. The depiction in the Weltchronik also shows material being carried up a wooden ladder.|$|R
50|$|The magic lantern, {{probably}} {{created by}} Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s, {{could be used}} to project animation, which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed {{one on top of the}} other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small crank and <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> that rotated a glass disc.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{gives the}} {{experimental}} results achieve in worm processing with whirling thread cutting. Values of roughness for different cutting parameters are presented and mathematical dependencies achieve after processing of experimental data have been obtain. Theoretical aspects Worm manufacturing using whirling thread cutting is an efficient process and better results gives the method with inner contact, that assures good conditions for cutting process, [1, 2]. The process utilises lathes and special design devices or special machine-tools {{that have a}} high cost. Because of this reason the utilisation of lathes and special devices frequently is meeting in industrial workshops, [3, 4, 5]. Experimental results The experimental researches {{have been done in}} T. C. M. Department of Iasi “Gh. Asachi” Technical University on a lathe SNA 560 x 1000, with a device made in the department. The rotate movement ns of the device’s knifes is given by the movement of electric motor and the transmission rate of <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels</b> that conduct movement at the device. The pulley diameter is Dpd= 216 mm and because is necessary different turning moments many <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels</b> was used with following diameters: Dp 1 = 188 mm; Dp 2 = 162 mm; Dp 3 = 133 mm; Dp 4 = 92 mm; Dp 5 = 57 mm. Turning movement of device principal axel were: ns 1 = 1241 rot/min; ns 2 = 1070 rot/min; ns 3 = 878 rot/min; ns 4 = 614 rot/min; ns 5 = 376 rot/min.

50|$|The {{heart of}} the launch system is a large winch, around which the launch cables are wound. This winch is driven by {{hydraulic}} turbines. The two launch cables {{are attached to the}} winch on its ends, and run through two grooves on top of the launch track. The cables are attached to the sides of the catch-car, which runs in a trough between the grooves. A third, single retractor cable is attached {{to the rear of the}} catch-car, it runs around a <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> at the rear end of the launch track and returns to the hydraulic building along the bottom of the launch track, where it is wound in the opposing direction on the winch's drum.|$|R
5000|$|A {{survey of}} Parkfield Colliery {{at the time}} of sale noted that it had two {{horizontal}} direct-acting steam winding engines each with 28in cylinders, a 4ft stroke and a drum 15ft in diameter. These had been made by Teague & Chew of Cinderford in the Forest of Dean. There were two 38ft high headgears, each with 2 <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels</b> of 15ft diameter. Steam was provided by four Lancashire boilers which measured 27ft by 7ft. A ventilating fan measured 18ft by 7ft and was driven by a pair of horizontal engines which had 14in cylinders and a 16in stroke. A Cornish pumping engine had a 54in cylinder and a 7ft stroke and was powered by two Lancashire boilers.|$|R
50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked <b>pulleys,</b> <b>wheels</b> or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a variable displacement pump and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a fixed displacement pump and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via flat belts and pulleys. The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original flat belts and <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels</b> on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] belts and pulleys which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R
50|$|Weight {{machines}} use gravity as {{the primary}} source of resistance, and a combination of simple machines to convey that resistance, to the person using the machine. Each of the simple machines (<b>pulley,</b> lever, <b>wheel,</b> incline) changes the mechanical advantage of the overall machine relative to the weight.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of Archimedes through the Renaissance, {{mechanisms}} {{were considered to be}} constructed from simple machines, such as the lever, <b>pulley,</b> screw, <b>wheel</b> and axle, wedge and inclined plane. It was Reuleaux who focussed on bodies, called links, and the connections between these bodies called kinematic pairs, or joints.|$|R
2500|$|One {{mystery of}} the pyramid's {{construction}} is its planning. John Romer suggests that they used the same method {{that had been used}} for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that [...] "such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means". He also argues for a 14-year time span for its construction. A modern construction management study, in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists, estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about 14,500 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000. Without the use of <b>pulleys,</b> <b>wheels,</b> or iron tools, they used critical path analysis methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} other K'Nex pieces, such as <b>wheels,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and other simple machines. There are also various motors {{that can make}} the models move.|$|R
50|$|However, a more {{successful}} strategy was identified by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines. He {{realized that a}} lever, <b>pulley,</b> and <b>wheel</b> and axle are in essence the same device: a body rotating about a hinge. Similarly, an inclined plane, wedge, and screw are a block sliding on a flat surface.|$|R
