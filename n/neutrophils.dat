5|$|<b>Neutrophils</b> {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated <b>neutrophils</b> release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of <b>neutrophils</b> lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting <b>neutrophils</b> is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by <b>neutrophils</b> can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|When <b>neutrophils</b> {{release their}} granule {{contents}} in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more <b>neutrophils</b> to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of <b>neutrophils.</b> The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of <b>neutrophils,</b> by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow <b>neutrophils</b> to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
40|$|As the {{principal}} cellular {{component of the}} inflammatory host defense and contributor to host injury after severe physiologic insult, the <b>neutrophil</b> is inherently coupled to patient outcome in both health and disease. Extensive {{research has focused on}} the mechanisms that regulate <b>neutrophil</b> delivery, function, and clearance from the inflammatory microenvironment. The <b>neutrophil</b> cell membrane mediates the interaction of the <b>neutrophil</b> with the extracellular environment; it expresses a complex array of adhesion molecules and receptors for various ligands, including mediators, cytokines, immunoglobulins, and membrane molecules on other cells. This article presents a review and analysis of the evidence that the <b>neutrophil</b> membrane plays a central role in regulating <b>neutrophil</b> delivery (production, rolling, adhesion, diapedesis, and chemotaxis), function (priming and activation, microbicidal activity, and neutrophil-mediated host injury), and clearance (apoptosis and necrosis). In addition, we review how change in <b>neutrophil</b> membrane expression is synonymous with change in <b>neutrophil</b> function in vivo. Employing a complementary analysis of the <b>neutrophil</b> as a complex system, <b>neutrophil</b> membrane expression may be regarded as a measure of <b>neutrophil</b> connectivity, with altered patterns of connectivity representing functionally distinct <b>neutrophil</b> states.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>neutrophil</b> {{migration}} and prolonged <b>neutrophil</b> contact on epithelial permeability was examined. Although <b>neutrophil</b> migration {{was not associated}} with a change in epithelial permeability, prolonged neutrophil-epithelial contact following migration resulted in an increase in epithelial permeability. These results were not altered by catalase, a specific <b>neutrophil</b> elastase inhibitor, methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone or cyclohexamide. This suggests that <b>neutrophil</b> migration does not occur via an H 2 O 2 -induced reversible mechanism of junctional opening, which we describe herein...|$|R
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and <b>neutrophils</b> (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The <b>neutrophils</b> also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The <b>neutrophils,</b> bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neutrophils</b> and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. <b>Neutrophils</b> are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, <b>neutrophils</b> migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E

When caries lesion is developing, it may invade to deeper tissues such as dental pulp and initiate cellular defenses such as <b>neutrophil.</b> <b>Neutrophil</b> is type of leukocytes which are important in phagocytosis process. If <b>neutrophil</b> fails in phagocytosis, <b>neutrophil</b> will be lysis and cause viability of <b>neutrophil</b> unprotected. Temulawak rhizome extract is predicted to increase viability of <b>neutrophil</b> because it contains curcuminoids, volatile oil, saponin, flavonoid, and tannin.

40|$|Macrolides {{have been}} shown to be {{effective}} in treating diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), although the precise modes of action remain unclear. At sites of airway inflammation, respiratory epithelium is considered an active participant in regulating <b>neutrophil</b> survival. We therefore examined the effect of erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, and josamycin on both <b>neutrophil</b> survival and on epithelial-derived factors, which influence <b>neutrophil</b> longevity. Media conditioned with transiently tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -�–stimulated A 549 human airway epithelial cells prolonged <b>neutrophil</b> survival compared with control media. The presence of dexamethasone during <b>neutrophil</b> culture led to further prolongation of <b>neutrophil</b> survival.

30|$|Septic hyperresistinemia {{strongly}} {{correlates with}} inhibition of <b>neutrophil</b> migration in vitro.

40|$|In {{experimental}} Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, the bacterial multiplication in {{the kidney}} parenchyma triggers {{a burst of}} <b>neutrophil</b> extravascular migration, {{as measured by the}} myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the kidney, a marker for tissue <b>neutrophil</b> infiltration. To test the mechanisms of in vivo <b>neutrophil</b> migration, pyelonephritis was surgically induced in rats that were then either complement-depleted with cobra venom factor (CVF), resulting in a profound hypocomplementemia for 72 h after inoculation, or treated with phenylbutazone (PB), a competitive antagonist of bacterial chemotactic formylpeptides. Compared to controls, CVF- and PB-treated animals killed when the <b>neutrophil</b> infiltration started (32 h) had a significantly reduced <b>neutrophil</b> infiltration, as measured by kidney MPO activity. This effect disappeared in animals killed 72 h after surgery, when <b>neutrophil</b> infiltration peaked. These data suggest that redundant chemotactic mechanisms triggered <b>neutrophil</b> migration.

40|$|Objective: Sepsis {{is defined}} as {{life-threatening}} organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. In this article, we reviewed the correlation between <b>neutrophil</b> dysfunction and sepsis. Data Sources: Articles published up to May 31, 2016, were selected from the PubMed databases, with the keywords of “neutrophil function”, “neutrophil dysfunction”, and “sepsis”. Study Selection: Articles were obtained and reviewed to analyze the <b>neutrophil</b> function in infection and <b>neutrophil</b> dysfunction in sepsis. Results: We emphasized the diagnosis of sepsis and its limitations. Pathophysiological mechanisms involve a generalized circulatory, immune, coagulopathic, and/or neuroendocrine response to infection. Many studies focused on <b>neutrophil</b> burst or cytokines. Complement activation, impairment of <b>neutrophil</b> migration, and endothelial lesions {{are involved in this}} progress. Alterations of cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators contribute to <b>neutrophil</b> dysfunction in sepsis. Conclusions: Sepsis represents a severe derangement of the immune response to infection, resulting in <b>neutrophil</b> dysfunction. <b>Neutrophil</b> dysfunction promotes sepsis and even leads to organ failure. Mechanism studies, clinical practice, and strategies to interrupt dysregulated <b>neutrophil</b> function in sepsis are desperately needed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neutrophil</b> elastase is a serine {{protease}} {{stored in the}} azurophilic granules of leukocytes. It has been implicated in the pathology of several lung diseases and is generally presumed {{to contribute to the}} tissue destruction and extracellular matrix damage associated with these conditions. To delineate the role of <b>neutrophil</b> elastase in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, <b>neutrophil</b> elastase-null mice were intratracheally instilled with bleomycin. In <b>neutrophil</b> elastase-null mice, biochemical and morphological characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis were attenuated for at least 60 days after bleomycin administration despite a typical response to bleomycin as evidenced by assessment of indices of DNA and cell damage. <b>Neutrophil</b> burden of bleomycin-treated wild-type and <b>neutrophil</b> elastase-null mice was comparable, and marked neutrophilic alveolitis was manifest in bleomycin-treated <b>neutrophil</b> elastase-null mice. An absence of immunostaining for active transforming growth factor (TGF) -β in lung tissue from bleomycin-treated <b>neutrophil</b> elastase-null mice suggested a defect in TGF-β activation, which was confirmed by biochemical assessment of TGF-β levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue.

5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, <b>neutrophils,</b> and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis.

Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|The immune system, {{particularly}} the innate component, plays a decisive role in tissue repair after an insult. Key actors include macrophages and <b>neutrophils,</b> but other cellular actors, including γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), are also important. The plasticity of immune cells {{and the balance}} between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair. Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well, for example in amphibians.

40|$|The {{search for}} a {{fundamental}} mechano-chemical process that results in net cell motion has led investigators to fit <b>neutrophil</b> tracking data to well described physical models in hopes of understanding the functional form of the driving force. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) equation for mean square displacement describes a locally persistent and globally random process and is often used {{as a starting point}} for analysis of <b>neutrophil</b> displacements. Based upon the apparently close fit of <b>neutrophil</b> tracking data to this equation and the nature of its derivation, biologists have inferred that the motor of the <b>neutrophil</b> is best represented as a random process. However, 24 of 37 <b>neutrophil</b> paths that we investigated preferentially display programmatic rather than Markov short term correlations between displacements or turn angles. These correlations reflect a bimodal rather than a uniform distribution of subpath correlations in the two variables, and are strongly sampling rate-dependent. Significant periodic components of <b>neutrophil</b> shape change are also detected at the same time scale using either Fourier or elliptical Fourier transform-based descriptors of the <b>neutrophil</b> perimeter.

These results suggest that IFN-gamma-induced <b>neutrophil</b> migration in vivo may be mediated by the release from resident macrophages of a <b>neutrophil</b> chemotactic factor and that dexamethasone blockade of <b>neutrophil</b> recruitment by IFN-gamma is due to inhibition of the release of this factor...|$|R
40|$|Background. Inhaled {{antibiotics}} {{are commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} cystic fibrosis lung disease. A previous study suggested <b>neutrophil</b> elastase activation by colistin in vitro. Here, we investigated direct effects of the commonly used antibiotics colistin and tobramycin on <b>neutrophil</b> elastase activity. Methods. <b>Neutrophil</b> elastase was measured spectrophotometrically. The antibiotics colistin and tobramycin were added in different concentrations with or without the addition of albumin. Results. Generally, <b>neutrophil</b> elastase activity was lower in the absence of albumin compared to its presence. Both antibiotics, colistin and tobramycin, had inhibitory effects on <b>neutrophil</b> elastase activity except for high concentrations of colistin when albumin was absent. Conclusions. Our results suggest inhibitory effects of colistin and tobramycin in vitro. There was a clear dependency of <b>neutrophil</b> elastase measurements on the presence of albumin.

25|$|<b>Neutrophils</b> are {{the most}} {{abundant}} white blood cell, constituting 60-70% of the circulating leukocytes. They defend against bacterial or fungal infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form pus. They are {{commonly referred to as}} polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands. This gives the <b>neutrophils</b> the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. <b>Neutrophils</b> are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds.

40|$|Rationale: The {{reduction}} of <b>neutrophil</b> {{migration to the}} bacterial focus is associated with poor outcome in sepsis. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was}} to identify soluble substances in the blood of septic mice that inhibit <b>neutrophil</b> migration. Methods: A pool of serum obtained from mice 2 hours after the induction of severe sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture inhibited the <b>neutrophil</b> migration. The proteins with inhibitory activity on <b>neutrophil</b> migration were isolated by Blue-Sepharose chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electrophoresis, and identified by mass spectrometry. Measurements and Main Results: Hemopexin was identified as the serum component responsible for the inhibition of <b>neutrophil</b> migration. In sepsis, the pretreatment of wild-type mice with hemopexin inhibited <b>neutrophil</b> migration to the focus of infection and decreased the survival rate from 87. 5 to 50. 0 %. Hemopexin-null mice subjected to severe sepsis presented normal <b>neutrophil</b> migration, low bacteremia, and an improvement of 40 % in survival rate. Moreover, hemopexin inhibited the <b>neutrophil</b> chemotaxis response evoked by C 5 a or macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 and induced a {{reduction of}} CXCR 2 and L-selectin as well as the up-regulation of CD 11 b expression in <b>neutrophil</b> membranes. The inhibitory effect of hemopexin on <b>neutrophil</b> chemotaxis was prevented by serine protease inhibitors or ATP. In addition, serum levels of ATP were decreased 2 hours after severe sepsis. Conclusions: These data demonstrate for the first time the inhibitory role of hemopexin in <b>neutrophil</b> migration during sepsis and suggest that the therapeutic inhibition of hemopexin or its protease activity could improve <b>neutrophil</b> migration to the focus of infection and survival in sepsis.
