5000|$|The {{original}} seal {{was designed}} by James A. [...] and cast by Richard Fuller and {{was adopted by the}} Seattle City Council in 1937. Previous to its adoption in 1937, the city had used a <b>notary</b> type <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{notarial}} act (or notarial instrument or notarial writing) is any written narration {{of facts}} (recitals) {{drawn up by}} a notary public or civil-law notary authenticated by his signature and official seal and detailing a procedure which has been transacted by or before him in his official capacity. A notarial act is the only lawful means of proving those facts {{of which it is}} the recognized record, whereas on other matters it is usually inadmissible, because, being beyond the powers entrusted to the notary by law, it is non-official. In most common-law countries, multiple-page acts are bound together using a sewn or knotted ribbon (referred to as silk), the ends of which are secured by a wafer impressed with the <b>notary's</b> <b>seal.</b> This is called annexing or annexure.|$|R
50|$|An eNotary is a Notary Public who notarizes {{documents}} electronically. One of {{the methods}} employed by eNotaries {{is the use of}} a digital signature and digital <b>notary</b> <b>seal</b> to notarize digital documents and validate with a digital certificate. Electronic notarization is a process whereby a notary affixes an electronic signature and <b>notary</b> <b>seal</b> using a secure Public key to an electronic document (such as a PDF or Word document). Once affixed to the electronic document, the document is rendered tamper evident such that unauthorized attempts to alter the document will be evident to relying parties. The e-notary will use cryptography and Public key infrastructure to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke the digital certificate. The Electronic Notary also must keep an electronic register of each act performed.|$|E

He then goes travelling around Italy using Philippe's name and bank account, even flawlessly mimicking his voice and mannerisms; in effect, Tom has become Philippe, even affixing his own photo, with <b>notary</b> <b>seal,</b> in Philippe's passport. He rents a large suite in a Rome hotel.|$|E
50|$|Virginia law {{requires}} a notary {{to use a}} seal on every document they notarize. The law specifies that when a seal is used {{that it must be}} sharp, legible, permanent and photographically reproducible. Also, it is recommended that the <b>notary</b> <b>seal</b> be imprinted or stampped just below the notarial statement. Care should be taken to not obscure the signatures or other parts of the document.|$|E
5000|$|A notary, {{in almost}} all common law jurisdictions other than most of North America, is a {{practitioner}} trained in the drafting and execution of legal documents. Notaries traditionally recorded matters of judicial importance as well as private transactions or events where an officially authenticated record or a document drawn up with professional skill or knowledge was required. The functions of notaries specifically include the preparation of certain types of documents (including international contracts, deeds, wills, and powers of attorney) and certification of their due execution, administering of oaths, witnessing affidavits and statutory declarations, certification of copy documents, noting and protesting of bills of exchange, and the preparation of ships' protests.Documents certified by <b>notaries</b> are <b>sealed</b> with the <b>notary's</b> <b>seal</b> or stamp and are recorded by the notary in a register (also called a [...] "protocol") maintained and permanently kept by him or her. These are known as [...] "notarial acts". In countries subscribing to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents or Apostille Convention, only one further act of certification is required, known as an apostille, and is issued by a government department (usually the Foreign Affairs Department or similar). For countries which are not subscribers to that convention, an [...] "authentication" [...] or [...] "legalization" [...] must be provided by {{one of a number}} of methods, including by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the country from which the document is being sent or the embassy, Consulate-General, consulate or High Commission of the country to which it is being sent.|$|R
50|$|Notaries in {{the state}} of New Jersey serve as {{impartial}} witnesses to the signing of documents, attests to the signature on the document, and may also administer oaths and affirmations. Seals are not required; many people prefer them and as a result, most <b>notaries</b> have <b>seals</b> in addition to stamps. Notaries may administer oaths and affirmations to public officials and officers of various organizations. They may also administer oaths and affirmations in order to execute jurats for affidavits/verifications, and to swear in witnesses.|$|R

50|$|Various statutes, rules, and {{regulations}} govern notaries public. California law sets maximum, but not minimum, fees for services related to notarial acts (e.g., per signature: acknowledgment $15, jurat $15, certified {{power of attorney}} $15, et cetera) A finger print (typically the right thumb) may be required in the notary journal based on the transaction in question (e.g., deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust affecting real property, power of attorney document, et cetera). Documents with blank spaces cannot be notarized (a further anti-fraud measure). California explicitly prohibits notaries public from using literal foreign language translation of their title.The use of a <b>notary</b> <b>seal</b> is required.|$|E
50|$|Black {{and other}} {{minorities}} at OSP have an acute problem with the librarian {{when it comes to}} their gaining access to courts. First we recognize racism is an ingrained traditional attitude. And second, prisons are reflections of those views. Therefore, Blacks and others in their own wherewithal struggle towards the path of freedom through redress in our courts. But quite often the librarian tries to preclude these efforts in many different ways. Such as telling prisoners his <b>notary</b> <b>seal</b> is broken and of course this tactic will go on for two or three weeks until one of the counselors puts a stop to it, being that if the librarian doesn't notarize documents they will have to do his job.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>notary</b> <b>seal</b> of {{the rubber}} stamp type is {{required}} to be affixed to all notarized paper documents. The rubber stamp must include the commissioned name of the notary public, the words [...] "Notary Public-State of Florida", the notary's commission number, and the date on which the notary's commission expires. Prior to the mid-1970s, the only statutory requirement regarding notarial seals was that one be used and that it include the words [...] "Notary Public" [...] and [...] "State of Florida at Large"; {{the name of the}} notary was optional, and the law did not specify what types of seals were permissible. This law was later amended to state that the seal must be round in design and of either the rubber stamp or impression type. In the early 1990s, the statute was again changed to require a rubber stamp seal, with an impression type seal being optional and not acceptable unless used in conjunction with a rubber stamp. However, many notaries continue to use the impression seal with their rubber stamp to allow for easy detection when trying to determine which document is an original. This process is made more difficult for notaries who only use a rubber stamp seal, as the Florida statutes require that the seal be affixed in only photographically-reproducible black ink.|$|E
5000|$|Pennsylvania notaries {{are governed}} by Title 57 of the Pennsylvania Statutes, known as the Notary Public Law. Act 151 of 2002 amended Title 57, {{bringing}} about the most significant changes to the Notary Public Law in 50 years. In effect since July 1, 2003, these changes include required education for notaries, specific signer identification procedures, eligibility of nonresidents to hold notarial commission, embossing seal no longer required on notarized documents, and authorization for electronic notarization. As {{a result of the}} repeal of the embosser requirement the wording [...] "Commonwealth of Pennsylvania" [...] is recommended to be clearly written or typed along the top border of the <b>Notary</b> Public's notarial <b>seal.</b>|$|R
60|$|On the morrow I buried Andres de Fonseca, {{but with}} no pomp, for he had said that he wished as little money as {{possible}} spent upon his dead body, {{and returned to the}} house to meet the <b>notaries.</b> Then the <b>seals</b> were broken and the parchments read and I was put in full possession of the dead man's wealth, and having deducted such sums as were payable for dues, legacies, and fees, the notaries left me bowing humbly, for was I not rich? Yes, I was rich, wealth had come to me without effort, and I had reason to desire it, yet this was the saddest night that I had passed since I set foot in Spain, for my mind was filled with doubts and sorrow, and moreover my loneliness got a hold of me. But sad as it might be, it was destined to seem yet more sorrowful before the morning. For as I sat making pretence to eat, a servant came to me saying that a woman waited in the outer room who had asked to see his late master. Guessing that this was some client who had not heard of Fonseca's death I was about to order that she should be dismissed, then bethought me that I might be of service to her or at the least forget some of my own trouble in listening to hers. So I bade him bring her in. Presently she came, a tall woman wrapped in a dark cloak that hid her face. I bowed and motioned to her to be seated, when suddenly she started and spoke.|$|R
50|$|The {{wording of}} Sublimis Deus {{was a general}} pronouncement, framed in terms that applied not only to Indians but to all unknown peoples. The {{principal}} passage reads:The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds {{in order to bring}} men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of receiving the Catholic Faith.We, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek with all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to receive it. Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any <b>notary</b> public and <b>sealed</b> with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, the said Indians and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect.|$|R
