40|$|Purpose – Many <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> are {{employed}} in practice to improve the performance of supply chains. But {{there is a lack}} of research that can offer guidance to practitioners in choosing the best <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> among a group of popular contracts. This paper aims to fill this gap by developing an intelligent rule-based <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> design system for choosing the best contract and its parameters from a supplier's point of view. Design/methodology/approach – The approach used in this paper is based on the comparison of several <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> that are encountered in supply chain practice. The paper aims at identifying the conditions under which one <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> outperforms another from the supplier's perspective. To facilitate the implementation of the decision-making rules that are developed in this research, an intelligent decision support system is developed. Findings – Six popular contracts are analysed; returns policy (RP), quantity discount (QD), target rebate (TR), backup agreement (BA), quantity flexibility (QF), and quantity commitment (QC). The main findings are: QD contracts generate larger expected profits for the supplier than TR contracts do when the demand is exogenous, an RP contract is better than a QD contract when the wholesale profit margin is sufficiently large and that the optimal QC contract always provides a higher expected service level than BA and QF contracts. Originality/value – The paper presents an approach for developing an intelligent <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> design system that can offer guidance to practitioners in choosing the best <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> for a particular supplier...|$|R
40|$|A <b>supply</b> <b>contract,</b> which {{achieves}} {{the optimal}} {{performance for the}} buyer or the supply chain as a whole, does not necessarily maximize the supplier’s expected profit. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the impacts of <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> and their differences from a supplier’s perspective, which is the aim of this thesis. This thesis considers six types of <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> namely, Returns Policy, Quantity Discount, Channel Rebate, Backup Agreement, Quantity Flexibility, and Quantity Commitment, in a supply chain of seasonal goods with a single selling season with a retailer and a supplier. Each contract is modelled in the framework of the interaction between the retailer’s and the supplier’s decisions. The contract parameters are optimized to maximise the supplier’s expected profit with consideration of retailer’s acceptance. Furthermore, the impacts of the demand pattern and cost structure on the performance of each contract are investigated. These contracts are then compared with each other and the best contracts are identified for various situations. In order to facilitate the <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> selection in practice, a rule-based decision support system has been developed using Visual Basic, for user interfaces and MATLAB for the optimization engine. The rule base embodies the outcome of the comparison of <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> and therefore is able to direct the system to select the best <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> for a particular situation.

We find that if nonlinear <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> are feasible, an exclusive dealing arrangement offers an upstream firm no advantage {{it would not have}} had without the arrangement. If a fully integratred (horizontally and vertically) firm would sell only one product, an upstream firm can foreclose its rival with a nonlinear <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> and achieve the same profit it would receive if it required exclusive dealing. If a fully integrated firm would sell both products, the feasibility of nonlinear <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> renders it unprofitable to foreclose, with or without exclusive dealing...|$|R

40|$|A {{review was}} made of the current and past use of {{long-term}} <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> in the forestry, coal, and natural gas industries to assess the applicability of long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> in bioenergy and why they are not prevalent. To assess past use, an extensive literature review was undertaken. In determining the current use of long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> professionals throughout woody biomass supply chain were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Participants represented forest landowners (non-industrial and industrial), pellet and biofuel producers, forestry management consultants, procurement firms, and energy producers (Biomass facilities, investor-owned utilities, and electric cooperatives). Participants were asked about their experiences with long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> willingness to enter into future long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> and factors that impact the decision-making process for decided whether to sell on the spot market or enter a long-term contract. Current use of long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> was mixed, with only a few participants having willingly entered into a long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contract.</b> Several participants, who currently did not utilize long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts,</b> believed they had a system that worked and saw no need to change what “wasn’t broken. ” At the same time, many of these participants were open to considering long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> in the future. Participants indicated several factors that were important to them when considering long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts.</b> Loss of control was particularly important for nonindustrial private timberland owners. Control was also important to other stakeholders in the bioenergy supply chain. These stakeholders believed long-term contracts could help them control the market by minimizing risk. Other important factors mentioned were the scale of operations to back a contract, pricing, use of long-term offtake agreements, building mills in areas with less competition, and the higher costs of bioenergy. Results from this study suggest the current lack of long-term <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> is attributable to a combination of relatively easy availability of wood, consumers not willing to pay a premium for a less efficient energy source as compared to coal, and stakeholders in the bioenergy supply chain being satisfied with their current system to procure/sell fiber. So is the current status quo likely to change? The answer is complicated. Due to the inefficiencies of woody biomass for energy and the efficiencies of using fossil fuels, bioenergy is not likely to gain significant market share without consumers being willing to pay more for energy. In places where it has expanded in use, contracts have usually been backed by subsidies. In the end, possibly the most important factor is how stakeholders view long-term contracts as a strategy. Buyers in this study mentioned them being financial undesirable due to their higher costs associated with price premiums. Sellers, on the other hand, said they felt long-term contracts would limit their ability to receive maximum value for their timber. Is it possible for them to be both? Well if the contract includes a rolling average pricing mechanism, it’s possible that at times it will be the highest priced/cost timber, and at other times the lowest priced/cost timber. It will however, never reach the market peaks or troughs that parties might experience in the spot market. Thus, if layered appropriately, it’s possible to keep your revenue/expenses relatively flat compared to participating in the spot market. This strategy is utilized by many Utilities and allows them to focus on eliminating inefficiencies elsewhere in their business while guaranteeing a steady supply/price. Thus, if parties looked at long-term contracts as a way to minimize market risk, via lowering market swings, we could see an increased future use of long-term contracts in the bioenergy and forestry industries...|$|R

40|$|A {{manufacturer}} writes <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> with N buyers. Then, {{the buyers}} invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> {{to achieve an}} efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage in renegotiation design, inserting simple clauses into the <b>supply</b> <b>contract</b> to shape the outcome of renegotiation. For example, when a buyer grants a financial "hostage" to the manufacturer or is charged a per diem penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the gain from renegotiation. "Tradable options," which grant buyers the right to trade capacity without intervention from the manufacturer, return the gain from renegotiation to the buyers. This paper proves that, under surprisingly general conditions, the firms can coordinate their investments with the simplest of <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> (fixed-quantity contracts).

In addition, due to their flexible operation, CCGT plants are a useful support for {{the integration of the}} growing renewable energy installed capacity. Consequently, during the last years, CCGT plants have proliferated in electricity systems, increasing the global demand of natural gas (NG). In order to guarantee the NG supply and to hedge the price volatility, electricity generation companies (Gencos) sign <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> with NG producers. Typically, NG producers force long-term contracts in order to recover their huge capital investments. Therefore, Gencos should optimize the exercise of the <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> in the long-term scope in order to maximize their profits in the electricity market. However, the optimal exercise of the <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> on behalf of the Gencos could be impeded because of possible bottlenecks in the NG system. Accordingly, this paper proposes a methodology to incorporate both the characteristics of NG <b>supply</b> <b>contracts</b> and the congestions in the NG system in an electricity market model that could support the decision-making process on behalf of the Gencos. A study case illustrates the methodology. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
