50|$|In early 2007, {{scientists}} {{created an}} entirely new proxy to determine annual mean air temperature on land—based on molecules from the cell membrane of soil inhabiting bacteria. Recently, Scientists from the NIOZ, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research conducted a temperature record dating back to 25,000 years ago. In concord with the German colleague of the University of Bremen, this detailed record shows the history of land temperatures based on the molecular fossils of soil bacteria. When applying this to the outflow core of the Congo River, the core contained eroded land material and microfossils from marine algae. That concluded that the land environment of tropical Africa was cooled more than the bordering Atlantic Ocean during the last ice-age. Since the Congo River drains {{a large part of}} tropical central Africa, the land derived material gives an integrated signal for a very large area. These findings further enlighten in <b>natural</b> <b>disparities</b> in climate and the possible costs of a warming earth on precipitation in central Africa.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} online user {{attention}} during informa-tion seeking tasks have mainly focused on analyzing searcher {{behavior in the}} web search settings. While these studies enabled better understanding of search result examination, their findings might not generalize for the tasks and search interfaces in other domains such as Shopping or Social Me-dia. In this paper we present, to best of our knowledge, the first cross-domain comparison of search examination behav-ior and patterns of aggregated attention across Web Search, News, Shopping and Social Network domains. We investi-gate how domain of the search and {{the scope of the}} infor-mation need affect search examination, and find significant differences beyond those arising from <b>natural</b> <b>disparities</b> be-tween individuals. For example, we find that the mean fix-ation duration, a common indicator of cognitive load, varies significantly across domains (e. g., mean fixation duration in the Social Network domain exceeds that of general Web Search by over 30 %). We also find large differences in the aggregate patterns of user attention on the screen, especially in the Shopping and Social Network domains compared to the Web Search domain, emphasizing the need for domain specific user models and evaluation metrics...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{and many}} animals have {{forward-facing}} eyes providing {{different views of}} the environment. Precise depth estimates {{can be derived from}} the resulting binocular disparities, but determining which parts of the two retinal images correspond to one another is computationally challenging. To aid the computation, the visual system focuses the search on a small range of disparities. Analysis of the statistics of natural scenes has revealed evidence that the brain exploits regularities to efficiently encode the visual world. We asked whether the brain similarly exploits the disparities encountered during binocular viewing of the natural environment. We did this by simultaneously measuring binocular eye position and 3 D scene geometry during natural tasks using a novel device that can reconstruct a participant’s retinal image while they perform natural tasks such as socializing, navigating, and making a sandwich. We find that the <b>natural</b> distribution of <b>disparities</b> is indeed matched to the statistics of <b>natural</b> <b>disparity,</b> allowing for a smaller range of correspondence search. Furthermore, the distribution of disparity explains the perception of some ambiguous stereograms. Finally, disparity preferences of macaque cortical neurons are consistent with the natural distribution. Analysis of the disparities resulting from simulated eye positions yields notably different distributions, suggesting that models of disparity processing should carefully consider how assumptions about eye position could influence the results. We conclude that binocular neural processes are well-matched to the regularities of the 3 D environment...|$|R
30|$|Submarine {{groundwater}} discharge (SGD) {{is described as}} submarine inflow of fresh and brackish groundwater from land into the sea. The release of sewages from point and non-point source pollutants from industries, agricultural and domestic activities gets discharged through groundwater to ocean creating <b>natural</b> <b>disparity</b> like decreasing flora fauna and phytoplankton blooms. Hence, to quantify fluxes of SGD in coastal regions is important. Quantification of SGD was attempted in Coleroon estuary, India, using three dissimilar methods like water budget, Darcy law and manual seepage meter. Three seepage meters were installed at two prominent litho units (alluvium and fluvio marine) {{at a distance of}} (0 – 14.7  km) away from Bay of Bengal. The water budget and Darcy law-quantified submarine seepage at a rate of 6.9  ×  106 and 3.2  ×  103 to 308.3  ×  103  m 3  year− 1, respectively, and the seepage meter quantified seepage rate of 0.7024  m h− 1 at an average. Larger seepage variations were isolated from three different techniques and the seepage rates were found to be influenced by hydrogeological characteristics of the litho units and distance from the coast.|$|R

40|$|Binocular {{disparity}} is {{the input}} to stereopsis, {{which is a}} very strong depth cue in humans. However, the distribution of binocular disparities in natural environments has not been quantitatively measured. In this study, we converted distances from accurate range maps of forest scenes and indoor scenes into the disparities that an observer would encounter, given an eye model and fixation distances (which we measured for the forest environment, and simulated for the indoor environment). We found that the distributions of <b>natural</b> <b>disparities</b> in these two kinds of scenes are centered at zero, have high peaks, and span about 5 deg, which closely matches the macaque MT cells ’ disparity tuning range. These ranges are fully within the operational range of human stereopsis determined psychophysically. Suprathreshold disparities (910 arcsec) are common rather than exceptional. There is a prevailing notion that stereopsis only operates within a few meters, but our finding suggests that we should rethink the role of stereopsis at far viewing distances because of the abundance of suprathreshold disparities.

Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the <b>natural</b> <b>disparity</b> in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, {{such as the}} feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization {{can lead to a}} reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high testosterone, and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks that are normally erased and not passed between generations, can lead to an altered sexual preference when they escape erasure and are transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that gene coding for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to mismatched sexual preference in offspring.|$|R

40|$|Disparity {{selective}} {{cells in}} V 1 {{respond to the}} correlated receptive fields of {{the left and right}} retinae, which do not necessarily correspond to the same object in the 3 D scene, i. e., these cells respond equally to both false and correct stereo matches. On the other hand, neurons in the extrastriate visual area V 2 show much stronger responses to correct visual matches [Bakin et al, 2000]. This indicates that a part of the stereo correspondence problem is solved during disparity processing in these two areas. However, the mechanisms employed by the brain to accomplish this task are not yet understood. Existing computational models are mostly based on cooperative computations in V 1 [Marr and Poggio 1976, Read and Cumming 2007], without exploiting the potential benefits of the hierarchical structure between V 1 and V 2. Here we propose a two-layer graphical model for disparity estimation from stereo. The lower layer matches the linear responses of neurons with Gabor receptive fields across images. Nodes in the upper layer infer a sparse code of the disparity map and act as priors that help disambiguate false from correct matches. When learned on <b>natural</b> <b>disparity</b> maps, the receptive fields of the sparse code converge to oriented depth edges, which is consistent with the electrophysiological studies in macaque [von der Heydt et al, 2000]. Moreover, when such a code is used for depth inference in our two layer model, the resulting disparity map for the Tsukuba stereo pair [middlebury database] has 40 % less false matches than the solution given by the first layer. Our model offers a demonstration of the hierarchical disparity computation, leading to testable predictions about V 1 -V 2 interactions...|$|R

The analysis was carried out on three different geographical domains (3 divisions (north, central and south Italy), 20 administrative regions and 103 provinces) with municipalities as the elementary spatial unit. While the distribution of the three indicators was coherent across space, the coefficient of variation of the three indicators, taken as a proxy of regional disparities, showed a contrasting spatial pattern. Domains with higher average values of the sustainable development index showed a lower variability among municipalities, indicating a less divided territorial context. By contrast, income and <b>natural</b> capital <b>disparities</b> are decoupled from the average level of the respective indexes. Multivariate analysis identifies a north-south gradient reflecting the divide between competitive and economically-disadvantaged regions in Italy.

An alternative process leads to the surprising conclusion that each non-synonymous site has accumulated as many as 2. b substitutions, on the average, in the two lineages leading to humans and mice. The standard deviation is also very large (0. 0) and the dispersion index (the ratio of the variance to the mean) is at least 17.

That is, as the farm households have located distant from the market and the main road, they found out to be less participating in adopting both activities. To be precise, as farm households’ residence location from the proxy market and main road increased by 1 %, the joint adoption decision of the farm household will be declined by 6.8 and 17.6 % units respectively. Conversely, as farm households have better access to market and road, there will not be information asymmetry about market opportunities, and the transportation and time costs will be significantly declined. Similarly, studies (Barrett et al. 2001) in Uganda and Tanzania, and (Sills and Caviglia-Harris 2009) in Brazil reviled that access to market could significantly promote non-farm earning prospects.

This paper attempts to make an empirical assessment of how the price competitiveness of domestic producers stabilizes the Polish and Slovak economies in comparison to the real interest rate, that could potentially be procyclical in EMU. To address this issue, we revisit the econometric studies of weighting the Monetary Conditions Index (MCI-ratio) to explore the relative importance of the two channels. We apply the IS-curve approach and [...] as opposed to previous MCI-ratio literature [...] we build a small open economy DSGE framework to be estimated with classical forward-looking techniques (FIML). We compare the estimates and impulse-response functions for Poland and Slovakia, concluding that the latter country seems to be more capable of handling asymmetric demand shocks under the common monetary policy. At the same time, it remains more vulnerable to asymmetric cost-push shocks. Also, we examine the consequences of a permanent fall in the interest rates in the home economy after the accession to the monetary union. If there was a <b>natural</b> interest rate <b>disparity</b> of 1 percentage point in favour of the catching-up economy and agents expected a 30 -year long period of closing this gap, our model would predict a terms of trade appreciation for both countries in question, whereby the required appreciation would be more pronounced for Poland than for Slovakia (9. 9 % and 2. 6 % respectively). competitiveness channel, EMU, MCI-ratio, DSGE, forward-looking estimation. ...|$|R

In this study, we used a time-calibrated phylogeny of 70 Iberian species of short-horned grasshoppers (Acrididae) to test for patterns of morphological disparity {{in relation to their}} ecology and phylogenetic history. Specifically, we examined the role of substrate type and level of ecological specialization in driving different aspects of morphological evolution (locomotory traits, chemosensitive organs and cranial morphology) in this recent radiation. Results: We found a bimodal distribution of locomotory attributes corresponding to the two main substrate type guilds (plant vs. ground); plant-perching species tend to exhibit larger wings and thicker femora than those that remain on the ground. This suggests that life form (i. e., substrate type) is an important driving force in the evolution of morphological traits in short-horned grasshoppers, irrespective of ancestry. Substrate type and ecological specialization had no significant influence on head shape, a trait that showed a strong phylogenetic conservatism. Finally, we also found a marginal significant association between the length of antennae and the level of ecological specialization, suggesting that the development of sensory organs may be favored in specialist species.

Is there {{a connection between the}} older settlements linked together by dry-stone walls and the late Iron Age settlements? Does the picture differ from the one presented for the Gotland region? How well are the general theories about different settlement development depending on basic natural conditions as for the potentials for cultivation and topography, corresponding to the physical remains?  Are there other factors involved when the settlement structure takes its form? The methods that are used here constitutes mainly of a comparison between different locations in the Mälar Valley that has got a well known prehistory thanks to extensive archaeological excavations. Cadastral maps, soilmaps, topography maps and maps over ancient monuments are intertwined to the same map and analyzed through works in Geographical information systems. The results of this study reveal an interesting suspicion in the continuity-question through the Iron Age. Certain settlements seem to be more stable than what was earlier assumed in the general models.  This occurrence of continuous use of sites must also be seen in a spatial context and not only a pattern formed by randomly chosen locations. The research has shown that it may be connected to the local political power in the Iron Age community. Related to this are also the different settlement forms where more than one unit occurs on a site.
