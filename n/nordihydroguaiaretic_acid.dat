40|$|Lipoxygenase {{metabolites}} of {{arachidonic acid}} {{can act as}} growth promoting factors for various cancer cell lines. Here we demonstrate that the 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> potently inhibits anchorage-independent growth of human pancreatic and cervical cancer cells in soft agar and delays growth of pancreatic and cervical tumours established in athymic mice. Furthermore, <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> induces apoptosis of these cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Potential mechanisms mediating these effects of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> were examined. <b>Nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> had no inhibitory effect on growth and survival signals such as tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor or basal and growth factor-stimulated activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2, p 70 s 6 k and AKT but selectively inhibited expression of cyclin D 1 in the cancer cells. In addition, treatment with <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> lead to a disruption of the filamentous actin cytoskeleton in human pancreatic and cervical cancer cells which was accompanied by the activation of Jun-NH 2 -terminal kinase and p 38 mapk.

40|$|The rising use {{of natural}} {{products}} creates an imperative need for an enhanced awareness of the safety of current and new products making {{their way into the}} marketplace. An important example is natural products containing lignans as the principal active component. Despite their structural similarity the lignan of creosote bush can cause hepato- and renal toxicity while the lignans of flaxseed have no reported serious toxicity. This dissertation aimed to investigate the oxidative metabolism of such lignans to determine whether reversible, competitive interactions and/or bioactivation may explain the differences in their apparent toxicity. The first objective was to study the metabolism and bioactivation of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> (creosote bush) and secoisolariciresinol (flaxseed). <b>Nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism in rat liver microsomes led to the production of three glutathione adducts formed via ortho¬-quinone reactive intermediates. This metabolism was independent of NADPH and thus attributed to autoxidation. Secoisolariciresinol metabolism yielded lariciresinol and no glutathione adducts suggesting an absence of bioactivation to reactive quinone intermediates. The second objective was to study the autoxidation of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid.</b> The major autoxidation product was a unique, stable schisandrin-like cyclolignan which was the result of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> cyclization. The half-life of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> in aqueous solution, pH 7. 4, 37 ºC is 3. 14 hours suggesting the cyclolignan may be responsible for some of the biological effects of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid.</b> The third objective was to study the inhibition of cytochrome P 450 isoforms 1 A 2, 2 B, 2 C 11 and 3 A by lignans derived from creosote bush and flaxseed. None of the lignans caused irreversible inhibition. Both creosote bush and flaxseed lignans caused reversible inhibition of P 450 enzyme activity that involved competitive or mixed-type inhibition, however the inhibition was present at nonphysiologically relevant concentrations. Activation of cytochrome P 450 isoforms was also observed at low lignan concentrations. The results suggest that P 450 -mediated bioactivation or reversible inhibition cannot explain the differences in toxicity noted between the lignans of creosote bush and flaxseed. This work suggests a minimal risk for drug-lignan interactions at P 450 enzymes. Further studies are warranted to determine the presence and biological and toxicological role of the <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> cyclolignan in herbal preparations...|$|E

The effects of arachidonic acid are rapid, reach a maximum after 2 – 3 min and then decline.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} refines knowledge synthesis from publicly accessible databases, {{based on}} the model of D. R. Swanson. Knowledge synthesis endeavors bring together two or more non-interactive literatures to create combinatorial research data on a specific topic. In this endeavor the biomedical literature was searched on the anti-neoplastic agent <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> (NDGA) for its potential role as a functional food in the chemoprevention of breast cancer. Bibliometric cocitation was utilized to identify complementary but non-interactive literatures in the disciplines of biomedicine and dietary science. The continuing specialization and fragmentation of the cancer literature degenerates the potential usefulness of cross-disciplinary research and information. As the biomedical sciences become more specialized the potential increases for isolation of discoveries and for failures to connect science {{to the needs of the}} people. Within the information science discipline several techniques are available to bridge the isolation between discoveries recorded in different sets of literatures. Electronic database searching with combinatorial keyword entries, syllogistic modeling and bibliometric author cocitation analysis are the principle techniques applied in this endeavor. The research questions are addressed to the absence or presence of human in vivo research on breast cancer with the potentially chemopreventative functional food NDGA. Utilizing a syllogistic model the literatures of functional foods, <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> and breast cancer were searched with designated combinatorial keywords. The documents retrieved were subjected to author cocitation analysis to demonstrate disjointness or connectivity of the two complementary literatures. The results demonstrated a possible preventative relationship between breast cancer in women and <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid,</b> a phytochemical antioxidant and potential functional food. The results of this study are consistent with D. R. Swanson's pioneering work in knowledge synthesis. Swanson's methods can be used to identify non-interactive, disjoint literatures.

40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} {{cells were}} incubated {{in the presence}} of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and one of three inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism:indomethacin, an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase system; <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid,</b> an antioxidant that inhibits lipoxygenase; and icosatetraynoic acid, an acetylenic analogue of arachidonic acid that blocks all known pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism. Indomethacin was ineffective in blocking luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-stimulated luteinizing hormone secretion. <b>Nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> was only marginally capable of inhibiting luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-stimulated luteinizing hormone secretion. Icosatetraynoic acid at 10 microM completely inhibited stimulated luteinizing hormone secretion. Addition of several epoxygenated arachidonic acid metabolites to cells in vitro resulted in secretion of luteinizing hormone equal to or greater than that induced by 10 nM luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. The half-maximal effective dose for these compounds was approximately 50 nM. The 5, 6 -epoxyicosatrienoic acid was the most potent of the compounds tested. These studies suggest that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-stimulated luteinizing hormone release is closely coupled with the production of oxidized arachidonic acid metabolites.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of relaxation of rabbit aortic strips by carbachol {{and by the}} inhibitory factor from the bovine retractor penis (BRP) {{on the presence of}} endothelium has been compared. Carbachol-induced relaxation is abolished by removing the endothelium, inhibitory factor-induced relaxation is unimpaired. The inhibitory factor, therefore, does not act by releasing an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The effect of inhibitors of eicosanoid metabolism on relaxation was examined. Quinacrine and <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> abolished the relaxant effect of carbachol and flurbiprofen had no effect. The relaxation produced by the inhibitory factor was unaffected by quinacrine and flurbiprofen while <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> potentiated the response. No eicosanoid appears, therefore, {{to be involved in the}} relaxant effect of the inhibitory factor from the BRP. Methylene blue, a drug reported to inhibit guanylate cyclase, in a concentration of 10 microM selectively abolished the relaxation produced by carbachol. However, at the higher concentration of 30 microM it abolished almost completely the response to inhibitory factor from the BRP and reduced inhibition by sodium nitroprusside.

40|$|Many flavone {{derivatives}} inhibit FAS, {{and their}} A and B rings {{play an important}} role, but is the C ring necessary for the inhibition of FAS? Here, using <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> (NDGA), with two phenyl rings connected by a four-carbon chain, as a representative, the structural basis for the inhibition of animal fatty acid synthase (FAS) by polyphenols was investigated. NDGA potently inhibits the overall reaction of FAS (IC 50 = 9. 3 – 0. 1 lM). The kinetic study indicated that NDGA inhibits FAS competitively with respect to acetyl-CoA, noncompetitively with respect to malonyl-CoA, and in a mixed manner with respect toNADPH. The inhibitorymechanismisthesameasthatofFASflavonoidinhibitors. This suggests that the C ring of flavonoids is not essential for their FAS inhibitory effect. This conclusion was further confirmed by the results obtained for different polyphenols. A structure-activity relationship study indicated that a biphenyl core exists in all FAS polyphenol inhibitors. Thus, we propose a common model possibly shared by all FAS polyphenol inhibitors. The model includes two almost planar aromatic rings with their respective hydroxyl groups, and a proper ester linkage between the two rings that possibly causes the inhibition of FAS by irreversibly inhibiting the b-ketoacyl reductase domain.

In addition, the effects of the ethanolic extract and its main metabolite, <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid,</b> on bile secretion in the perfused liver were tested. In the experiment on prevention of gallstones, the dry ethanolic extract at a level of 0. 5 % of diet completely inhibited gallstone formation, lowered biliary moles percent cholesterol and increased the proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid of hepatic bile. The dry aqueous extract at a level of 1 % of diet did not affect gallstone frequency or biliary parameters. In the experiment on elimination of gallstones, the ethanolic extract significantly reduced gallstone frequency, gallbladder bile cholesterol concentration and moles percent cholesterol.

40|$|Intact actin microfilaments are {{required}} for insulin-regulated glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT 4) translocation to the plasma membrane. Lipoxygenase (LO) metabolites have recently been shown {{to contribute to the}} regulation of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. In the present investigation, ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to study the effects of two structurally different LO inhibitors (esculetin and <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid)</b> on insulin signalling events, glucose uptake, GLUT 4 translocation and the actin network organization. Insulin stimulation increased glucose uptake 3 -fold in control cells, whereas LO inhibition completely blocked this effect. This was paralleled by a slight reduction in the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1 and IRS- 2. However, inhibition of 12 -LO did not affect the association of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase with IRS- 1 and the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B in response to insulin. Addition of 12 (S) -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid almost completely restored the insulin action in cells exposed to <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid.</b> Insulin stimulation increased cell surface GLUT 4 2 -fold in control cells, whereas LO inhibition abrogated the insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation. LO inhibition induced a prominent disassembly of actin fibres compared with control cells. In conclusion, we show here that 12 (S) -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid plays a role in the organization of the actin network in cardiomyocytes. LO inhibition blocks GLUT 4 translocation without affecting downstream insulin signalling. These data suggest that LO metabolites participate in the regulation of glucose transport by contributing to a rearrangement of actin cytoskeletal elements...|$|E

The present report describes the determination of luminol- or lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence of whole blood in a microtitre plate assay with a 96 -well luminometer (HAMAMATSU MTP reader®). Using heparinized venous human blood from healthy donors, optimal chemiluminescence intensities were determined at a blood dilution of 1 / 100 in a total volume of 0. 25 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution, containing 0. 4 mmol/l luminol as enhancer and either opsonized zymosan (1 g/ 1) or the phorbol ester, 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (10 ~ 6 mol/l), as stimuli. The in vitro effects of <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid,</b> diphenylene iodonium, and diclofenac were tested.

40|$|Although {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) in the CA 1 {{region of the}} hippocampus is initiated postsynaptically by the influx of Ca 2 + through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels, the maintenance of LTP {{seems to be at}} least in part presynaptic. This suggests that the postsynaptic cell releases a retrograde messenger to activate the presynaptic terminals. It is likely that this messenger is membrane-permeant and reaches the presynaptic neuron by diffusion. We therefore have investigated two major membrane-permeant candidate retrograde messengers, arachidonic acid and nitric oxide (NO). Consistent with arachidonic acid or a lipoxygenase metabolite being a retrograde messenger, the phospholipase A 2 and lipoxygenase inhibitor <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> blocked LTP in the guinea pig CA 1 region in vitro. However, arachidonic acid (up to 100 microM) did not reliably produce activity-independent LTP, and activity-dependent potentiation by arachidonic acid was blocked by DL-aminophosphonovaleric acid. Since <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> also interferes with signal transduction involving NO, we next examined whether inhibitors of NO synthase block LTP. NG-Nitro-L-arginine blocked LTP when given in the bath, and this inhibition was partially overcome by high concentrations of L-arginine, suggesting that the inhibitor is specific to NO synthase. NG-Nitro-L-arginine and NG-methyl-L-arginine (but not NG-methyl-D-arginine) also blocked LTP when injected intracellularly, indicating that NO synthase is located in the postsynaptic cell. The NO, in turn, seems to be released into the extracellular space, since bathing the slice with hemoglobin, a protein that binds NO and is not taken up by cells, also blocked LTP. Moreover, NO enhances spontaneous presynaptic release of transmitter from hippocampal neurons in dissociated cell culture. These data favor the idea that NO might be a retrograde messenger in LTP...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether interference with the metabolism of arachidonic acid or the entry of extracellular calcium affects the responses of the canine saphenous vein to acetylcholine, potassium or norepinephrine. Rings of canine saphenous vein, with or without endothelium, were suspended in organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution and set at their optimal length for isometric tension recording. Removal of the endothelium, confirmed by the absence of the characteristic relaxation induced by thrombin in intact rings, did not affect concentration-response curves to acetylcholine or norepinephrine. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, augmented the response to acetylcholine. This effect was comparable in rings with and without endothelium and in rings pretreated with phentolamine. Indomethacin did not alter the response to norepinephrine but augmented that to potassium. Similar results were obtained with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid and meclofenamate. The antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibitor <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid</b> and the cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone blocked the ability of indomethacin to augment acetylcholine- and potassium-induced contractions. Arachidonic acid-induced contractions were not blocked by indomethacin but were inhibited by <b>nordihydroguaiaretic</b> <b>acid,</b> phenidone and the calcium entry blockers diltiazem and nimodipine. Diltiazem and nimodipine inhibited responses to potassium and acetylcholine without affecting those to norepinephrine. The augmentation by indomethacin of potassium- and acetylcholine-evoked contractions with inhibited by diltiazem and nimodipine. In rings of femoral artery denuded of endothelium, indomethacin had no effect on the responses to acetylcholine, norepinephrine or potassium. These results suggest that, in the canine saphenous vein but not in the femoral artery, activation of the lipoxygenase pathway for the metabolism of arachidonic acid augments preferentially contractions which depend upon the entry of extracellular calcium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
