5000|$|A Monster's Ball {{match is}} a {{professional}} wrestling, hardcore match staged by Global Force Wrestling. The key premise of the match was that all contenders are sequestered alone in a locked room without light, food or water for twenty-four hours before the match. This stipulation is intended to induce extreme feelings of aggression in the competitors. Once released, the wrestlers fight {{one another in a}} no disqualification match, with the usage of weapons encouraged. Victory can be achieved by pinfall or submission, with the match ending as soon as one wrestler is pinned or submits (there is no elimination format). The locked away stipulation was simply forgotten about, however, and not mentioned since the sixth one. It is now simply a Street Fight, as the match has to end inside the Ring. Many signature weapons include: Thumb tacks, [...] "Janice" [...] (Abyss' friend: A board filled with nails) and a bed of barbed wires. Due to the hardcore nature of the match, the Monster's Ball typically features numerous high spots. There has been a total of fourteen official matches, plus eleven occurring on Impact non-televised [...] "house shows" [...] and one match dubbed [...] "Monster's Ball" [...] by a <b>non-affiliated</b> <b>company,</b> although it featured Impact wrestler Abyss. There is apparently no set number of wrestlers although it is generally four. The smallest official match was a one-on-one match at Bound for Glory (2009) and Slammiversary VIII.|$|E
40|$|Japanese-style {{management}} {{is characterized by}} the traditional practice of so-called lifetime employment. Shukko {{plays an important role in}} supporting and supplementing Japanese long-term employment. Shukko involves the transfer of parent company employees to an affiliated company or a <b>non-affiliated</b> <b>company.</b> In Japan’s current prolonged recession, Japanese companies are forced to transfer employees to affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies in order to cut personnel expenses. So Shukko has negative implications. However, Shukko also has positive aspects. Japanese companies have strategies to educate and train employees and to enable them to acquire know-how through Shukko in affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies. This allows Japanese companies to adapt their capabilities in a flexible way to a changing environment.

Statistical analysis conducted in the framework of a linear fixed effects model indicates that the <b>non-affiliated</b> <b>companies</b> were liquidity constrained. The paper also sets out the corporate control structure as laid down in the trade law reform of 1884 and traces the origins of the current German dual board system, as well as the origins of several other aspects of the institutions that tied the German banking system to industrial concerns.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of debt in {{corporate}} governance {{with respect to a}} large emerging economy, India, where debt has been an important source of external finance. First, we examine the extent to which debt acts as a disciplining device in those corporations where potential for over investment is present. We undertake a comparative evaluation of group-affiliated and <b>non-affiliated</b> <b>companies</b> to see if the governance role of debt is sensitive to ownership and control structures. Second, we examine {{the role of}} institutional change in strengthening the disciplining effect or mitigating the expropriating effect of debt. In doing so, we estimate, simultaneously, the relation between Tobin’s Q and leverage using a large cross-section of listed manufacturing firms in India for three years, 1996, 2000, and 2003. Our analyses indicate that while {{in the early years of}} institutional change, debt did not have any disciplinary effect on either standalone or group affiliated firms, the disciplinary effect appeared in the later years as institutions become more market oriented. We also find limited evidence of debt being used as an expropriation mechanism in group firms that are more vulnerable to such expropriation. However, the disciplining effect of debt is found to persist even after controlling for such expropriation possibilities. In general, our results highlight the role of ownership structures and institutions in debt governance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the function of}} corporate governance of the zaibatsu holding companies. Since 19 th century, {{or in some cases}} since 17 th century, zaibatsu accumulated assets and diversified them into various businesses. Expansion and diversification of the businesses caused problems which resulted from asymmetric information, namely adverse selection and moral hazard of the agents who executed the businesses. In order to resolve these problems, zaibatsu introduced organizational innovation. By early 1920 's, each zaibatsu established the holding company, while it separated the businesses into joint-stock companies. The holding company of zaibatsu had the organizations and full-time stuffs to monitor the affiliated companies. In many cases, the concerning sections of the holding company, such as the section of audit, inspection etc., checked the budget and financial data of the affiliated companies, while the matters {{of the board of directors}} were approved by the holding company ex ante and ex post. There existed systematic rules on the allocation of powers between the holding company and the affiliated companies. Also, the holding company frequently dispatched directors to the affiliated companies. The efficacy of these devices of governance was tested quantitatively. We compared ROE between zaibatsu affiliated firms and non-zaibatsu firms, using panel data of 135 firms from 1922 to 1936. By controlling the effects of company scale, industry-specific shocks, and macro-shocks, we obtained the result that zaibatsu-affiliated firms clearly outperformed the other companies. This result supports the hypothesis that the zaibatsu holding company played the role of monitoring the affiliated companies. Besides this governance function concerning the affiliated companies, zaibatsu also disciplined the <b>non-affiliated</b> <b>companies</b> in the capital market. The holding companies and the core affiliated companies frequently executed take over, which contributed to restructure the targeted companies, thorough replacement of the directors, assistance of management. ...|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that as long}} as an {{affiliate}} is [...] "communications" [...] related, the FCC has ruled that CPNI is under an opt-out approach (can be shared without your explicit permission). A phone company is permitted to sell all information on you, such as numbers you call, when you called them, where you were when you called them, or any other personally identifying information. CPNI would normally require a warrant for law enforcement agencies, but it can be freely sold to [...] "communications" [...] related companies. One can verify this by checking rule 64.2007(b)(1) and footnote 137 in the 2007 CPNI order. One can call up a phone company and opt out by requesting that they do not share CPNI information. In the case of Verizon Wireless, for example, the company states that on the one hand, [...] "Your privacy is an important priority at Verizon Wireless", and on the other hand, states that Verizon shares CPNI [...] "among our affiliates and parent companies (including Vodafone) and their subsidiaries unless you advise us not to". and states that it shares [...] "URLs (such as search terms) of websites you visit when you use our wireless service, the location of your device ("location information"), and your use of applications and features" [...] as well as other [...] "information about your use of Verizon products and services (such as data and calling features, device type, and amount of use), as well as demographic and interest categories (such as gender, age range, sports fan, frequent diner, or pet owner)" [...] with other <b>non-affiliated</b> <b>companies,</b> and does allow customers to request that such sharing not be done via an online form, and it is unclear whether Verizon considers some or all such [...] "online" [...] requests to be about CPNI or as legally binding as [...] "call-based" [...] requests about CPNI.|$|R
