40|$|Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT 1) is an {{essential}} lysosomal protein in the mammalian nervous system whereby defects result in a fatal pediatric disease called Infantile <b>Neuronal</b> <b>Ceroids</b> <b>Lipofuscinosis</b> (INCL). Flies bearing mutations in the Drosophila ortholog Ppt 1 exhibit phenotypes similar to the human disease: accumulation of autofluorescence deposits and shortened adult lifespan. Since INCL patients die as young children, early developmental neural defects due {{to the loss of}} PPT 1 are postulated but have yet to be elucidated. Here we show that Drosophila Ppt 1 is required during embryonic neural development. Ppt 1 embryos display numerous neural defects ranging from abnormal cell fate specification in a number of identified precursor lineages in the CNS, missing and disorganized neurons, faulty motoneuronal axon trajectory, and discontinuous, misaligned, and incorrect midline crossings of the longitudinal axon bundles of the ventral nerve cord. Defects in the PNS include a decreased number of sensory neurons, disorganized chordotonal neural clusters, and abnormally shaped neurons with aberrant dendritic projections. These results indicate that Ppt 1 is essential for proper neuronal cell fates and organization; and to establish the local environment for proper axon guidance and fasciculation. Ppt 1 function is well conserved from humans to flies; thus the INCL pathologies may be due, in part, to the accumulation of various embryonic neural defects similar to that of Drosophila. These findings may be relevant for understanding the developmental origin of neural deficiencies in INCL...|$|R

40|$|The {{human and}} bovine genomes each contain two {{expressed}} nuclear genes, called P 1 and P 2, for subunit c, a hydrophobic subunit of the membrane sector, Fo, of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Both P 1 and P 2 encode the same mature protein, but the associated mitochondrial import sequences are different. In sheep with the neurodegenerative disease <b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis,</b> {{and also in}} humans with Batten's disease, unmodified subunit c accumulates in lysosome-derived organelles {{in a variety of}} tissues. However, the sequences of cDNAs for P 1 and P 2 from sheep with <b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis</b> were identical to those in healthy control animals. Therefore, since there was no mutation in either of the mitochondrial import sequences of subunit c in the diseased animals, <b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis</b> does not arise from changes in an import sequence causing mis-targeting of the c subunit to lysosomes. The levels of expression of P 1 and P 2 genes were approximately the same in diseased and healthy animals, and so the protein is unlikely to accumulate because of excessive transcription of either gene. Transcription of a spliced pseudogene related to P 2 was detected in both a control animal and a sheep with <b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis.</b> The transcripts encode amino acids 1 - 31 of the P 2 mitochondrial targeting sequence. In the diseased animal, an arginine replaced a glutamine in the control sequence. However, restriction fragment analysis of genomic DNA from a further 12 sheep established that the sequence differences were not linked to <b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis...</b>|$|R

Despite extensive studies performed in different NCL animal models, the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in NCLs remain poorly understood. To model NCL in human cells, we generated {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) by reprogramming skin fibroblasts from a patient with CLN 5 (<b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis,</b> <b>neuronal,</b> 5) disease, the late infantile variant form of NCL.

Tyr 392 X), were further differentiated into neural lineage cells, the most affected cell type in NCLs. The CLN 5 Y 392 X iPSC-derived neural lineage cells showed accumulation of autofluorescent storage material and subunit C of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, both representing the hallmarks of many forms of NCLs, including CLN 5 disease. In addition, we detected abnormalities in the intracellular organelles and aberrations in neuronal sphingolipid transportation, verifying the previous findings obtained from Cln 5 -deficient mouse macrophages.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of, incidence of, and survival from childhood neuronal lipofuscinoses in Norway. All children with <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses living in Norway are referred to the Tambartun National Resource Centre for the Visually Impaired. We based the data collection on the medical records at Tambartun. We identified 70 children with <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses who were born in Norway from 1957 to 1998. Seven had a diagnosis of late infantile <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses, and 63 had the juvenile form of <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses. In 2005, the prevalence of childhood <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses was 8. 3 per million inhabitants in Norway, and all children were diagnosed with the juvenile form. The average annual incidence rate of childhood <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses was 1. 8 per 100, 000 live births using the years from 1957 to 1978 and 3. 9 using the years from 1978 to 1999. The trend in incidence increased at an annual rate of about 3. 3 % per year (P 5. 001), averaged over this period. Restricted to the most recent period (1967 – 1998), the trend was much weaker (1. 4 % increase per year; P 5. 3), and confidence intervals included the possibility of no trend. The median age at death of children diagnosed with late infantile <b>neuronal</b> <b>ceroid</b> lipofuscinoses was 12 years (95 % confidence interval 9 – 14) and 26 years (95 % confidence interval 25 – 30) for children diagnosed with the juvenile form.

40|$|Juvenile <b>ceroid</b> <b>lipofuscinosis,</b> or Batten disease, is a {{hereditary}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive visual loss, seizures, cognitive and psychomotor deterioration, and early death, usually between 15 and 35 years of age. Individuals with this disease have massive deposits of autofluorescent inclusion bodies in cells of most tissues. The accumulation of these intracellular deposits suggests that juvenile ceroid-lipofuscinosis is a storage disease {{resulting from the}} inability of cells to metabolize some normal cellular constituent.
