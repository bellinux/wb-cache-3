5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{building}} a set of Swedish goggles is to construct a nose piece. <b>Nose</b> <b>pieces</b> can feature a variety of designs, {{some of the most}} popular are the included string threaded through the included rubber tube, a short length of the included strap (which is much more easily adjusted than the string), or simply using the string as a nose piece. For <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> using the string and tube, a pair of tweezers can be used to guide the string through the small holes located on the inside of the frames, as well as into the rubber tube. A small knot is then tied by hand and threaded into the tube.|$|E

The material is still used to make the earsocks on Oakley glasses, and many of the <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> and now the bands of their watches. Oakley went on to produce number plates, gloves, grips, elbow guards, chin guards, and goggles for the BMX and motocross communities.After selling Oakely Inc. to Italian Eyeware company Luxottica Group in 2007, founder James Jannard went on to found Red Digital Cinema.|$|E
40|$|The {{aluminium}} extrusion {{process is a}} forming process where a billet of hot aluminium is pressed through a die to produce long straight aluminium profiles. A large variety of products with different and complex cross-sections can be made. The insight in {{the mechanics of the}} {{aluminium extrusion}} process is still limited. Design of extrusion dies is primarily based on trial and error. The wasted scrap and time in these trail and error iterations, can be reduced by gaining more insight in the extrusion process. Numerical analysis is a valuable tool in obtaining that insight. In this thesis reports new developments for the analysis of the aluminium extrusion process are treated. The subject matter is presented in four chapters. Attention is focussed on three topics: • A comparison between experiments and simulations of container flow • Modeling the start-up of the extrusion process in an Eulerian formulation • Deriving a new finite element for ALE simulations Extrusion experiments have been performed at Boalgroup to visualize the flow inside the container during extrusion. These experiments are compared with simulations. The results of the simulations are steady state results that are post-processed to be comparable to the experimental results. If the simulations are not in agreement with the experiments, the material properties used in the simulations are adapted so the results agree. With this method it is possible to determine material properties under extrusion conditions. Correcting the dies after trial pressings is performed by die-correctors. The correctors use {{the first part of the}} profile (<b>nose</b> <b>piece)</b> to asses the work that has to be performed on the die. To be able to model this <b>nose</b> <b>piece,</b> is very valuable during designing of the die. In chapter 4 and 5 new strategies to simulate the shape of the <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> are treated. In the last chapter the possibilities of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on a porthole die for a tube. The simulated <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> is in very good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) {{storage ring}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) will be {{equipped}} with 54 dipole magnets having a gap of 35 mm, and 6 dipoles having a gap of 90 mm. Each dipole has a field of 0. 4 T and provides 6 degrees of bending for a 3 GeV electron beam. The large aperture magnets are necessary to allow the extraction of long-wavelength light from the dipole magnet to serve {{a growing number of}} users of low energy radiation. The dipoles must not only have good field homogeneity (0. 015 % over a 40 mm x 20 mm region), but the integral transfer functions and integral end harmonics of the two types of magnets must also be matched. The 35 mm aperture dipole has a novel design where the yoke ends are extended up to the outside dimension of the coil using magnetic steel <b>nose</b> <b>pieces.</b> This design increases the effective length of the dipole without increasing the physical length. These <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> can be tailored to adjust the integral transfer function as well as the homogeneity of the integrated field. One prototype of each dipole type has been fabricated to validate the designs and to study matching of the two dipoles. A Hall probe mapping system has been built with three Group 3 Hall probes mounted on a 2 -D translation stage. The probes are arranged with one probe in the midplane of the magnet and the others vertically offset by {+-} 10 mm. The field is mapped around a nominal 25 m radius beam trajectory.

40|$|During trial {{pressings}} of an {{aluminium extrusion}} {{the shape of}} the first extrudate (<b>nose</b> <b>piece)</b> tells the correctors how to change the die geometry to obtain an acceptable product. In this paper the initial filling of an aluminium extrusion die is analyzed with the objective to predict {{the shape of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>piece.</b> The calculation domain is discretized using P 1 +P 1 tetrahedral elements. The analysis is executed as an Eulerian analysis, where the material flows through the mesh. The whole domain is divided in an aluminium domain and an air domain, where the air is modeled as a pseudo material. The interface between the aluminium and the air is tracked by convection of the initial material coordinates. After the aluminium leaves the die, the free surface of the extrusion is calculated by an ALE method. The formulation of the element, the convection of the initial coordinates, the handling of the boundary conditions, the modeling of the air domain and the reconstruction of the free surface after extrusion are treated in this paper. The results of the simulations are compared to results of real extrusions...|$|R

30|$|To {{avoid the}} beard {{disturbing}} influence, one may make following reservation in {{the method of}} seeking nose characteristic points: the relevant points are being determined {{on the basis of}} all located points, arranged in a pattern (vertical curves), resembling the shape of <b>nose</b> <b>piece.</b> All points which significantly differ from the vertical arc shape should be removed. One attempts to find blowholes or other points on the basis of analysed pictures, but not always and not in every pictures they may be located. The important information may be also the point with the highest luminance level. It is almost always placed in the central nose part. Points determining the nose width may be compared with the nose central point. The final localization may be determined on this basis.|$|R

50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.|$|R

40|$|The film {{stiffness}} {{of a face}} seal is improved without increasing the sealing and dam area by using an apparatus which includes a primary seal ring {{in the form of}} a <b>nose</b> <b>piece.</b> A spring forces a sealing surface on the seal ring into sealing contact with a seat to form a face seal. A circumferential clearance seal is formed in series with this face seal by a lip on the piece. The width of the surface of the lip is substantially the same as the width of the sealing surface on the face seal and the clearance between the surface on the lip and the shaft is substantially the same as the spacing between the face sealing surfaces on the face seal when the shaft is rotating. The circumferential clearance seal restricts the flow of fluid from a main cavity to an intermediate cavity with a resulting pressure drop. The hydrostatic opening face is strongly dependent on the face seal clearance, and the desired axial stiffness is achieved...|$|R
