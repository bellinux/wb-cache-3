This project aims evaluating changes in salivary IL- 1 beta, cortisol, and melatonin in night workers. Method. Two day and three night healthy workers participated in this study. Sleep was evaluated by actimetry and activity protocols. Saliva was collected at waking and bedtime the last workday and the following two days-off and was analyzed by ELISA. Results. Neither sleep duration nor efficiency showed any association with salivary IL- 1 beta. IL- 1 beta levels were higher at waking than at bedtime during working days for all workers, but only one day and one night-worker maintained this pattern and hormone rhythms during days off. For this <b>night</b> <b>worker,</b> melatonin levels were shifted to daytime. A second one presented clear alterations in IL- 1 beta and hormone rhythms on days-off. Conclusions. Our preliminary results suggest that night work can disturb the variation pattern of salivary IL- 1 beta. No association of this variation with sleep was observed. It seems that disruption in hormone rhythms interfere with salivary IL- 1 beta production. IL- 1 beta production pattern seems to be maintained when rhythms are present, in spite of a shift in melatonin secretion...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{carry out}} a survey data {{collection}} from health care workers in Brazil, Croatia, Poland, Ukraine and the USA with two primary goals: (1) to provide information about which aspects of well-being are most likely to need attention when shiftwork management solutions are being developed, and (2) to explore whether nations are likely to differ with respect to the impacts of night work on the well-being of workers involved in health care work. METHODS: The respondents from each nation were sorted into <b>night</b> <b>worker</b> and non-night worker groups. Worker perceptions of being physically tired, mentally tired, and tense {{at the end of the}} workday were examined. Subjective reports of perceived felt age were also studied. For each of these four dependent variables, an ANCOVA analysis was carried out. Hours worked per week, stability of weekly work schedule, and chronological age were the covariates for these analyses. RESULTS: The results clearly support the general proposal that nations differ significantly in worker perceptions of well-being. In addition, perceptions of physical and mental tiredness at the end of the workday were higher for night workers. For the perception of being physically tired at the end of a workday, the manner and degree to which the night shift impacts the workers varies by nation. CONCLUSIONS: Additional research is needed to determine if the nation and work schedule differences observed are related to differences in job tasks, work schedule structure, off-the-job variables, and/or other worker demographic variables...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} examine the effects of night work on salivary {{melatonin}} concentration during and subsequent to night work and the mediating role of light. We included 254 day <b>workers</b> and 87 <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> who were followed during 322 work days and 301 days off work. Each day was defined as the 24 hour period starting from the beginning of a night shift or from waking in the mornings with day work and days off. Light levels were recorded and synchronized with diary information (start and end of sleep and work). On average, participants provided four saliva samples per day, and these were analyzed for melatonin concentration by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Differences between day and <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> on work days and days off were assessed with multilevel regression models with melatonin concentration as the primary outcome. All models were stratified or adjusted by time of day. For light exposure, we estimated the total, direct and indirect effects of night work on melatonin concentrations obtaining 95 % confidence intervals through bootstrapping. On work days, <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> showed 15 % lower salivary melatonin concentrations compared with day workers (− 15. 0 %; 95 % CI: − 31. 4 %; 5. 2 %). During the night, light exposure mediated a melatonin suppression of approximately 6 % (− 5. 9 %, 95 % CI: − 10. 2 %; − 1. 5 %). No mediating effect of light was seen during the day time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Night {{shift work}} has been {{associated}} with an increased risk for breast and prostate cancer. The effect of circadian disruption on sex steroid production is a possible underlying mechanism, underinvestigated in humans. We have assessed daily rhythms of sex hormones and melatonin in night and day shift workers of both sexes. METHODS: We recruited 75 night and 42 day workers, ages 22 to 64 years, in different working settings. Participants collected urine samples from all voids over 24 hours on a working day. Urinary concentrations of 16 sex steroid hormones and metabolites (estrogens, progestagens, and androgens) and 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin were measured in all samples. Mean levels and peak time of total and individual metabolite production were compared between <b>night</b> and day <b>workers.</b> RESULTS: <b>Night</b> <b>workers</b> had higher levels of total progestagens [geometric mean ratio (GMR) 1. 65; 95 % confidence intervals (CI), 1. 17 - 2. 32] and androgens (GMR: 1. 44; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 2. 00), compared with day workers, after adjusting for potential confounders. The increased sex hormone levels among <b>night</b> shift <b>workers</b> were not related to the observed suppression of 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin. Peak time of androgens was significantly later among <b>night</b> <b>workers,</b> compared with day workers (testosterone: 12 : 14 hours; 10 : 06 - 14 : 48 vs. 08 : 35 hours; 06 : 52 - 10 : 46). CONCLUSIONS: We found increased levels of progestagens and androgens as well as delayed peak androgen production in <b>night</b> shift <b>workers</b> compared with day workers. IMPACT: The increase and mistiming of sex hormone production may explain part of the increased risk for hormone-related cancers observed in <b>night</b> shift <b>workers...</b>|$|R

We investigated the association between insomnia and a self-reported physician diagnosis of CVD in day and <b>night</b> <b>workers,</b> considering all sleep episodes during nocturnal and diurnal sleep. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1307 female nursing professionals from 3 public hospitals, using baseline data from the &# 8220;Health and Work in Nursing - a Cohort Study. &# 8221; Participants were divided into two groups: i) day workers with no previous experience in night shifts (n= 281) and whose data on insomnia were related to nocturnal sleep and ii) those who worked exclusively at night (n= 340) and had data on both nocturnal and diurnal sleep episodes, as they often sleep at daytime. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Among day workers, insomnia complaints increased the odds of CVD 2. 79 -fold (95 % CI= 1. 01 - 6. 71) compared with workers who had no complaints. Among <b>night</b> <b>workers,</b> reports of insomnia during both nocturnal and diurnal sleep increased the odds of reported CVD 3. 07 -fold (95 % CI= 1. 30 - 7. 24).

The potassium excretory rhythm was, in most subjects, well adapted to night work in that they excreted least during their hours of sleep; no relationship could be discerned between potassium excretory and plasma 11 -OHCS rhythms. The sodium excretory rhythm was less regular than that of potassium in both <b>night</b> and day <b>workers,</b> and in <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> both sodium excretion and urine flow were often high during the hours of sleep, so that the subjects were sometimes awakened by the need to micturate. There was, however, sufficient association between the behaviour of sodium and potassium to suggest that their excretory rhythms have a common cause, and {{that this is not the}} secretion of 11 -OHCS. Phosphate excretion fell sometimes on rising, even though plasma 11 -OHCS concentration was not high, and sometimes after a high level of plasma 11 -OHCS, at a time other than on rising.

40|$|Shift workers adopt a sleep-wake {{pattern that}} is inverted, and {{reversing}} their natural activity-rest rhythm may have negative implications for sleep, food intake {{and physical activity}}. Study 1 explored the associations between shift work and sleep, nocturnal eating and physical activity in health workers. Participants (n= 385) were asked questions relating to their sleep, nocturnal eating and physical activity. Rotating and <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> reported poorer sleep quality (p< 0. 01) than day <b>workers.</b> <b>Night</b> <b>workers,</b> in particular, reported lower total sleep time (TST) (p< 0. 05), and greater use of sleep medication (p< 0. 05) than day workers. A higher proportion of shift workers (p< 0. 01) reported nocturnal eating than day workers. Although the energy expenditure of <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> was nearly twice as high (p< 0. 05) than in day workers, BMI was not significantly different between both groups which may be an implication of nocturnal eating. No group differences were found for exercise habit (p≥ 0. 18) and activity level (p= 0. 313). Exercise was investigated as a sleep intervention (Study 2). Participants (n= 12) were randomised to no-exercise or to a 40 min bout of treadmill exercise at moderate or vigorous intensities in a crossover design. Exercise was performed 6 h before bedtime, and sleep was assessed by polysomnography. The results revealed that exercise did not improve sleep, but instead, high intensity exercise increased NREM light sleep (p< 0. 05). Study 3 identified and modelled the periodicity of habitual TST under spontaneous living in 13 males across 14 days. The results showed that TST waxed and waned with a periodicity between 2 - 18 days, and was unique to individuals. Overall, shift work was found to negatively affect several dimensions of subjective sleep. Exercise as an intervention, however, did not produce the hypothesised increments in sleep quality.

METHODS: The Million Women Study is a large prospective cohort study of women's health in the United Kingdom with 1. 3 million women recruited during 1996 - 2001 (aged 50 - 64 years) through 66 National Health Service breast screening centers. We analyzed the data from a random sample of 41 652 participants who, in 2009 - 2010, reported their history of night work. RESULTS: Of the participants, 1 in 8 women (13 %) reported that they had ever worked at night and 1 in 50 (2 %) reported working at night for ≥ 20 years. For 33 sociodemographic, behavioral, reproductive, and hormonal factors examined, 20 showed highly significant differences between "ever" and "never" <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> (P< 0. 0001); 12 showed significant trends by duration of night work (P< 0. 01). In particular, compared to women who had never worked at night, women who had worked at night were more likely to (i) be of lower socioeconomic status [the odds ratio (OR) for ever versus never <b>night</b> <b>workers</b> of being in the lowest third of socioeconomic status was 1. 15, 99 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 06 - 1. 25]; (ii) have ever used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the menopause (OR 1. 43, 99 % CI 1. 33 - 1. 55); (iii) be current smokers (OR 1. 37, 99 % CI 1. 19 - 1. 58); and (iv) be obese (OR 1. 26, 99 % CI 1. 15 - 1. 37). Compared to women who had never worked at night, women who had worked at night for ≥ 20 years were more likely to be (i) of lower socioeconomic status (OR 1. 28, 99 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 57); (ii) nulliparous (OR 1. 47, 99 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 91); (iii) current smokers (OR 1. 63, 99 % CI 1. 18 - 2. 25); and (iv) obese (OR 1. 55, 99 % CI 1. 25 - 1. 93).

The aim of the study was to explore association between night shift work and lifestyle factors using data from a cross-sectional study among blue-collar workers employed in industrial plants in Łódź, Poland. Material and Methods: The anonymous questionnaire was self-administered among 605 employees (236 women and 369 men, aged 35 or more) - 434 individuals currently wor­king night shifts. Distribution of the selected lifestyle related factors such as smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), number of main meals and the hour of the last meal was compared between current, former, and never <b>night</b> shift <b>workers.</b> Adjusted ORs or predicted means were calculated, as a measure of the associations between night shift work and lifestyle factors, with age, marital status and education included in the models as covariates. Results: Recreational inactivity (defined here as less than one hour per week of recreational physical activity) was associated with current night shift work when compared to never <b>night</b> shift <b>workers</b> (OR = 2. 43, 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 5. 22) among men.
