40|$|ZnO {{has long}} been {{considered}} as a model UV-driven photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting, but its performance has been limited by fast charge-carrier recombination, extremely poor stability in aqueous solution, and slow kinetics of water oxidation. These issues were addressed by applying a strategy of optimization and passivation of hydrothermally grown 1 D ZnO nanowire arrays. The length and diameter of bare ZnO nanowires were optimized by varying the growth time and precursor concentration to achieve optimal photoelectrochemical performance. The addition of earth-abundant cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) and <b>nickel</b> <b>borate</b> (Ni-B) oxygen evolution catalysts onto ZnO nanowires resulted in substantial cathodic shifts in onset potential to as low as about 0. 3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for Ni-B/ZnO, for which a maximum photocurrent density of 1. 1 mA cm- 2 at 0. 9 V (vs. RHE) with applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 0. 4 % and an unprecedented near-unity incident photon-to-current efficiency at 370 nm. In addition the potential required for saturated photocurrent was dramatically reduced from 1. 6 to 0. 9 V versus RHE. Furthermore, the stability of these ZnO nanowires was significantly enhanced by using Ni-B compared to Co-Pi due to its superior chemical robustness, and it thus has additional functionality as a stable protecting layer on the ZnO surface. These remarkable enhancements in both photocatalytic activity and stability directly address the current severe limitations {{in the use of}} ZnO-based photoelectrodes for water-splitting applications, and can be applied to other photoanodes for efficient solar-driven fuel synthesis.

40|$|In recent years, biodiesel, a {{substitute}} for fossil fuels, {{has led to the}} excessive production of crude glycerol. The resulting crude glycerol can possess a high concentration of salts and an alkaline pH. Moreover, current crude glycerol purification methods are expensive, rendering this former commodity a waste product. However, Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans, a haloalkaliphilic bacterium, possesses the metabolic capability to convert glycerol into 1, 3 -propanediol, a valuable commodity compound, without the need for salt dilution or adjusting pH when grown on this waste. Experiments were performed with different combinations of 24 medium components to determine their impact on the production of 1, 3 -propanediol by using a fractional factorial design. Tested medium components were selected based on data from the organismâ€™s genome. Analysis of HPLC data revealed enhanced production of 1, 3 -propanediol with additional glycerol, pH, vitamin B 12, ammonium ions, sodium sulfide, cysteine, iron, and cobalt. However, other selected components; nitrate ions, phosphate ions, sulfate ions, sodium:potassium ratio, chloride, calcium, magnesium, silicon, manganese, zinc, <b>borate,</b> <b>nickel,</b> molybdenum, tungstate, copper and aluminum, did not enhance 1, 3 -propanediol production. The use of a fractional factorial design enabled the quick and efficient assessment of the impact of 24 different medium components on 1, 3 -propanediol production from glycerol from a haloalkaliphilic bacterium...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{potentiometric sensor}} for the combined determination of the concentration of a first and a second gas component of a gas sample that is introduced into a measurement gas chamber (1), comprises a sodium ion (Na+) -conducting, solid electrolyte (2), a measuring electrode (3), which has a first material that is gas-sensitive with respect to the first and/or the second gas component and which is brought into or is in gas connection with the measurement gas chamber and which is in planar contact with the solid electrolyte, a reference electrode (4), which has a second material that is gas-sensitive with respect to the first and/or the second gas component and which is brought into or is in gas connection with the measurement gas chamber and which is in planar contact with the solid electrolyte and which is electrically insulated from the measuring electrode, and a referencing electrode (5), which is in planar contact with the solid electrolyte and which is electrically insulated from the measuring electrode and from the reference electrode and which is sealed off in a gas-tight manner from the measurement gas chamber. The sensor is formed for the determination of potential difference such as potential difference between the measuring electrode and the reference electrode, the potential difference between the measuring electrode and the reference electrode and the potential difference between the reference electrode and referencing electrode. The potential difference is electrically connected at both electrodes and/or the sensor is formed so that the first potential difference depends on the partial pressure of the first gas component and the second gas component, the third potential difference depends on the partial pressure of the second gas component and the first gas component, and/or the second potential difference depends on the partial pressure of the first and the second gas component.
