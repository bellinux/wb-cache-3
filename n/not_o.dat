It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do <b>not,</b> <b>O</b> king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

2500|$|She was {{inspired}} to write “Pass Me <b>Not,</b> <b>O</b> Gentle Saviour” after speaking at a service at the Manhattan prison in spring 1868, from comments by some prisoners for the Lord not to pass them by. Doane set it to music and published it in Songs of Devotion in 1870. “Pass Me Not” became her first hymn to have global appeal, after it was used by Sankey in his crusades with Moody in Britain in 1874. Sankey said, “No hymn was more popular at the meetings in London in 1875 (sic) than this one.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The luxurious banquets at {{the court}} of the exilarch were well known.

Buber's edition, the feast was given by the chief of the synagogue). Another story told in the land of Israel relates that an exilarch had music in his house morning and evening, and that Mar 'Ukba, who subsequently became exilarch, sent him as a warning this sentence from Hosea: [...] "Rejoice <b>not,</b> <b>O</b> Israel, for joy, as other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crosby {{was known}} as the [...] "Queen of Gospel Song Writers" [...] and as the [...] "Mother of modern congregational singing in America", with most American hymnals {{containing}} her work. Her gospel songs were [...] "paradigmatic of all revival music", and Ira Sankey attributed the success of the Moody and Sankey evangelical campaigns largely to Crosby's hymns. Some of Crosby's best-known songs include [...] "Pass Me <b>Not,</b> <b>O</b> Gentle Saviour", [...] "Blessed Assurance", [...] "Jesus Is Tenderly Calling You Home", [...] "Praise Him, Praise Him", [...] "Rescue the Perishing", and [...] "To God Be the Glory". Some publishers were hesitant to have so many hymns by one person in their hymnals, so Crosby used nearly 200 different pseudonyms during her career.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, other {{television}} station groups (such as Hearst Television) also implement common branding practices among its stations (even when affiliated with different networks). Some of the branding elements are now used by stations that are <b>not</b> <b>O</b> or even affiliates {{of a certain}} network (such as Sunbeam Television's WHDH in Boston and WSVN in Miami using {{a variation of the}} circle 7 logo, and ABC affiliate KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa using CBS' [...] "I Love Chicago" [...] motif). Likewise, network affiliates may also license graphics packages for use on their newscasts and imaging from their networks to reduce the costs of licensing imaging from other parties; though it has been reduced in usage than in the past, many affiliate stations also license the network's imaging for their entertainment program and news promotions. Nonetheless, such practices and elements can still {{be traced back to the}} O, which represented the earliest {{television station}} groups under common ownership, before the emergence and proliferation of national station ownership groups in the subsequent decades.|$|E
