On returning to Dillon, Tim finds that a neighbor woman, with whom he had a brief affair, is <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> his brother Billy and has all but moved into their house. Tim moves out but has trouble finding another place to live and ultimately returns. Coach Taylor allows him to rejoin the team after he shows up at practice and on his own initiative apologizes to everyone on the team for his lack of commitment.|$|E
5|$|With {{all four}} curses lifted, Link climbs {{on top of}} the Clock Tower at midnight on the third day to confront the Skull Kid again. There and then, he summons the Four Giants, who halt the moon's descent toward Termina by holding it up with their arms. <b>Now</b> <b>seeing</b> the Skull Kid as a useless puppet, Majora's Mask drops his grip on him and flies up to possess the moon instead. With Tatl at his side, Link follows the Majora's Mask inside the moon and defeats him once and for all, {{returning}} the moon to its proper place in the sky. The Four Giants return to their sleep. Tatl and Tael reunite with the newly liberated Skull Kid. The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora's Mask, stating it has been purified of its evil power. Link rides away on Epona while the people of Termina celebrate the Carnival of Time and the dawn of a new day.|$|E
25|$|Joyner, <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> the {{hopelessness}} of South Carolinas situation, {{decided to}} fire her guns one last time, {{not wishing to}} surrender with his cannons loaded.

25|$|True to its roots, Elk Island National Park still {{maintains}} a thriving elk population, estimated at 605 in 2007, {{as well as}} around 300 moose and over 500 deer. Parks Canada transferred eighteen western moose from Elk Island to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1949. Reintroduction of traditional species {{has been an important}} focus as well. Besides the success of the wood and plains bison introduction, beaver were reintroduced in 1942, and in 2007 numbered near 1000. 1987 saw the beginning of a Trumpeter Swan reintroduction programme which is <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> mating pairs returning to Elk Island, raising hope for a sustainable population.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Philadelphia region, Bucks County has {{experienced}} a rapid increase of immigrants since the 2000 census. Known for its very large and established Eastern European population, most notably the Russian community, but also for its Ukrainian and Polish communities, Bucks County is <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> a rapid surge of other immigrant groups. A 2005 population estimate of Bucks showed that the Indian and Mexican populations had already doubled since 2000. Bucks County is one of only two counties in Pennsylvania where Mexicans are the largest Hispanic community, the other being Montgomery County. Bucks County also is home to large and very prominent Roman Catholic and Jewish populations.|$|E

However, her father gradually starts spending more time with his new wife, which galls and displeases Nadia who does not receive an equal amount of love and attention anymore. This compels and drives her to step in and ruin their relationship. <b>Now</b> <b>seeing</b> Safia as her enemy, Nadia plots for revenge from her stepmother. Nadia accuses Safia of having an affair with Aziz (Omar Sharif), Nadia's young uncle.|$|E
25|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Egypt, the {{influence}} of Coptic art and architecture on Egyptian Islamic architecture and the incorporation of some Coptic features in Islamic building in Egypt can be seen. This {{can be explained by}} the fact that the early Muslim rulers of Egypt, much like the Ptolemaic and Byzantine rulers before them, recruited native Egyptians to undertake the building labor. In later centuries, Coptic art and architecture also incorporated motifs inspired by Islamic styles. In particular, very early examples of the pointed arch appear in Coptic churches from the 4th century onwards, and this became a notable feature of Islamic architecture, and may have spread from there to European Gothic architecture, though this whole area remains controversial among architectural historians, with many <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> the origins among the Assyrians, from whom it spread to Persia, where it joined the Islamic style.|$|E

500|$|Astronomers {{sometimes}} use {{the alternative}} name Edgeworth–Kuiper belt to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally {{referred to as}} EKOs. Brian G. Marsden claims that neither deserves true credit: [...] "Neither Edgeworth nor Kuiper wrote about anything remotely like what we are <b>now</b> <b>seeing,</b> but Fred Whipple did". David Jewitt comments: [...] "If anything... Fernández most nearly deserves the credit for predicting the Kuiper Belt." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{project is}} not the only one of its nature to fail; Indonesia and Malaysia mounted {{enormous}} tire-reef programs in the 1980s and are <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> the ramifications of the failure of tire reefs, from littered beaches to reef destruction. Jack Sobel, The Ocean Conservancy's director of strategic conservation said in a 2002 interview that [...] "I don't know of any cases where there's been a success with tire reefs." [...] That year, The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup removed 11,956 tires from beaches all over the world.|$|E
500|$|Kerekes {{noted the}} animal {{slaughter}} and inclusion of footage from The Last Road to Hell as {{adding to the}} sense of reality of the film. Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment compares these scenes to Vsevolod Pudovkin's theory of montage, saying, [...] "In Cannibal Holocaust, we see the actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals. [...] The brain has been conditioned to accept that which it's <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> as real. This mixture of real and staged violence, combined with the handheld camerawork and the rough, unedited quality of {{the second half of the}} movie, is certainly enough to convince someone that what they are watching is real." [...] Deodato says he included the execution footage in The Last Road to Hell to draw further similarities to Cannibal Holocaust and the Mondo filmmaking of Gualtiero Jacopetti.|$|E

500|$|Localised strike action {{began in}} June 2009 when workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh staged a 24-hour strike on 19 June over {{concerns}} about the impact that modernisation would have on postal workers. This was followed the next day by a similar walkout in parts of Scotland. Speaking about the situation at the time Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary said, [...] "We are <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> cuts but not modernisation in the postal industry and there's only so long before this is going {{have a major impact}} on services. The CWU does not and has not blocked change. Once again we are seeing Royal Mail working against the union and failing to engage the workforce." [...] Ward also said that his union would offer Royal Mail and the government a three-month no-strike deal if Royal Mail fulfilled its part of the 2007 agreement.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Grinning Man" [...] {{the title}} refers {{to is the}} subject of a Hieronymous Bosch {{painting}}, which hangs in the attic Nightmare Room. Once the episode's mysteries are resolved, Constance confesses that she rescued the painting from a burning room decades previously, leaving an elderly uncle to die as she did so. She has Glenn assist her in burning the painting in Metropolis' grounds. The episode ends with Jonathan, Joey, and Adam arriving at a restaurant to celebrate with their significant others. Adam discovers that he has been conned by Candy, and will not be receiving any return on his pornography investment. Joey receives a call from her partner, Alec (Adam James), who reveals that he is in Miami with Nicola and the two are <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> one another.

500|$|Writing in Salon, David Sirota, a {{progressive}} political commentator compared The Dark Knight Rises {{and the game}} Call of Duty to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: [...] "Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected {{the spirit of the}} Reagan Revolution's conservative backlash, we are <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the Tea Party's rhetorical backlash to the powerful Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist." [...] An article in Variety reported Chuck Dixon, the co-creator of the Bane character, as saying that Bane is [...] "far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street type if you're looking to cast him politically." [...] Catherine Shoard of the center-left British publication The Guardian claimed the film [...] "is a quite audaciously capitalist vision, radically conservative, radically vigilante, that advances a serious, stirring proposal that the wish-fulfilment of the wealthy is to be championed if they say they want to do good." [...] In contrast, liberal commentator Jonathan Chait opined in New York that [...] "What passes for a right-wing movie these days is The Dark Knight Rises, which submits the rather modest premise that, irritating though the rich may be, actually killing them and taking all their stuff might be excessive." [...] Writing in USA Today, Bryan Alexander called Bane [...] "the ultimate occupier" [...] and reported that Christian Bale was amazed that the script had [...] "foreseen" [...] the Occupy movement.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper, [...] "The {{number of}} undocumented {{immigrants}} has declined in absolute terms, while the overall population of low-skilled, foreign-born workers has remained stable.... because major source countries for U.S. immigration are <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> {{and will continue}} to see weak growth of the labor supply relative to the United States, future immigration rates of young, low-skilled workers appear unlikely to rebound, whether or not U.S. immigration policies tighten further." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{the while}} Merezhkovsky {{was trying to}} {{convince}} Mussolini {{that it was the}} latter's mission to start the [...] "Holy War against Russia" [...] (the idea formed the basis of his article [...] "Meeting Mussolini", published by Illustrated Russia in February 1937). Seeing his name frequently mentioned by the Italian press in connection with bizarre Merezhkovsky's suggestions made duce uneasy and he took a step back. Visiting Rome in summer 1937, Merezhkovsky had talks with the Italian Foreign minister, but failed to meet Mussolini. Then came the disillusionment, and in October of the same year he was already speaking of how disappointed he was with the Italian leader's [...] "petty materialism." [...] He tried to contact General Francisco Franco, <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> Spain as the last anti-Communist citadel of Europe and failed. Thus Merezhkovsky's choice of the new European [...] "heroes" [...] narrowed down to Adolf Hitler.|$|E

Richards said [...] "we are <b>now</b> <b>seeing</b> some very optimistic signs" [...] in the latest military offensive, Operation Moshtarak (togetherness), in Helmand.
