Thus previous reports of hydrated minerals and organic compounds {{on the surface of}} Lutetia have been disproven. The surface also does not contain any olivine. Together with the high density of Lutetia these results indicate that it is either made of the enstatite chondrite material or may be related to metal-rich and water-poor carbonaceous chondrite of classes like CB, CH, or CR.|$|E

2500|$|Light {{from the}} corona comes from three primary sources, {{from the same}} volume of space. The K-corona (Kfor kontinuierlich, [...] "continuous" [...] in German) is created by {{sunlight}} scattering off free electrons; Doppler broadening of the reflected photospheric absorption lines spreads them so greatly as to completely obscure them, giving the spectral appearance of a continuum with <b>no</b> <b>absorption</b> lines. The F-corona (Ffor Fraunhofer) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is observable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are seen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high elongation angles from the Sun, where {{it is called the}} zodiacal light. The E-corona (E for emission) is due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the coronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or forbidden or hot spectral emission lines and is the main source of information about the corona's composition.|$|E

Now steam is nothing but an {{artificial}} cloud in the process of dissipation; it is as much a cloud as those of the sky itself, that is, a quantity of moisture rendered visible in the air by imperfect solution. Accordingly, observe how exquisitely irregular and broken are its forms, how sharp and spray-like; but with all the facts observed which were pointed out in Chap. II. of this Section, the convex side to the wind, the sharp edge on that side, the other soft and lost. Smoke, on the contrary, is an actual substance existing independently in the air, a solid opaque body, subject to <b>no</b> <b>absorption</b> nor dissipation but that of tenuity. Observe its volumes; there is no breaking up nor disappearing here; the wind carries its elastic globes before it, but does not dissolve nor break them.[37] Equally convex and void of angles on all sides, they are the exact representatives of the clouds of the old masters, and serve at once to show the ignorance and falsehood of these latter, and the accuracy of study which has guided Turner to the truth.|$|E
60|$|Eyes.--Close {{behind the}} basal articulations of the antennæ, the sternal surface {{consists}} of two approximate, elongated, narrow, flat pieces, or segments. These Burmeister considers as the basal segments of the antennæ: as they are not cylindrical, I {{do not see the}} grounds for this conclusion: their posterior ends are rounded, and the membrane forming them is reflected inwards, in the form of two, forked, horny apodemes, together resembling two letters, =UU=, close together; these project up, inside the animal, for at least one third of its thickness from the sternal to the dorsal surface. The two great, almost spherical eyes in L. australis, each 1/150th of an inch in diameter, are attached to the outer arms, thus, =°UU°=, in the position of the two full stops. Hence the eyes are included within the carapace. Each eye consists of eight or ten lenses, varying in diameter in the same individual from 1/2000 to 3/2000th of an inch, enclosed in a common membranous bag or cornea, and thus attached to the outer apodemes. The lenses are surrounded half way up by a layer of dark pigment-cells. The nerve does not enter the bluntly-pointed basal end of the common eye, but {{on one side of the}} apodeme. The structure here described is exactly that found, according to Milne Edwards, in certain crustacea. In specimens just attached, in which <b>no</b> <b>absorption</b> has taken place, two long muscles with transverse striæ may be found attached to the knobbed tips of the two middle arms of the two =°UU°=, and running up to the antero-dorsal surface of the carapace, where they are attached; other muscles (without transverse striæ) are attached round the bases, on both sides of both forks. The action of these muscles would inevitably move the eyes, but I suspect that their function may be to draw up the narrow, deeply folded, sternal surface, and thus cause the retraction of the great prehensile antennæ within the carapace.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNitric oxide (NO) and {{nitrogen}} dioxide (NO 2) were absorbed into aqueous amine {{to determine the}} absorbing species, the absorption kinetics, and the aqueous products at the ppm-level NOx concentrations typical of flue gas from fossil fuel power plants. At flue gas conditions of 0. 5 - 5 ppm of <b>NO</b> 2, <b>absorption</b> is dominated by free radical <b>absorption</b> of <b>NO</b> 2 as nitrite. <b>NO</b> 2 <b>absorption</b> kinetics are first order in NO 2 partial pressure, half order in free amine concentration, and fastest in methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). The reaction-enhanced liquid mass transfer coefficient for <b>NO</b> 2 <b>absorption</b> in 8 m piperazine (PZ) at absorber conditions is 9. 7 * 10 - 7 mol/s·m 2 ·Pa, yielding 92 % <b>NO</b> 2 <b>absorption</b> at a typical A/G of 3. 3 * 106 s·Pa·m 2 /mol. Similarly, a 9 m monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent will absorb roughly 70 % of the inlet NO 2 while a 7 m MDEA/ 2 m PZ solvent will absorb over 99 % of the NO 2. Nitrite and nitrate are the main NOx absorption products in MDEA with nitrite dominating at low NO 2 partial pressures. In PZ, the amine free radical formed during <b>NO</b> 2 <b>absorption</b> will react with NO to directly form n-nitrosopiperazine (MNPZ) or react with itself to form 2 -piperazinol (2 -PZOH). Typical nitrosamine yields in 5 m PZ are around 15 % of total absorbed NOx and can be halved {{with the addition of}} 200 mM Inhibitor A, a free radical scavenger. Nitrate and nitramine are minor products of NOx absorption, accounting for less than 5 % of total absorbed NOx...|$|R

60|$|This {{colloquy}} {{had taken}} place in the middle of Piazza San Marco, always, as a great social saloon, a smooth-floored, blue-roofed chamber of amenity, favourable to talk; or rather, to be exact, not in the middle, but at the point where our pair had paused by a common impulse after leaving the great mosque-like church. It rose now, domed and pinnacled, but a little way behind them, and they had in front the vast empty space, enclosed by its arcades, to which at that hour movement and traffic were mostly confined. Venice was at breakfast, the Venice of the visitor and the possible acquaintance, and, except for the parties of importunate pigeons picking up the crumbs of perpetual feasts, their prospect was clear and they could see their companions hadn't yet been, and weren't for a while longer likely to be, disgorged by the lace-shop, in one of the loggie, where, shortly before, they had left them for a look-in--the expression was artfully Densher's--at Saint Mark's. Their morning had happened to take such a turn as brought this chance to the surface; yet his allusion, just made to Kate, hadn't been an overstatement of their general opportunity. The worst that could be said of their general opportunity was that it was essentially in presence--in presence of every one; every one consisting at this juncture, in a peopled world, of Susan Shepherd, Aunt Maud and Milly. But the proof how, even in presence, the opportunity could become special was furnished precisely by this view of the compatibility of their comfort {{with a certain amount of}} lingering. The others had assented to their not waiting in the shop; it was of course the least the others could do. What had really helped them this morning was the fact that, on his turning up, as he always called it, at the palace, Milly had not, as before, been able to present herself. Custom and use had hitherto seemed fairly established; on his coming round, day after day--eight days had been now so conveniently marked--their friends, Milly's and his, conveniently dispersed and left him to sit with her till luncheon. Such was the perfect operation of the scheme on which he had been, as he phrased it to himself, had out; so that certainly there was that amount of justification for Kate's vision of success. He had, for Mrs. Lowder--he couldn't help it while sitting there--the air, which was the thing to be desired, of <b>no</b> <b>absorption</b> in Kate sufficiently deep to be alarming. He had failed their young hostess each morning as little as she had failed him; it was only to-day that she hadn't been well enough to see him.|$|E
