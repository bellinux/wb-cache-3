5|$|German {{military}} officers were {{disappointed by the}} limited extent of the attack, which ultimately achieved more political goals than strategic ones. Russia's Black Sea Fleet was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged by the raid. The gunboat Donetz was later raised and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|Caesar ciphers can {{be found}} today in children's toys such as secret decoder rings. A Caesar shift of {{thirteen}} is also performed in the ROT13 algorithm, a simple method of obfuscating text widely found on Usenet and used to obscure text (such as joke punchlines and story spoilers), but <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> used {{as a method of}} encryption.|$|E
5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.|$|E
2500|$|Niels Bohr said in 1962, [...] "You see {{actually}} the Rutherford work was <b>not</b> taken <b>seriously.</b> We cannot understand today,but it was <b>not</b> taken <b>seriously</b> at all. There {{was no mention}} of it any place. The great change came from Moseley." ...|$|R

5|$|Madison's plan {{operated}} on several assumptions that were <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> challenged. During the deliberations, few raised serious {{objections to the}} planned bicameral congress, nor the separate executive function, nor the separate judicial function. As English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions, law making embodied in the legislature, and law executing embodied in the king and his courts, {{the division of the}} legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.|$|E
5|$|Marina Litvinenko : UK reports state Litvinenko's widow tested {{positive}} for polonium, though she is <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> ill. The Ashdown Park hotel in Sussex has been evacuated as a precaution, possibly to do with Scaramella's previous visit there. According to the 6pm Channel 4 (9 December 2006) news the intake of polonium she suffered would only result in a dose of 100 mSv, leading to a 1 in 200 chance of cancer.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands {{in order to prevent}} further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to the high cost of the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|The Junta {{reversed}} the military disasters of 251–71 {{with a string}} of victories, most notably the defeat at Naissus of a vast Gothic army by Claudius II, which was so crushing that the Goths did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> threaten the empire again until a century later at Adrianople (378).|$|E
5|$|The Yankees did {{not reach}} the World Series in 1997, but came back {{with one of the}} better seasons in {{baseball}} history in 1998, which culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series. The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card, they did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> contend for the division title. They ultimately lost their ALDS.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Regina Maria Pia was badly burned in the battle, but the other three vessels were <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged. The ships served {{in a variety of}} roles for the {{remainder}} of their long careers; they were modernized in the late 1880s and thereafter used as a training ships. Regina Maria Pia, San Martino, and Ancona were discarded in 190304, and Castelfidardo joined them in the breaker's yard in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with her}} three sister ships, , , and , Grosser Kurfürst {{took part in}} most of the fleet actions during the war, {{including}} the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The ship was subjected to heavy fire at Jutland, but was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged. She shelled Russian positions during Operation Albion in September and October 1917. Grosser Kurfürst was involved in a number of accidents during her service career; she collided with König and Kronprinz, grounded several times, was torpedoed once, and hit a mine.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its capability {{to deal with}} the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.|$|E
5|$|Considerable Australian {{and other}} Allied {{military}} resources {{were devoted to}} protecting shipping and ports from Axis submarines and warships. For instance, the RAN escorted over 1,100coastal convoys the Army established coastal defences to protect important ports and {{a high proportion of}} the RAAF's operational squadrons were used to protect shipping at various times. Nevertheless, the use of these units for defensive tasks and the shipping casualties in Australian waters did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> affect the Australian economy or Allied war effort.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E
5|$|However, the League of Lezhë {{defeated}} {{both the}} Venetian {{forces and the}} Ottoman expedition. The League won over the Venetian forces on 23 July 1448 {{at the gates of}} Scutari, and over the Ottomans three weeks later, on 14 August 1448, at the Battle of Oronichea. The Republic was, thereafter, left with few soldiers to defend Venetian Albania. As a result, the League soon signed peace with the Republic of Venice, while continuing the war against the Ottoman Empire. After the Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–1448, Venice did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> challenge Skanderbeg or the League, allowing Skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Baden {{returned}} {{to active duty}} {{to take part in}} a naval tour of the Baltic by the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II. Rear Admiral Eduard Knorr, the commander of the fleet, raised his flag aboard Baden during the voyage. The fleet stopped in St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen on the seventeen-day cruise. Baden ran aground in the harbors of both Stockholm and Copenhagen, but was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged in either incident. Baden also participated in the visit to Great Britain in August 1889, where Wilhelm II took part in the Cowes Regatta. Baden and the rest of the fleet joined the Royal Navy in a fleet review for Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|N'Diaye {{was born}} in Dakar, Senegal to Seynabou and Mbad N'Diaye. He has an older brother, named Adam. He grew up playing soccer and did <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> begin playing {{basketball}} at a young age. In 2010, Amadou Koundoul, who was the assistant coach for the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team at the time, saw N'Diaye participate in a pick-up game in a gymnasium at Dakar. He asked him {{to travel to the}} United States, and N'Diaye accepted the offer. He arrived in the US without knowing how to speak English. In the new country, he initially had trouble with speaking English and often needed things to be translated to French.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1844, Wickliffe {{and two of}} {{his daughters}} boarded the {{steamship}} Georgia traveling from Old Point Comfort in Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. While en route, he was stabbed in the chest by a man wielding a claspknife. The knife bounced off Wickliffe's breastbone without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe's attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was <b>not</b> <b>seriously</b> injured, and returned home three days after the attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.|$|E
