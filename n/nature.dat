5|$|Beauty in <b>nature</b> has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That <b>nature</b> has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate <b>nature</b> and beauty.

An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).
