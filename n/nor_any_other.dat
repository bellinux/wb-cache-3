5|$|Even though Steuart {{had fought}} bravely under {{extremely}} difficult conditions, neither he <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> officer was cited by Johnson in his report. Gettysburg marked the high-water {{mark of the}} Confederacy; thereafter Lee's army would retreat until its final surrender to General Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E

5|$|Since the pigeye shark so {{strongly}} resembles the bull shark, morphology-based phylogenetic studies {{have considered the}} two species to be closely related. Neither this <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> arrangement is strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been inconclusive regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

5|$|Another {{witness who}} had {{attended}} the {{concert at the}} rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 was {{initially}} under development by Black Isle Studios, a studio owned by Interplay Entertainment, under the working title Van Buren. Black Isle Studios was the developer {{of the original}} Fallout and Fallout 2. When Interplay Entertainment went bankrupt and closed down Black Isle Studios before the game could be completed, the license to develop Fallout 3 was sold for a $1,175,000 minimum guaranteed advance against royalties to Bethesda Softworks, a studio primarily known as the developer of The Elder Scrolls series. Bethesda's Fallout 3, however, was developed from scratch, using neither Van Buren code <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> materials created by Black Isle Studios. In May 2007, a playable technology demo of the canceled project was released to the public.|$|E
5|$|Wes Gephart, {{though his}} {{personal}} brilliance {{and ability to}} attract investment, was able to cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen {{the end of its}} glory: after 1890, its population, heretofore steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring. The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of ironmaking in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County.|$|E

25|$|On the {{practical}} side, Larramendi resumed his career of a lawyer. The {{number of his}} customers decreased as they realized that the new political setting provided him with neither political influence <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> benefits.

25|$|On 24 April (Easter Sunday), Sato Kilman's {{government}} was ousted by a motion of {{no confidence in}} Parliament, by twenty-six votes to twenty-five. Serge Vohor became Prime Minister in his place, and appointed a new Cabinet which included neither Regenvanu <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> of Kilman's ministers.

25|$|The {{impending}} hardship {{was further}} {{compounded by the}} loss of their most skillful leader in dealing with the Powhatan Confederacy in trading for food: Captain John Smith. He became injured in August 1609 in a gunpowder accident, and was forced to return to England for medical attention in October 1609. After Smith left, Chief Powhatan severely curtailed trading with the colonists for food. Neither the missing Sea Venture <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> supply ship arrived as winter set upon the inhabitants of the young colony in late 1609.|$|E
25|$|Grothendieck's work {{includes}} {{the invention of}} the étale and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation of André Weil's that there is a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a finite field reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the complex numbers. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he <b>nor</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.|$|E
