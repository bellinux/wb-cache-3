40|$|Assisted living {{facilities}} {{claim that}} <b>negotiated</b> risk agreements give residents {{the freedom to}} act against facility advice. On the contrary, <b>negotiated</b> risk was proposed originally to waive a facility’s liability for inadequate care, and liability waiver remains a significant component of <b>negotiated</b> risk. This Article offers the first detailed legal analysis of state <b>negotiated</b> risk laws. Due to <b>negotiated</b> risk’s dueling definitions – based either on the against-facility-advice scenario or the inadequate care scenario – state law is marked by ambiguity and inconsistency. Currently, fifteen states address <b>negotiated</b> risk in law, and an additional state has developed a standardized <b>negotiated</b> risk form. This Article places each of these states into one of eight categories, depending generally {{on the extent to}} which <b>negotiated</b> risk is used purportedly to resolve disputes, plan care, consent to inadequate care, or waive liability. This Article recommends that <b>negotiated</b> risk be abandoned, and that all references to <b>negotiated</b> risk be eliminated from state law. <b>Negotiated</b> risk is in fact not necessary for a resident to act against facility advice. In nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, a resident undisputedly has the right to act against facility advice, with no need to <b>negotiate</b> an agreement with the facility. Also, any waiver of facility liability is unenforceable as a violation of public policy. In health care settings, courts uniformly refuse to enforce a consumers’ waiver of a provider’s liability. Finally, the term “negotiated risk” is too compromised to be of any further use. <b>Negotiated</b> risk has no settled definition, and state law definitions are generally vague enough to accommodate both the against-facility-advice scenario and the inadequate care scenario...|$|R

The deal gave the Flames four days with which they had exclusive rights to negotiate with Bouwmeester before he became an unrestricted free agent and gained the ability to negotiate with any team. Hours before that deadline expired, Bouwmeester and the Flames agreed to a five-year, $33 million contract.|$|E

3000|$|The {{information}} on the <b>negotiated</b> and residual part of the wage also allows us to investigate whether {{an increase in the}} <b>negotiated</b> wage induces firms to adjust the other component of the wage. The red line in Figs.  11 and 12 represents the <b>negotiated</b> part of the wages. Note that due to the institutional setting, the evolution of the <b>negotiated</b> part of the wages is sticky as it is usually predetermined for 3  years. As a result the <b>negotiated</b> part of the wages continued to rise even during years of economic downturn (grey area). 16 However, a simple graphical inspection of the evolution of the <b>negotiated</b> (red line) and residual (black line) part of the wages shows that in 2009 and in 2014, firms compensated for the increase of the <b>negotiated</b> part of the wages by reducing the residual component. 17 [...]...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{whether a}} {{government}} party always prefers to <b>negotiate</b> with another compact party {{rather than with}} many different parties in a legislature. We claim that the interaction between ideological polarization and number of parties {{plays an important role}} in this decision. We start by modeling two types of legislatures: The 2 -parties legislature, in which the government party <b>negotiates</b> with another compact party; and the m+ 1 -parties legislature, in which it <b>negotiates</b> with m> 2 parties. Parties <b>negotiate</b> on both a public (ideological) and a distributive (private) policy. Our main result shows that the government party does not always prefer to <b>negotiate</b> in a bilateral situation. If the level of ideological polarization in the 2 -parties legislature is high enough, it prefers to <b>negotiate</b> with m less polarized parties. We also find that if there are two legislatures with the same number of parties, the government party prefers to <b>negotiate</b> in that with the smallest level of ideological polarization. number of parties, bargaining, legislature...|$|R
