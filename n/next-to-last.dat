5|$|After {{their success}} in the 1985 series, the Hanshin Tigers began an 18-year losing streak placing last or <b>next-to-last</b> in the league. Brief rallies in 1992 and 1999 brought hope to fans, but they were soon {{followed}} with defeat.|$|E
5|$|Over 500 extras {{were used}} for the <b>next-to-last</b> scene, the {{blockade}} of the building at Daley Center, including 200 National Guardsmen, 100 state and city police officers, with 15 horses for the mounted police (and three each Sherman tanks, helicopters, and fire engines).|$|E
5|$|David Cutcliffe {{was brought}} in prior to the 2008 season, and amassed more wins {{in his first season}} than the {{previous}} three years combined. The 2009 team won 5 of 12 games, and was eliminated from bowl contention in the <b>next-to-last</b> game of the season. Mike MacIntyre, the defensive coordinator, was named 2009 Assistant Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA).|$|E
5|$|The draft {{order was}} {{determined}} by a coin toss, the winner of which could choose either: (a) the first overall pick in the expansion draft and the 28th, and last, pick {{in the first round}} of the 1993 MLB amateur draft; or (b) allow the other team to pick first and receive both the second and third overall expansion draft picks, the right to pick first in the subsequent rounds of the expansion draft, and the 27th, and <b>next-to-last,</b> overall pick in the 1993 MLB amateur draft. Colorado won the toss and chose to pick first overall.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league {{contract}} {{to return to the}} Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He was activated on the <b>next-to-last</b> day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24appearances (22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Chance endured {{surgeries}} {{to correct}} blood clots {{in his brain}} that were caused by being hit by pitches in his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs {{in an effort to}} save the team money. The New York Yankees negotiated for Chance's release from the Cubs after the 1912 season. The Cubs released Chance while he was hospitalized, and in January 1913, Chance signed a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 ($ in current dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees' manager. He also played first base for the Yankees and served as field captain, though he played in no more than 12 games in a season. The Yankees sat in last place on the <b>next-to-last</b> day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to finish in seventh place. In 1914, Chance named Roger Peckinpaugh the Yankees' new captain.|$|E
5|$|Kasuga was the <b>next-to-last</b> of the 10 Giuseppe Garibaldi-class armored cruisers to be built. The first {{ship had}} been {{completed}} in 1895 and the class had enjoyed considerable export success, and had been gradually improved over the years. The last two ships of the class were ordered on 23 December 1901 by the Argentine Navy {{in response to the}} order by Chile for two second-class battleships. The possibility of war between Argentina and Chile, however, abated before the vessel was completed, and a combination of financial problems and British pressure forced Argentina to dispose of Bernardino Rivadavia and her sister ship Mariano Moreno. The Argentine government attempted to sell the ships to Russia, but negotiations failed over the price demanded by the Argentinians. The Japanese government quickly stepped in and purchased them due to increasing tensions with Russia despite the high price of ¥14,937,390 (£1,530,000) for the two sisters. Already planning to attack Russia, the government delayed their surprise attack on Port Arthur that began the Russo-Japanese War until the ships had left Singapore and could not be delayed or interned by any foreign power.|$|E
5|$|Reeves' {{impact was}} immediate. As Parcells {{had done in}} 1984, Reeves named Simms his {{starting}} quarterback. The defense returned to form, and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two regular season games left, the Giants were 11–3 and appeared poised for a first-round playoff bye. They were upset by a Phoenix Cardinals team, {{who came into the}} game with just five wins, 17–6, in the <b>next-to-last</b> week of the season, setting up a winner–take–all contest against Dallas in the final regular season game. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series and home-field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first-round game, 17–10 over the Vikings. However, they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3 in the divisional playoffs. Simms played in all 16 games, completing nearly 62% of his passes, and threw for over 3,000 yards and 15 touchdowns. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates made the Pro Bowl, and Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. After the season, Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms, the two biggest figures of the late 1980s and early 1990s Giants teams, retired.|$|E

25|$|In {{the tables}} below the {{possibilities}} of syllable nucleus of the <b>next-to-last</b> syllable and their accent is shown. The different sound of a <b>next-to-last</b> syllable makes no grammatical distinction, for example, words nóras – wish and kū́nas – body, are of the same declensional and accentuation patterns. But {{there are a few}} certain differences in the accentuation features of the nucleus sounds of the <b>next-to-last</b> syllable. Most of the vocals and diphthongs can have either of the accents: a start-firm or an end-firm. Short a, e sounds, when they are in a stem of a word and stressed, lengthen and have always an end-firm accent; i, u are short and there is no accentual differentiation in their stress. Mixed diphthongs a, e + l, m, n, r have the first element lengthened when stressed in a start-firm accent, when in i, u + l, m, n, r and a diphthong ui the first element remains short in the same case. The words having ą, ę in a pre-desinential syllable are not included here {{because of the lack of}} declensional types. Some examples: rą̃stas 2 – balk, timber; žąsìs 4 – goose; ąsà 4 – handle; kę́sas 3 – hassock.|$|E
25|$|The words having acute {{intonation}} (|_́_|-|__|, |_̀_|-|__|) in the <b>next-to-last</b> syllable (for {{the first}} accentuation pattern the accent falls {{only on the}} stem, for the third it moves to the ending in certain cases) are accentuated in the first or the third patterns.|$|E
25|$|The Hunter Mountain Fire Tower {{is located}} on the summit of the eponymous mountain, second highest of the Catskill Mountains in the U.S. state of New York. It was the first of 23 fire lookout towers built by the state in the region, and the <b>next-to-last</b> of the five still {{standing}} to be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Stress is phonemic in Kapampangan. Primary stress {{occurs on}} either the last or the <b>next-to-last</b> {{syllable}} of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs {{at the end of}} a word. Stress shift can occur and it may shift to the right or the left to differentiate between nominal or verbal use, as in the following examples.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2004, the Angels {{mounted a}} {{comeback}} {{to overcome the}} division leading Oakland Athletics {{in the last week}} of the regular season, clinching the title in the <b>next-to-last</b> game. However, they were swept in the American League Division Series 3 games to 0 by the AL Wild Card Boston Red Sox, who, after beating their longtime rivals, the New York Yankees, went on to win their first World Series since 1918.|$|E
25|$|Alvise Da Mosto, {{built at}} the Cantieri Riuniti del Quarnaro in Fiume, was laid down on 22 August 1928, {{launched}} on 1 July 1929 and completed on 15 March 1931. During the sea trials she reached {{a top speed of}} 42.7 knots, the fastest ship in her class. As the was the <b>next-to-last</b> of her class to enter service, she had already received the modifications that her sisterships needed after completion in order to improve stability and seaworthiness.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the lockout}} of the 2004–05 season, new GM Dale Tallon set about {{restructuring}} {{the team in}} the hopes of making a playoff run. Tallon made several moves in the summer of 2005, most notably the signing of Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin and All-Star defenseman Adrian Aucoin. However, injuries plagued Khabibulin and Aucoin, among others, and the Blackhawks again finished well out of the playoffs with a 26–43–13 record – <b>next-to-last</b> in the Western Conference and the second-worst in the NHL.|$|E
25|$|Virginia built {{many schools}} after World War I and again after World War II, but such barely {{kept up with}} {{population}} growth. Virginia had among the lowest tax rates in the nation, so local school boards often scrimped on school construction. Before $45 million in appropriations during the administration of Governor John S. Battle, per pupil expenditures and teacher salaries both remained below national averages, and the state ranked last nationally in percentage of high school age children actually attending high school, and <b>next-to-last</b> in college age children going to college.|$|E
25|$|All teams must {{abide by}} the rules set at the {{beginning}} of the race. Failure to do so can result in time penalties, which can negatively affect finishing position in that leg of the race. In a non-elimination leg, if the last team to arrive at the mat is checked in before a previous team has completed its penalty, then the remainder of the penalty time will be waited out at the start of the next leg of the race, beginning at the departure time of the <b>next-to-last</b> team.|$|E
25|$|The {{numbers in}} the upper row mean {{accentuation}} types. For the third type the additional information is given in dictionaries. The mark 3 without the letter added, is for words, stressed in the <b>next-to-last</b> syllable. The letter after is for polysyllabic words and says what type of stress the syllable has in those cases where the stress falls on the stem (other cases receive it on the ending) and how distant from the ending the syllable stressed is. The letter a is for a start-firm (tvirtapradė priegaidė) accent and the letter b – for an end-firm (tvirtagalė priegaidė) and short stressed vowel. The single digit with a letter means that the stress falls on the third syllable from the ending; if the stress falls on the fourth syllable from the ending, the mark is 34a or 34b, there are also nouns having stress in the fifth (35a, 35b) and sixth (36b) syllable from the ending. Here are {{a few examples of}} the nouns of the third accentuation pattern, the singular nominative and the plural dative and accusative cases: akmuõ, akmenìms, ãkmenis; áugalas, augaláms, áugalus; žándas, žandáms, žándus. The first declension also include nouns stressed in the more distant from the ending syllable than the <b>next-to-last,</b> but their stress is steady through the cases and is always clear from the nominative singular.|$|E
25|$|During the {{coalition}} government's brief tenure {{and one year}} afterwards, due to the protracted lack of a permanent central authority, the Fund For Peace's Fragile States Index (FSI; {{formerly known as the}} Failed States Index) listed Somalia on top for six consecutive years between 2008 and 2013. In 2009, Transparency International ranked the nation in last place on its annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), a metric that purports to show the prevalence of corruption in a country's public sector. In mid-2010, the Institute for Economics and Peace also ranked Somalia in the <b>next-to-last</b> position in between war-afflicted Iraq and Afghanistan on its Global Peace Index.|$|E
25|$|Faced with relegation, {{the board}} financed two key acquisitions. Firstly, young Arsenal striker John Hartson in a £3.3million move (again {{breaking}} the club's transfer record) {{and in addition}} the signing of Newcastle United forward Paul Kitson in a £1.2million move and battling Manchester City midfielder Steve Lomas for £1.6million. The strike pair were an instant hit, scoring 13 goals between them in 12 games as a pairing, including those in a vital 4–3 win against close rivals Tottenham, a 3–2 against Chelsea and a hat-trick for Kitson and brace for Hartson in a 5–1 rout of Sheffield Wednesday in the <b>next-to-last</b> game, confirming the club's survival and effectively saving Redknapp's job.|$|E
25|$|Some {{spaces of}} the tables are not filled, {{but this does not}} mean that there are no words which would fit. The sounds a, e (end-firm when stressed) and i, u (short) can not be start-firm and {{consequently}} the word having them in the <b>next-to-last</b> stressed syllable can not be of the first and the third accentuation pattern. Some of the declensional types include few words, for example there are only two words of the third accentuation pattern in the fifth declension: sūnùs and lietùs. The number of words (Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language / Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000) of the declensional patterns can be checked in the section above.|$|E
25|$|The 49ers {{looked forward}} to {{becoming}} the first NFL team to win three consecutive Super Bowls, and they moved through the playoffs to the NFC Championship Game to face the New York Giants. The 49ers defense was able to hold backup quarterback Jeff Hostetler and the Giants without a touchdown, but the tide of the game changed when Montana was sacked by Leonard Marshall while rolling out of the quarterback pocket; he was injured and left the game, which the Giants won, 15–13, on the last of five Giants field goals, which {{was set up by}} a fumble from 49ers running back Roger Craig. It would be Montana's <b>next-to-last</b> appearance in a 49er uniform.|$|E
25|$|The Clausura tournament saw América end in <b>next-to-last</b> {{place in}} the general standings. This had not been seen since the mid-1950s. In {{the first five months}} of 2008, América was showered with twelve defeats, two draws and three victories, which {{resulted}} in the third-straight tournament without qualifying for the playoffs. The manager at the time was Rubén Omar Romano, {{who was one of the}} least successful coaches in the club's history. Coincidently, after being replaced by Juan Antonio Luna, América got their third victory of the Clausura against Monterrey. Despite their poor domestic form, América fared well in the Copa Libertadores, defeating Brazilian side Flamengo in the round-of-16 3–0 at the Estádio do Maracanã, overturning a 2–4 first-leg deficit, and advancing to the quarter-finals.|$|E
25|$|Liège {{first came}} under attack on 6 August 1914. When the Liège's fortifications proved {{unexpectedly}} stubborn, the Germans brought heavy siege artillery to bombard the forts with shells far larger than {{they were designed to}} resist. Hollogne was heavily bombarded starting 13 August. On 15 August the neighboring Fort de Loncin exploded under bombardment at 1720 hours. At 1900 hours a German delegation arrived and offered to take the commandant to see the wreckage of Loncin. The fort's doctor and another officer went to Loncin, reporting back at 2200. A plan was then proposed the evacuate and blow up the fort, which was stymied when the garrison discovered that it was surrounded. German artillery bombardment recommenced the next day; Hologne surrendered at 0730 on the 16th, the <b>next-to-last</b> Liège fort to capitulate.|$|E
25|$|After the 1976 season, {{most of the}} Athletics' veteran players {{did become}} {{eligible}} for free agency, and predictably almost all left. Several decades and 3,000 miles later, one of baseball's most storied franchises suffered yet another dismemberment of a dynasty team. As happened {{with the end of}} the A's first dynasty in the early 1900s, the collapse was swift and total. The next three years were as bad as the worst days in Philadelphia or Kansas City, with the A's finishing last twice and <b>next-to-last</b> once. In 1977, for instance—only three years after winning the World Series and two years after playing for the pennant—the A's finished with the worst record in the American League, and the second-worst record in baseball. They even trailed the expansion Seattle Mariners (though by only 1/2 game, as one game with the Minnesota Twins was canceled by weather and never made up).|$|E
25|$|November {{had five}} Thursdays that year (instead of the more-common four), Roosevelt {{declared}} the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving {{rather than the}} fifth one. Although many popular histories state otherwise, he made clear that his plan was to establish the holiday on the <b>next-to-last</b> Thursday in the month instead of the last one. With the country still {{in the midst of}} The Great Depression, Roosevelt thought an earlier Thanksgiving would give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas. Increasing profits and spending during this period, Roosevelt hoped, would help bring the country out of the Depression. At the time, advertising goods for Christmas before Thanksgiving was considered inappropriate. Fred Lazarus, Jr., founder of the Federated Department Stores (later Macy's), is credited with convincing Roosevelt to push Thanksgiving to a week earlier to expand the shopping season, and within two years the change passed through Congress into law.|$|E
25|$|After the 2009 season, Corp {{transferred}} to Richmond, and after off-season practices, Mustain became Barkley's back-up for the 2010 season. Before the season, Mustain was diagnosed and started treatment for {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and head coach Pete Carroll left to coach in the NFL and was replaced by Lane Kiffin, who stuck with Barkley as the starter. Mustain proceeded to back up Barkley until Barkley was injured in the <b>next-to-last</b> game of the season, allowing Mustain to start his first football game since playing at Arkansas in 2006. Starting in the Notre Dame rivalry game, Mustain put up 21-for-38 passes for 183 yards with one interception in a game that became known for a pass that was dropped: In the final two minutes of the game, Mustain threw an accurate pass to a wide-open Ronald Johnson that would have resulted in a touchdown and the probable win, but Johnson bobbled the ball and dropped it. Moments after the drop, Mustain threw his only interception of the game to seal the loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparation}} {{games were}} started by barely defeating the Poland national team 59–58 on August 4, {{and with a}} loss to the Georgia national team 81–70 on August 5. Following it, the team traveled to Orléans, France {{to participate in a}} not more fortunate international tournament, losing both games to the Croatia national team 80–82 and to the France national team 77–98. On August 18, Lithuanians reached their second victory by crushing Romania national team 97–64 in Riga, but were convincingly defeated by the Latvia national team 77–87 on the next day, mostly due to the youngsters Dāvis Bertāns and Kristaps Porziņģis. After returning to Lithuania, the team's final roster was announced on August 23; however, during the team's <b>next-to-last</b> warmup game before EuroBasket, against Iceland national team, Lukas Lekavičius suffered a broken foot that kept him out of the tournament and diminished the 84–62 victory. He was replaced on the roster by Adas Juškevičius. The farewell game was played on August 25 in Vilnius, and was lost during the final seconds 78–79.|$|E
25|$|The Top 14 is {{organized}} by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which runs the professional rugby leagues within France (Top 14 and Rugby Pro D2). There exists a promotion and relegation system between the Top 14 and Pro D2. Starting with the 2017-18 season, only the lowest-placed club on the ladder after the regular season is automatically relegated to Pro D2. The playoff champion of Pro D2 is automatically promoted, while the <b>next-to-last</b> Top 14 club and the playoff runner-up of Pro D2 play each other to determine which club will be in Top 14, and which will be in Pro D2 the following season. Starting with the 2009–10 season, the Top 14 knock-out stages consist of three rounds. The teams finishing third through to sixth on the ladder play quarter-finals, hosted by the No. 3 and No. 4 teams. The winners then face the top two seeds in the semi-finals, whose winners then meet in the final at the Stade de France (although the 2016 final was instead held at the Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain due to a scheduling conflict with France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016). In previous seasons, only the top four teams qualified for semi-finals. Unlike many other major rugby competitions (such as the Aviva Premiership, Mitre 10 Cup, Currie Cup, and from 2009–10 the Celtic League/Pro12), the Top 14 has traditionally held its semi-finals at neutral sites.|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats, {{coached by}} Adolph Rupp, began the 1965–66 season with an 83–55 win over Hardin–Simmons University on December 1, 1965. In road games at Virginia and Illinois, Kentucky prevailed by 26 and 18 points respectively. Wins {{in three games}} at home gave the Wildcats a 6–0 win–loss record, and the team was {{selected}} at number ten in the AP Poll, having previously been unranked. After three more victories by margins of 10 points or more, the Wildcats began play in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on January 8, 1966, at Florida. Kentucky won 78–64, before a contest in Georgia that required two overtime periods. The Wildcats, by this time up to second in the national rankings, managed a four-point victory. The team reached {{number one in the}} AP Poll in the February 8 rankings, and Kentucky's undefeated streak continued into early March. In the Wildcats' <b>next-to-last</b> regular season game, Tennessee handed them their first loss, by a score of 69–62. With a 103–74 win over Tulane, Kentucky completed the regular season with a record of 24–1 (15–1 in conference play), and had the top ranking in the AP Poll. Forward Pat Riley was the team's leading scorer; including postseason play, he averaged 21.9 points per game, and his 8.9 rebounds per game also led the club. Guard Louie Dampier had a 21.1 point-per-game average and played the most minutes of anyone on the Wildcats' roster. Larry Conley led Kentucky in assists.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008 the South African {{government}} {{announced that it}} would introduce electricity rationing. On 25 January 2008 the country's deepening power crisis was such that South Africa's (and the world's) largest gold and platinum mining companies were forced to shut down operations. Eskom (the national power supplier) and the government both apologised for the blackouts and in his <b>next-to-last</b> State of the Nation speech Mbeki devoted nearly three pages to the electricity crisis, repeating the apologies of Eskom and the government. Mbeki blamed the power shortages on increased demand caused by years of economic growth and the provision of electricity to black townships that were not connected in the apartheid era. But Mbeki also admitted the government had failed to heed warnings from Eskom (the earliest 10 years previously) that without new power stations Eskom {{might not be able to}} meet demand by 2007. Each year over the preceding 10 years, Eskom had produced annual Integrated Strategic Electricity Plans each setting out scenarios of future investment requirements to cope with projected increased demand, but although projections of average demand growth in the period 2001–2005 had been accurate, no investment had been forthcoming. Mbeki failed to respond to allegations that the government's black empowerment strategy had been a root cause of the problem in that small and medium sized black entrepreneurs, in preference to large corporations, had been awarded coal supply tenders. The policy of giving preference to small suppliers had caused problems in securing reliable supplies of coal, and had also, because small suppliers did not have the capital to invest in rail or conveyor belts infrastructure but used coal trucks, accelerated the wear and tear damage to the roads around the power stations. Warnings highlighted in several of Eskom's annual reports, starting in 2003, had been ignored not only by the Eskom board but also its political masters, Mbeki's government.|$|E
