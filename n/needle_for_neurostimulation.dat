Similarities and differences in scales and questionnaires for the valid identification of a neuropathic pain component are discussed.

40|$|<b>Neurostimulation</b> {{techniques}} <b>for</b> {{the treatment}} of primary headache syndromes, particularly of chronic cluster headache, have received much interest in recent years. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) has yielded favourable clinical results and, despite the limited numbers of published cases, is becoming a routine treatment for refractory chronic cluster headache in specialized centres. Meanwhile, other promising techniques such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or sphenopalate ganglion stimulation have emerged. In this article {{the current state of}} clinical research <b>for</b> <b>neurostimulation</b> techniques <b>for</b> chronic cluster headache is reviewed...|$|R
