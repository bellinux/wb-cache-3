40|$|We {{investigated}} whether speakers {{represent their}} partners' task {{in a joint}} naming paradigm. Two participants took turns in <b>naming</b> pictures; occasionally <b>the</b> (initial) picture {{was replaced by a}} different picture (target), signaling that they had to stop <b>naming</b> <b>the</b> initial picture. When the same participant had to <b>name</b> <b>the</b> target picture, he or she completed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of <b>the</b> initial picture more often than when neither participant had to <b>name</b> <b>the</b> target picture. Crucially, when the other participant had to <b>name</b> <b>the</b> target picture, the first participant also completed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of <b>the</b> initial picture more often than when neither participant <b>named</b> <b>the</b> target picture. However, the tendency to complete <b>the</b> initial <b>name</b> was weaker when the other participant had to <b>name</b> <b>the</b> target than when the same participant went on to <b>name</b> <b>the</b> target. We argue that speakers predict that their partner is about to respond using some, but not all, of the mechanisms they use when they prepare to speak...|$|R
