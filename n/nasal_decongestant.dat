A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, (actually more similar to norepinephrine,) was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. [...] Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a <b>nasal</b> <b>decongestant</b> under the trade name Benzedrine Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed {{for the treatment of}} narcolepsy, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications.
