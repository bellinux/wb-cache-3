(Indonesian) migrant workers are often suffered from inhumane action and unable to obtain maximum protection of their rights. It can also be said that they experience dehumanization. The latest example advertisement entitled "Indonesian maids are now on sale", circulated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in October 2012. This advertisement is considered as dehumanization of Indonesian migrant workers, as if they were items that can be sold and traded. Attempts to humanize Indonesian labors can be done in various ways, such as by providing strong regulations. Some of these laws include the Law <b>No.</b> 39 <b>year</b> 2004 concerning the Protection and Placement of Indonesian Workers Abroad; Law <b>No.</b> 37 <b>year</b> 1999 on Foreign Relations; the ICCPR that has been ratified by the Government of Indonesia in Law <b>no.</b> 12 <b>year</b> 2005; Law <b>No.</b> 16 <b>year</b> 2012 on the Ratification of the International Convention on Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families; and Law <b>No.</b> 16 <b>year</b> 2011 about Legal Aid.

25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} a {{leap year}} if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is a leap year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that <b>no</b> <b>year</b> divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E

This suggests that Seti II's reign at Thebes was interrupted {{by the rise of}} a rival: king Amenmesse in Upper Egypt. Secondly, the German scholar Wolfgang Helck has shown that Amenmesse is only attested in Upper Egypt by several Year 3 and a single Year 4 ostracas; Helck also noted that <b>no</b> <b>Year</b> 1 or Year 2 ostracas from Deir El Medina could legitimately be assigned to Amenmesse's reign. This conforms well with the clear evidence of Seti II's control over Thebes in his first two years, which is attested by various documents and papyri. In contrast, Seti II is absent from Upper Egypt during his third and fourth years which are notably unattested—presumably because Amenmesse controlled this region during this time.|$|E
