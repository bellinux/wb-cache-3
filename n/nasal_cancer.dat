40|$|Background The New Zealand city of Rotorua {{sits on a}} {{geothermal}} field. However, {{little is}} known about the possible health impacts of the geothermal emissions. This was an ecological study that examined cancer incidence and morbidity data for Rotorua. Methods Cancer registry and hospital discharge (morbidity) data were obtained for the decade 1981 - 1990. Standardized incidence ratios (SLR) were calculated com-paring Rotorua residents with those living in the rest of New Zealand. Diagnostic categories examined were based on known target organ systems of hydrogen sulphide toxicity. Results Of the cancer sites, there was an elevated rate for <b>nasal</b> <b>cancers.</b> However, this was based on only four cases. The SIR for cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung in Maori women was 1. 48 (95 % CI: 1. 03 - 2. 06). This was not explained by higher smoking rates. In the hospital discharge data, a number of diseases showed elevated SIR, notably diseases of the nervous system and the eye. To some extent, these effects were characteristic of effects induced by hydrogen sulphide and also mercury compounds. However, there were few data with which to assess whether significant mercury exposures had occurred, and other explanations were possible. Conclusions There are inadequate exposure data for Rotorua to permit conclusions on likely causal associations. However, some of the elevated disease rates were at least consistent with what one might expect to find if sufficient exposures to hydrogen sulphide and/or mercury were occurring...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chronic {{exposure}} to nickel compounds {{is associated with}} increased incidence of certain types of human cancer, including lung and <b>nasal</b> <b>cancers.</b> Despite intensive investigation, the oncogenic processes remain poorly understood. Apoptosis resistance is a key feature for tumor cells to escape physiological surveillance and acquire growth advantage over normal cells. Although NiCl 2 exposure induces transformation of human lung epithelial cells, little information is available with regard to its molecular mechanisms, it is also not clear if the transformed cells are apoptosis resistant and tumorigenic. We explored the apoptosis resistance properties of nickel chloride-transformed human lung epithelial cells and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that transformed BEAS- 2 B human lung epithelial cells are resistant to NiCl 2 -induced apoptosis. They have increased Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL and catalase protein levels over the passage matched non-transformed counterparts. The mechanisms of apoptosis resistance are mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent. Forced overexpression of Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL and catalase proteins reduced NiCl 2 -induced cell death; siRNA-mediated knockdown of their expression sensitized the cells to nickel-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Bcl- 2, Bcl-xl and catalase protein expression plays {{a critical role in}} apoptosis resistance. Akt also participates in this process, as its overexpres-sion increases Bcl-xL protein expression levels and attenuates NiCl 2 -induced apoptosis. Furthermore, transformed cells are tumorigenic in a xenograft model. Together, these results demon-strate that nickel-transformed cells are apoptosis-resistant and tumorigenic. Increased expression of Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL and catalase proteins are important mechanisms contributing to transformed cell oncogenic properties...|$|R
