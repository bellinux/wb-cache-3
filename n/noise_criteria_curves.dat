The analyses have been conducted for different values of inlet mass flow rate on 2 -D and 3 -D models. Noise computations {{have been made in}} different points of control volume (Receivers) to better predict the volume distribution of sound pressure. The Ffwocs Williams–Hawkings model has been used for aero-acoustic analysis which is based on the Lighthill acoustic analogy generalized with the inclusion of moving surface. The k-ε turbulence RANS model in its “Realizable” version has been used and all simulations have been accomplished by the use of the STAR-CCM+ CFD software. The Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in the hearing range measured in the receivers, opportunely rescaled in according to weighting curves (dBA), have been filtered in octave bands. These curves have been successively compared with <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> <b>curves,</b> that establish the maximum SPL acceptable level for the different environments...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) United States Operational Segment {{has four}} {{permanent}} rack sized ISS Crew Quarters (CQs) providing a private crew member space. The CQs use Node 2 cabin air for ventilation/thermal cooling, {{as opposed to}} conditioned ducted air-from the ISS Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA) or the ISS fluid cooling loop. Consequently, CQ can only increase the air flow rate to reduce the temperature delta between the cabin and the CQ interior. However, increasing airflow causes increased acoustic noise so efficient airflow distribution is an important design parameter. The CQ utilized a two fan push-pull configuration to ensure fresh air at the crew member's head position and reduce acoustic exposure. The CQ ventilation ducts are conduits to the louder Node 2 cabin aisle way which required significant acoustic mitigation controls. The CQ interior needs to be below <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>curve</b> 40 (NC- 40). The design implementation of the CQ ventilation system and acoustic mitigation are very inter-related and require consideration of crew comfort balanced with use of interior habitable volume, accommodation of fan failures, and possible crew uses that impact ventilation and acoustic performance. Each CQ required 13 % of its total volume and approximately 6 % of its total mass to reduce acoustic noise. This paper illustrates the types of model analysis, assumptions, vehicle interactions, and trade-offs required for CQ ventilation and acoustics. Additionally, on-orbit ventilation system performance and initial crew feedback is presented. This approach is applicable to any private enclosed space that the crew will occupy...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems {{are used to}} {{quantify}} the background noise in a built environment, including <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NC), Balanced <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC Mark II), A-weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq), and others. An on-going debate exists in the acoustical community over which criterion is the most appropriate {{to use in the}} variety of ambient noise situations encountered. In an effort to quantitatively support the use of individual criterion, this project subjectively correlates these various criteria with human task performance and perception. Eleven subjects participated in a pilot study by completing typing and proofreading tasks, as well as subjective ratings of loudness, annoyance, and spectral quality. Results show that {{there were no significant differences}} in productivity scores among the 12 noise exposures tested; however, significant relationships were found between indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> predictions of level and subjective perception of loudness and annoyance. In this study, RC and RC-Mark II were found to be the most correlated with level perception, although NC, NCB, and LAeq were also strongly correlated. Additionally, interesting relationships were found between subjective perceptions of rumble or roar and criteria predictions of such. The authors are in the process of extending the pilot study to more subjects, as well as examining the effects of tonal and fluctuating background <b>noise</b> spectra on <b>criteria</b> predictions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{differences in}} task performance and perception under six non-time-varying ventilation-type background noise spectra with differing tonality. The results {{were related to}} five indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems: <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NC), Balanced <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC-Mark II), and the A-weighted equivalent sound pressure level (LAeq). These criteria systems are commonly used in the U. S. building industry, but concerns exist over whether they are appropriate for all noise situations. Thirty test subjects completed three types of performance tasks (typing, reasoning, and math) and answered questions about {{their perception of the}} indoor environment under each noise condition. Results showed that performance scores did not change significantly across the six noise conditions, but there were differences in subjective perception. For example, perception trends for tonality, annoyance, and distraction changed based on the frequency and prominence of discrete tones in noise. However, these perceptual changes were not fully reflected in the criteria level or spectral quality ratings. Additionally, task performance was related to subjective perception but not to criteria level predictions. As a result, the authors suggest that the current criteria should be modified to account for the frequency and prominence of tones in background noise...|$|R

40|$|Overall {{loudness}} is not {{the only}} quality of indoor background noise that affects occupants. The distribution of noise across frequency (pitch), whether or not the noise contains tones, and whether or not the noise changes over time must also be considered. There are several indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems available to quantify the background noise in rooms, but many of them do not account for these factors. These systems are commonly used by architects and engineers, and often incorporated into manufacturer’s data, design guides, and standards. There is much debate over which of the criteria systems best reflect how occupants will respond to noise. To examine these issues, an extensive study is being completed at the University of Nebraska investigating the effects of various types of air-conditioning noise on occupant productivity and perception.

40|$|Several <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> methods {{commonly}} used in architectural acoustics have been quantitatively related to human noise perception and task performance {{under a variety of}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems-induced background noise conditions. The five <b>criteria</b> examined were: <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NC), Balanced <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC Mark II), and A-weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq). ^ The project was completed over three phases. Phase I included twelve background noise conditions controlled to be non-varying over time and non-tonal, while exhibiting neutral, rumbly, roaring, or hissy characteristics. Phase II was conducted as an intermediate study to examine specifically the effects of exposure time length and types of performance tasks used. Phase III investigated the effects of background noise exposures containing various levels of discrete tones across a frequency range from 120 to 595 Hz. Under each noise condition, subjects completed performance tasks and answered questions about their perception of the acoustic environment. ^ Results show that task performance is significantly affected by occupant perception of noise, but this relationship is not fully demonstrated by the criteria systems analyzed. It was also found that the five criteria analyzed are generally well suited in describing subjective loudness perception, but that some discrepancies in criteria ratings of spectral quality and subjective perception exist. Finally, perception of annoyance and tonality changed based on the frequency and prominence of discrete tones in noise, but these changes were not reflected in the criteria level or spectral quality ratings. Based on the findings of this work, modifications to the existing criteria are recommended. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A multiple-pass tube-drawing {{process is}} often used to obtain large {{cross-sectional}} reductions in tubular components. For a multi-pass drawing process, it is important to distribute the strains among the individual passes. With even distribution of the strains, there is less chance to exceed the formability limit of the material in any one pass, thus preventing defects such as drawing cracks from occurring. In the present study, an analytical model is developed, which determines the appropriate intermediate tube geometry to ensure uniform strain distributions for a two-pass drawing process. The model is based on the evaluation of the cross-sectional changes of the tube after each pass. For a desired product geometry, the model provides the intermediate diameter and intermediate thickness that should be used to distribute evenly the drawing strains between the two passes. Finite element modelling of the two-pass tube-drawing process confirms the viability and validity of the analytical model. The model has also been used to develop <b>criteria</b> <b>curves</b> for various limit strains. These <b>criteria</b> <b>curves</b> can be used to determine whether the tube will fail or will be successfully drawn in a two-pass process...|$|R
