The two countries share growing {{concerns for the}} environment and want to preserve Costa Rica's tropical resources and prevent environmental degradation. In 2007, the United States reduced Costa Rica's debt in exchange for protection and conservation of Costa Rican forests through a debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swap</b> {{under the auspices of}} the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. This is the largest such agreement of its kind to date. This deal between both governments generated 50 million dollars which were devoted to conservation projects.|$|E

The governments of Indonesia and United States of America have a deal about the agreement in decreasing debt of Indonesia governments partly as donation for natural conservation. This agreement will be implemented on Debt for Nature Swaps (DNS) program. The method of {{this research}} is qualitative research by using explorative method with library research technique used some references that is literatures, articles of scientific journal, and relevant resources. By using theory of national interest concept that is stated by Jack c Plano and Roy Olton, there is interest of creditor country (United States of America) in supporting debtor country (Indonesia) in decreasing their debt through Debt for <b>Nature</b> <b>Swap</b> (DNS) program. The result {{of this research is}} making of united states interest on Debt for <b>Nature</b> <b>Swap</b> (DNS) program in Indonesia as the building of economy and politic on natural conservation in Indonesia through TFCA (The Tropical Forest Conservation Action) design that is TFCA 1 and TFCA 2.

It evaluates the performance of private and Public DNS and inquires whether such swaps have made any significant dent on the debt and deforestation problems besetting many developing countries. It also assesses the prospects for such swaps in the future. We argue that since the prospects for DNS are limited, a more conducive solution for the deforestation problem in many developing countries may lie in generalized resource transfers to these countries of the sort envisaged in recent proposals for a World Environmental Organization (WEO) ...|$|E
50|$|The Nature Conservancy has pioneered {{new land}} {{preservation}} {{techniques such as}} the conservation easement and debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps.</b> A conservation easement {{is a way for}} land owners to ensure that their land remains in its natural state while capitalizing on some of the land's potential development value. Debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps</b> are tools used to encourage natural area preservation in third world countries while assisting the country economically as well: in exchange for setting aside land, some of the country's foreign debt is forgiven.|$|R

5000|$|Debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps</b> {{are usually}} {{actioned}} by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned {{or at least}} used the land in question. Land rights are often expressed in different ways and ownership takes many forms. Some early debt-for-nature swaps tended to overlook the people living on the land set aside for conservation. Subsequent swaps have sought to include local residents, especially indigenous peoples, in the decision making process and the management of lands. Although [...] "seeking" [...] to include {{does not mean that}} local residents have been included. Reports of recent debt swap cases in Madagascar, for instance, indicate local resentment towards conservation projects.|$|R
40|$|Foreign debt, {{although}} it arose in Poland in the seventies, leading {{as a result}} to the debt trap, is a factor which {{must be taken into}} consideration both in decision-making concerning current economic policy and in the construction of a long-term strategy of the development of Poland. The subject of the article are the Polish foreign obligations to the creditors associated in the Paris Club and London Club. In order to solve the debt problem in 1981 Poland undertook lasting several years negotiations with the creditors associated in the Paris Club and London Club. Breakthrough moments in the conducted restructuring talks were: April 1991 with the Paris Club and March 1994 with the London Club. The agreements concluded with the creditors from both clubs caused a reduction of the Polish foreign debt by about 9. 7 billion USD in 1994. In accordance with the accepted schedules the return of the debts to the Paris Club is to be finished in the year 2009; a small payment is due in the year 2014, whereas to the London Club in the year 2024. The established schedule of payment of the foreign debt which utilizes new techniques of reduction of foreign debts (debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swap,</b> Brady Bonds, buy-back) has as its purpose the creation of time for the Polish economy to develop the export potential, attract foreign investments on a larger scale and to structurally adapt making possible the integration of Poland with the European structures. ...|$|E
40|$|Debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps</b> {{involve the}} {{exchange}} of a debtor country's external obligation for that country's agreement to use local currency instruments to support a specific environmental project, such as development of conservation management plans, training of park personnel, or environmental education activities. These agreements are often described as deals where everyone benefits : the debtor country reduces its external debt, the environmental group can leverage its original donation amount, and banks profit from selling their debt on the secondary market or from the publicity value of donating the debt to the environmental group. However, this is a too simplistic analysis of debt for nature agreements. This paper examines whether the debtor country and environmental group benefits from the swap compared to the alternative of a straight donation of funds from the environmental group to the developing country, {{as well as the}} incentives that commercial banks have to donate, rather than sell, debt to international environmental groups.

40|$|Markets {{are often}} {{considered}} {{enemies of the}} environment. A traditional view is that environmental issues are grounded on market externalities because, in cases such as smoking, one individual's consumption is irrevocably linked to those of others. This leads to ill defined private choices and {{to the failure of}} market efficiency. Markets can therefore induce overconsumption of environmental resources, such as clean air. Reciprocally, environmental concerns are often blamed for undermining market performance. Environmental regulation can lead to undue costs and prevent the unfettered behavior needed for achieving market efficiency. Yet recent evidence points in the opposite direction. Markets have evolved some of the most innovative and useful solutions for global environment problems. This includes new and profitable products such as catalytic converters, industrial scrubbers and waste management technologies, as well as new financial instruments such as tradeable emission permits, profit - sharing environmental ventures, and debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps.</b> One observes a groundswell of positive interest in the environment arising from all levels of the business community. This paper examines the role of market innovation in explaining the apparent contradiction between markets and the environment. It argues that market innovation can serve as a powerful tool of environmental policy operating together with a competitive market environment...|$|R

40|$|Brazil {{nuts are}} {{harvested}} {{from the primary}} rainforests in the Amazonian lowlands as a direct form of sustainably using the region’s biological resources. We analyze the ecological economics of Brazil nut production in the Peruvian region of Madre de Dios where nut extraction occurs on hundreds of small-holder concessions operating under long-term agreements. This activity sustains locally important economies that suffer from small volumes and high seasonality. The size and the remoteness of the NTFP concession determine much of its profitability to concessionaires. Seasonality of the harvest generates short-term income peaks {{for the majority of}} collectors. The fragility of the Brazil nut economy in the region is compounded by volatile market prices and the overall development pressures in Amazonia, which usually involve deforestation. Although the current regulatory mechanisms in Peru encourage long-term Brazil nut production in concessions, the income level is seldom high enough to help concession-owners to rise from poverty. Auxiliary financial support based on compensations for the non-valued ecosystem services provided by the forest-covered Brazil nut concessions could change the picture. Funds for these could come from international instruments like those of carbon emission control or debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps.</b> Green marketing could be developed to consider payments supporting ecosystem values as well as mechanisms supporting indigenous communities working with Brazil nuts. Appropriate indicators are needed to optimize those management, policy and trading conditions that best help to preserve the invaluable ecosystem functions and services...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} inter-organizational relationships and organizational development {{that emerged from}} the use of debt for <b>nature</b> <b>swaps</b> (DNS). DNS has been viewed primarily as a financial mechanism that increased the monetary value of conservation donations by converting a country 2 ̆ 7 s discounted debt into funds for environmental protection. ^ I explored aspects of this mechanism that have not been examined previously, focusing on its use as a tool for encouraging relationships among organizations with complementary interests and its potential as a model of inter-organizational governance. To do so, I reviewed and then employed inter-organizational theory to frame the DNS experience. The empirical data includes a general discussion of experiences across the set of countries that participated in these agreements and an in-depth case study of two countries, Bolivia and Costa Rica. Case study methods were used, as well as archival materials, to develop the empirical evidence. ^ The research proposition that initiated this work states that the DNS mechanism generated an adaptive model of transnational environmental governance. I found that this model was adaptive to turbulence associated with the debt crisis by structuring a transnational domain of organizational relationships that together were able to protect biodiversity. This transnational domain includes NGOs and government agencies and extends from local organizations operating on behalf of specific protected areas to international organizations acting to preserve global biodiversity. It exemplifies two recent trends in the environmental field: the internationalization of funding and the localization of action. ^ The findings suggest that DNS is not merely a financial mechanism developed in response to the debt crisis and its national environmental ramifications, but that a transnational model has evolved from it which offers a new approach to environmental planning and governance. In this model, the actors who implement conservation programs also participate in the development of policy and planning. In addition to the introduction and dissemination of this transnational model of governance, the DNS legacy includes the diffusion of the concept of using debt for environmental purposes, the establishment of endowments and environmental trust funds, and the development of capacity among NGOs and government agencies to achieve conservation goals. ...|$|R

5|$|In 2009, Raycom Media (owner of Honolulu-based NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates, KHNL and KFVE) {{announced}} it would take over the operations of local CBS affiliate KGMB (then owned by MCG Capital Corporation), giving it control {{of three of the}} television stations in Hawaii. The deal was a complex arrangement which involved trading the non-license assets of KFVE (such as its call sign, programming, and network affiliation) for those of KGMB (effectively placing the station under Raycom ownership, but using KFVE's license, signal, and virtual channel 5), and taking over KFVE (which moved to the channel 9 license owned by MCG Capital) under a shared services agreement. Due to its <b>nature,</b> the <b>swap</b> was not a transaction that would require the intervention of the FCC, aside from the changing of call signs. The three stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as Hawaii News Now. An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 from the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement. On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE to the aforementioned American Spirit Media.|$|R
5000|$|While the Court {{unanimously}} concurred that Grokster {{could be}} liable for inducing copyright infringement, there was considerable disagreement over whether the case is substantially different from the Sony case, and whether the precedent established by Sony should be modified. On the one hand, Justice Ginsburg, joined by Kennedy and Rehnquist, claim that [...] "this case differs markedly from Sony" [...] as there was insufficient evidence of uses which were non-infringing. On the other hand, Justice Breyer, joined by Stevens and O'Connor, claims [...] "a strong demonstrated need for modifying Sony (or for interpreting Sony's standard more strictly) {{has not yet been}} shown," [...] primarily because [...] "the <b>nature</b> of ... lawfully <b>swapped</b> files is such that it is reasonable to infer quantities of current lawful use roughly approximate to those at issue in Sony."

40|$|When equity default swap (EDS) {{contracts}} {{were first}} {{included in a}} rated collateralized debt obligation (CDO) deal, some critics doubted the originality of the product. In fact, EDSs are equivalent to already existing binary barrier options on equity, except the premium is not paid upfront, but over time, and conditional on the trigger event not having occurred. Therefore, as opposed to existing options, the buyer of an EDS: (1) postpones payment for protection, and (2) purchases not only protection against {{a sharp drop in}} the price of equity, but also the right to cease payments in case the barrier is hit. This paper derives the closed-form pricing formula for equity default swap spreads under the Black-Scholes assumptions, and then quantifies the fraction of the EDS spread actually due to the “swap ” feature of the contract for plausible parameter values. It is found that the extra spread due to the <b>swap</b> <b>nature</b> of EDSs is economically significant only for high volatility, high trigger levels, and long time-to-maturity. The impact of interest rates on the value of the “swap ” feature is almost exclusively due to the postponment of payments. ...|$|R
5000|$|The St Clair {{homestead}} {{was later}} compulsorily {{acquired by the}} Council and demolished {{to make way for}} the St Clair Recreation Centre. In 2008 the Charles Sturt Council proposed a land swap between 4.7 hectares of the Reserve (including the St Clair Oval) with an adjoining contaminated site on the former Actil factory land. This was proposed to allow residential development on the parklands and Oval site. Despite community opposition, including a legal challenge by a group of local residents, the land swap proceeded in late 2009. The Council voted 13 to 3 to proceed with the land swap and transfer the land to the State Government's Land Management Corporation (now known as Renewal SA). This was despite concerns raised by local residents over the unequal <b>nature</b> of the <b>swap</b> (in both land value and open space) and the loss of the park. As of July 2013, the original park remains undeveloped. The Parliament's Upper House has voted to launch another inquiry into the swap and the South Australian chapter of the Returned Service League has voted to support the motion to have the original park retained as a war memorial, both to realise the 1942 petition, and to honour the scattered ashes of war veterans.' ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of {{worldwide}} commitments to meet global basic learning needs made at the 1990 United Nations Conference on Education for All (EFA) in Jomtien, the 2000 World Education Forum in Dakar and the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit in New York, UNESCO has established a Working Group on Debt Swaps for Education which has met on two occasions so far, in 2006 and 2007. Drawing on experiences of bilateral donors such as Spain and Germany, this UNESCO Working Group is now promoting debt-for-education swaps, constructions whereby external debt is cancelled by the creditor {{in exchange for the}} debtor government’s commitment to mobilise domestic resources for education sector spending. The experience with debt swaps in the mid 1990 s was, however, far from positive, and recent improved insight in the economics of debt relief suggests extreme caution. In reviewing debt-for-education swaps between Germany and Indonesia and between Spain and El Salvador, this paper examines to what extent these second- generation debt swaps differ from their contested predecessors. We argue that, while the Paris Declaration’s principles of policy and system alignment appear to have been fairly well implemented on education sector level in both case studies considered, it is mainly the macro-economic <b>nature</b> of such <b>swaps</b> that remains problematic. For debt relief to hold at least some promise of translating into an efficient and effective instrument of development, it should be large and comprehensive, {{as in the case of}} the HIPC Initiative and its successor the MDRI. ...|$|R
40|$|Given a 2 -edge connected, {{positively}} real-weighted graph G with n vertices and m edges, a tree σ-spanner of G is a {{spanning tree}} T in which for every pair of vertices, {{the ratio of}} their distance in T over that in G is bounded by σ, the so-called stretch factor of T. Tree spanners with provably good stretch factors find applications in communication networks, distributed systems, and network design, but unfortunately –as any tree-based infrastructure– they are highly sensitive to even a single link failure, since {{this results in a}} network disconnection. Thus, when such an event occurs, the overall effort that has to be afforded to rebuild an effective tree spanner (i. e., computational costs, set-up of new links, updating of the routing tables, etc.) can be prohibitive. However, if the edge failure is only transient, these costs can simply be avoided, by promptly reestablishing the connectivity through a careful selection of a temporary swap edge, i. e., an edge in G reconnecting the two subtrees of T induced by the edge failure. According to the tree spanner’s <b>nature,</b> a best <b>swap</b> edge for a failing edge e is then a swap edge generating a reconnected tree of minimum stretch factor w. r. t. distances in the graph G deprived of edge e. For this problem we provide two efficient linear-space solutions for both the weighted and the unweighted case, running in O(m 2 logα(m,n)) and O(mn logn) time, respectively. As discussed in the paper, our algorithms also improve on the time complexity of previous results provided for other related settings of the problem...|$|R
