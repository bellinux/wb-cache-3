5|$|The Giants {{struggled}} in 2015, finishing 6-10 again {{and third in}} the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> due to the Giants defense blowing {{the lead in the}} final minutes in 6 of their 10 games. Despite their defensive struggles, Quarterback Eli Manning threw for a career-high 35 touchdown passes and also set career highs in attempts and completions. After the season, head coach Tom Coughlin resigned after 12 seasons.|$|E
5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. By Week 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating Dallas to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans to fire him. However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win the <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b> The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career.|$|E
5|$|The Giants won the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{title for}} the first time since 2000 with a 30–21 win against the Oakland Raiders in the final game of the season. The Giants lost 23–0 to the Carolina Panthers in the first round of the playoffs however. The 2005 Giants had five pro bowlers, {{including}} Barber (who set a team record in rushing yards during the season), Shockey, Strahan, Defensive End Osi Umenyiora, and Special teamer David Tyree.|$|E
5|$|The Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and Washington Redskins {{finished}} the 1985 season with identical 10–6 records. Dallas {{was awarded the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title because they had the best head-to-head record among the three teams. The Giants were awarded a wild card berth because of their record in NFC play, while Washington did not qualify for the playoffs due to a head-to-head loss against the San Francisco 49ers, who also finished 10–6.|$|E
5|$|The Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams (NFC West), and New Orleans Saints (NFC West) {{finished}} the 1988 season with identical 10–6 records. Philadelphia {{was awarded the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title due to a head-to-head sweep of the Giants in regular season play, while Los Angeles was awarded a wild card berth based on winning percentage in NFC play. The Giants and Saints did not qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 2006. The season was {{characterized}} by inconsistent play, criticism of the coaching {{by the media and}} players, and Manning's struggles. They won five straight following a 1–2 start, giving them a two-game lead in the <b>NFC</b> <b>East,</b> but they lost six of their last seven games, and the players publicly clashed with Coughlin. One of the team's worst losses was a 24–21 defeat to Tennessee, in which the team surrendered a 21-point 4th-quarter lead. Following a season-ending win at Washington, the Giants made the playoffs as a wild card in spite of their record, but were defeated 23–20 by Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The New York Giants are an American {{football}} team based in East Rutherford, New Jersey. They are {{a member of}} the National Football League (NFL) and play in the NFL's National Football Conference (<b>NFC)</b> <b>East</b> division. In 92 completed seasons, the franchise has won eight NFL championships, including four Super Bowl victories. The Giants have won more than 600 games and appeared in the NFL playoffs 32 times. Though the Giants play home games in East Rutherford, they draw fans from throughout the New York metropolitan area. In 2010, the team began playing in MetLife Stadium, formerly New Meadowlands Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> champions playing their games on the road. In the 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams. And 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished {{on the outside looking in}} despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b> The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance and told the reporters that he had a feeling that the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Giants hired former Arizona Cardinals {{offensive}} coordinator Jim Fassel as their head coach before the 1997 season. With the team's offense floundering {{once again and}} a 2–3 record after five games, Fassel turned to inexperienced Danny Kanell as the starting quarterback over Dave Brown. The Giants experienced a resurgent season, finishing 10–5–1 and winning the <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b> They hosted a first–round playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings. The Giants led the Vikings {{for most of the}} game, including 22–13 in the 4th quarter, but following a muffed onside kick, the Vikings booted a last-second field goal to win 23–22. Following the season, George Young left the Giants. He was replaced by Ernie Accorsi, a veteran general manager who had successful stints building the Baltimore Colts and Cleveland Browns.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost {{tight end}} Kevin Boss, wide {{receiver}} Steve Smith, guard Rich Seubert, linebacker Keith Bulluck, wide receiver Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O'Hara to free agency. However, the 2011 season {{also saw the}} emerging of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened the season against the Washington Redskins on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, with both New York City and Washington being a target of the attacks. The Redskins beat the Giants 28–14, but the Giants won their next three games, against the Rams, Eagles, and Cardinals. After a loss against the Seattle Seahawks, they went on another three-game winning streak. A key victory was an upset of the New England Patriots 24–20 at Gillette Stadium. The victory ended the Patriots' NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Ballard with 15 seconds left. However, the Giants lost their next three games, before regaining their position atop the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with a tightly contested 37–34 win over the Dallas Cowboys on December 11. After splitting their next two games against the Redskins and New York Jets, a victory over the Cowboys in the last game {{of the regular season}} clinched a postseason appearance for the Giants.|$|E
25|$|Including the 2014 season, the Cowboys {{have won}} the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> 22 times in their 54-year history.|$|E

25|$|With {{the merger}} of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles {{were placed in the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> Division with their archrivals the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins, and the Dallas Cowboys. Their heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rivalries, dating {{all the way back to}} 1933 and has been {{considered}} by writers in Philadelphia as one of the best rivalries in the NFL in the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|Dallas {{finished}} {{the regular season}} winning the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with a 10–4 record, winning their final five regular season games to overcome the St. Louis Cardinals (who lost their final three games and fell to third place in the final standings) and New York Giants (who lost their finale 31–3 to the Los Angeles Rams; a Giants victory would have given New York the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title based upon a better division record and forced a coin toss between the Cowboys and Detroit Lions for the wild card playoff spot).|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} Thanksgiving {{win over the}} Raiders, the Cowboys went to Giants Stadium for the final time to face off against their <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rival the New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas Cowboys {{became the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{division}} champions with their season finale shutout of the Philadelphia Eagles, the second division title in Romo's three full seasons {{as the starting}} quarterback.|$|E
25|$|Gailey led {{the team}} to two playoff {{appearances}} with a 10–6 record in 1998 and an <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> championship, but the Cowboys were defeated in the playoffs by the Arizona Cardinals 20–7.|$|E
25|$|With the win, the Cowboys avoided going 8-8 for {{the first}} time since 2010, and {{clinched}} a winning season, the first since the 2009 team won the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> and won a playoff game.|$|E
25|$|The team's heated {{rivalry with}} the Philadelphia Eagles {{is the oldest}} of the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rivalries, dating {{all the way back to}} 1933, and has been called the best rivalry in the NFL in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Romo led the NFL in {{completion}} percentage and {{passer rating}} {{en route to}} the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title, and he was ranked 34th in the NFL's list of the top 100 players of 2015, the highest undrafted player on the year's list.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 Washington Redskins {{season was}} the team's 75th season, {{and saw the}} team achieve a record of 9–7 and a playoff appearance. This was an {{improvement}} over the 2006 season in which they went 5–11 and finished last in the <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Giants {{finished}} with a 10–6 record and missed the playoffs after losses to the Eagles, who won the <b>NFC</b> <b>East,</b> {{as well as the}} eventual Super Bowl Champion Green Bay Packers. Tuck was named as an alternate to the 2011 Pro Bowl and All-Pro teams.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} road {{win over the}} Buccaneers, the Cowboys would play their very first regular season home game at the new Cowboys Stadium. With an NFL-record regular season crowd on hand, Dallas would play a Sunday night game against their <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rival, the New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{ended the}} season 8–8. They {{were in a}} {{position}} to win the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> but lost to the Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on NBC which allowed New York to win the division. The Giants would go on to win Super Bowl XLVI.|$|E
25|$|With the {{win over}} the Giants, the Cowboys {{improved}} to a league best 6-1 on the season, moved into sole possession of {{first place in the}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> due to the Eagles having a bye week. This is the Cowboys best start to a season since 2007 when the Cowboys also went 6-1 after the first 7 games.|$|E
25|$|Topping {{a three-game}} winning streak and winning its fifth {{out of six}} games, Dallas beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-24 in {{overtime}} in Week 15 (December 16).

25|$|However, the Giants then {{suffered}} a four-game losing streak, including road losses against the resurgent San Francisco 49ers and the New Orleans Saints and home losses to the Eagles and the then-undefeated Green Bay Packers, {{to make their}} record 6–6 entering December. The Giants broke their losing streak with a tightly contested 37–34 road victory over the Cowboys on December 11, but lost at home to the Washington Redskins the following week to make their record 7–7 with a Christmas Eve showdown against their crosstown rival New York Jets the following week. The Giants won, 29–14, and knocked the Eagles out of playoff contention, {{to set up a}} Week 17 home game against the Cowboys in which the winner would clinch the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. The game was flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants defeated the Cowboys, 31–14, and clinched the <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title and the fourth seed in the playoffs. Wide receiver Victor Cruz finished the regular season with 1,536 receiving yards, breaking the Giants franchise record previously held by Amani Toomer.|$|E
25|$|Tuck's {{rookie season}} in the NFL found him behind Pro Bowl {{defensive}} ends Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora on the New York Giants depth chart, reducing his role to special teams and the first backup at each defensive end position. In total, Tuck played in 14 regular season games with one start and the NFC Wild Card Game. His first career sack came against the Giants' <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rival, the Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
