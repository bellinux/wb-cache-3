5|$|Segrè's group set up its {{equipment}} in a disused Forest Service {{cabin in the}} Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943. His group's task was to measure and catalog the radioactivity of various fission products. An important line of research was determining the degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium. Initially, the tests using mass spectrometry, used by Columbia University, and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segrè studied Berkeley's results and could find <b>no</b> <b>error,</b> while Kenneth Bainbridge likewise found no fault with New York's. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement. Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at Los Alamos, which Segrè's group concluded were due to cosmic rays, which were more prevalent at Los Alamos due to its high altitude.|$|E

500|$|If {{an error}} occurs during the play when a batter records a hit, the {{official}} scorer must {{determine whether the}} batter would have advanced {{as far as he}} did had the error not occurred. For example, if a batter hits a ball into an outfield gap, the ball is badly misplayed by an outfielder attempting to retrieve and throw the ball back into the infield, and the batter is able to reach all four bases to score, then the official scorer must decide whether an error should be charged to the outfielder. If <b>no</b> <b>error</b> is charged, then the batter would be credited with an [...] "inside the park" [...] home run. If an error is charged to the outfielder, then the batter would likely be credited with either a double or triple.|$|E
500|$|Solomon Eliot Asch (September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a Polish gestalt {{psychologist}} and pioneer in social psychology in the United States. He created seminal pieces {{of work in}} impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. [...] His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only {{greater than the sum}} of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: [...] "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. <b>No</b> <b>error</b> in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" [...] (Asch, 1952, p.61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Colloquial {{usage of}} the term 'PSK31' in amateur radio usually implies {{the use of the}} most {{commonly}} used variant of PSK31: binary phase shift keying (BPSK). [...] BPSK uses <b>no</b> <b>error</b> control, but an allied mode, QPSK31 quadrature phase shift keying, uses four phases instead of two, to provide a degree of forward error correction. [...] It is simple to switch from BPSK to QPSK if difficulties arise during a contact. [...] When QPSK is used; after encoding into varicode, the binary signal is further transformed into a quaternary set of phase shifts. [...] A sliding window of five bits is used to select one of the four possible phase shifts, providing a means of error correction by spreading each bit of data across adjacent bits. [...] Successful decoding of an input bit requires a large number of phase shift sequences to be received, causing a 20-bit, 640-millisecond latency (delay) in the output of the decoder.|$|E
