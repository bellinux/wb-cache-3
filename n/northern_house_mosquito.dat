50|$|Culex pipiens (the common house {{mosquito}} or <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito)</b> is {{a species}} of blood-feeding mosquito of the family Culicidae. It is a vector of some diseases, such as Japanese encephalitis, meningitis, and urticaria. In the US and parts of Europe, it can spread West Nile virus, and in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, it has been demonstrated to be a vector of Usutu virus.|$|E
30|$|Recently, both C. pipiens (<b>Northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito)</b> and C. quinquefasciatus (Southern house mosquito), {{together}} with C. tarsalis {{and several other}} Culex species, have attracted much attention within the USA and Canada as significant vectors of West Nile Virus. When one considers the number of human pathogenic viruses that Culex species transmit combined with {{the numbers of people}} afflicted with lymphatic filariasis, the overall disease burden created by members of the genus Culex is very large. This burden caused by Culex species exceeds those of dengue and yellow fever transmitted by Aedes aegypti (estimated at ~[*] 20 million) (Goddard et al. 2002).|$|E

The virus is in the virus family Rhabdoviridae, and it is widely distributed in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Flanders virus does not cause disease. The virus is frequently found in birds, such as Red-winged blackbirds, House sparrows, and starlings. It is also found in bird-feeding mosquitoes, such as the black-tailed mosquito (Culiseta melanura) and the <b>northern</b> and southern <b>house</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Culex pipiens and Culex quinquefasciatus, respectively). Presence of the virus in an area serves as a sentinel or warning for West Nile virus and as a trigger for public health control and prevention interventions targeting West Nile virus...|$|R

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that IR40a {{is involved in}} DEET reception in mosquitoes has been tested in the southern <b>house</b> <b>mosquito,</b> Culex quinquefasciatus. Reducing CquiIR40a transcript levels did not affect DEET-elicited behavior or electroantennographic (EAG) responses thus suggesting that IR40a {{is not involved in}} DEET reception in Culex mosquitoes. An antennae-specific odorant receptor, CquiOR136, was demonstrated to respond to DEET and other insect repellents. Similar knockout experiments showed that EAG responses to DEET recorded from mosquitoes with reduced CquiOR136 transcript levels were dramatically lower. Additionally, behavioral tests showed that this phenotype was not repelled by DEET. In conclusion, these results suggest that CquiOR136, not CquiIR40a, is involved in DEET reception in the southern <b>house</b> <b>mosquito.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Throughout the winter, the <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito,</b> Culex pipiens, is {{continually}} exposed to desiccating conditions, and this water deficit is further exacerbated by long periods with {{no access to}} free water. In this study, we report that mosquitoes in diapause are more tolerant of xeric conditions than their nondiapausing counterparts. To counter water loss female mosquitoes reared under conditions that induce diapause have a lower percent water content that results from a higher dry mass which in turn decreases their surface area to volume ratio. Both diapausing and nondiapausing females can tolerate a loss of approximately 30 %, but diapausing females conserve their water reserves more do not reach this limit as readily. This mosquito relies solely on drink-ing free water to replenish its water supply and has no ability to absorb water vapor from the atmosphere. Cuticular hydrocarbon content was nearly 3 x higher in diapausing female mosquitoes than nondiapausing individuals, this enhancement impedes water loss through the cuticle. No differences were noted in sorbitol, trehalose, glycerol or the total sugar contents during diapause. Additionally, the utilization on internal lipids by diapausing C. pipiens was significantly lower than nondiapausing female. Thus, the increased dehydration resistance of diapausing females C. pipiens results from the combination of their larger size, accumulation of additional cuticular lipids, and a suppression of metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Originating from Africa, Usutu virus (USUV) first {{emerged in}} Europe in 2001. This mosquito-borne flavivirus caused high {{mortality}} rates in its bird reservoirs, which strongly resembled {{the introduction of}} West Nile virus (WNV) in 1999 in the United States. Mosquitoes infected with USUV incidentally transmit the virus to other vertebrates, including humans, which can result in neuroinvasive disease. USUV and WNV co-circulate in parts of southern Europe, but the distribution of USUV extends into central and northwestern Europe. In the field, both viruses have been detected in the <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito</b> Culex pipiens, of which the potential for USUV transmission is unknown. To understand the transmission dynamics and assess the potential spread of USUV, we determined the vector competence of C. pipiens for USUV and compared it with the well characterized WNV. We show {{for the first time}} that northwestern European mosquitoes are highly effective vectors for USUV, with infection rates of 11 % at 18  °C and 53 % at 23  °C, which are comparable with values obtained for WNV. Interestingly, at a high temperature of 28  °C, mosquitoes became more effectively infected with USUV (90 %) than with WNV (58 %), which could be attributed to barriers in the mosquito midgut. Small RNA deep sequencing of infected mosquitoes showed for both viruses a strong bias for 21 -nucleotide small interfering (si) RNAs, which map across the entire viral genome both on the sense and antisense strand. No evidence for viral PIWI-associated RNA (piRNA) was found, suggesting that the siRNA pathway is the major small RNA pathway that targets USUV and WNV infection in C. pipiens mosquitoes...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the repellent properties of extracts from the catnip plant (Nepeta cataria) and the Osage orange (Madura pomifera) fruit. This chapter includes results on German cockroach (Blattella germanica), and house fly (Musca domestica) contact irritancy to catnip essential oil, and its major components, Z,E-nepetalactone and E,Z-nepetalactone, compared with the commercial standard, N,Ndiethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Both species showed high percentage repellency values when exposed to filter paper treated with catnip essential oil or the individual nepetalactone isomers. Of the two nepetalactone isomers evaluated, German cockroaches were most responsive to the E,Z isomer. House flies showed similar trends in contact irritancy, responding to surfaces treated with the predominant catnip isomer, Z,E-nepetalactone, more intensely than to the catnip essential oil. Catnip and Osage orange essential oils, and a sesquiterpene found in Osage orange, elemol, were evaluated for repellency to the <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito</b> (Culex pipiens) and are presented here. Two mosquito bioassays were used to measure percentage and contact repellecy. Mosquitoes responded initially with high percentage repellency to surfaces treated with catnip essential oil. From the residual repellency study, this trend in repellency by the catnip oil significantly decreased over the 180 -minute test period. Elemol, and DEET initially had lower percentage repellency values than catnip essential oil, but did not show the negative relationship between percentage repellency and time, retaining excellent repellency throughout the 3 -hour bioassay. Solutions with elemol and DEET exhibited greater significance in contact repellency compared to catnip essential oil. These results show that catnip essential oil is a potent mosquito repellent, but does not provide the same residual effects as the commercial standard, DEET, Elemol, a sesquiterpene extracted from the fruit of the Osage orange, shows excellent promise as a mosquito repellent with comparable activity to DEET in contact and residual repellency...|$|E

40|$|New {{insecticides}} are {{urgently needed}} because resistance to current insecticides allows resurgence of disease-transmitting mosquitoes while concerns for human toxicity from current compounds are growing. We previously reported {{the finding of}} a free cysteine (Cys) residue {{at the entrance of}} the active site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in some insects but not in mammals, birds, and fish. These insects have two AChE genes (AP and AO), and only AP-AChE carries the Cys residue. Most of these insects are disease vectors such as the African malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto) or crop pests such as aphids. Recently we reported a Cys-targeting small molecule that irreversibly inhibited all AChE activity extracted from aphids while an identical exposure caused no effect on the human AChE. Full inhibition of AChE in aphids indicates that AP-AChE contributes most of the enzymatic activity and suggests that the Cys residue might serve as a target for developing better aphicides. It is therefore worth investigating whether the Cys-targeting strategy is applicable to mosquitocides. Herein, we report that, under conditions that spare the human AChE, a methanethiosulfonate-containing molecule at 6 µM irreversibly inhibited 95 % of the AChE activity extracted from An. gambiae s. str. and > 80 % of the activity from the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti L.) or the <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito</b> (Culex pipiens L.) that is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis. This type of inhibition is fast (∼ 30 min) and due to conjugation of the inhibitor to the active-site Cys of mosquito AP-AChE, according to our observed reactivation of the methanethiosulfonate-inhibited AChE by 2 -mercaptoethanol. We also note that our sulfhydryl agents partially and irreversibly inhibited the human AChE after prolonged exposure (> 4 hr). This slow inhibition is due to partial enzyme denaturation by the inhibitor and/or micelles of the inhibitor, according to our studies using atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. These results support our view that the mosquito-specific Cys is a viable target for developing new mosquitocides to control disease vectors and to alleviate resistance problems with reduced toxicity toward non-target species...|$|E
40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) is {{maintained}} {{in a natural}} transmission cycle between mosquito vectors and bird hosts. However, mosquitoes can also transmit WNV to mammals, such as humans and horses, which may result in disease. In Europe, such cases of WNV disease are yearly recurring in southern and central Europe, but have not been detected in northern Europe. The absence of WNV outbreaks in northern Europe {{may be explained by}} lowered vector competence of the main vector for WNV: the <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> <b>mosquito,</b> Culex (Cx.) pipiens. The aim of this thesis was, therefore, to investigate the role of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes in transmission of WNV in Europe, in order to understand differences in WNV circulation between northern and southern Europe. The species Cx. pipiens consists of two biotypes, pipiens and molestus, which can form hybrids. Both biotypes and their hybrids are morphologically identical but differ in their behaviour, which may have consequences for WNV transmission. In this thesis, the Cx. pipiens biotype composition was investigated in The Netherlands, and more broadly at the European scale. These studies revealed that both biotypes and their hybrids are present throughout The Netherlands, {{and that there is a}} shift towards relatively more biotype pipiens mosquitoes at northern latitudes in Europe. The next step was to assess vector competence of these northern European biotypes and their hybrids, and to make a direct comparison with vector competence of a southern European population. Both biotypes and their hybrids originating from The Netherlands are competent vectors for WNV. Interestingly, no differences in vector competence were found between a Dutch and Italian biotype pipiens population. However, both studies revealed that low temperatures of 18 °C are an important limiting factor for WNV transmission. A more in-depth study on the effects of WNV on the host-seeking behaviour of biotype pipiens mosquitoes revealed that WNV infection reduces the host-seeking response towards host odour, but that other fitness parameters (e. g. flight activity, blood-feeding, and survival) are not affected. When results from the biotype composition and vector competence studies were included in a newly developed R 0 model, it becomes clear that biotype pipiens is the main contributor to WNV transmission. The results presented in this thesis show that the Cx. pipiens biotypes and their hybrids are present throughout The Netherlands, and that they can transmit WNV under favourable climatic conditions. The absence of WNV outbreaks in northern Europe can most likely be explained by low temperature which has a negative effect on mosquito abundance, vector competence, and the duration of the infectious period. When considering the outcomes of this thesis in the light of climate change, northern European countries such as The Netherlands should be prepared for future WNV transmission...|$|E

5000|$|Segregation {{avoidance}} {{occurs when}} an {{unequal crossing over}} event leads to a locus duplication containing two heterogeneous alleles creating a situation akin to permanent heterozygosity.

On the basis of indoor behavioral assays it has even been suggested that 1 -octen- 3 -ol might be a repellent to the southern <b>house</b> <b>mosquito.</b> Our approach was two-prong, i. e., to isolate 1 -octen- 3 -ol-sensitive ORs expressed in maxillary palps and antennae of southern <b>house</b> female <b>mosquito,</b> and test the hypothesis that this semiochemical is a repellent. An OR with high transcript levels in maxillary palps, CquiOR 118 b, showed remarkable selectivity towards (R) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol, whereas an OR expressed in antennae, CquiOR 114 b, showed higher preference for (S) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol than its antipode. Repellency by a surface landing and feeding assay showed that not only racemic, but enantiopure (R) - and (S) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol are repellents at 1 % dose thus suggesting the occurrence of other (S) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol-sensitive OR(s).

40|$|Current anticholinesterase {{pesticides}} {{were developed}} during World War II and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in insects and in mammals. A sequence analysis of AChEs from 73 species and a three-dimensional {{model of a}} malaria-carrying mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) AChE (AgAChE) reported here show that C 286 and R 339 of AgAChE are conserved {{at the opening of}} the active site of AChEs in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. Both residues are absent in the active site of AChEs of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse.

The four insects are <b>house</b> <b>mosquito,</b> Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, and German cockroach. The discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito AChEs rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria.

During 2003 - 2007, I carried out research on the social mating system and parental behavior of a migratory population of <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> wren (Troglodytes aedon aedon) and a resident population of southern house wren (Troglodytes aedon bonariae) breeding in nest-boxes in the U.

The addition of nest-boxes to increase territory quality of occupied territories did not stimulate polygyny in southern house wrens. Only removal of territorial males and floaters increased the polygyny rate in the southern house wren, suggesting intense competition for breeding territories. Strong competition for breeding sites could be a consequence of higher adult survival in the south leading to lack of enough territories to breed in relation to population density. Indeed, southern house wrens bred in smaller territories than <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> wrens. <b>Northern</b> and southern <b>house</b> wrens visited a caged female close to the primary and secondary boxes in similar proportions. Both were aggressive to the caged female close to the primary nest-box, but a higher proportion of southern house wren females were aggressive when the cage was installed close to the secondary box.

Indeed, southern house wren polygynous males' territories were of similar size to <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> wren territories, but monogamous southern house wren territories were smaller than <b>northern</b> <b>house</b> wren territories.
