40|$|The next {{generation}} of the wireless networks will consist of several overlapping tiers. Provision of undisrupted communication to mobile users is a challenging task. Handover delay {{is one of the}} problematic issues that users are faced in the heterogeneous networks. However, in the case of both the WiMAX and the WiFi technologies which are located at the same base station (BS), the vertical handover (VHO) delay will be less as compared with the two conventional WiMAX/WiFi heterogeneous networks with two different wireless Internet service providers (WISP). Nevertheless, protocol conversion is still adding delay and jitter for data exchange between the needed two technologies. In this paper, {{in order to reduce the}} delay in the protocol conversion, a <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>design</b> for WiWi (WiMAX and WiFi) adaptation layer is proposed. The realization of the interworking between these two standards is discussed and evaluated.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. In a {{university}} context {{it is important}} to understand and appreciate prior learning and attitudes when planning teaching and learning experiences. This paper presents a study undertaken with <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>design</b> undergraduates with particular reference to their knowledge and application of ergonomic principles in a design task. Design teams of 3 students were established and given the task of mind mapping their approach to the design of a new bicycle seat. The mind maps were analysed in relation to the general fields emerging (e. g. initial ideas, research, materials and ergonomics). Follow up interviews were held to explore issues raised in more depth. Findings indicate only an extremely basic level of understanding of ergonomics was demonstrated, which primarily focused on anthropometrics. Teachers appear to focus only at this level and students who have a deeper understanding of ergonomics are achieving this via personal interest and resources outside the classroom. Conclusions are drawn relating to teaching and learning ergonomics within undergraduate industrial design courses...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{important}} trends both {{in technology}} and in society {{in order to understand}} the new demands and challenges to the design profession. We conclude that, in order to respond to these challenges, there is a need for a new type of design research, as well as new ways of teaching design. We suggested that, in this context, “Designed Intelligence ” and “Competence-based learning ” play an important role. We state the nature of this designed intelligence and identify it as a relevant and appropriate territory to explore with the aim of contributing to the global scientific community. The project we want to present is the creation of the <b>new</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> faculty and education program at the Eindhoven University of Technology. The course started in September 2001 and is fully based on an innovative model of competence-based learning. The strategic partners are the Design Academy Eindhoven and Philips Design. Focus will be on the design of intelligent products, services and experiences, i. e. on designs in which the physical and the virtual come together. The presentation will consist of three parts: The Future of the Design Profession, the ID Eindhoven Education Model, and Research in Designed Intelligence.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has been most {{promising}} {{for the development of}} a philosophical basis for Design Education in Brazil. The first meeting of directors of Brazilian Industrial Design high schools took place in 1984 in Rio de Janeiro. In 1986 in Brasilia a team of professional designers met, with the aim of evaluating almost 25 years of industrial design education in Brazil. In 1987 the Brazilian ministry of education and culture outlined the domains and approved the content of a <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>design</b> education curriculum. In 1988 representatives from all the Brazilian design schools met in Florian 6 polis to discuss, identify and determine guidelines for teaching design and in that same year the new national design curriculum was enforced in all high level Brazilian design courses. However, analyses of the documents published following these events show that design in Brazil is conceived as an educational practice relating only to the tertiary level and a professional activity restricted to the fields of Graphic and Industrial Design. The reason why Design in Brazil is often elitist, vocational, and restrictive appears to be related to design educators not realising the full potential of the Portuguese word desenho; and therefore, not conceptualising Design as an area of human experience, skill and knowledge that reflects man's concern with the appreciation and adaptation of his surroundings in the light of his material and spiritual needs. In particular, relating to the configuration, composition, meaning, value and purpose of man-made phenomena. Consequently, Brazilian design educators are decharacterising the Portuguese language when, treating matters related to Design, they use English terms and expressions unnecessarily. Thus, this dissertation examines design language in Brazil; and the importance of an agreed language to develop design education in the country. Chapter I is concerned with the denotations given to the words design, dessin, disegno, designo, diseno, deseno, and desenho in their respective languages; and the connotations which the human ability design has acquired within certain European cultural contexts. In Chapter II texts were investigated in order to examine concepts of Design in Brazil, and how Brazilian design educators have understood, discussed and disseminated ideas using written language. Chapter III is based on interviews with Brazilian design educators, and it focuses on the spoken language used by them to express and discuss problems of education in the country. The contribution of this dissertation to Brazilian design education, can be found in Chapters IV and V, where an attempt is made to: (i) reinforce the meanings and usage of the Portuguese word desenho; (ii) create a design terminology genuinely based on Portuguese words; and (iii) build a structural model for a design language, which can be used to reconstruct and evaluate the present curriculum of Brazilian design courses. ...|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} {{industrial}} embedded systems are developed to undergo hard environmental conditions, especially high temperatures. To prevent this impact, environmental conditions (e. g. the temperature) could be monitored. Plenty of <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>designs</b> are built around SoCs, and more especially around the Zynq- 7000 introduced by Xilinx in 2011. In fact, monitoring the temperature inside the Zynq {{has become a}} challenge. While many applications focused on precision, the application proposed here instead is in an industrial context and aims at detecting a temperature excess {{as fast as possible}} to achieve the thermal protection of a logic area of the chip. Most of the digital sensors designed require a calibration to be operational. Such a process is not viable for time to market, and a solution must be found to either lighten it (e. g. by doing a simple 3 -points calibration) or simply avoiding it. Instead of measuring the temperature in an absolute way, this paper focuses on detecting if the temperature is above or below a threshold. This work exhibits the implementation of three temperature digital sensors with promising results on Zynq technology. Two of the presented sensors are based on a ring-oscillator and another uses a flip-flop as a sensing element. Results show that a temperature increase can be detected in less than 1 ms without any calibration protocol and this sensor was found to perfectly fit the targeted application...|$|R

50|$|Various organisations were {{established}} to foster New Zealand {{design in the}} aftermath of the Second World War. The earliest body to promote an appreciation of design in New Zealand was the Wellington Architectural Centre, established in 1946. In April 1948 it launched the country's first design publication, the New Zealand Design Review, which it continued to publish until 1954. An Auckland Design Guild was formed in 1949 but failed to survive to the end of that year. In Christchurch, a group of interested persons established the Design Association of New Zealand in 1960. The formation of a design practitioner body, the New Zealand Society of Industrial Artists, which was modelled on the British Society of Industrial Artists (known since 1976 as the Chartered Society of Designers), was mooted in October 1959 by a group of largely British-trained, Auckland-based designers teaching at the Elam School of Art, although it was not legally incorporated - as the New Zealand Society of Industrial Designers - until 1961. The Department of Industries and Commerce, headed by its permanent secretary Bill Sutch, began investigations into the possibility of establishing a national design promotion body, modelled on the British Council of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> (known since 1973 as the Design Council) in April 1958. This work led to the formation of the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> Council, established under the terms of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> Act 1966. Although significantly under-resourced, the council functioned from November 1967 until December 1988 when it was abolished; certain of its activities being derogated to a quality assessment body, TELARC. Finally in 1991 the remaining organisations merged to form the Designers Institute of New Zealand, promoting graphic, spatial, industrial, fashion and craft design, and the management and teaching of these disciplines. Architecture and design is taught at a wide range of tertiary institutions, including AUT, Massey, Victoria and Otago Universities, Unitec and Otago Polytechnic.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIndustrial Design {{education}} {{is going through}} a rapid evolution with more Design students making use of internet resources and tools such as crowdsourcing, 3 D printing services, and other web-based tools to validate their ideas more quickly. The popularity of online 3 D printing services such as Shapeways and Sculpteo accelerate the design process and learning. These services allow the designer to “print” virtually in any material such as plastics or metals. The impact of this new technology and other new web-based tools is significant not only in the industry but in the classroom as well. Current <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> pedagogy is still partially based on technology, materials and processes that were developed a century ago. For example, pencils and paper are still the primary idea development tool. Books and magazines used to be the primary research tool but already have been surpassed by the Internet. Computer technology has improved significantly since the appearance of the first PCs, Macs and CNC machines. With all these advances in technology, one aspect of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> education that needs to be re-visited is the pedagogy of Design Drafting in this new age of online 3 D printing services. The traditional Design pedagogy that was based on the development of different skills or competencies in separate courses or classes have not changed significantly in the last 40 years, 3 D printing technology could potentially change this situation. Some new academic papers discuss this <b>newer</b> trend in <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> schools but very few provide examples on how they implemented the new Internet-based 3 D printing services in their curriculum. <b>Industrial</b> <b>Design</b> schools need to adapt quickly to the new reality, embracing Internet resources and online tools as core skills that every designer must have.
