5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{is believed}} to have evolved from the <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> wildcat, whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa. Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having diverged from the <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> wildcat around 8,000 BC in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|The Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> Studies (often simply {{referred}} to as the BYU Jerusalem Center, BYU–Jerusalem or Mormon University), situated on Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem, is a satellite campus of Brigham Young University (BYU), the largest religious university in the United States. Owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land, and the program is open to qualifying full-time undergraduate students at either BYU, BYU-Idaho, or BYU-Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1912 Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, {{led by the}} geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> Party led by Frank Stillwell, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt {{and its neighbors}} were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the earliest}} known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a <b>near</b> <b>eastern</b> fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen {{issued its}} {{report on the}} matter. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Chris was {{the fourth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming on July 31 in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands from a tropical wave, Chris moved generally to the west-northwest, skirting the northern fringes of the Caribbean islands. Chris was a relatively short-lived storm, reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65mph (100km/h) on August 2, while positioned north of St. Martin. The storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on August 5, <b>near</b> <b>eastern</b> Cuba. Overall impact was minimal, amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path. No deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by <b>near</b> <b>eastern</b> immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
5|$|The museum {{opened on}} 10 August 1793 with an {{exhibition}} of 537paintings, {{the majority of the}} works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's abdication many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; <b>Near</b> <b>Eastern</b> Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.|$|E
