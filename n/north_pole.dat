5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind {{in the race for the}} <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
5|$|Brian takes Stewie to the mall, {{only to get}} a rude brush-off {{from the}} Santa who works there when he leaves for the night. As a result, Stewie vows to kill Santa for blowing him off and forces Brian {{to take him to}} the <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> Attempting to trick Stewie, he brings him to a Santa's Village {{amusement}} park. Soon discovering the charade, Stewie threatens to shoot Brian if he does not take him to the real <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E

5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> This may seem surprising, but the <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the <b>North</b> <b>Pole,</b> but crashed on the return.|$|E

25|$|A second {{method of}} {{determining}} the latitude of the observer measures the angle of elevation of a celestial <b>pole,</b> <b>north</b> in the northern hemisphere. Seen from zero latitude the <b>north</b> <b>pole's</b> elevation is zero; that is, it is a point on the horizon. The declination of the observer's zenith also is zero and therefore so is his latitude.|$|R
5|$|Cassini {{photographs}} {{have led}} to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's <b>north</b> <b>pole,</b> the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's <b>north</b> <b>pole</b> revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea. In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.|$|E

50|$|Oriented paleomagnetic core {{samples are}} {{collected}} in the field; mudstones, siltstones, and very fine-grained sandstones are the preferred lithologies because the magnetic grains are finer {{and more likely to}} orient with the ambient field during deposition. If the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today's field (<b>North</b> Magnetic <b>Pole</b> near the <b>North</b> Rotational <b>Pole),</b> the strata would retain a normal polarity. If the data indicate that the <b>North</b> Magnetic <b>Pole</b> were near the South Rotational Pole, the strata would exhibit reversed polarity.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott {{saw no reason to}} believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

5000|$|One {{confusion}} that arises from this definition is that, if Earth itself is {{considered as a}} magnet, the south pole of that magnet {{would be the one}} nearer the <b>north</b> magnetic <b>pole,</b> and vice versa. The <b>north</b> magnetic <b>pole</b> is so-named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its geographical location. The <b>north</b> and south <b>poles</b> of a permanent magnet are so-called because they are [...] "north-seeking" [...] and [...] "south-seeking", respectively.|$|R
5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the <b>North</b> <b>Pole.</b> Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
