40|$|Radioactive {{waste is}} {{generated}} by many different technical and scientific applications. For the past decades, different waste disposal strategies have been considered. Several questions on the waste disposal strategy remain unanswered, particularly regarding the long-term radiotoxicity of minor actinides (Am, Cm, Np), plutonium and uranium. These radionuclides mainly arise from high level nuclear waste (HLW), specific waste streams or dismantled nuclear weapons. Although many countries have opted for the direct disposal of spent fuel, from a scientific and technical point of view {{it is imperative to}} pursue alternative waste management strategies. Apart from the vitrification, especially for trivalent actinides and Pu, crystalline ceramic waste forms are considered. In contrast to glasses, crystalline waste forms, which are chemically and physically highly stable, allow the retention of radionuclides on well-defined lattice positions within the crystal structure. Besides polyphase ceramics such as SYNROC, single phase ceramics are considered as tailor made host phases to embed a specific radionuclide or a specific group. Among oxidic single phase ceramics pyrochlores are known to have a high potential for this application. This work examines ZrO 2 based pyrochlores as potential nuclear waste forms, which are known to show a high aqueous stability and a high tolerance towards radiation damage. This work contributes to (1) understand the phase stability field of pyrochlore and consequences of non-stoichiometry which leads to pyrochlores with mixed cationic sites. Mixed cationic occupancies are likely to occur in actinide-bearing pyrochlores. (2) The structural uptake of radionuclides themselves was studied. (3) The chemical stability and the effect of phase transition from pyrochlore to defect fluorite were probed. This phase transition is important, as it is the result of radiation damage in ZrO 2 based pyrochlores. ZrO 2 – Nd 2 O 3 pellets with pyrochlore and defect crystal structure were synthesised via a wet-chemical coprecipitation route to obtain highly homogeneous ceramics. Their structure-properties relationships were studied by a combination of different characterisation techniques, e. g. powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and luminescence spectroscopy. These complementary techniques were chosen to gain insight into the radionuclide uptake and order-disorder transition from a bulk to a local structural level. The transition of pyrochlore to the less ordered defect fluorite phase was examined by XRD and TEM and recognized to be a gradual transition. This transition was proven to have no significant impact on the aqueous durability under acidic conditions. In addition to their high radiation tolerance ZrO 2 based pyrochlores are therefore expected to ensure high long-term durability even during the decay of embedded radionuclides. The radionuclide uptake on well-defined lattice positions within the pyrochlore crystal structure was probed by luminescence spectroscopy (time resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy, TRLFS) of Cm and Eu doped La 2 Zr 2 O 7 pyrochlores and defect fluorite samples. TRLFS is an ideal method to unravel the lattice site by probing the local environment of the dopant. According to TRLFS results Eu and Cm adopt the A site within the pyrochlore crystal structure and regular cation lattice sites in the defect fluorite. In addition, a minor species is present in the pyrochlore which was identical to the major species observed in the defect fluorite. Vice versa, the defect fluorite contains a minor species which has adopted the pyrochlore environment. This is in good agreement with the TEM findings. Due to the different pyrochlore and defect fluorite species, TRLFS {{could be used as a}} tool to quantify radiation damage in ZrO 2 based pyrochlore nuclear waste forms. In order to more closely imitate a realistic waste form 5 mol% and 10 mol% Pu-pyrochlores were synthesised. To this end, a wet chemical synthesis route was developed. Characterisation by XRD, SEM and EDX indicates a homogeneous structural uptake of Pu- 239 into pyrochlore. Extensive dissolution studies were carried out on Nd 2 O 3 - ZrO 2 pyrochlores using static and dynamic experimental setups including variations of pH, temperature and chemical composition. Typical for all experiments is an initial incongruent dissolution with a preferential <b>Nd</b> <b>release.</b> <b>The</b> higher initial rates decreased with time until a steady state was reached oftentimes approaching a congruent dissolution of Nd and Zr. The steady state of the Zr release was reached after 10 - 20 days in experiments at 110 °C and c(H+) = 0. 1 mol/L. Differences in the Zr-O and Nd-O bonding strengths may be partly responsible for the higher initial release rate of Nd. The activation energy Ea (Zr-based pyrochlore) = 47 kJ/mol and Ea = 28 kJ/mol for the defect fluorite indicated a surface controlled dissolution mechanism. A rough estimation for a Nd 2 Zr 2 O 7 pyrochlore leads to a dissolution rate in the order of 10 - 10 gm- 2 d- 1 under repository relevant conditions, demonstrating its ability to serve as a highly durable nuclear waste form. Complementary to the macroscopic approach microscopic observations were made to gain a more detailed view into the dissolution. SEM and vertical scanning interferometry provided new insights into the dissolution kinetics at grain boundaries and the surface retreat of individual grains. These microscopic methods indicate a temporal evolution of the surface reactivity. The combination of macroscopic and microscopic dissolution studies allowed first insights into the dissolution mechanism of a ZrO 2 – Nd 2 O 3 pyrochlore series which is essential for a profound understanding of the chemical stability of a nuclear waste form...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of earthquakes near the artificial lakes at Kariba, Kremasta, and Koyna, where earthquakes of magnitude xceeding 6 have occurred, is examined. Foreshock-aftershock patterns of these earthquake sequences correspond with Mogi's type II model, whereas the normal earthquakes of these regions belong to type I. Three similar elations could be fitted {{in the time}} distribution of aftershocks of the main earthquakes. Quite contrary to normal earthquakes, foreshock b values {{are found to be}} comparable with the aftershock b values in the frequency-magnitude relations. Focal mechanisms of the largest earthquakes of these sequences have been determined and compared. Dip-slip components of the motion are such that the lakes are situated on the downthrown blocks. These regions are characterized by a volcanic past and the presence of rocks such as limestones and red boles which are easily affected by water. These findings are useful in distinguishing the reservoir-associated earthquakes from normal earth-quakes and suggest hat the artificial lakes are responsible for changing the mechanical properties of <b>the</b> strata <b>nd</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> accumulated strains...|$|R

40|$|Alginate-based biofilms were {{reticulated}} with Ca++ {{supplied by}} two sources, calcium chloride and benzoate, and using glycerol as plasticizer. The strong gelling {{power of the}} Ca++ ions hindered smooth casting procedures, so that films with low degree of reticulation were initially manufactured (1 st stage). These films were further crosslinked with an excess of Ca++ by immersion in a solution of 3 to 7 % of CaCl 2. 2 H 2 O (2 <b>nd</b> stage). <b>The</b> <b>release</b> of sorbate was evaluated considering different active agent concentrations in the film and two levels of alginate crosslinking. The mechanism involved in the diffusional process was investigated using the Power Law Model. The results indicated that potassium sorbate diffusion in alginate films has characteristics of Fickian and non-Fickian behavior. Effective diffusion coefficients obtained using the solution in series derived from Fick's Second Law are close to values obtained with the short-time solution, with effective diffusivities varying from 3 to 5 × 10 - 7 cm 2 /s. The diffusivity values decreased with the degree of reticulation and increase with benzoate concentration in the film...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} nature of the multi-component radio {{continuum}} and HI emission associated with the nearby galaxy group comprised of two dominant ellipticals, NGC 5898 and NGC 5903, and a dwarf lenticular ESO 514 -G 003. Striking new details of radio emission are unveiled from <b>the</b> 2 <b>nd</b> Data <b>Release</b> of <b>the</b> ongoing TIFR. GMRT. SKY. SURVEY (TGSS) which provides images with a resolution of 24 arcsec x 18 arcsec and a typical rms noise of 5 mJy at 150 MHz. Previous radio observations of this compact triplet of galaxies include images at higher frequencies of the radio continuum as well as HI emission, the latter showing huge HI trails originating from the vicinity of NGC 5903 where HI is in a kinematically disturbed state. The TGSS 150 MHz image has revealed a large asymmetric radio halo around NGC 5903 and also established that the dwarf SO galaxy ESO 514 -G 003 is the host to a previously known bright double radio source. The radio emission from NGC 5903 is found to have a very steep radio spectrum (α - 1. 5) and to envelope a network of radio continuum filaments bearing a spatial relationship to the HI trails. Another noteworthy aspect of this triplet of early-type galaxies highlighted by the present study is that both its radio loud members, namely NGC 5903 and ESO 514 -G 003, are also the only galaxies that are seen to be connected to an HI filament. This correlation is consistent with the premise that cold gas accretion is of prime importance for triggering powerful jet activity in the nuclei of early-type galaxies.
