5|$|In early 1396, {{following}} {{the peace treaty}} with England, the French army mobilised against another pressing threat; that of the Turks to the east {{as part of a}} new crusade. As a leader of the original party to investigate events in Hungary, it was <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> Jean de Carrouges would return with his followers in the service of his old commander, Admiral Jean de Vienne. The army crossed Central Europe, united with the Hungarians and marched south, burning the city of Vidin and massacring the inhabitants before {{following the}} course of the Danube southeast, cutting a swathe of destruction through Ottoman territory. On the 12 September, the army arrived at the city of Nicopolis but were repulsed from its walls and settled into a siege.|$|E

25|$|Given that {{conventional}} {{plate tectonics}} accounts {{for much of}} the geomorphic features of continents and oceans, it is <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> creationists would seek to develop a high speed version of the same process.

25|$|In his 2008 {{review of}} the volume, Săndulescu noted that the text omitted {{important}} details from its author's life. Given the date of completion, he describes as understandable that Cioculescu failed to mention facts about his anti-communist brother and his death in confinement, and believes it <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> the book does not include any detail about the critic's own affiliation with the anti-communist Dreptatea. However, he sees a bizarre tendency in that Amintiri skips over Cioculescu's time in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of where to hold the marriage ceremony raised the most criticism. To the Hohenzollerns, it seemed <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> the nuptials of the heir of the throne of Prussia would be held in Berlin.

25|$|Being a {{derivative}} of the morna, it is <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> the coladeira shares some characteristics with the former, as the harmonic sequence, the verse structure and a varied and syncopated melodic line. According to J. Monteiro, the true coladeira {{is the one}} that results from a morna. So, if the morna is normally played with a 60 bpm tempo, the coladeira should have a 120 bpm tempo. However, this is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|Of the New Testament, {{attempts}} at translation {{must have been}} made very early, and among the ancient versions of New Testament scripture, the Syriac in all likelihood is the earliest. It was at Antioch, the capital of Syria, that the disciples of Christ were first called Christians, and it seemed <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> the first translation of the Christian Scriptures should have been made there. The tendency of recent research, however, {{goes to show that}} Edessa, the literary capital, was more likely the place.|$|E

25|$|In historiography {{the breakup}} has been {{extensively}} discussed, though scholars highlight different points of contention, adversely interpreted dynamics of the conflict and contrasting methodologies. The most traditional judgement underlines the clash of personalities. Ramón Nocedal, son of political leader and himself raised to be a leader, considered it <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> he should have succeeded his father. His decisive leadership style and age seniority versus Carlos VII – a charismatic figure anxious not to {{be reduced to a}} decorative role by one of his subjects – did not help. In Carlism-biased versions of this theory, Nocedal is characterized by overgrown personal ambitions, in propaganda mocked as “Ramón I Pontifice Rey del Universo” or “Ramón Romea y Nocedal”.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> Gleizes and Metzinger, both {{articulate}} men, {{should come}} {{not just to}} theorize {{on the meaning of}} Cubism, but to defend the movement against attacks leveled {{in the wake of the}} 1911 public exhibitions. The two had exhibited regularly at the important salons (Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants) since around 1903 and held divers official positions within them (e.g., hanging committee members). Both were well-versed in philosophy, mathematics and poetry. While Metzinger had participated in discussions at the Bateau Lavoir (from 1907), both he and Gleizes were largely responsible for the impression made by the Cubists on the general public during both the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne of 1910 and 1911 respectively. Intellectual and moral support for their endeavors came from members of the Section d'Or (Groupe de Puteaux).|$|E
25|$|M. Renard {{advanced}} {{the view that}} Janus and not Juppiter was the original paredra or consort of Juno, {{on the grounds of}} their many common features, functions and appearance in myth or rites as is shown by their cross coupled epithets Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia: Janus shares the epithet of Juno Curitis and Juno the epithet Janus Geminus, as sororius means paired, double. Renard's theory has been rejected by G. Capdeville as not being in accord with the level of sovereign gods in Dumézil's trifunctional structure. The theology of Janus would show features typically belonging to the order of the gods of the beginning. In Capdeville's view it is only <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> a god of beginnings and a sovereign mother deity have common features, as all births can be seen as beginnings, Juno is invoked by deliverers, who by custom hold a key, symbol of Janus.|$|E

25|$|Since every {{household}} {{was almost}} entirely self-sufficient, {{there was very}} little need for trade. Goods and services were exchanged, but a household's survival did not depend on it. In the course of bringing in various resources, it was <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> a given household would reap a windfall of a particular resource, be it a large harvest of apricots, wheat, or a large bison that was brought back by the hunters, etc. When a household found itself with a plentiful supply of a particular resource, it did not necessarily mean that the surplus would be traded in the modern sense of the word, but rather, the surplus would probably be given away to others in the community who could use whatever resource they had on hand, with no thought of reciprocation or direct realized return {{on the part of the}} gifters. This is the basis of a gift economy, which has been observed in many hunter-gatherer or subsistence farmer cultures, and that was most likely the same with the Cucuteni-Trypillia society, at least during the early period of the culture.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Ottoman issue had {{again become}} acute, and, {{after the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, it seemed <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> Sultan Mehmed II was {{rallying}} his resources to subjugate Hungary. His immediate objective was Nándorfehérvár (today Belgrade). Nándorfehérvár was a major castle-fortress, and a gatekeeper of south Hungary. The fall of this stronghold would have opened a clear way to the heart of Central Europe. Hunyadi arrived at the Siege of Belgrade at the end of 1455, after settling differences with his domestic enemies. At his own expense, he restocked the supplies and arms of the fortress, leaving in it a strong garrison under the command of his brother-in-law Mihály Szilágyi and his own eldest son László Hunyadi. He proceeded to form a relief army, and assembled a fleet of two hundred ships. His main ally was the Franciscan friar, Giovanni da Capistrano, whose fiery oratory drew a large crusade made up mostly of peasants. Although relatively ill-armed (most were armed with farm equipment, such as scythes and pitchforks) they flocked to Hunyadi and his small corps of seasoned mercenaries and cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Ecgwynn's {{marriage}} to Edward the Elder {{appears to have}} been consummated before his accession to the throne (899). If Æthelstan was aged thirty when he was elected king (924), as William of Malmesbury claims he was, the year of his birth would have been 893 or 894. By this time, Edward had reached majority and one of his priorities would have been to secure the continuation of Alfred's line. No sources report what became of Ecgwynn afterwards, though two events are directly relevant. First, William writes that on King Alfred's instigation, Æthelstan was sent to be raised at the Mercian court of his aunt Æthelflæd. Second, it is known that by 901, Edward had taken to wife Ælfflæd, a daughter of ealdorman Æthelhelm. The reason for this decision is unclear. It may simply have been that Ecgwynn was no longer alive in 899 and that it was therefore only <b>natural</b> <b>that</b> Edward looked for a fresh bride. It is also possible that Edward's first marriage was thought to lack the political import that was needed to buttress his position as king of the English. Alfred may have been responsible for arranging the first marriage and so his death in 899 would have afforded Edward and his counsellors room to follow a different course.|$|E
