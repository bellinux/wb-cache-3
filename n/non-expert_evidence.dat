40|$|The {{problem with}} expert {{evidence}} {{is not the}} inappropriateness of the Daubert approach. The narrow focus on Daubert is misplaced. The real problem is with the more deeply entrenched view that expert evidence should be excluded under circumstances in which analogous <b>non-expert</b> <b>evidence</b> would be admitted. Daubert embodies the distinction between expert and <b>non-expert</b> <b>evidence,</b> but it is that very distinction, and not just Daubert, that is the problem. Daubert has indeed transformed modern evidence law, but perhaps it has awakened us {{to the need for}} a more profound transformation, one in which the very foundations of treating expert testimony differently are undercut. This is a larger claim than that Daubert itself is a problem, and it is this larger claim we seek to advance here...|$|E
40|$|Using law and {{evidence}} to achieve fair and accurate decisions in numerous legal cases requires a complex multiagent system. This paper discusses a framework based on many-valued, predicate, default logic that successfully captures legal knowledge, integrates and evaluates expert and <b>non-expert</b> <b>evidence,</b> coordinates agents working on different legal problems, and evolves the knowledge model over time. The graphical syntax and the semantics of this framework allow the automation of key tasks, {{and the emergence}} of dynamic structures for integrating human and non-human agents. The logical basis of the framework ensures its applicability to knowledge and problem domains of similar complexity to law...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{research}} in linguistics and artificial intelligence, legal research has not used advances in logical theory very effectively. This article uses default logic {{to develop a}} paradigm for analyzing all aspects of legal reasoning, including factfinding. The article provides a formal model that integrates legal rules and policies with the evaluation of both expert and <b>non-expert</b> <b>evidence</b> – whether the reasoning occurs in courts or administrative agencies, and whether in domestic, foreign, or international legal systems. This paradigm can standardize the representation of legal reasoning, guide empirical {{research in}}to the dynamics of such reasoning, and put the representations and research results to immediate use through artificial intelligence software. This new model therefore {{has the potential to}} transform legal practice and legal education, as well as legal theory...|$|E
40|$|Most {{perceived}} {{parameters of}} sound (e. g. pitch, duration, timbre) {{can also be}} imagined {{in the absence of}} sound. These parameters are imagined more veridically by expert musicians than <b>non-experts.</b> <b>Evidence</b> for whether loudness is imagined, however, is conflicting. In music, the question of whether loudness is imagined is particularly relevant due to its role as a principal parameter of performance expression. This study addressed the hypothesis that the veridicality of imagined loudness improves with increasing musical expertise. Experts, novices and non-musicians imagined short passages of well-known classical music under two counterbalanced conditions: 1) while adjusting a slider to indicate imagined loudness of the music and 2) while tapping out the rhythm to indicate imagined timing. Subtests assessed music listening abilities and working memory span to determine whether these factors, also hypothesised to improve with increasing musical expertise, could account for imagery task performance. Similarity between each participant’s imagined and listening loudness profiles and reference recording intensity profiles was assessed using time series analysis and dynamic time warping. The results suggest a widespread ability to imagine the loudness of familiar music. The veridicality of imagined loudness tended to be greatest for the expert musicians, supporting the predicted relationship between musica...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Prometheus methodology for developing intelligent agent systems. The methodology {{has been developed}} {{over the last several}} years in collaboration with Agent Oriented Software. Our goal was to develop a design process with associated deliverables which can be taught to industry practitioners and undergraduate students who do not have a background in agents and which they can use to develop intelligent agent systems. Our claim is that Prometheus is developed in sufficient detail to be used by a <b>non-expert.</b> Our <b>evidence</b> is, at this stage, still anecdotal; however, the indications are that Prometheus is usable by non-experts and that they find it usefu...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the reliability of}} <b>non-expert</b> voice identification <b>evidence.</b> While much {{attention has been paid}} to the frailties of eyewitness evidence, little attention has been given to the frailties of ‘earwitness’ evidence, even though it has been tendered in several wrongful conviction cases. The author reviews the results of the empirical literature that has examined the reliability of earwitness evidence. The author also analyzes the principal factors used by Canadian criminal courts to assess earwitness reliability in light of the empirical study of those factors. The general conclusions are that earwitness evidence can often be quite unreliable and that the courts have not always properly assessed its reliability...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{has been}} recognized as a prevalent issue leading to multiple negative consequences for victims and perpetrators. Efforts to reduce its occurrence and increase awareness are important. The majority of sexual harassment prevention programs evaluated have used knowledge-enhancing techniques in order to combat sexual harassment; however, results have not yielded a decrease in sexual harassment supportive attitudes. This study {{examined the effects of}} a sexual harassment training program that incorporated aspects of the elaboration likelihood model (Petty 2 ̆ 6 Cacioppo, 1986) via manipulation of argument strength and source expertise. A pretest established participants 2 ̆ 7 sexual harassment policy knowledge and attitudes. One hundred and fifty four participants were randomly assigned to view one of four training videos where the strength of the arguments (weak/strong) and source expertise (non-expert/expert) were manipulated. Participants then completed a posttest of sexual harassment policy knowledge and attitudes. Participants also listed arguments against sexual harassment recalled from the training video and indicated their level of motivation to attend to the video, ability to understand the information presented in the video, and their favorable thoughts regarding the video 2 ̆ 7 s content. Results suggest that all participants evidenced an increase in knowledge of university sexual harassment policies from pretest to posttest but changes in attitude were not significant. Participants who viewed weak arguments from a <b>non-expert</b> source <b>evidenced</b> greater recall of arguments presented in training videos compared to all other training videos. Women evidenced less supportive attitudes towards sexual harassment and more motivation to attend to and process the information presented in the videos compared to men. This study provided data on the applicability of the elaboration likelihood model to sexual harassment training programs, supporting previous research findings that training can enhance sexual harassment knowledge and immediate recall of information learned. The sexual harassment training program implemented in this study successfully enhanced sexual harassment policy knowledge in men and women, using experts and non-expert sources, conveying general and detailed information on the policies. However, the training program was not successful at changing participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards sexual harassment. Interpretations and implications of the results, as well as future directions and limitations, are discussed...|$|R
