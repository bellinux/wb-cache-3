The underlying mechanism for negative control of the <b>Notch</b> 1 <b>gene</b> in human cells, as well as in a mouse model of EGFR-dependent skin carcinogenesis, involves transcriptional suppression of p 53 by the EGFR effector c-Jun.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Notch {{signaling}} pathway is constitutively activated in human cutaneous melanoma to promote growth and aggressive metastatic potential of primary melanoma cells. Therefore, genetic variants in <b>Notch</b> pathway <b>genes</b> may affect the prognosis of cutaneous melanoma patients. METHODS: We identified 6, 256 SNPs in 48 <b>Notch</b> <b>genes</b> in 858 cutaneous melanoma patients included in a previously published cutaneous melanoma genome-wide association study dataset. Multivariate and stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression and false-positive report probability corrections were performed to evaluate associations between putative functional SNPs and cutaneous melanoma disease-specific survival. Receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed, and area under the curve {{was used to assess}} the classification performance of the model. RESULTS: Four putative functional SNPs of <b>Notch</b> pathway <b>genes</b> had independent and joint predictive roles in survival of cutaneous melanoma patients. The most significant variant was NCOR 2 rs 2342924 T>C (adjusted HR, 2. 71; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 73 - 4. 23; Ptrend = 9. 62 × 10 (- 7)), followed by NCSTN rs 1124379 G>A, NCOR 2 rs 10846684 G>A, and MAML 2 rs 7953425 G>A (Ptrend = 0. 005, 0. 005, and 0. 013, respectively). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that area under the curve was significantly increased after adding the combined unfavorable genotype score to the model containing the known clinicopathologic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SNPs in <b>Notch</b> pathway <b>genes</b> may be predictors of cutaneous melanoma disease-specific survival.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comWe have conducted an evolutionary analysis of <b>Notch</b> <b>genes</b> of the vertebrates Danio rerio and Mus musculus to examine the expansion and diversification of the Notch family during vertebrate evolution. The existence of multiple <b>Notch</b> <b>genes</b> in vertebrate genomes suggests that the increase in Notch signaling pathways may be necessary for the additional complexity observed in the vertebrate body plan. However, orthology relationships within the vertebrate Notch family indicate that biological functions are not fixed within orthologous groups. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the vertebrate Notch family suggests that the zebrafish notch 1 a and 1 b genes resulted from a duplication occurring {{around the time of the}} teleost/mammalian divergence. There is also evidence that the mouse <b>Notch</b> 4 <b>gene</b> is the result of a rapid divergence from a <b>Notch</b> 3 -like <b>gene.</b> Investigation of the ankyrin repeat region sequences showed there to be little evidence for gene conversion events between repeat units. However, relationships between repeats 2 – 5 suggest that these repeats are the result of a tandem duplication of a dual repeat unit. Selective pressure on maintenance of ankyrin repeat sequences indicated by relationships between the repeats suggests that specific repeats are responsible for particular biological activities, a finding consistent with mutational studies of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene glp- 1. Sequence similarities between the ankyrin repeats and the region immediately C-terminal of the repeats further suggests that this region may be involved in the modulation of ankyrin repeat function.

The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell signaling system present in most multicellular organisms, as it controls cell fate specification by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and survival. Regulation of the Notch signaling pathway can be achieved at multiple levels. Notch proteins are involved in lineage fate decisions {{in a variety of}} tissues in various species. Notch is essential for T lineage cell differentiation including T versus B and αβ versus γδ lineage specification.

40|$|The <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> is {{a member}} of one of the sets of genes that control the {{developmental}} pathways that specify cell fate decisions in Drosophila melanogaster. The goal of this research was to use a genetic approach to identify and characterize a gene that functions with Notch in a cell fate pathway. A candidate was found in a new mutation that causes phenotypes similar to Notch and that interacts phenotypically with Notch mutations. This mutation was identified as a mutation of the deltex gene. The deltex gene was mapped to the salivary chromosome band region 6 AB. Mutant phenotypes in the wings, legs, eyes, ocelli, and bristles were demonstrated. The mutant phenotypes of deltex are consistent with the hypothesis that deltex functions in a cell fate pathway. A comparison of deltex mutant phenotypes with Notch mutant phenotypes showed that the phenotypes are very similar. Synergistic phenotypic interactions between mutations of deltex and mutations of Notch showed that deltex and Notch function together in the wings, legs, eyes, ocelli, and bristles.

40|$|Notch is a transmembrane {{receptor}} {{that determines}} cell fates and pattern formation in all animal species. After specific ligand binding, the intracellular part of Notch is cleaved off and translocates to the nucleus, where it targets the DNA binding protein RBP-J. In {{the absence of}} Notch, RBP-J represses <b>Notch</b> target <b>genes</b> by recruiting a corepressor complex. We and others have previously identified SHARP as one component of this complex. Here, we show that the corepressor ETO {{as well as the}} leukemogenic fusion protein AML 1 /ETO directly interacts with SHARP, that ETO is part of the endogenous RBP-J-containing corepressor complex, and that ETO is found at <b>Notch</b> target <b>gene</b> promoters. In functional assays, corepressor ETO, but not AML 1 /ETO, augments SHARP-mediated repression in an histone deacetylase-dependent manner. Furthermore, either the knockdown of ETO or the overexpression of AML 1 /ETO activates <b>Notch</b> target <b>genes.</b> Therefore, we propose that AML 1 /ETO can disturb the normal, repressive function of ETO at <b>Notch</b> target <b>genes.</b> This activating (or derepressing) effect of AML 1 /ETO may contribute to its oncogenic potential in myeloid leukemia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNotch encodes a {{transmembrane protein}} that {{functions}} in intercellular signaling. Although {{there is one}} <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> in Drosophila, vertebrates have three or more with overlapping patterns of embryonic expression. We cloned the entire 7575 -bp coding region of an amphioxus <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> (AmphiNotch), encoding 2524 amino acids, and obtained the exon/intron organization from a genomic cosmid clone. Southern blot and PCR data indicate that AmphiNotch is the only <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> in amphioxus. AmphiNotch, like Drosophila Notch and vertebrate Notch 1 and Notch 2, has 36 EGF repeats, 3 Notch/lin- 12 repeats, a transmembrane region, and 6 ankyrin repeats. Phylogenetic analysis places it {{at the base of}} all the vertebrate genes, suggesting it is similar to the ancestral gene from which the vertebrate Notch family genes evolved. AmphiNotch is expressed in all three embryonic germ layers in spatiotemporal patterns strikingly similar to those of all the vertebrate homologs combined. In the developing nerve cord, AmphiNotch is first expressed in the posteriormost part of the neural plate, then it becomes more broadly expressed and later is localized dorsally in the anteriormost part of the nerve cord corresponding to the diencephalon. In late embryos and larvae, AmphiNotch is also expressed in parts of the pharyngeal endoderm, in the anterior gut diverticulum, and, like AmphiPax 2 / 5 / 8, in the rudiment of Hatschek's kidney. A comparison with Notch 1 and Pax 5 and Pax 8 expression in the embryonic mouse kidney helps support homology of the amphioxus and vertebrate kidneys. AmphiNotch is also an early marker for presumptive mesoderm, transcripts first being detectable at the gastrula stage in a ring of mesendoderm just inside the blastopore and subsequently in the posterior mesoderm, notochord, and somites. As in sea urchins and vertebrates, these domains of AmphiNotch expression overlap with those of several Wnt genes and brachyury.

40|$|The {{function}} of the <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> is required in cell interactions defining alternative cell fates in several developmental processes. The <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> encodes a transmembrane protein with 36 epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like repeats in its extracellular domain. This protein functions as a receptor that interacts with other transmembrane proteins, such as Serrate and Delta, which also have EGF repeats in their extracellular domain. The Abruptex mutations of the Notch locus are associated with amino acid substitutions in the EGF repeats 24 - 29 of the Notch protein. We have studied, in genetic combinations, the modifications of Notch function caused by Abruptex mutations. These mutations lead to phenotypes which are opposite to those caused by Notch deletions. The Abruptex phenotypes are modified {{by the presence of}} mutations in other loci, in particular in the genes Serrate and Delta as well as Hairless, and groucho. The results suggest that all Abruptex mutations cause stronger than normal Notch activation by the Delta protein. Some Abruptex alleles also display an insufficiency of N function. Abruptex alleles which produce stronger enhancement of Notch activation also display stronger Notch insufficiency. This insufficiency could be due to reduced ability of Abruptex proteins to interact with Notch ligands and/or to form functional Notch dimers. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In a British linkage study, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 <b>gene</b> polymorphisms were highly associated with schizophrenia.

We conducted a case-control study with Japanese subjects to explore an association between the triplet repeat polymorphism in the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 <b>gene</b> and schizophrenia, including subtypes of schizophrenia, longitudinal disease course characteristics, and a positive family history for psychoses. Methods We examined the (CTG) n repeat polymorphism in the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 <b>gene</b> among 100 healthy Japanese individuals and 102 patients with schizophrenia (22 paranoid, 38 disorganized, 29 residual, 64 episodic, 31 continuous, 42 with prominent negative symptoms, and 46 with positive family histories) using a polymerase chain reaction-based, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Results Five different alleles consisting of 6, 9, 10, 11, and 13 repeats of CTG (Leu) in patients with schizophrenia, and 4 alleles consisting of 6, 9, 10, and 11 repeats in controls were found. No significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies of repeat numbers were found between controls and patients.

Gain of Notch 1 function results in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a number of mouse experimental models, and activating Notch 1 mutations deregulate Notch 1 signaling in the majority of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Notch 2, another member of the <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> family, is preferentially expressed in mature B cells and is essential for marginal zone B-cell generation. Here, we report that 5 of 63 (~ 8 %) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, a subtype of mature B-cell lymphomas, have Notch 2 mutations. These mutations lead to partial or complete deletion of the proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich (PEST) domain, or a single amino acid substitution at the C-terminus of Notch 2 protein. Furthermore, high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that some diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases also have increased copies of the mutated Notch 2 allele. In the Notch activation-sensitive luciferase reporter assay in vitro, mutant Notch 2 receptors show increased activity compared with wild-type Notch 2.

Notch 1, 2, and 3 genes show distinct cell-type specific expression patterns.

The data show that Notch expression is downregulated in dental epithelial cells juxtaposed to mesenchyme, indicating that dental epithelium needs a mesenchyme-derived signal {{in order to maintain the}} downregulation of Notch. Finally, Notch expression in dental mesenchyme is upregulated in a region surrounding beads soaked in retinoic acid (50 - 100 micrograms/ml) but not in fibroblast growth factor- 2 (100 - 250 micrograms/ml).

This variation is distributed asymmetrically across the range of possible alleles, with a peak in each population at opa 31 (typically encoding Q₁₃HQ₁₇) and/or opa 32 (typically encoding Q₁₃HQ₁₈) and a tendency towards a large tail of longer alleles and few shorter alleles. Variation in this pattern between populations may {{be a result of}} certain tracts being less harmful in certain backgrounds, or it {{may be due to the}} ancestry of these populations. This variation has real effects, such that lines bearing alleles longer or shorter than the common 31 - and 32 -codon alleles exhibit abnormal phenotypes, gene expression disruption, and decreased viability, effects that persist even when the <b>Notch</b> <b>gene</b> is outcrossed or recombined into other backgrounds. I also describe lines bearing CRISPR-Cas 9 -edited opa repeats and highlight a potential interaction between Notch and the transcriptional activator Dorsal. Dorsal also exhibits variation in the length of its polyglutamine tract, and short tracts at Dorsal most frequently appear alongside short tracts at Notch, while long tracts of each also frequently co-occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of both Notch 3 and pre-T-cell-receptor (pre-TCR) invariant chain {{appears to be}} a common feature of all T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). <b>Notch</b> <b>genes,</b> and other genes that are dysregulated in some T-ALL subgroups, encode factors that {{play a crucial role in}} both T-cell development and leukemogenesis. A complex network of signals, involving Notchs, pre-TCR, nuclear factor kappaB and E 2 A, appears to be responsible for the leukemogenesis process. Thus, T-ALL is a paradigm for developmental pathways that underlie the pathogenesis of this disease...|$|R
50|$|In 1914, John S. Dexter {{noticed the}} {{appearance}} of a notch in the wings of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The alleles of the gene were identified in 1917 by Thomas Hunt Morgan. Its molecular analysis and sequencing was independently undertaken in the 1980s by Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas and Michael W. Young. Alleles of the two C. elegans <b>Notch</b> <b>genes</b> were identified based on developmental phenotypes: lin-12 and glp-1. The cloning and partial sequence of lin-12 was reported {{at the same time as}} Drosophila Notch by Iva Greenwald.|$|R
40|$|Background. The NOTCH pathway {{is known}} to be {{important}} in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease, possibly through regulators of osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK), and its ligand (RANKL) system. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to search for possible associations between <b>NOTCH</b> 1 <b>gene</b> mutations and circulating levels of OPG and soluble RANKL (sRANKL) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Methods. The study was performed on 61 patients with AS including 31 with bicuspid and 30 with tricuspid aortic valves. We applied a strategy of targeted mutation screening for 10 out of 34 exons of the <b>NOTCH</b> 1 <b>gene</b> by direct sequencing. Serum OPG and sRANKL levels were assessed. Results. In total, 6 genetic variants of the <b>NOTCH</b> 1 <b>gene</b> including two new mutations were identified in the study group. In an age- and arterial hypertension-adjusted multivariable regression analysis, the serum OPG levels and the OPG/sRANKL ratio were correlated with NOTCH 1 missense variants. All studied missense variants in <b>NOTCH</b> 1 <b>gene</b> were found in Ca(2 +) -binding EGF motif of the NOTCH extracellular domain bound to Delta-like 4. Conclusion. Our results suggest that the OPG/RANKL/RANK system might be directly influenced by genetic variants of NOTCH 1 in aortic valve calcification...|$|R
