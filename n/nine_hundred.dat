Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal.

5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of <b>Nine</b> <b>Hundred</b> was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E

25|$|The federal government's goal of commercializing {{the bison}} {{throughout}} Canada undermined {{the need to}} provide inexpensive bison meat to the local population in northern Canada. With new agreements with meatpackers in the south, combined with their prior commitment to the Hudson's Bay Company and Indian Affairs, over <b>nine</b> <b>hundred</b> bison were slaughtered. Through the agreement, the packing companies received top quality bison meat for low prices, while northern Canada got tough meat that was sold at higher prices. CWS biologists feared that there was no scientific legitimacy to the slaughtering of the <b>nine</b> <b>hundred</b> bison, many which did not have tuberculosis. In the winter of 1957- 1958, the testing and slaughtering program of the bison was established. The conservation and commodification of bison are fundamentally contradictory goals.|$|E
