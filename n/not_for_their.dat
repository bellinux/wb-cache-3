Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad (sira) and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the jinn are spoken in the Quran <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce {{during his}} {{long years of}} writing Finnegans Wake. Were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's {{constant}} financial support), {{there is a good}} possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France.|$|E
5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E

5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E

25|$|As chariot warfare became {{eclipsed by}} mounted cavalry and {{infantry}} units with effective crossbowmen in the Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{the participation of}} the shi in battle dwindled as rulers sought men with actual military training, not just aristocratic background. This was also a period where philosophical schools flourished in China, while intellectual pursuits became highly valued amongst statesmen. Thus, the shi eventually became renowned <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> warrior's skills, but for their scholarship, abilities in administration, and sound ethics and morality supported by competing philosophical schools.|$|E

The Thracians in classical times were broken up into a large number of groups and tribes, though a number of powerful Thracian states were organized, such as the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace and the Dacian kingdom of Burebista.

25|$|The royal couple's murder {{upset and}} shocked most of Europe, but was met enthusiastically at home. Russia {{immediately}} recognized the National Assembly's decision declaring Peter the next King of Serbia and expressed satisfaction that the inter-dynastic intrigues which had plagued {{the country since}} the early 19th century {{had been brought to}} an end. Austria-Hungary declared its neutrality on the matter, but privately, policymakers in Vienna expressed hope that Peter's accession would have a placating effect. The United Kingdom demanded that the chief conspirators be severely punished, and when the Royal Serbian Government neglected to carry out this request, the British severed all diplomatic ties. Several other European nations followed in the United Kingdom's footsteps and severed ties as well. Peter lacked the power or authority to punish the conspirators. He also felt a deep sense of obligation towards them, acknowledging that he {{would not have been able}} to assume the throne were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> actions.|$|E
25|$|Not every suicide {{case was}} successful. Some mothers who had drowned their {{children}} were unable to drown themselves thereafter. In other cases, doses of poison proved to be lethal for children, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mothers. There were also cases where children survived attempted drownings. After a failed suicide, some killed themselves by others methods. A mother and her repeatedly raped daughter, for instance, died by hanging themselves in an attic, after repeatedly failing to drown themselves in the Peene river. Another mother who had poisoned and buried three of her four children before, tried to hang herself on an oak three times, only to be prevented to do so each time by Soviet soldiers. There are further records of Soviet soldiers preventing suicides by retrieving people from the river and nursing cut wrists. In another case, a grandfather forcibly took away a razor blade from a mother {{who was about to}} kill her children and herself after being raped by Soviet soldiers and hearing of the death of her husband. After Soviet soldiers had raped a girl to death and shot her father, an aunt cut her daughter's and son's wrists as well as her own. The other women of the family committed suicide, only one aunt was able to save the grandmother. One family survived, because the 15-year-old son persuaded his mother, who had become a rape victim, to abort her induced drowning, when she was already being dragged by the Tollense river.|$|E

The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal [...] "a much-needed charge". Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica [...] "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band [...] "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".|$|E

[...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of D minor. It has the sequence of B–C–Dm as its chord progression and Kesha's vocals in the song span from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Musically, the song has been compared to Lady Gaga's debut single, [...] "Just Dance", for their similar composition and lyrical context and to Fergie for their similar rap style.|$|E
