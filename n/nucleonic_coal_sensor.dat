40|$|AbstractExplosion {{caused by}} gas {{is one of}} the major coal mine accident, and {{real-time}} detection of the coal mine gas is becoming more and more important. In this paper we introduce a method based on near infrared spectrum <b>coal</b> mine gas <b>sensor</b> systems aiming at the errors caused by background-interference in detection on the concentration of methane gas in the past. We choose equal-absorption method in the experiment to eliminate the inaccuracy caused by spectrum of other gas absorbed at the same time. Also, we make use of a absorption cell to eliminate inaccuracy caused by different absorption parameters and interference caused by background.

40|$|Severe natural {{conditions}} and complex terrain {{make it difficult}} to apply precise localization in underground mines. In this paper, an anchor-free localization method for mobile targets is proposed based on non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (Multi-dimensional Scaling: MDS) and rank sequence. Firstly, a <b>coal</b> mine wireless <b>sensor</b> network is constructed in underground mines based on the ZigBee technology. Then a non-metric MDS algorithm is imported to estimate the reference nodes’ location. Finally, an improved sequence-based localization algorithm is presented to complete precise localization for mobile targets. The proposed method is tested through simulations with 100 nodes, outdoor experiments with 15 ZigBee physical nodes, and the experiments in the mine gas explosion laboratory with 12 ZigBee nodes. Experimental results show that our method has better localization accuracy and is more robust in underground mines...|$|R
40|$|Fatal {{accidents}} {{associated with}} underground coal mines require {{the implementation of}} high-level gas monitoring and miner’s localization approaches to promote underground safety and health. This study introduces a real-time monitoring, event-reporting and early-warning platform, based on cluster analysis for outlier detection, spatiotemporal statistical analysis, and an RSS range-based weighted centroid localization algorithm for improving safety management and preventing accidents in underground coal mines. The proposed platform seamlessly integrates monitoring, analyzing, and localization approaches using the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, a real-time operational database, application gateways, and application program interfaces. The prototype has been validated and verified at the operating underground Hassan Kishore <b>coal</b> mine. <b>Sensors</b> for air quality parameters including temperature, humidity, CH 4, CO 2, and CO demonstrated an excellent performance, with regression constants always greater than 0. 97 for each parameter when compared to their commercial equivalent. This framework enables real-time monitoring, identification of abnormal events (> 90 %), and verification of a miner’s localization (with < 1. 8 m of error) in the harsh environment of underground mines. The main contribution {{of this study is}} the development of an open source, customizable, and cost-effective platform for effectively promoting underground coal mine safety. This system is helpful for solving the problems of accessibility, serviceability, interoperability, and flexibility associated with safety in coal mines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{main purpose}} was to provide an {{implementable}} design scenario for underground coal mines using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main reason being that given the intricacies in the physical structure of a coal mine, only low power WSN nodes can produce accurate surveillance and accident detection data. The work mainly concentrated on designing and simulating various alternate scenarios for a typical mine and comparing them based on the obtained results {{to arrive at a}} final design. In the Era of embedded technology, the Zigbee protocols are used in more and more applications. Because of the rapid development of sensors, microcontrollers, and network technology, a reliable technological condition has been provided for our automatic real-time monitoring of coal mine. The underground system collects temperature, humidity and methane values of <b>coal</b> mine through <b>sensor</b> nodes in the mine; it also collects the number of personnel inside the mine {{with the help of an}} IR sensor, and then transmits the data to information processing terminal based on ARM...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} Capsule Pipeline Research Center {{of the last}} eight years (1991 - 99) has been focused on the coal log {{pipeline}} (CLP) technology. Year 8 saw the construction of a testbed (pilot plant) to test both CLP and other hydraulic capsule pipeline applications. Built with equipment, materials and services valued at over $ 400, 000 donated by nineteen companies, the plant will ready the CLP technology for commercial use in two years. During year 8, a rotary press was designed for compacting coal and biomass fuel, a <b>coal</b> log <b>sensor</b> was invented, and the U. S. Department of Energy sponsored a project which will develop a new biomass fuel for coal-fed power plants, using the compaction technology developed from coal logs research. In addition, significant advancements were made in the study of pneumatic capsule pipeline powered by linear induction motors including the construction of a laboratory test facility. Also, during year 8, the Center hosted an international symposium and short course on underground transportation of freight by capsule pipelines. National and international experts on pipeline freight transportation attended this symposium and presented papers here. Over the last eight years, the Center has greatly advanced various technologies related to capsule pipelines, readying them for commercial use. Future plans revolve around testing the CLP technology in the pilot plant in order to ready it for commercial use. The Center will also develop a new biofuel for use by power plants, and engage in further research in underground shipment of freight by pneumatic capsule pipelines.

40|$|A novel {{electrostatic}} {{sensor array}} {{was designed to}} measure particle concentration downstream of a swirl burner. The fundamental mechanism and the primary constituent elements of the sensor array were described. The root-mean-square magnitude of the measured electrostatic voltage was determined {{as an indication of}} the particle concentration. The accuracy of the electrostatic sensor array was calibrated by the optical fluctuation method. Local particle concentrations at different cross-sections of the measuring chamber were measured to investigate the diffusion characteristic of the pulverized <b>coal</b> particles. Electrostatic <b>sensor</b> array showed its ability in the field measurement in this work. The measurements indicated that the velocity of the inner secondary air had a significant effect on the diffusion of the pulverized coal particles. The particles concentrated {{in the center of the}} cross-section after leaving the burner. With the development of the gas–solid two-phase flow, the particles distributed like a ring shape. The radius of the particle ring increased with the increase of the velocity of the inner secondary air. But the effect of the velocity of outer secondary air on the radius of the particle ring is very slight. The maximum radius occurred when the velocity of inner secondary air was 21 m/s, which was favorable for stable combustion...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to demonstrate {{the use of an}} Integrated Combustion Optimization System to achieve NO{sub X} emission levels in the range of 0. 15 to 0. 22 lb/MMBtu while simultaneously enabling increased power output. The project plan consisted of the integration of low-NO{sub X} burners and advanced overfire air technology with various process measurement and control devices on the Holcomb Station Unit 1 boiler. The plan included the use of sophisticated neural networks or other artificial intelligence technologies and complex software to optimize several operating parameters, including NO{sub X} emissions, boiler efficiency, and CO emissions. The program was set up in three phases. In Phase I, the boiler was equipped with sensors {{that can be used to}} monitor furnace conditions and coal flow to permit improvements in boiler operation. In Phase II, the boiler was equipped with burner modifications designed to reduce NO{sub X} emissions and automated coal flow dampers to permit on-line fuel balancing. In Phase III, the boiler was to be equipped with an overfire air system to permit deep reductions in NO{sub X} emissions. Integration of the overfire air system with the improvements made in Phases I and II would permit optimization of boiler performance, output, and emissions. This report summarizes the overall results from Phases I and II of the project. A significant amount of data was collected from the combustion <b>sensors,</b> <b>coal</b> flow monitoring equipment, and other existing boiler instrumentation to monitor performance of the burner modifications and the coal flow balancing equipment...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aid of}} a DOE grant (No. DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41050), Stolar Research Corporation (Stolar) {{developed}} the Horizon Sensor (HS) to distinguish between the different layers of a coal seam. Mounted on mining machine cutter drums, HS units can detect or sense the horizon between the coal seam and the roof and floor rock, providing the opportunity to accurately mine the section of the seam most desired. HS also enables accurate cutting of minimum height if that is the operator's objective. Often when cutting is done out-of-seam, the head-positioning function facilitates a fixed mining height to minimize dilution. With this technology, miners can still be at a remote location, yet cut only the clean coal, resulting in a much more efficient overall process. The objectives of this project were to demonstrate the feasibility of horizon sensing on mining machines and demonstrate that Horizon Sensing can allow coal to be cut cleaner and more efficiently. Stolar's primary goal was to develop the Horizon Sensor (HS) into an enabling technology for full or partial automation or ''agile mining''. This technical innovation (R&D 100 Award Winner) is quickly demonstrating improvements in productivity and miner safety at several prominent coal mines in the United States. In addition, the HS system can enable the cutting of cleaner coal. Stolar has driven the HS program on the philosophy that cutting cleaner coal means burning cleaner <b>coal.</b> The <b>sensor,</b> located inches from the cutting bits, is based upon the physics principles of a Resonant Microstrip Patch Antenna (RMPA). When it is in proximity of the rock-coal interface, the RMPA impedance varies depending on the thickness of uncut coal. The impedance is measured by the computer-controlled electronics and then sent by radio waves to the mining machine. The worker at the machine can read the data via a Graphical User Interface, displaying a color-coded image of the coal being cut, and direct the machine appropriately. The Horizon Sensor program began development in 1998 and experienced three major design phases. The final version, termed HS- 3, was commissioned in 2000 {{with the assistance of the}} DOE-Mining Industry of the Future program, commercialized in 2002, and has been used 14 times in 12 different mines within the United States. The Horizon Sensor has applications in both underground and surface mining operations. This technology is primarily used in the coal industry, but is also used to mine trona and potash. All horizon sensor components have Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) (United States) and IEC (International) certification. Horizon Sensing saves energy by maximizing cutting efficiency, cutting only desired material. This desired material is cleaner fuel, therefore reducing pollutants to the atmosphere when burned and burning more efficiently. Extracting only desired material increases productivity by reducing or eliminating the cleaning step after extraction. Additionally, this technology allows for deeper mining, resulting in more material gained from one location. The remote sensing tool allows workers to operate the machinery away from the hazards of cutting coal, including noise, breathing dust and gases, and coal and rock splintering and outbursts. The HS program has primarily revolved around the development of the technology. However, the end goal of the program has always been the commercialization of the technology and only within the last 2 years of the program has this goal been realized. Real-time horizon sensing on mining machines is becoming an industry tool. Detailed monitoring of system function, user experience, and mining benefits is ongoing...|$|R
