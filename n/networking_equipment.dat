25|$|In 2000, the FBI {{began the}} Trilogy project to upgrade its {{outdated}} information technology (IT) infrastructure. This project, originally {{scheduled to take}} three years and cost around $380 million, ended up over budget and behind schedule. Efforts to deploy modern computers and <b>networking</b> <b>equipment</b> were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were not. Virtual Case File, or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management. In January 2005, {{more than two years}} after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI officially abandoned the project. At least $100 million (and much more by some estimates) was spent on the project, which never became operational. The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade-old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts consider woefully inadequate. In March 2005, the FBI announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project, code-named Sentinel, which they expected to complete by 2009.|$|E

2500|$|On December 1, 2008, Multiven {{filed an}} {{antitrust}} lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. {{in an effort}} to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco <b>networking</b> <b>equipment.</b> In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Alfred-Adekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in an anti-trust hearing. Although he was released after 28 days on bail, the case has stretched for a year, because the U.S. Attorney's office was unable to present the evidence required for the extradition. The antitrust lawsuit has been settled 2 months after Alfred-Adekeye's arrest. In May 2011, the US extradition request has been denied. Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ronald McKinnon, who oversaw the extradition hearing, commented on the arrest saying [...] "It is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law". He also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because Alfred-Adekeye [...] "dared to take on a multinational giant." [...] Judge McKinnon has also condemned the US prosecutor for hiding the fact that Alfred-Adekeye was in legal proceedings against Cisco Systems, for stating that Alfred-Adekeye had left the USA in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against Alfred-Adekeye when he was taken into custody. He described the information provided by Cisco and the US prosecutor as [...] "full of innuendo, half-truths and falsehoods," [...] adding that [...] "This speaks volumes for Cisco's duplicity" [...] and accused them of [...] "unmitigated gall" [...] in using such a heavy-handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure Alfred-Adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{have emerged}} as one of the new hot topics in {{wireless}} communications. They consist of a number of static wireless routers which form an access network for end users to IP-based services. Unlike traditional WLAN deployments, wireless mesh networks provide multihop routing, facilitating an easy and cost-effective deployment. In this paper, we focus in the provision of efficient multicast routing on such wireless mesh networks, and its seamless interconnection to wired IP multicast services. The proposed architecture and protocols allow for a ready deployment without changes on the existing <b>networking</b> <b>equipments</b> in the fixed network or in end user’s devices. Our simulations and empirical evaluation on a real wireless mesh network demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a good performance and its highly scalable. I...|$|R

How the existing and newly proposed congestion control algorithms are {{far away from}} minimizing download times? And now the question remains is how to bring solution to the tough problem of reducing flow completion time in theory and practically, especially for multimedia long flows over wireless <b>networking</b> <b>equipments.</b> When internet users are downloading web page, downloading a file, sending an attachment, send/read mail, always involve the network in almost any interaction. Every user wishes to complete the transaction in the time as small as possible. Thus, each one over the internet demands smallest possible flow completion time. Nowadays, people are less concerned about network throughput, network efficiency, optimum network utility or packet drop rate or packet delivery ratio. They behave selfish wanting always to complete their flow as fast as possible. Here {{in this paper we}} are presenting the design of a newly created protocol called TCPBooster developed and suggested by us to reduce the limitations of existing congestion control protocol over wireless networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A major {{barrier to}} {{advancing}} modern wireless networking {{research is the}} lack of an effective wireless network simulation platform that simultaneously offers high fidelity, scalability, reproducibility and ease of use. MiNT [8], [7] is an innovative wireless network emulation platform that is specifically designed to satisfy all these desirable properties.

This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of this networked robot system. Each robot node in MiNT is an iRobot’s Roomba, which is modified to house an embedded PC equipped with multiple wireless networking interfaces and to re-charge the embedded PC through Roomba’s built-in self-charging mechanism. For robot navigation and movement, MiNT’s networked robot system supports a computer vision-based robot positioning mechanism and a collision avoidance-driven trajectory planning component. Finally, MiNT provides an interactive control interface and visualization interface to give users real-time visibility into and full control over the MiNT testbed. I...|$|R
