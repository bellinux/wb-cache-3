50|$|Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu {{discusses}} {{issues of}} cultural capital, and symbolic capital. As with Weber, he is commenting on how <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means</b> {{are used to}} confer and deny status to individuals and groups. However, Bourdieu developed independently from Weber, even though they probably do reflect the type of 'capital' that Status Group confers on those who are privileged.|$|E
50|$|The latent part {{consists}} of that {{segment of the}} population not yet fully integrated into capitalist production. In Marx's day, he was referring to people living off of subsistence agriculture who were looking for monetary employment in industry. In modern times, people coming from slums in developing countries where they survive largely by <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means,</b> to developed cities where they work for pay might form the latent. Housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve. They are not unemployed, because they are not necessarily actively looking for a job; but if capital needs extra workers, it can pull them out of the latent reserve. In this sense, the latent forms a reservoir of potential workers for industries.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} investigate the private enforcement of non-monetary inter-firm payments in Russia during the 1990 s. Since acceptability of means of payment can have a self-reinforcing nature, the dominance of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means</b> of payment over money in Russia {{might have been a}} result of the driving forces of the demonetiziation equilibrium. We propose a very simple search model to explore acceptability of means of payment different from legal tender - fiat money, commodity money, and trade credit. In each case, we show that monetization through the proposed means of payment is always a possible trade pattern. ...|$|E
40|$|Using Spanish {{data from}} European Union Household Panel Survey {{corresponding}} to 2001, {{we find that}} the incidence and the consequences, monetary and non-monetary, are different for the job-worker qualification and education mismatches. In fact, only 36 % of workers have the same type of fit under both criterions of classification. Additionally, the qualification mismatches have worse consequences for workers than education mismatches. Specifically, the monetary consequences are neutrals for overqualified workers, but negatives for underqualified workers, while the wage of educational mismatched workers is not significantly different of those who have similar characteristics and are accurately match in terms of formal education. However, the overeducated workers earn higher wages than their well-matched co-workers and the wage penalization for one year of undereducation is lower than the reward for one year of required education. On the other hand, the analysis of the <b>non-monetary</b> consequences, by <b>means</b> of job satisfaction, shows that the qualification mismatched workers have lower probability of being completely satisfied than those who are accurately match in terms of qualification, while the effects of education mismatch situations on job satisfaction are no significant. However, among similar jobs, the years of educational mismatch can have an effect even positive on job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} why <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means</b> of exchange, such as barter and the reciprocation of favors, {{are chosen}} by firms despite the usual benefits of monetary transactions. We consider the chosen {{means of exchange}} when both monetary and non-monetary exchange mechanisms are available. We illustrate three potential reasons {{for the emergence of}} non-monetary trade. First, a willingness to barter may reveal information that cannot be revealed solely through monetary trade. Second, non-monetary trade may constrain the ability of agents to engage in inefficient rent-seeking activities. Finally, non-monetary trade improves the ability of agents to impose trade sanctions on those who act dishonestly. We consider a number of applications of each of these ideas. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper examines {{the influence of}} the national government on talent development programs in their support of the performing arts through financial aid. The first part of this thesis examines whether {{there is a difference between}} companies that are subsidized by the government or by the national fund for performing arts (in Dutch: NFPK+) and companies who do not at all receive subsidy from the national government. Further more, it is studied which factors other than subsidy, influence talent development programs. The second part focuses on the support by the government in <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means</b> to influence talent development programs within the performing arts. Meaning that along with the subsidy there comes a set of expectations and control mechanisms. By using the policy-performing-model (Torenvlied, 1996) (in Dutch: beleidsuitvoeringmodel), this thesis provides insight on how {{the influence of the}} government on the companies in the performing arts can be explained. The results show that the amount of the subsidy and the size of the company are decisive in the extent of talent development within the companies. In addition, the company itself has to see the importance of talent development, wants the policy to have any effect. Larger companies find talent development more important than smaller companies. However, the control mechanisms that the government uses, albeit nuanced, has important influence on the companies within the performing arts...|$|E
40|$|Background Globally, food {{insecurity}} {{is a major}} public health concern. In North America, it is particularly prevalent in certain sub-groups, including Indigenous communities. Although many Indigenous and remote communities harvest and share food, most food security assessment tools focus on economic access. This study describes the psychometric evaluation of a modified Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), developed for mixed economies, to assess {{food insecurity}} among pregnant Inuit women. Methods The HFIAS was administered to 130 pregnant women in Nunavik (Arctic region of Quebec), Canada. Data were fit to a Rasch Rating Scale Model (RSM) to determine the discrimination ability of the HFIAS. Person parameter (Theta) estimates were calculated based on the RSM {{to provide a more}} accurate scoring system of the modified HFIAS for this population. Theta values were compared to known correlates of food insecurity. Results Comparative fit indices showed preference for {{a modified version of the}} HFIAS over the original. Theta values displayed a continuum of severity estimates and those values indicating greater food insecurity were consistently linked to known correlates of food insecurity. Participants living in households with more than 1 hunter (Theta = -. 45) or more than 1 fisher (Theta = -. 43) experienced less food insecurity than those with no hunters (Theta =. 48) or fishers (Theta =. 49) in their household. The RSM indicated the scale showed good discriminatory ability. Subsequent analyses indicated that most scale items pertain to the classification of a household as moderately food insecure. Conclusions The modified HFIAS shows potential for measuring food insecurity among pregnant women in Nunavik. This is an efficient instrument that can inform interventions targeting health conditions impacting groups that obtain food through both monetary and <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The primary aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{contribution}} made by business organisations in the fight against poverty in Mauritius. Whereas on one side businesses are flourishing and ultra-capitalism is the order of the day, we are witnessing, in parallel, a growing level of poverty worldwide. This situation of paradoxes is not being dealt with effectively by governments, being more interested in attracting foreign direct investment. Civil society organisations, on the other hand, lack the resources to do so. The role played by the business sector is analysed in this work. Design/methodology/approach – For data collection purpose, a questionnaire-based semi-structured interview schedule, worked out through the application of the mixed-methods approach, was devised and applied to a stratified sample of 33. 3 per cent of the top 100 companies and the 19 locally-incorporated banks, based on the stratified random sampling method. Secondary sources, mainly in the form of company publications were also used. Findings – Most businesses surveyed already have established procedures with regards to the allocation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. They are willing to help in creating a better society whether through financial or <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means,</b> and do have the resources to do so. However, presently, only 11 per cent of CSR funds are devoted to the fight against poverty. There is a need to set the priorities and to coordinate these efforts. What is lacking is the active involvement of business leaders and public figures. This is needed to create the momentum for setting poverty alleviation as a top-priority of our social agenda. Originality/value – This work contributes to the scarce literature on CSR in Africa by analysing the way business organisations in the Mauritian economy contribute to the fight against poverty through CSR. It provides an evaluation of what is presently being done, and proposes ways through which the business contribution could be enhanced in order to help more people in need.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to study and test a {{selection}} of compensation variables and examine whether these factors can influence on employee cynicism. The study focuses on the personnel in three service stations in Finland {{that are part of}} Teboil’s organisation. These three stations were chosen to represent all the service station within Teboil. These stations are considered to be an appropriate pick for this study since their recent organisational changes.   This subject was considered to be interesting to study when taking into consideration the current situation in the economy. The economical recession forces many organisations to act meaning changes in the organisational structure and among the employees. Teboil improved the income effectiveness by making changes that resulted in reduction in salaries and working hours etc. In order to maintain the motivation among the employees in spite of these unfortunate changes this study examines <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means</b> to compensate people and hinder the development of cynicism, since these cases, reduction in employees’ pay checks and working hours can be assumed to be factors that affect on the cynicism level.   This particular organisation was chosen for this study because the researcher {{has been a part of}} this organisation on and off for several years and also there was a need for this kind of study in the service station area, since it was evident for the managers that some issues will raise when the cut backs will be introduced. This survey also showed the managing department’s concern about the well being of the employees in the stations. It showed that the consequences of these changes were taking into consideration and the satisfaction of the employees was very important to maintain.   The conclusion of this study is that internal as well as individual equity are the compensation factors that affect the most on cynicism. These factors comprehend the equality among all the employees, among employee and his/her co-workers (internal equity) and the equality between the input and output (individual equity). In order to maintain these important aspects equal, non-monetary compensation means are suggested. Propositions are mainly to give positive feedback regularly in order to show the appreciation and also monitor the employees and more eagerly and consistently recognize the good performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the discussion regarding accounting for emission trading schemes, introduced on a global scale {{as a result of the}} Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which sets binding greenhouse gases emissions targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European Union. The EU Directive 87 / 2003 /EC establishes a scheme for greenhouse gases allowance trading, in order to promote reduction of greenhouse gases in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The European Union has adopted a “cap and trade” scheme (Starbatty, 2010), which establishes a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases than can be released over a specified period of time. The European Emission Trading Scheme (the EU ETS) started in January 2005 and it is the largest company-level, multi-sector cap and trade emissions trading scheme in the world. Allowances are instruments issued by the administrator (e. g., a government) of the trading scheme and assigned to the participants of the trading scheme. They are transferrable instruments which can be traded, either in an official market or over the counter. Any emission of greenhouse gases must be offset by returning an appropriate number of allowances to the administrator of the scheme. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), after withdrawing IFRIC 3, is working, jointly with the US Financial Accounting and Standards Board (FASB), to produce a new standard on emission trading schemes. Thus, at the time of writing, no accounting standard yet exists on how to report emission trading schemes in financial statements. In this paper we discuss the problem of the appropriate accounting for emission trading allowances, considering the relevant literature in this field and the various positions taken by authors and regulatory bodies over the years. Provided that financial reporting should always reflect the economic substance of the phenomena which it aims to portray, we emphasize the difference between emission permits and emission allowances, noting how the latter represent a means of payment for every unit of greenhouse gases emitted. We therefore argue against reporting emission allowances as intangible assets, offering instead an alternative view of these instruments as <b>non-monetary</b> <b>means</b> of payment. We also consider to which extent the current reporting model for financial instrument devised by IAS 32 is applicable to emission allowances. Finally, we comment on the measurement issues that arise at each reporting date for the emission allowances held by the scheme participant...|$|E
