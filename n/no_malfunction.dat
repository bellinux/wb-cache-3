5000|$|Click type torque {{wrenches}} are precise when properly calibrated—however {{the more complex}} mechanism can result in loss of calibration sooner than the beam type, where {{there is little to}} <b>no</b> <b>malfunction,</b> (however the thin indicator rod can be accidentally bent out of true). Beam type {{torque wrenches}} are impossible to use in situations where the scale cannot be directly read - and these situations are common in automotive applications. The scale on a beam type wrench is prone to parallax error, {{as a result of the}} large distance between indicator arm and scale (on some older designs). There is also the issue of increased user error with the beam type - the torque has to be read at every use and the operator must use caution to apply loads only at the floating handle's pivot point. Dual-beam or [...] "flat" [...] beam versions reduce the tendency for the pointer to rub, as do low-friction pointers.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Malfunctions {{of cardiac}} implantable {{electronical}} devices (CIED) {{have been described}} after high-energy radiation therapy {{even in the absence}} of direct exposure to ionizing radiation, due to diffusion of neutrons (n) causing soft errors in inner circuits. The purpose of the study was to analyse the effect of scattered radiation on different types and models of CIED and the possible sources of malfunctions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-nine explanted CIED were placed on an anthropomorphous phantom of tissue-equivalent material, and a high-energy photon (15 MV) radiotherapy course (total dose = 70 Gy) for prostate treatment was performed. All devices were interrogated before and after radiation. Radiation dose, the electromagnetic field, and neutron fluence at the CIED site were measured. Thirty-four pacemakers (PM) and 25 implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) were analysed. <b>No</b> <b>malfunctions</b> were detected before radiation. After radiation a software malfunction was evident in 13 (52...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInappropriate ICD shocks {{are common}} adverse events; they are mainly due to {{supraventricular}} arrhythmias and secondly {{are related to}} noise, undersensing, oversensing, device malfunctions. We present a case of inappropriate device therapy due to myopotential oversensing in a patient with a subcutaneous ICD (s-ICD). A 58 years old male with an s-ICD during the device interrogation showed a previous episode of suspected sustained ventricular tachycardia at 210  bpm, which was effectively treated with ICD shock. The patient experienced the electrical shock while holding a big gas-cylinder in his arms. The EGM analysis revealed many irregular ventricular signals of low amplitude lasting for 24  s and interrupted by the shock. The device showed <b>no</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> This is the first case report of inappropriate S-ICD shock related to myopotential over-sensing. By recording intracardiac EGM, we demonstrated that the noise {{was created by the}} activity of the pectorals muscles...|$|R
50|$|X-linked {{dominant}} {{erythropoietic protoporphyria}} {{is distinct from}} EPP in {{that there is no}} overload of Fe2+ ions. Additionally, unlike the other condition the arises out of a mutation of the ALAS2 gene, there is no anemia. XDEPP is characterized by a buildup of Protoporphyrin IX caused by in increased level of function in the ALAS2 enzyme. Because there is a buildup of Proporphyrin IX with <b>no</b> <b>malfunction</b> of the FECH enzyme, all the available Fe2+ is used in the production of Heme causing the FECH enzyme to use Zn2+ in its place causing a buildup of Zinc Protoporphyrin IX. X-linked dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria is a relatively mild version of porphyria with the predominate symptom being extreme photo sensitivity causing severe itching and burning of the skin due to the buildup of Protoporphyrin IX. One possible treatment was discovered when treating an individual with supplemental Iron for a gastric ulcer. Levels of free Protoporphyrin decreased significantly as there was iron available for the FECH to produce Heme. Levels of Zn Protoporphyrin, however did not decrease.|$|E
5000|$|Somewhat more {{abstract}} is the design stance, {{the domain of}} biology and engineering, which requires {{no knowledge of the}} physical constitution or the physical laws that govern a system's operation. Based on an implicit assumption that there is <b>no</b> <b>malfunction</b> in the system, predictions are made from knowledge of the purpose of the system's design (this could also be called the [...] "teleological stance"). At this level, we are concerned with such things as purpose, function and design. When we predict that a bird will fly when it flaps its wings on the basis that wings are made for flying, we are taking the design stance. Likewise, we can understand the bimetallic strip as a particular type of thermometer, not concerning ourselves with the details of how this type of thermometer happens to work. We can also recognize the purpose that this thermometer serves inside a thermostat and even generalize to other kinds of thermostats that might use a different sort of thermometer. We can even explain the thermostat in terms of what it's good for, saying that it keeps track of the temperature and turns on the heater whenever it gets below a minimum, turning it off once it reaches a maximum.|$|E
5000|$|The Colt {{was tested}} next, as the Mannlicher sample had still not been {{received}} from the manufacturer's representative. Testing began in February 1900. The Colt {{had a number of}} initial problems, due to ill fitting parts in the trigger mechanism, which eventually required the attention of a manufacturer's representative, who fitted a new trigger mechanism. Once this was done, the pistol fired the remaining 293 rounds of the 500 allotted for the endurance test, plus an additional 150 rounds with no malfunctions. Another supply of ammunition, consisting of 350 rounds of low velocity [...]38 ACP ammunition (935 ft/s) was also tested, with no adjustments to the recoil spring. This was done to test the repaired trigger mechanism, and while it was not expected to function with the pistol tuned for the 1200 ft/s ammunition, only four failures were experienced with this ammunition. The pistol fired all ten rounds with no malfunctions during the dust test. After accelerated rusting with sal ammoniac, the pistol was frozen so that the slide would not move. A sharp blow {{on the edge of a}} table with the slide freed it enough to allow the slide to operate, and a round to be chambered. After firing the first round, the slide failed to return to battery, but was readily closed, and the remaining rounds functioned without malfunction. All remaining ammunition, 23 rounds, was then fired through the rusted gun with <b>no</b> <b>malfunction.</b>|$|E
40|$|Passive {{integrated}} transponder (PIT) tags {{only work}} in very close {{proximity of the}} receiver (cm distance). Therefore, active transponders are mainly used in behavioural monitoring. In the present study, the effects of intraabdominal implantation of PIT tags on survival, well-being and growth performance of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) were investigated. Furthermore, the tag retention rate and read out error rate of all tags were examined. Passive integrated transponder tags were implanted in the abdominal cavity of nearly 6 000 turbots. All tags were readout and checked for correct function {{over a period of}} 122 days every five and a half weeks. No significant effects of tagging on fish survival (mortality rate < 0. 2 %), health or growth were detected during the trial period.

30|$|Subcapsular hepatic {{steatosis}} {{is a rare}} form of accumulation of fat within the liver, first described in 1989 by Wanless et al. [54]. According to the literature, it occurs in about 18  % of peritoneal dialysis patients [55]. It {{is caused by the}} contact of subcapsular hepatocytes with insulin of the dialysate injected into the peritoneal cavity. On ultrasound, it can be identified as echogenic nodules or scar tissue or as hypodense subcapsular areas on CT, generating a signal drop on the opposed-phase weighted MRT images. Termination of dialysis can lead to a regression [55]. Normally, <b>no</b> <b>malfunction</b> of the liver is caused, and the disease is of no clinical significance.

40|$|Aution Max AX- 4280, an {{automated}} urine test-strip analyser, was evaluated in three centres. Method com-parison, imprecision, carry-over, linearity, detection limit and drift studies were performed for glucose, pro-tein, blood and leukocytes using Uriflet S 9 UB strips. These strips enable measurement of pH, glucose, pro-tein, blood, leukocytes, ketones, bilirubin, urobilino-gen and nitrite. Specific gravity {{is determined by}} the refractive index method. Within-run and between-day imprecision, assessed using pooled urines and quality control materials, were good. No drift over 24 h or sample carry-over was observed. Method comparison with quantitative methods for glucose, protein and specific gravity yielded good correlations. Ascorbate negatively interfered with haemoglobin, glucose and nitrite measurements.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of a fire are twofold: an increase in temperature and heat fluxes, and smoke propagation at {{the source of the}} fire and in adjacent rooms. These may lead to malfunctions of fire safety electrical equipment in nuclear power plants. A survey of relevant literature has shown that the equipment most affected by smoke particles and gases are electronic boards. Smoke causes electronic boards to malfunction in four ways: loss of metallic contact due to chemical corrosion, increased short circuiting between the conductors, loss of mechanical contact conductivity, and reduced capacity for movement in electromechanical systems as a result of particle deposits. These effects can occur over different timescales: – In the short term, malfunctions that have critical impact in terms of plant safety occur – such as electrical short circuiting and increased contact resistance, – Mid to longer term, corrosion effects can appear. A test procedure based on the repeatability of a 20 -minute duration cable fire was set up. Temperature and smoke composition in terms of both gaseous products and soot were controlled. Tests were performed on boards designed to sum test and regulation signals, or to control an analog chain fitted with relays. Although the behaviour of the equipment may be dependent upon its construction material and equipment layout, <b>no</b> electronic board <b>malfunctions</b> occurred during the 24 -hour tests. Furthermore, <b>no</b> <b>malfunctions</b> were detected in the boards when they were retested six months later under normal conditions and without any clean-up following the smoke exposure.
