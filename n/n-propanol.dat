Along with ethanol, other volatile compounds such as <b>n-propanol</b> are produced as products of putrefaction. The aim of this study is the evaluation of ethanol and <b>n-propanol</b> in postmortem blood. Methods: A case-control study was done on 300 blood samples obtained from cadavers that were referred to Legal Medicine Organization (LMO) of Tehran, Iran, over a year (2009 - 2010). Blood ethanol and <b>n-propanol</b> concentrations were analyzed in duplicate by HSGC. Data on cadavers were taken from the information sheets and were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: In this study, mean <b>n-propanol</b> level in blood was 8. 311 mg/dl in putrefied and 1. 58 mg/dl in non-putrefied victims. Interval times between death and autopsy in putrefied and non-putrefied victims were 3. 5 and 1. 25 days. Results show that <b>n-propanol</b> concentrations increase 1. 23 mg/dl/day after death. In 99 % of putrefied victims, ethanol level was more than 10 mg/dl. There was a high correlation between ethanol and <b>n-propanol</b> concentrations. By increasing 1 mg/dl of <b>n-propanol</b> concentration, ethanol levels increased 2. 5 and 1. 4 mg/dl in putrefied and non-putrefied victims, respectively.

40|$|Hand {{disinfection}} with short-chain aliphatic alcohols, so-called "rub-ins" is {{the method}} of choice for cross-infection prevention in health care environments, but their irritant potential is not well known. Skin tolerance is a major compliance factor, and {{a high proportion of}} health care workers suffer from low-grade irritant contact dermatitis. Therefore, assessment of the irritancy of the skin disinfectant <b>n-propanol</b> 60 %, and comparative 100 % and 0 % solutions, was performed in the setting of experimental low-grade ICD. ICD was induced by overnight patch exposure to H 2 O, and to 0. 3 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), in 12 probands, followed by repeated open exposure to the test substances. Outcome variables were transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and skin surface capacitance. On skin sites pre-irritated by SDS, all <b>n-propanol</b> concentrations (100 %, 60 %, 0 %) increased TEWL. However, a clear divergence appeared between pure <b>n-propanol,</b> and the lower concentrations. In contrast to pure <b>n-propanol,</b> <b>n-propanol</b> 60 % and 0 % had no significant effect on TEWL on H 2 O-pre-irritated skin sites. Capacitance of pre-irritated skin sites was increased by exposure to H 2 O-containing <b>n-propanol</b> solutions (60 % and 0 %). These results show a clear difference between the irritant potential of <b>n-propanol</b> 100 % on one side, and <b>n-propanol</b> 60 % and 0 % on the other side. The level of pre-existent skin irritation is a pertinent factor in susceptibility to irritation, as the irritant potential of <b>n-propanol</b> 60 %, the concentration used in daily practice, and <b>n-propanol</b> 0 % (water) became significant only on detergent-irritated skin.

40|$|An ether is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that consists of}} an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. In this work, we investigate the bimolecular dehydration of two alcohols, <b>n-propanol</b> and methanol with catalysts {{that are used in}} transesterification. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the feasibility of promoting etherification reaction using methanol and <b>n-propanol</b> as model alcohols. When methanol and <b>n-propanol</b> are reacted together, three types of ethers can be produced; i. e., dimethyl ether, methyl-propyl ether (also referred to as methoxypropane), and di-propyl ether. The latter two ethers are of more fuel interest due to their ability to stay in liquid phase at room temperature; however, the ability of catalysts to selectively produce liquid ethers is not established. Initial studies were conducted to discern the effect of sulfuric acid, amberlyst- 36 and titanium isopropoxide, catalysts that are known to be effective for transesterification, at four levels of temperature on the substrate conversion, ether yield and selectivity using <b>n-propanol.</b> Subsequent studies with <b>n-propanol</b> and methanol additionally looked at the impact of select catalyst concentrations and reaction conditions. Studies indicate that liquid mixtures of 1 -methoxypropane and di-propyl ethers could be formed by reacting <b>n-propanol</b> and methanol in the presence of sulfuric acid or Amberlyst 36. Higher concentrations of sulfuric acid (5 % w/w) coupled with higher temperatures (> 140 °C) favored substrate conversion and ether yields. However, it was revealed that the selectivity toward specific ethers, i. e., coupling of the two larger alcohols to produce di-propyl ether vs larger one with the smaller one to produce methoxypropane could be controlled by appropriate selection of the catalyst. We anticipate the results being a starting point for a simple technique to produce specific ethers using a mixture of alcohols that could be applied for applications such as transesterification byproduct utilization...|$|E

The difference in boiling points between <b>n-propanol</b> and 2 -butanol is 2, 1 oC and the corresponding relative volatility is 1, 09. The extractive agents and respective relative volatilities of <b>n-propanol</b> achieved were correlated with the physical properties of the pure extractive agent. In the presence of a high-boiling hydrocarbon cut, White oil 2 (C 12 - C 14 isoparaffin), a relative volatility of 1, 57 was achieved. This significantly improves the potential to separate <b>n-propanol</b> from 2 -butanol. Hydrogen bonding and polarity mainly contribute to the selectivity of an extractive agent. This result is in agreement with the findings of Yeh (1984). Accurate selection can be made using physical properties and can be applied to polar systems in general.

Alcohols represent a potential source of energy for the future. The structural features of an alcohol fuel have a direct impact on combustion properties. In particular, substitution in alcohols can alter the global combustion reactivity. In this study, experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the critical conditions of extinction and autoignition of <b>n-propanol,</b> 1 -butanol, iso-propanol and iso-butanol in non-premixed diffusion flames. Experiments were carried out in the counterflow configuration, while simulations were conducted using a skeletal chemical kinetic model for the C 3 and C 4 alcohols. The fuel stream consists of the pre-vaporized fuel diluted with nitrogen, while the oxidizer stream is air. The experimental results show that autoignition temperatures of the tested alcohols increase in the following order: iso-propanol > iso-butanol > 1 -butanol ≈ <b>n-propanol.</b> The simulated results for the branched alcohols agree with the experiments, while the autoignition temperature of 1 -butanol is slightly higher than that of <b>n-propanol.</b> For extinction, the experiments show that the extinction limits of the tested fuels increase in the following order: <b>n-propanol</b> ≈ 1 -butanol > iso-butanol > iso-propanol. The model suggests that the extinction limits of 1 -butanol is slightly higher than <b>n-propanol</b> with extinction strain rate of iso-butanol and iso-propanol maintaining the experimentally observed trend.

Efficacy against the aerobic flora of the forehead was mainly influenced by the type of alcohol (P < 0. 001), followed by the concentration (P < 0. 001) and the application time (P = 0. 006). Ethanol and isopropanol were significantly less effective (both P < 0. 001).
