5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not}} be substantiating the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> performance was {{vital to the}} plays, nor did he ever acknowledge {{the presence of an}} audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Born in Burntwood, Staffordshire, Sutton {{performed}} well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for colorectal cancer. His father had fought the disease twice, {{and both were}} predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> colorectal cancer could occur in a teenager.|$|E

5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, {{and more like}} the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis. Stravinsky, however, while acknowledging that he had studied the Tallis settings and works by William Byrd and Palestrina, did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they had influenced his music.|$|E
5|$|He {{retired from}} his {{university}} posts in 2004, but continued working on Time Team until 2011 and in 2006 commenced writing regular articles for British Archaeology magazine until his death. Although Aston did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{he would leave}} a significant legacy behind him, after his death various archaeologists claimed {{that he had a}} major impact in helping to popularise the discipline among the British public.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E

5|$|Some {{commentators}} do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the compliance}} pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour.

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

5000|$|Marten's {{epidemiological}} insight was prescient. Although Leeuwenhoek {{had reported}} seeing bacteria in 1676, he had <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> his [...] "little animals" [...] caused disease. In 1882 Robert Koch confirmed {{the agent of}} tuberculosis. To this day its treatment remains a challenge.|$|R
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Hank, an {{upstanding}} {{member of the}} community, {{would be capable of}} such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E
5|$|Because Corman did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> The Little Shop of Horrors {{had much}} {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, {{he did not}} bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

5|$|Bolt {{announced}} that he would double-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics, and the new 100 m world-record holder was the favourite to win both. Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a lack of experience would work against him. Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.|$|E
5|$|French losses {{numbered}} 2,000 {{killed and}} wounded plus 400 captured. The Austrians suffered 1,300 killed and wounded with 1,300 captured. On 10 July, Charles evacuated Malsch {{and ordered a}} forced march east to Pforzheim via Karlsruhe. Also on the 10th, the French occupied Ettlingen and Neuenbürg. Anxious to protect his magazines at Heilbronn, Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days. For his part, Moreau would <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Charles had given up, so he waited around Ettlingen for several days. Meanwhile, the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July. The next day, Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5000|$|There was a Case II, which {{applied to}} income from professions and vocations. It is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> a company within the charge to {{corporation}} tax can have such income and consequently Case II was effectively abolished when income tax stopped being treated on a schedular basis.|$|R
50|$|Liston biographer Paul Gallender's take is that Liston's {{shoulder}} {{was essentially}} paralyzed {{by the end}} of round six, and his corner made the decision to end the fight, despite Liston's protests. Liston spit out his mouth guard in disgust, still <b>not</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> Clay was the superior fighter.|$|R
50|$|The oldest known written {{records of}} {{languages}} {{closely related to}} Kazakh were written in the Old Turkic alphabet. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> any of these varieties were direct predecessors of Kazakh. Modern Kazakh has historically been written using versions of the Latin, Cyrillic and Arabic scripts.|$|R
