40|$|Irrigation can {{positively}} influence cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) {{yield and}} fiber quality {{during periods of}} short-term drought. A cover crop in conjunction with conservation tillage can also benefit cotton yield and fiber quality by conserving soil moisture and potentially increasing plant available water. A split-plot experiment in a randomized complete block design was utilized to examine how interactions between irrigation levels and tillage systems affect cotton yield and fiber quality in the Tennessee Valley on a Decatur silt loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Paleudults) from 2001 - 2003. Main plots were tillage systems and subplots were irrigation levels. The no-tillage system increased yields 13 % in 2003 (normal rainfall year), while irrigation levels increased yields 46 % and 32 %, respectively in 2002 and 2003 over <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>yields.</b> Micronaire and staple were not affected by tillage system or irrigation level in 2001; however, micronaire and staple were influenced by tillage system and irrigation level in 2002. Only irrigation level influenced fiber quality in 2003. A no-tillage system, utilizing a cover crop combined with irrigation, can improve cotton yields in the Tennessee Valley...|$|R
40|$|Perennial woody crops {{have the}} {{potential}} to contribute significantly to the production of bio-fuels while simultaneously helping to provide a wide range of conservation benefits. Among these benefits are increased biological diversity in the landscape, conservation of soil and water resources, maintenance of forest ecosystem productivity and health, contribution to the global carbon cycle, and provision of socioeconomic benefits. Short rotation woody crops, like hybrid poplar and willow, grow rapidly and can reach 15 - 25 feet in height after only three years. Currently, <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>yields</b> can be sustained at about 5 dry tons/acre/year and are increasing as plant breeding, nutrient management, and weed control advances are made. The high hemi-cellulose and cellulose content of woody biomass result in favorable net energy conversion ratios of 1 : 11 when co-fired with coal and 1 : 16 when undergoing gasification. Directing this wood fiber into bio-fuels would benefit both the energy sector and forest and farm landowners, while providing an array of conservation benefits and ecological services. The amount of biofuel that can be sustainably produced each year from perennial crops is potentially very large. The next Farm Bill affords an opportunity to insure that this potential can be more fully realized...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design a {{computer}} model which compares three sprinkler irrigation systems [...] -portable pipe with volume gun, traveller with volume gun and towable/non-towable centre pivot [...] -for potato production. The model user is required to enter a set of basic data: crop and field conditions, irrigation technical parameters and basic economic data, following which the model establishes the preliminary irrigation system and a comparative investment analysis. The model was applied and tested on a potato farm situated in Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix (southwestern Quebec). Based on a 14 -year climatic analysis, supplemental irrigation for a normal rainfall growing period (368 mm) was estimated at 250 mm. The application of the model indicates that for a normal rainfall period with an assumed yield increase of 25 % over non-irrigated production, all three systems provide net profits (increases of 11 % to 50 %). However, when determining the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on a 10 -year period, the maximum rate attained by the more profitable systems [...] -portable pipe and non-towable centre pivot (both with an electric pump) [...] -was 14 %, a rate inferior to the IRR for non-irrigated production (17 %). The Net Present Value (NPV) analysis for the two most profitable irrigation systems provided a slightly higher NPV value for irrigated than for non-irrigated production ($ 10, 942 [...] -irrigated vs $ 10, 522 [...] -non-irrigated production). The payback period for those two irrigation systems was 7 years. Greater gains of irrigated over <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>yields</b> would be expected for a dry period because of low and unpredictable <b>yields</b> in <b>non-irrigated</b> conditions. A farmer planning to invest in an irrigation system must carefully investigate all technical and socio-economic aspects.

40|$|Significant {{variations}} {{were found}} for water use (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) among seven winter wheat genotypes. These variations were explained by canopy temperature (Tc) differences. The genotype TAM 101 had the highest seasonal water used and maintained low WUE in both seasons of the study, and was ranked among genotypes that had warm canopies. The strong correlation among canopy temperature, seasonal water use, and WUE indicates that canopy temperature measurements during grain-filling stage {{may be used to}} identify wheat genotypes according to their water use, WUE, and consequently yield performance under both irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> conditions. <b>Yield</b> reduction under water stress conditions was less for Bezostaya and Chisholm genotypes compared to the other five genotypes. The contrasting behavior of canopy temperature of these two genotypes, under both treatments irrigated and non-irrigated plots, suggested different plant strategies (prodigal vs. conservative) for maintaining yield in water-limited environments.

40|$|Environment plays a {{major role}} in the {{development}} of a corn plant. Alternation of this habitat by a mechanical injury to the leaf tissue may alter the plant(s) growth pattern and in turn influence yield. The interruption of physiological and chemical processes during the growing season may be more harmful to the corn at one stage of its development than at another. The relative importance of leaf area as a determinant of yield must be considered to the extent that production varies or can be made to vary, as a result of the amount of photosynthetic area functioning on a plant for a specific period of the growing season. The research reported in this thesis is a portion of a study on simulated hail damage to corn. The study was conducted under irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> environments.

The {{experiments were}} carried out under cool season semiarid climatic conditions in Erzurum province located in the east of Turkey in the spring seasons of 2003 and 2004. The experiment included six water deficits: 0 % (well-irrigation), 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 % (non-irrigation). Results indicate that deficit irrigation influenced evapotranspiration, tuber yield and water-use efficiency. Potato evapotranspiration decreased as water deficit increased. Seasonal evapotranspiration was 445. 2 mm in well-irrigated treatment and 195. 2 mm <b>non-irrigated</b> treatment. Potato <b>yield</b> and water-use efficiency were also found decrease as water deficit increased. Potato yield of well-irrigated treatment was 26. 43 t ha - 1 while 8. 28 t ha - 1 in non-irrigated treatment. A linear relationship was found between evapotranspiration and tuber yield. Water use efficiency was 59. 56 kg/ha/mm for well-irrigated treatment and 42. 13 kg/ha/mm for non-irrigated treatment.

40|$|ABSTrACT The {{impact of}} {{moisture}} deficit {{stress on the}} yield response of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to foliar-applied K is not well understood. Studies were conducted in Arkansas from 1999 through 2002 at three field locations to evaluate the effect of irrigation and soil-applied K on the yield response of cotton to foliar-applied K. Eight treatments consisting of soil-applied K and no soil K with or without foliar-applied K, plus irriga-tion or no-irrigation were arranged in a split-split plot design with five to six replications. For most site-years, lint yield was not enhanced by foliar K where soil K applications were made according to current University of Arkansas recommenda-tions. Response to soil-applied K varied with initial soil K fertility level. Across site-years, lint yield responded 40 % of the time to soil-applied K under irrigated conditions whereas yield did not respond under non-irrigated conditions. Variation in rainfall among the growing seasons moderated the response of lint yield and yield components to irrigation. The data suggest that a yield response to soil-applied K may be observed more frequently in irrigated cotton grown in the mid-south when compared to <b>non-irrigated</b> cot-ton. Lint <b>yields</b> typically were not enhanced by foliar-applied K applications on soils where pre-plant, Melich 3 K levels ranged from 270 - 376 kg K ha- 1, irrespective of irrigation.

40|$|The primary maize (Zea mays L.) {{production}} {{areas are}} in temperate regions {{throughout the world}} {{and this is where}} most maize breeding is focused. Important but lower yielding maize growing regions such as the sub-tropics experience unique challenges, the greatest of which are drought stress and aflatoxin contamination. Here we used a diversity panel consisting of 346 maize inbred lines originating in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical areas testcrossed to stiff-stalk line Tx 714 to investigate these traits. Testcross hybrids were evaluated under irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> trials for <b>yield,</b> plant height, ear height, days to anthesis, days to silking and other agronomic traits. Irrigated trials were also inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and evaluated for aflatoxin content. Diverse maize testcrosses out-yielded commercial checks in most trials, which indicated the potential for genetic diversity to improve sub-tropical breeding programs. To identify genomic regions associated with yield, aflatoxin resistance and other important agronomic traits, a genome wide association analysis was performed. Using 60, 000 SNPs, this study found 10 quantitative trait variants for grain yield, plant and ear height, and flowering time after stringent multiple test corrections, and after fitting different models. Three of these variants explained 5 - 10 % of the variation in grain yield under both water conditions. Multiple identified SNPs co-localized with previously reported QTL, which narrows the possible location of causal polymorphisms. Novel significant SNPs were also identified. This study demonstrated the potential to use genome wide association studies to identify major variants of quantitative and complex traits such as yield under drought that are still segregating between elite inbred lines...|$|R
40|$|Consumers {{interest}} for organic agriculture and environmental-friendly agricultural products is increasing. Nevertheless, cultivation protocols in organic farming are not sufficiently standardized to guarantee product quality stability, a parameter which {{is critical for}} further expansion of this niche market. Variable responses in terms of {{quality and quantity of}} the harvested product often arise from complex interactions between agronomic and environmental factors. Here we report on the effects of different levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 50, 150, 200 kg N ha− 1) and irrigation regime (50 % and 100 % replenishment of the evaporation determined using a Class A pan, plus a <b>non-irrigated</b> control) on <b>yield</b> and accumulation of primary metabolites of two potato cultivars (Agria and Merit) grown under conventional and organic farming systems. Organic farming caused a 25 % marketable yield reduction with a higher percentage of large tubers under conventional farming, whereas irrigation increased the marketable yield and the percentage of large tubers. Nitrogen fertilization affected the marketable yield and significantly interacted with the irrigation regime in modifying potato yield and quality. Farming protocol, cultivar, irrigation and nitrogen fertilization all affected both amino acid contents and composition with a significant decrease of most essential amino acids in coincidence with highest nitrogen levels. An increased water availability caused an accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers only in organic farming, whereas such accumulation was not observed under conventional farming. These results indicate that cultivar-specific genetic determinants and cultivation factors, including the farming system, may strongly and specifically interact to affect important quality parameters of potato tubers. This should be considered to improve quality standards in organic farming...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the increasing demand for and price of corn related to the unprecedented growth of the corn-based ethanol industry, growers in the Southeast need to alleviate weather and soil limitations that have hindered corn production in the region. We present two years of preliminary results from an ongoing research with objectives to demonstrate the potential of high residue conservation tillage to enhance water conservation and improve irrigation and water use efficiency in corn production. The research is being conducted within two irrigated corn-cotton-peanut rotation studies at University of Georgia research stations at Camilla and Tifton, GA. All crops in the rotation are present each year but this research focuses only on each year’s corn crop. At each location treatments are assigned to nine 30 ft x 70 ft plots in four complete blocks in a factorial arrangement consisting of 2 tillage (conventional (CT) without a rye cover crop on 4 plots and strip-tillage (ST) with a rye cover of high residue on 4 and low residue on 1 plot) by 4 irrigations (spanning the zero to full irrigation scale). Strip-tillage enhanced infiltration. While still within statistical margin of error, this led to slightly taller plants with more biomass (stalks and leaves) at tasselling. Corn grain yield differentials arising from tillage treatments have not yet materialized. In <b>non-irrigated</b> plots, grain <b>yield</b> remained 40 to 50 bu ac- 1 at Camilla and 40 to 100 bu ac- 1 at Tifton, while fully irrigated plots produced 200 to 250 bu ac- 1. Improvement in residue management (raising high residue and being able to plant into it) and developing the irrigation schedule strategies that would capture the advantages of the enhanced infiltration under strip-tillage continue to be areas of research...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many aspects of hydrological and agricultural systems. Temperature and precipitation are usually the main forcing inputs for hydrological and agricultural simulations, while wind effect has generally been neglected in previous research. Wind speed is, however, an important factor for many physical processes, including evaporation from soil, and transpiration from plants. In order to investigate how climate variability impacts agricultural production, there are three hypotheses addressed in this dissertation. Hypothesis 1 is that the representation of changing wind speed will play an important role in the simulation of hydrological processes, and that the effect of wind speed will directly affect soil hydrology and evapotranspiration. Hypothesis 1 is tested using a factor separation analysis to quantify the contribution of projected future wind speed to hydrologic change under future climate. The result showed that changes in wind speed affected soil hydrology and evapotranspiration directly. ^ Hypothesis 2 is that the application of irrigation will be significantly beneficial for crop productivity in the future as it will mitigate risk associated with water deficits in the growing season, Regional farmers are expected to rely more on irrigation to mitigate risk due to increased climate variability in the future, resulting in a substantial increase in its use. This hypothesis is tested through the analysis of changes in crop (corn and soybean) yield due to climate change between historical and future periods using the VIC-CropSyst model, which incorporates a cropping system model, the CropSyst, model, into a large-scale hydrology model, the VIC model. First the effect of climate change on <b>non-irrigated</b> crop <b>yields</b> is quantified, then the ability of irrigation to mitigate crop yield losses due to changes in climate are quantified. Application of irrigation is found to improve corn yield by up to 5 % and soybean yield by 20 %, compared to the non-irrigated future scenario. In addition, irrigation is found to have significantly mitigated the impact of climate uncertainty on crop yield, with more benefits for soybean yield than for corn yield. This analysis addressed Hypothesis 2 and showed that irrigation is significantly beneficial for crop productivity and mitigates the impact of future changes in temperature and precipitation, meaning risk associated with water deficits in the growing season can be decreased using irrigation. ^ Hypothesis 3 is that the increased use of irrigation on historically rain-fed crops will affect regional water use significantly, increasing the risk of water supply deficits in the crop growing season. The assessment of water footprint in addition to the previous analysis of irrigation impact on crop yield, found that irrigation leads to significant increases in the blue water footprint. The assessment addressed Hypothesis 3 and suggested that irrigation on traditional rain-fed crops will affect regional water use significantly. However, we cannot assess the risk of water supply deficits because irrigation use is unrestricted in the model. ...|$|R
40|$|Properties such as soil {{apparent}} {{electric conductivity}} (ECa), topography and other site-related data (e. g. canopy reflectance from aerial images) vary across field. The agronomic {{effects of such}} variability can sometimes {{be seen in the}} spatial variations of crop yield on that field. However, yield maps do not always represent the natural boundaries based on site characteristics. Identification of these boundaries as “management zones” (MZ) can be beneficial in crop management and improving crop input use efficiency. A simple methodology is required to delineate such zones. This research presents an effective methodology to delineate MZ in an irrigated and a non-irrigated (rain-fed) arable maize field in New Zealand. Elevation data for the sites were acquired from Google Earth images and a soil survey. Soil ECa was collected from a soil survey with an electromagnetic device. Yield values (t/ha) were obtained from combine harvesters equipped with yield monitor and Global Positioning System (GPS), over the course of four years for the irrigated site, and two years for the <b>non-irrigated</b> site. The <b>yield</b> data was quality controlled using a filtering system to remove outliers and technically non-plausible data. The data sources were combined in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and three MZ were delineated for each field through standard clustering methods. The maize yields were aggregated per derived MZ to compare yields between different MZ-classes. The results showed that there was some consistency in yields related to the MZ, derived without yield data. In both the non-irrigated and irrigated fields, the lowest yield consistently occurred in the same class each year, however, the MZ-class with the highest yield varied year to year. The results show that it is possible for the studied type of fields to delineate ‘natural’ clusters or zones of site properties that can be used as MZ-classes as they represent different yield levels. The required inputs are freely available and easily obtained data...|$|R

R., Lincoln, in the 1971 / 72 and 1972 / 73 seasons to examine ways {{of reducing the}} cost of establishing lucerne and reducing the loss of production in the first year. Trial I examined {{the effect of a}} spring sown barley (cv Zephyr) cover crop at three seeding rates, 0, 56 and 112 kg/ha, on lucerne sown at the same time at three seeding rates, 2. 9, 3. 8 and 5. 8 kg/ha with and without irrigation. The 1971 / 72 season was drier than normal but lucerne establishment was unaltered by a cover crop regardless of seeding rate or irrigation treatment. The overall establishment was high with 73 % of viable seeds being present as plants after the first winter at a seeding rate of 2. 9 kg/ha. Lucerne production at the harvest cut was reduced by barley sown at 56 kg/ha to 21 % and 49 % non-irrigated and irrigated respectively and remained depressed for two further cuts <b>non-irrigated</b> but <b>yield</b> was restored by the following cut irrigated. Irrigation increased the first season lucerne yield by 100 % clear seeded and 194 % with 56 kg/ha of barley and lucerne seeding rate had no effect on lucerne yield. Undersown lucerne at all seeding rates reduced barley grain yield by 20 % at the low barley seeding rate but lucerne at the high seeding rate only reduced grain yield at the high barley seeding rate. Trial II examined the effect of a winter sown wheat (cv Arawa) and a spring sown barley (cv Research) on the establishment and early yield of lucerne sown in the spring at three seeding rates (2. 25, 9. 0, 35. 0 kg/ha). The influence of cover crop competition was further examined by sowing the cover crops at three seeding rates (56, 112 and 224 kg/ha), and by simulated grazing of the wheat and the use of a herbicide on the barley and clear seeded lucerne. The 1972 / 73 season was drier than normal and although percentage lucerne establishment decreased as the lucerne seeding rate increased, no cover crop treatments effected lucerne establishment. Overall establishment was low with 36. 5 % of viable seed being present as plants after harvest at the 2. 25 kg/ha seeding rate. Lucerne production at the harvest cut was low and was reduced markedly by cover crop treatments and height, root weight and root weight distribution data suggested that wheat had a greater effect than barley. No further cuts w. ere taken in the establishment season but cover crops continued to reduce lucerne yields in four cuts, in the following season. The use of spring sown cereal cover crops for lucerne establishment can be justified on the basis of providing a more profitable return, provided the establishment year production of clear seeded lucerne is low but cannot be justified on the basis of weed suppression. Lucerne seeding rates of 2. 25 and 2. 9 kg/ha produced stands with at least 30 plants/m² which was a density sufficient for maximum production...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture can {{simultaneously}} address global food, feed, fiber, {{and energy}} challenges provided our soil, water, and air resources are not compromised in doing so. As we embark on the 19 th Triennial Conference of the International Soil and Tillage Research Organization (ISTRO), I {{am pleased to}} proclaim that our members are well poised to lead these endeavors because of our comprehensive understanding of soil, water, agricultural and bio-systems engineering processes. The concept of landscape management, as an approach for integrating multiple bioenergy feedstock sources, including biomass residuals, into current crop production systems, is used as the focal point to show how these ever-increasing global challenges can be met in a sustainable manner. Starting with the 2005 Billion Ton Study (BTS) goals, research and technology transfer activities leading to the 2011 U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Revised Billion Ton Study (BT 2) and development of a residue management tool to guide sustainable crop residue harvest will be reviewed. Multi-location USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Renewable Energy Assessment Project (REAP) team research and on-going partnerships {{between public and private}} sector groups will be shared to show the development of landscape management strategies that can simultaneously address the multiple factors that must be balanced to meet the global challenges. Effective landscape management strategies recognize the importance of nature’s diversity and strive to emulate those conditions to sustain multiple critical ecosystem services. To illustrate those services, the soil quality impact of harvesting crop residues are presented to show how careful, comprehensive monitoring of soil, water and air resources must {{be an integral part of}} sustainable bioenergy feedstock production systems. Preliminary analyses suggest that to sustain soil resources within the U. S. Corn Belt, corn (Zea mays L.) stover should not be harvested if average grain yields are less than 11 Mg ha- 1 (175 bu ac- 1) unless more intensive landscape management practices are implemented. Furthermore, although <b>non-irrigated</b> corn grain <b>yields</b> east and west of the primary Corn Belt may not consistently achieve the 11 Mg ha- 1 yield levels, corn can still be part of an overall landscape approach for sustainable feedstock production. Another option for producers with consistently high yields (> 12. 6 Mg ha- 1 or 200 bu ac- 1) that may enable them to sustainably harvest even more stover is to decrease their tillage intensity which will reduce fuel use, preserve rhizosphere carbon, and/or help maintain soil structure and soil quality benefits often attributed to no-till production systems. In conclusion, I challenge all ISTRO scientists to critically ask if your research is contributing to improved soil and crop management strategies that effectively address the complexity associated with sustainable food, feed, fiber and fuel production throughout the world...|$|R
