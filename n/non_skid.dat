Automobiles make their way back and forth down the paved road at center, a florist's van moving away in the righthand lane. Brick {{commercial}} buildings line the street to either side, along with utility poles. To the right, a two-story brick building has been vacated and brandishes a "For Rent" sign just outside its door. A dividing line is visible {{down the center of}} the road.; Legible signs from left to right read: "Card & Schwarz Reality Co.

50|$|The league was {{the brainchild}} of Indianapolis grocer Irv Kautsky, who {{sponsored}} the Indianapolis Kautskys club team, and Goodyear Tire Company, who originally sponsored the Akron Wingfoots. After a false start in the early 1930s, the league was restarted in 1938, with the Wingfoots winning the initial NBL title. By World War II, both the Wingfoots and the Firestone Tire Company's <b>Non</b> <b>Skids</b> had suspended play, but other seminal pro teams such as the Ft. Wayne Zollner Pistons (now the Detroit Pistons), Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers), Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings), Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers), and Tri-Cities BlackHawks (now the Atlanta Hawks), all of whom are currently playing in the NBA, had joined.After World War II, the fledgling Basketball Association of America was established by arena owners in large cities to try to capture the popularity of the NBL teams from the smaller communities. This attempt failed miserably as 13 of the 16 BAA teams folded. Undaunted, the remaining BAA teams, the Philadelphia Warriors, Boston Celtics, and New York Knicks convinced the top NBL teams to join with them and they formed the NBA. Thus, the early NBA was composed mostly of teams brought over from the NBL and three BAA teams.|$|R

A participaÃÃo nesse projeto despertou para o tema e originou esta dissertaÃÃo, que tem por objetivo mapear as condiÃÃes arquitetÃnicas de acesso do portador deficiÃncia fÃsica aos serviÃos {{hospital}}ares na cidade de Sobral-Ce. O referencial teÃrico apÃia-se na Lei n 7. 853 de 24 / 10 / 1989 que estabelece normas que asseguram o exercÃcio dos direitos individuais e sociais das pessoas portadoras de deficiÃncia e sua efetiva integraÃÃo social. Estudo quantitativo que utilizou instrumento de coleta de dados tipo cheque lista elaborado consultando a lei, foram incluÃdos no estudo os quatro hospitais gerias da cidade, a coleta ocorreu no mÃs de maio de 2004 e foram alguns dados documentados fotograficamente. A anÃlise estatÃstica constatou no que se refere Ãs suas adjacentes aos hospitais a ausÃncia de faixas, para pedestres e de rebaixamento de meio fio em pontos estratÃgicos (25 %); obras pÃblicas e particulares desprotegidas de tapumes (100 %), avenidas livres de buracos (50 %); calÃadas que nÃo estÃo livres de buracos e desnivelamento (100 %), placas de sinalizaÃÃo de trÃnsito visÃveis (75 %); o percurso para a instituiÃÃo estÃ sinalizado (100 %); mas nÃo hÃ semÃforos em pontos estratÃgicos (100 %). Quanto ao acesso ao hospital, possuem rebaixamento de guias (50 %); ausÃncia do sÃmbolo internacional de acesso (100 %); hÃ rampas de acesso (100 %); escadaria sem corrimÃo (50 %); as portas possuem a largura ideal (100 %); as de vai e vem nÃo possuem visor (100 %). As caracterÃsticas internas dos hospitais mostram que as Ãreas de circulaÃÃo possuem obstÃculos (100 %), o piso das rampas Ã antiderrapante (50 %); as rampas e escadas possuem corrimÃo (50 %), mas fora do padrÃo legal. Um hospital tem apenas um pavimento os outros trÃs contam com 13 escadas internas com degraus ideais; os balcÃes atendem a legislaÃÃo (80 %) e assentos pÃblicos tambÃm (32 %). Os bebedouros sÃo acessÃveis, mas os telefones nÃo. Conclui-se que hÃ barreiras arquitetÃnicas no percurso casa/hospital, no acesso direto ao hospital e nas suas dependÃncias internas. A legislaÃÃo vigente que garante o acesso do portador de deficiÃncia fÃsica aos serviÃos de saÃde estÃ sendo desrespeitadas o que demonstra desconhecimento e descaso do serviÃo pÃblico, bem como, dos profissionais da saÃde que sÃo co-responsÃveis na garantia do exercÃcio da cidadania desta populaÃÃo. The search {{plan of the}} Nursing Department of the Federal University of CearÃ called: {{accessibility of}} physically and/or sensorial deficient people to health care: the object of physical conditions and communication study is to point out any architectonic obstacles making difficult or obstructing any physically deficient people (pdp) to access basic health cares and general hospitals and study the communication problems amongst such people and health caring team members. My participation in such a plan called my attention to such a theme and gave rise to this dissertation, the objects of which are to map the architectonic conditions for the physically deficient people to access any hospital cares {{in the city of}} Sobral-CE and point out any internal architectonic obstacles and also in the hospitals for the physical move of PDPs. The theoretical system of reference is based on Law No. 7, 853, dated 10 / 24 / 1989, which sets up rules to ensure the exercise of individual and social rights of physically deficient people and the effective social integration thereof. Such study is quantitative and used an instrument of data collection of check-list type made by consultation under law. Four general hospitals of the city were included in such study and data collections were performed in the month of May 2004. Some of them have been documented on photos The statistic analysis found out in connection with the areas around hospitals that there no crosswalks (100 %) and lowering of curb at strategic points (75 %); public and private works with no fence made of planks (100 %); pavements with holes and unlevellings (100 %); avenues with no holes (50 %); visible transit signs (75 %); the way going to the institution is signaled (100 %), but there are no traffic lights at strategic points (100 %). Concerning access to hospitals, there is no lowering of curbs (75 %); there is no parking area for PDPs signalized with the International Access Symbol (100 %); there is sloping roadway (100 %), flight of stairs with no handrail (50 %); doors are well sized (100 %); swing doors has no appropriate visors (100 %); the inner features of the hospitals show that the transit areas have obstacles (100 %); the pavement on the outer sloping roadways are <b>non</b> <b>skid.</b> (100 %); the inner sloping roadways and stairs have handrails available (50 %) but not in compliance wit the lawful standard. One of the hospitals has one floor but the other three ones have three inner stairs; counters are in accordance with legislation (80 %) and the public seats as well (33 %). Drinking places and telephones are not accessible (95. 5 %) It was concluded that there are architectonic obstacles in the way from house to hospital, in the direct access to hospital in the inner rooms thereof. The legislation in force assuring the physically deficient people to access the health care has not been complied with. This means that the public service has obviously not been aware of such legislation and has been negligent. The health caring professionals who are also responsible for assuring the citizenship of such portion of population to be exercised have been negligent as well...|$|E
