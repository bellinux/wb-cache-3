5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now {{participated in it}} for two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, and what he felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, <b>now</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among {{various members of the}} staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at least a decade, as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E

2500|$|Purdue's Golden Girl {{ranks among}} the nation's best twirlers and {{is at the top}} of her art form. This talented {{performer}} is selected by audition each April, and serves as a leader of the AAMB as well as an ambassador for Purdue University. Recognized nationally for her unique talents, this coveted position has roots going back to the early history of Purdue Bands. The tradition of the Golden Girl was begun in 1954 during the era of quarterback Len Dawson, whose poise on the field prompted the press to nickname him Purdue's [...] "Golden Boy." [...] At the same time, Dr. Al G. Wright (<b>now</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> Bands Emeritus) brought his first twirling protégé to the field, Juanita Carpenter, who earned the title of [...] "Golden Girl." [...] When Dawson graduated Purdue was left without a Golden Boy, but Carpenter's graduation didn't have the same effect on her title. Instead Golden Girl evolved into a movable crown that's been passed down through generations, and the position has become the standard for excellence within the twirling community.

2500|$|McKenzie was {{recommended}} for the Fisk presidency {{by his friend}} and colleague Thomas Jesse Jones, <b>now</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the Phelps-Stokes Fund and a Fisk trustee. McKenzie's background impressed the Fisk trustees and the General Education Board. He was the most prominent sociologist in the nation specializing in Native American affairs, {{a founder of the}} Society of American Indians, and had experience in community development and forging relationships with White constituencies to promote minority advancement. McKenzie's strong Christian character and commitment to student discipline fit nicely with Fisk's history and mission, as well as the strongly Christian orientation of Nashville and the South. In mid-February 1915, McKenzie and several Fisk trustees traveled to Tuskegee to visit with Booker T. Washington and obtain his approval for McKenzie's candidacy. After receiving Washington's blessing, McKenzie accepted the position the fourth President of Fisk University, and immediately began his work. [...] McKenzie knew that past Fisk Presidents were constantly [...] "in the line of fire" [...] and worked under a microscope in Nashville. Only two months prior, John Cutler Shedd withdrew his name from consideration for the Presidency after assessing the demands of the position. McKenzie also knew that would expose himself and his administration to severe criticism, especially from Blacks. Black Nashvillians demanded a Black President at Fisk, students chaffed with the strict code of conduct, and Fisk alumnus W.E.B. Du Bois was an outspoken critic of the administration. McKenzie was challenged [...] "to breast the criticism of the critical Negro, the critical Southern white, and the critical Northern white, looking to the day when the wisdom as well as success will justify this course." ...|$|E
