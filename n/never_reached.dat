5|$|Bowie had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} the Glass Spider Tour to Russia, albeit with the band only (no dancers or elaborate props), but with the money and extra stage provided by the sponsorship, Bowie felt he could take the full tour to Russia and South America.

5|$|On 28 December 1963, {{submarine}} activity 2.5km (1.5mi) to {{the northeast}} of Surtsey caused {{the formation of a}} ridge 100m (328ft) high on the sea floor. This seamount was named Surtla, but <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> sea level. Eruptions at Surtla ended on 6 January 1964, and it has since been eroded from its minimum depth of 23m (75ft) to 47m (154ft) below sea level.|$|E

His oldest brother Jacob died serving in the Spanish–American War; his other brothers Frank and John also played baseball, but <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> the major leagues. His older brother, Harry Coveleski, later won 20 games in a season on three occasions during his major league career.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E

Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling.|$|E

In the fourth episode of the serial he mentions that he <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, tying in with The Quatermass Memoirs later assertion of his wife's early death.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Krichell was {{involved}} in a minor scandal. Harry Nicolas was a high school baseball star in Long Island. The Yankees sent Krichell to scout him and offered him a contract with a blank check, being willing pay up to $20,000 for his services. As Nicolas was still in high school, the Yankees were fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball. Nicolas <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> the Majors. However, Krichell's recommendation of Casey Stengel for manager of the Yankees in 1948 was instrumental in their front office hiring him.|$|E

5|$|In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the Russians {{crossed the}} Commonwealth border {{four days later}} than in the south, on 22 May. Poland's ally, the Kingdom of Prussia, broke its {{alliance}} with Poland and the Prussian commander of the Lithuanian army, Duke Württemberg, betrayed the Polish-Lithuanian cause by refusing to fight the Russians.

5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor.

Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably <b>never</b> <b>reached</b> Pagan. They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably never got closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the film led to a proposed, but unrealized, American dramedy series that was in {{contention}} to air for the 2007–08 television season on Fox.
