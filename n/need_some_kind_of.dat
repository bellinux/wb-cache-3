Even petrol powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries.

2500|$|Two {{additional}} shortened versions {{were also}} used occasionally when episodes ran over the allotted time: the version used in a few episodes of season two cut half of the first stanza and the entire second, going directly to the first chorus following the verse, [...] "Sometimes you just get a feeling/Like you <b>need</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change...", reducing the length to 65 seconds, but the version used from season three onward used all but the second stanza, reducing the length to 48 seconds; the season four short version added a shorter harmonica portion near the end, which was absent in the season three short version. It has been a common misconception that the theme was reduced to the 48-second version from season three onward but that version was only used in syndicated reruns to allow stations added commercial time. The 72-second version was used for all episodes originally broadcast on ABC from seasons 3 to 8, with exceptions where ABC airings used the 48-second version when episodes ran over the allotted time. A shorter instrumental version of the theme, also composed by Frederick and Salvay, was also used as a closing theme in {{all but a few}} episodes (and was dropped entirely for season eight), which was rearranged in season three to sound nearly identical to the main theme, with another rearrangement for season five that saw it elongated from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.|$|E

ObjectiveEvaluate hearing aid use dispensed in a publicly-funded health service after one year, the interventions needed and users' satisfaction. MethodProspective observational cross-sectional study. Hearing aid users were invited by telephone to participate in an evaluation of hearing aid use. Results 200 hearing aid users attended the evaluation (47 % of sample loss); 76. 5 % of the subjects were using hearing aids bilaterally, 10. 5 % unilaterally and 13. 0 % none of them; 99. 5 % <b>of</b> users <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> intervention. Users who kept wearing their hearing aids were considered “satisfied”. ConclusionActive search by telephone showed that hearing aid users who attend this publicly-funded health service have difficulties to attend follow-up appointments. Most of the users that came for evaluation kept using their hearing aids; non-use rate was 13 %. Practically all hearing aid users <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> intervention. Despite the high level of satisfaction, those findings did not include users who did not participate in evaluation, which could represent subjects less adhered to the treatment.

Those who opt out of surgery also have faster recovery times and are able to return to work or sports sooner.
