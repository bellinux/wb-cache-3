30|$|We {{have been}} researching the method {{to enhance the}} {{targeting}} in breast tissue, named a preloading-based <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> method. The concept of the method is that before inserting the needle, the breast is pressed by the preloading probe to stabilize the tumor as the needle approaches. During the <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> phase, the <b>needle</b> direction does not change to avoid damaging internal tissues. Insertion is stopped when the tumor position and needle tip are closest. Thus, this method has a preloading phase and a <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> phase to locate the preloading probe and pierce the breast tissue. The preloading phase hardens the tissue between the target and the needle tip to stabilize the tumor and {{make it easier to}} pierce the tissue during the <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> phase.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of time on the clinical efficacy of topical anesthetic in reducing pain from <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> alone as well as injection of anesthetic. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-mouth, clinical trial which enrolled 90 subjects, equally divided into 3 groups based upon time (2, 5, or 10 minutes) of topical anesthetic (5 % lidocaine) application. Each group was further subdivided into 2 : <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> only in the palate or <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> with deposition of anesthetic (0. 5 mL 3 % mepivacaine plain). Each subject received drug on one side and placebo on the other. Subjects recorded pain on a 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS). The results showed that for <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> only, 5 % lidocaine reduced pain as determined by a significant difference in mean VAS after 2 minutes (20. 1 mm, P <. 002), 5 minutes (15. 7 mm, P <. 022), and 10 minutes (13. 7 mm, P <. 04), as analyzed by paired t tests. For <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> plus injection of local anesthetic, a significant difference in mean VAS was noted only after 10 minutes (14. 9 mm, P <. 031), yet pain scores for both topical anesthetic and placebo were elevated at this time point resulting in no reduction in actual pain. Time of application did not result in a significant difference in effect for either <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> only or <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> plus injection of local anesthetic, as analyzed by 1 -way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

40|$|Abstract—Minimally {{invasive}} {{medical procedures}} such as biopsies, anesthesia drug injections, and brachytherapy cancer treatments require inserting a needle {{to a specific}} target inside soft tissue. This is difficult because <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> displaces and deforms the surrounding soft tissue causing the target to move during the procedure. To facilitate physician training and pre-operative planning for these procedures, we develop a <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> motion planning system based on an interactive simulation of <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> in deformable tissue and numerical optimization to reduce placement error.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> through soft tissue, {{enabling the}} development and validation of force models and insertion techniques for accurate needle tip placement. During <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> into the prostate, the needle deflects {{en route to the}} target which leads to seed misplacement and suboptimal dose to cancerous cells. Many researchers have studied slow <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> speed and axial - <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> direction - force distribution and components. However, little work has been performed on stiffer needle material properties, tissue deformation with needle deflection, and normal - perpendicular to <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> direction - force distribution. This lack of knowledge have led to tissue deformation, needle deflection, and misplaced target when performing <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> procedures. 	This research aims to quantify the impact of an optimized <b>needle</b> grid, <b>insertion</b> techniques, and needle-tissue force interaction leading to needle deflection and phantom deformation. First, an improved grid used to guide the needle was investigated and inserted via different hand insertion techniques to acquire needle deflection. To measure needle deflection, a measurement apparatus with acceptable gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R) and documented accuracy was introduced. Next, stiffer needle properties were explored and inserted at much faster speed via a high-speed device, when compared to hand insertion or current robotic devices. Finally, finite element analysis (FEA) models were developed to predict relative needle-phantom motion using measured force data, while simultaneously obtaining experimental needle deflection and phantom deformation. The needle and phantom FEA models and the normal force distribution on the needle shaft were validated with separate experimental results. Findings from this dissertation include a 40 % decrease in average needle deflection with the improved grid (and the same fast hand insertion technique), in addition to a 60 % decrease in average needle deflection with the stiffer needle at the faster speed (compared to the less stiff needle and slow speed). Also, the needle and phantom FEA models are reasonably accurate to the experimental data, having a difference of 7 % and 18 %, respectively. These findings can be used to improve <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> techniques, while understanding force distribution effect on needle bending and compensate during the insertion path...|$|R

30|$|Preloading-based <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> {{with all}} concave probe diameters showed better {{placement}} accuracy than did normal <b>needle</b> <b>insertion.</b> This {{can be said}} under conditions of both short and long distances between the tumor and the initial insertion point. Our data from the in vivo experiment also suggests that pressing by the concave probe reduces needle placement error. The major reason to enhance <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> accuravy is same as the condition with convex shape probe [28] and described as follows: Many related works have stated that the main puncture event is designated by a peak force applied to the needle that is preceded by a steady rise followed by a sharp decrease [22],[23]. That is, when a needle punctures the breast, it does not immediately cut the tissue; instead, it first pushes the tissue and then punctures it. During this phase, tumor displacement is increased. The preloading method enhanced the <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> accuracy because the tumor displacement during <b>needle</b> <b>insertion</b> is decreasing. Our previous report also suggested that breast tissue with high strain displays nonlinear characteristics and higher stiffness parameters [28]. Pressing by the preloading probe results in high strain in the tissue surrounding the tumor. This spreads the tissue to not only stabilize it, but also to produce a rapid increase in stress near the needle. Puncture thus occurs with little tumor displacement. The concave probe is especially supposed to harden the tissue surrounding the tumor as discussed in this section later. The other potential advantage of concave shape stabilize the tumor {{at right angles to}} the direction of <b>needle</b> <b>insertion.</b> The futher investigation should be carried out about this issue while the advantage was partially supported by our previous result [27].|$|R
