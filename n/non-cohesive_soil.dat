The resultant Lake Moeris was able to store 13 billion cubic meters of flood water each year. This immense work of civil engineering was eventually finished by his son Amenmehat IV and brought prosperity to Fayum. The area became a breadbasket for the country and continued to be used until 230 BC when the Lahun branch of the Nile silted up.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the design}} concept {{based on the}} idea of {{limiting}} the settlement of footings by settlement-reducing piles is gaining more and more support, there have been very few experimental studies of the behaviour of piled footings in <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> The influences of the contact between the pile cap and the soil on the capacity and the load-settlement behaviour of a piled footing are considerable but this has not been well understood. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the overall interaction between the piles, the cap, and the soil in piled footings with friction piles in <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> The major part of the study consists of three extensive series of large-scale field model tests on single piles, free-standing pile groups, shallow footings and piled footings. The field tests were carried out in loose to dense sand, and with pile spacings of four, six and eight times the pile width. By performing the field model tests, the Author has tried to create a better understanding of the load-transfer mechanism and of the load-settlement behaviour of a piled footing in <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> The most important factors influencing the behaviour of piled footings have been investigated. The study shows that in cap-pile interaction, the increase in the pile shaft resistance is most important and more pronounced than the increase in the pile base resistance and the change in the cap capacity. It is also found that the load-settlement behaviour of the cap in a piled footing is very similar to that of a shallow footing with the same geometry under equal soil conditions. This remark is used as the basis for the proposed simplified methods of predicting settlement of a friction piled footing in <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> The results calculated using the proposed methods are in good agreement with the measured values. The reduction in settlement of a piled footing, in relation to a corresponding shallow footing, depends clearly on the relative cap capacity. With a high value of the relative cap capacity, i. e. when the capacity of the cap is predominant over that of the piles, the contribution of the piles has a clear effect in reducing the settlement of the footing...|$|E

The research is focused on the design, fabrication and analysis of a new screw nail and its interaction mechanisms between the soil and nail in two cohesive and <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> materials that are compacted in a suitably fabricated large box. The interaction behaviour of the nail was investigated by a series of fully instrumented pullout tests that were carried under different surcharge load conditions and the observed behaviours were compared with the results of pullout tests by various other investigators. Numerical modelling was also carried out in an attempt to investigate and understand the performance and the shear mechanism of the screw nail under different boundary conditions. For this purpose, a full three-dimensional finite element computer program was used to study the soil and nail displacements associated with the axial loading. Comprehensive laboratory soil tests were carried out prior and after the pullout tests to fully characterise the soils conditions. The box was instrumented with load cells and LVDTs and strain gauges were adhered to the screw nail. For the <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soil,</b> thin vertical sand bands were cast to analyse the soil deformation patterns after the completion of the pullout tests.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how temperature {{measurements of the}} water filtered by earthfill dams {{can be used to}} determine the soil filtration ratio and to monitor the condition of earthfill dams. The ground water temperature change is caused by the processes of heat conductivity and convection. The analysis of heat transfer within earthfill dams demonstrates that the speed of thermal waves varies between (4 - 6) 10 - 7 m/s. Therefore, whenever the water filtration ratio is under 4 ∙ 10 - 7 m/s, propagation of thermal waves is driven by the heat conductivity. If the soil filtration ratio is below 2 ∙ 10 - 5 m/s, thermal waves are caused by forced convection (the filtration flow). Temperature measurements of the water filtered by earthfill dams composed of <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> make it possible to calculate averaged soil filtration ratios with an error under 20 - 40 %.

Thus plastic limit of the soils were determined by following rolling device, Casagrande method and cone penetrometer method.

The first tools to design earth dams to resist piping were developed during 1910 – 1935. Filter criteria for dispersive soils was refined in the 1970 ’s. Piping phenomena are generally defined as: (1) heave, (2) internal erosion, (3) backwards erosion, although other modes are possible. Recent work on piping highlights the limitations of the occurrence of piping and the role that design and construction may play in a large percentage of piping failures. Standardized laboratory procedures are available to assess piping potential in cohesive materials, but no such methods exist for <b>non-cohesive</b> <b>soils.</b> However, methods are available for evalu-ation of self-filtration potential. Recent advances in com-puter technology have facilitated the evaluation of seepage and deformation in embankments but computational methods for evaluation of piping potential are currently limited...|$|R
