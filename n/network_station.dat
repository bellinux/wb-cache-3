2500|$|During the station's {{first decade}} with CBS, newscasts were added and dropped from KTVT's schedule. Channel 11 would first expand news {{programming}} with {{the debut of}} half-hour weekday newscasts at noon and 5:00p.m. in February 1996. In January 1999, it added a 6:30p.m. newscast on weeknights {{as a replacement for}} Hard Copy (which had been airing on KTVT since September 1997, when the program moved to the station from KDFW); the newscast was later replaced in September 2000 by Hollywood Squares (which had previously aired on WFAA from the revival series' September 1998 premiere until June 2000). Concurrent with the discontinuance of Hard Copy following its cancellation, the station debuted an hour-long 4:00p.m. newscast on September 11 of that year; after the program's initial cancellation in September 2002, KTVT restored that newscast in January 2004 (later reducing it to a half-hour broadcast in September 2005, before expanding it to an hour once more on January 11, 2010).
