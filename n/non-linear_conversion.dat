40|$|Abstract- Two of {{the most}} {{important}} static transducer characteristics, in any measurement system, are linearity and accuracy. In the present paper, the calibration and linearization of a low-cost orifice flow meter is considered. Accuracy improvement is based on calibration coefficients that are evaluated with the measurements obtained from a reference flow meter. Linearity improvement is based on a <b>non-linear</b> A/D <b>conversion</b> whose transfer characteristic is the inverse of the transducer’s characteristic. The linearity can be strongly improved using a <b>non-linear</b> A/D <b>conversion</b> performed by a low-cost ADC, using only single-bit input and output ports. The proposed method, already described by the authors in previous papers, is applied to an orifice-based flow meter, simplifying the typical conditioning circuit that requires an additional square root extractor circuit.

40|$|Guidelines for {{exposure}} to radiofrequency fields are {{based largely on}} thermal effects of these fields. However, controversy remains over the possibility of adverse health effects from exposure to low level fields such as those {{associated with the use}} of mobile phones. A plausible mechanism considers the demodulation of amplitude modulated RF fields by biological systems: if this were to operate, they would be exposed to low frequency fields similar to those of biological processes, and therefore with the potential for biological activity. This study performed the experiment originally proposed by Balzano [2002] to test whether biological cells exhibit the nonlinear responses necessary for demodulation. This would be indicated by the generation of a second-harmonic signal upon exposure of the sample to a pure fundamental signal at around 883 MHz. The experiment used a highly sensitive system employing a doubly-resonant cavity. Storage of the high-frequency energy in the highly-resonant cavity with very low noise amplification and the avoidance of any electrode contact with the samples allowed the experiments to approach the ultimate limits of physical sensitivity. Using a wide range of biological materials, the study was not able to demonstrate <b>non-linear</b> <b>conversion</b> of RF energy by biological materials.

The study {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a novel method for incorporating hypoxia information from PET-CT imaging into treatment planning and estimates the efficiency of various optimization approaches. Its focuses on the feasibility of optimizing treatment plans based on the <b>non-linear</b> <b>conversion</b> of PET hypoxia images into radiosensitivity maps from the uptake properties of the tracers used. Material and methods. PET hypoxia images of seven head-and-neck cancer patients were used to determine optimal dose distributions needed to counteract the radiation resistance associated with tumor hypoxia assuming various scenarios regarding the evolution of the hypoxic compartment during the treatment. A research planning system for advanced studies has been used to optimize IMRT plans based on hypoxia information from patient PET images. These resulting plans were compared in terms of target coverage for the same fulfilled constraints regarding the organs at risk. Results. The results of a planning study indicated the clinical feasibility of the proposed method for treatment planning based on PET hypoxia. Antihypoxic strategies would lead to small improvements in all the patients, but higher effects are expected for the fraction of patients with hypoxic tumors. For these, individualization of the treatment based on hypoxia PET imaging could lead to improved treatment outcome while creating the premises for limiting the irradiation of the surrounding normal tissues. Conclusions. The proposed approach offers the possibility of improved treatment results as it takes into consideration the heterogeneity and the dynamics of the hypoxic regions. It also provides early identification of the clinical cases that might benefit from dose escalation as well as the cases that could benefit from other counter-hypoxic measures. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnA {{frequency}} synthesizer is a control system which employs a reference signal from a component, {{such as a}} crystal oscillator, with excellent phase and frequency stability to synthesize higher frequencies with similarly desirable characteristics. Such a control system {{is at the heart}} of many communication schemes. Due to the digital circuitry used in frequency synthesis, it is relatively straightforward to synthesize frequencies at integer multiples of the reference signal frequency. A synthesizer which achieves this is called an integer-N {{frequency synthesizer}}. The main challenge in the design of integer-N synthesizers is to reduce phase noise introduced by circuitry while achieving a needed frequency resolution. Noise can be spectrally spread by conversions in the loop which are non-linear, so the strategy to reduce noise is two-fold. Control-loop and circuit design techniques can be used to reduce device noise, but it is also important to make sure that the noise performance is not degraded by spectral spreading within the loop. This thesis addresses primarily the latter approach with the design and implementation of circuits targeting a specific conversion within the loop. Frequency resolution of a synthesizer can be improved by introducing additional circuitry and complexity. This additional complexity makes it possible to multiply the reference frequency by a fractional number and thus achieve higher frequency resolution. A control system which achieves this is called a fractional-N frequency synthesizer. The cost associated with the increased frequency resolution is a form of noise that is deterministic called spurious noise. This spurious noise can also be spread and amplified by <b>non-linear</b> <b>conversions</b> in the control loop. A quantitative understanding of the magnitude of this noise that is not readily available in the literature was developed in this research. A comparison between several implementations of integrated frequency synthesis was also carried out in this research with the intent of providing guidelines to produce a better performing synthesizer. These implementations differ in key components of the loop where linearity is of particular importance...|$|R
40|$|Attosecond pulses are {{sought for}} {{experiments}} enlightening intra-atomic and intermolecular phenomena in attosecond or femtosecond time scale. These pulses {{can only be}} obtained via high-harmonics generation in gases with the current technology. The cut-off energy of the harmonics increases non-linearly with the wavelength of the driving laser, whereas the conversion efficiency sinks drastically. Here, we will present the first developments of a laser driver system for high-harmonics generation applications, capable of answering these challenges via a broadband spectrum covering several octaves with high energy. Attosecond science highly depends on the electric field of the driving laser and is very sensitive to the carrier-envelope phase stability. As the phenomena occur past a certain threshold of the electric field, single-cycle pulses are best adapted. The spectrum of these pulses, a few femtosecond long in time, covers several hundreds of nanometers. Pulse compression in a highly non-linear fiber achieves few femtosecond long pulses at a 100 ´s µJ energy level, but is not scalable to broader spectra and higher energies. A broader spectral coverage is obtained via <b>non-linear</b> <b>conversion</b> of a hundred nanometers to one octave initial broad spectrum. Due to the limitations in energy {{of this kind of}} conversion, the resulting pulses, with energies lower than the µJ level, have to be amplified afterwards with optical parametric amplifiers. We will use a waveform synthesizer based on parallel amplification: a broadband, low energy pulse generated via passively CEP stable white-light generation will be split spectrally into several channels and amplified separately to higher energies via parametric amplification. The CEP-stable white-light is driven by a sub-picosecond Yb:KYW regenerative amplifier delivering > 5 mJ energy. The parametric amplification will be divided in several stages, the first ones being pumped with the remaining energy from the regenerative amplifier and the last ones with the output of a cryogenically cooled Yb:YAG composite thin-disc amplifier.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{requirements of}} the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyAccent conversion intends to change the accent of a speaker to a desired accent and preserve the speaker’s voice identity. This technology can offer a number of useful applications. For example, integrating accent conversion to a text-to-speech system (TTS) can produce a voice with a desired accent instantly and inexpensively. Applying the technology to the film industry can change an actor’s or actress’s accent to a desired accent without hard training for the actor or actress {{to learn a new}} accent; this can be achieved by modifying the accent of the film recordings. As a foreign language learning tool, it could allow the learners to listen to their own voice with the native speaker’s accent and to mimic that accent. Hence, enhance learning experience and improve learning progress. In this dissertation, a new approach in both accent analysis and conversion has been proposed. In contrast to previous approaches in accent-related research, such as in regional or foreign accent classification and identification, where the databases are formed from large groups of single-accent speakers, this study uses data from an individual who can speak in two accents. This removes the effects of inter-speaker variability and facilitates efficient identification and analysis of acoustic features of different accents. Two British regional accents which display distinct differences to the human listener were used in this study as two typical British regional accents. Vowel based acoustic analysis was carried out to investigate the acoustic characteristics of the two accents and identify the prominent features that are most influential on the variability of accents. Acoustic characteristics such as formant frequencies, fundamental frequency and its variation slope, intensity of speech, and duration of phone were used for accent acoustic analysis. In this dissertation, accent conversion via formants modification and pitch contour manipulation was investigated. Three different formant-based spectral mappingalgorithms, mean-variance linear conversion, Nth order <b>non-linear</b> <b>conversion</b> and piece-wise linear transformation based on Gaussian mixture model conversion were investigated.

40|$|Background. COSMIC Function Points and {{traditional}} Function Points (i. e., IFPUG Function points and more recent variation of Function Points, such as NESMA and FISMA) {{are probably the}} best known and most widely used Functional Size Measurement methods. The {{relationship between the two}} kinds of Function Points still needs to be investigated. If traditional Function Points could be accurately converted into COSMIC Function Points and vice versa, then, by measuring one kind of Function Points, one would be able to obtain the other kind of Function Points, and one might measure one or the other kind interchangeably. Several studies have been performed to evaluate whether a correlation or a conversion function between the two measures exists. Specifically, {{it has been suggested that}} the relationship between traditional Function Points and COSMIC Function Points may not be linear, i. e., the value of COSMIC Function Points seems to increase more than proportionally to an increase of traditional Function Points. Objective. This paper aims at verifying this hypothesis using available datasets that collect both FP and CFP size measures. Method. Rigorous statistical analysis techniques are used, specifically Piecewise Linear Regression, whose applicability conditions are systematically checked. The Piecewise Linear Regression curve is a series of interconnected segments. In this paper, we focused on Piecewise Linear Regression curves composed of two segments. We also used Linear and Parabolic Regressions, to check if and to what extent Piecewise Linear Regression may provide an advantage over other regression techniques. We used two categories of regression techniques: Ordinary Least Squares regression is based on the usual minimization of the sum of squares of the residuals, or, equivalently, on the minimization of the average squared residual; Least Median of Squares regression is a robust regression technique that is based on the minimization of the median squared residual. Using a robust regression technique helps filter out the excessive influence of outliers. Results. It appears that the analysis of the relationship between traditional Function Points and COSMIC Function Points based on the aforementioned data analysis techniques yields valid significant models. However, different results for the various available datasets are achieved. In practice, we obtained statistically valid linear, piecewise linear, and <b>non-linear</b> <b>conversion</b> formulas for several datasets. In general, none of these is better than the others in a statistically significant manner. Conclusions. Practitioners interested in the conversion of FP measures into CFP (or vice versa) cannot just pick a conversion model and be sure that it will yield the best results. All the regression models we tested provide good results with some datasets. In practice, all the models described in the paper –in particular, both linear and non-linear ones– should be evaluated in order to identify the ones that are best suited for the specific dataset at hand...|$|E
40|$|High {{electro-optic}} {{figure of}} merit n 03 r 41 {{and the absence of}} natural birefringence make semi-insulating gallium arsenide (GaAs) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) attractive materials for the fabrication of electro-optical devices. In this context we characterized both acoustic and optical phonon contributions to the electro-optic coefficient of CdTe and GaAs. Accurate measurements of n 03 r 41 as a function of modulation frequency and temperature were carried out on CdTe:In and GaAs crystal at 1. 5 μm. For CdTe, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first time that a contribution to the electro-optic coefficient due to optical phonons has been determined. A positive value for the ionic contribution, due to optical phonons in GaAs, is obtained, in disagreement with that previously inferred from Raman scattering efficiency measurements. The pure electronic contribution was then isolated, and the second-order non-linear optical coefficient was derived. The latter was compared to previously reported data from <b>non-linear</b> wavelength <b>conversion</b> measurements...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1966 copper vapour lasers (CVLs) {{have developed}} into a mature technology with applications including high-speed imaging, micro-machining, <b>non-linear</b> frequency <b>conversion</b> to the ultraviolet, and pumping of solid-state laser materials. However, the performance characteristics of conventional CVLs are fundamentally limited by kinetic processes at play within the gain medium and hence, these devices largely failed {{to keep pace with}} advances in visible solid state lasers during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. In 1996 a new subclass of CVL, termed a kinetically enhanced or KE-CVL, was developed that used a ternary gas mixture (HCl–H₂–Ne) to tailor the kinetic processes that limit laser performance. These devices offer dramatic improvements in power (both average and high beam quality) and repetition rate scalability. Indeed, 100 W of visible, high beam quality power is now readily available from relatively small copper laser systems. In this paper the underlying principles and performance characteristics of KE-CVLs will be reviewed. 32 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} highly stable bow-tie power {{enhancement}} cavity for critical second-harmonic generation into the UV using a Brewster-cut β-BaB_ 2 O_ 4 (BBO) nonlinear crystal. The cavity geometry {{is suitable for}} all UV wavelengths reachable with BBO and can be modified to accommodate anti-reflection coated crystals, extending its applicability to the entire wavelength range accessible with <b>non-linear</b> frequency <b>conversion.</b> The cavity is length-stabilized using a fast general purpose digital PI controller based on the open source STEMlab 125 - 14 (formerly Red Pitaya) system acting on a mirror mounted on a fast piezo actuator. We observe 130 h uninterrupted operation without decay in output power at 313 nm. The robustness of the system has been confirmed by exposing it to accelerations of up to 1 g with less than 10 % in-lock output power variations. Furthermore, the cavity can withstand 30 minutes of acceleration exposure {{at a level of}} 3 g_rms without substantial change in SHG output power, demonstrating that the design is suitable for transportable setups...|$|R
