Lifecycle cost includes anything that pertains to the building from when it is in its schematic design phase until it is demolished. A chart of the cost distribution is shown in figure 2.

Another {{translation of}} the valedictory is found in [...] "Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States" [...] which contains corresponding letters between James Burrill Angell and James B. Blaine. Angell's first letter about Ci'an was written three days after her death and received on 23 June 1881:"Sir: I have to announce that on the 8th instant, at 6PM, the Empress Dowager, {{commonly known as the}} Empress of the East Palace, in distinction from the Empress Dowager of the West Palace, died after an illness of only two days. The legations have, {{at the time of this}} writing, received no official announcement of the event. But the Peking Gazette contains two imperial rescripts concerning her death. As the mail leaves at once I cannot now inclose {{translation of the}}m.The deceased Empress is the widow of the Emperor Hsien-Fung, who reigned from 1850 to 1861. Having lost his wife just as he ascended the throne, he married the lady just deceased. She bore him no son. In 1856 one of his concubines or second wives bore him a son, who succeeded him as the Emperor Tung-Chih in 1861. At the death of Hsien-Fung, his wife, the woman who just died, was, of course, the Empress Dowager. But by decree of the new Emperor, Tung-Chih, his mother was also raised to the honor of Empress Dowager. So there have been two Empresses Dowager since 1861. The present Emperor, Kwang-Hsü, who came to the throne in 1874, is the cousin of Tung-Chih and nephew of the surviving Empress Dowager. The two Empresses, it is thought, have played a considerable part in the conduct of affairs. The deceased Empress has been reputed to be of a pacific spirit, and friendly to Prince Kung. The surviving Empress has been thought to take a more active part in shaping the policy of the empire. She has been so ill for months that her death has been daily expected, and several times reported in the streets. But the Empress of the East Palace has not been ill, until she was seized last week with her fatal disease. I think she was about forty-five years of age. It is feared that her sudden death may have an unfavorable and possibly fatal effect on the surviving Empress in her condition of weakness.It is impossible to say yet whether the death of the Empress of the East Palace will lead to any important political results. Should the other Empress also die, it is extremely possible that important consequences would follow, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>predict</b> what they would be.

For thousands of years people have wondered, speculated, and argued about the origin of the universe without actually knowing anything about it. In the closing years of the twentieth century, we're learning enough to begin to peer across the gulf that separates our universe from its source at the beginning of-or perhaps before-the Big Bang.

He made choices from the options available to him and suffered the consequences as they developed. But his history underscores the fact that slavery generated a corresponding social system that was unforgiving to the individual caught in its contradictory currents. As Michael P. Johnson and James L. Roark suggest in Black Masters, their sensitive study of another slave owner and ex-slave, William Ellison of South Carolina, a purely personal solution to such volatile social relations proved impossible. What bound William Johnson to Mississippi, what inner torment in search of resolution drove him to a relentless acquisitiveness, how he understood his identification with the dominant racial group that kept him at a far distance and would have kept him enslaved but for chance—the diary provides us only with silence on these and similar tensions. What we do know, especially from the survivors of more modern collective acts of evil, is that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> individual <b>can</b> <b>predict</b> precisely how he or she might react to so unforgiving a system.

Pandemic prevention strategies must be based on preparing for the unexpected and being capable of reacting accordingly. There is growing evidence that infection control measures were helpful in containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as avian influenza. Compliance of standard infection control measures, intensive promotion of hand and respiratory hygiene, vigilance and triage of patients with febrile illness, and specific infection control measures are key components to contain a highly contagious disease in hospital and to protect healthcare workers, patients and visitors. The importance of standard precautions for any patient and cleaning and disinfection for the healthcare environment cannot be overemphasized. SARS illustrated dramatically the potential of air travel and globalization for the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease. To prevent the potential serious consequences of pandemic influenza, timely implementation of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions locally within the outbreak area is the key to minimizing global spread.

40|$|It is a truism {{that future}} prices {{of energy for}} {{transportation}} {{will be determined by}} the forces of supply and demand. For transport fuels, these forces have entered a crucial phase that is likely to persist for several decades. Oil production from conventional resources outside of the OPEC countries will peak within a few years. Unconventional fossil resources that can be exploited at current prices, resources whose early development is already well underway, pose an even greater threat to the global climate. To bring these resources to the market at a rate to match the growth in demand for mobility fuels in the developed and developing economies will require massive, risky investments. Serious risks are posed by the environmental acceptability of these fuels and also by the fact that a sudden downturn in world oil prices would turn them into stranded assets. It is also a truism that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> accurately <b>predict</b> the price of oil. Today, oil costs $ 70 per barrel. Ten years ago, it cost less than $ 20 per barrel. Twenty seven years ago oil prices peaked at $ 90 per barrel. Thirty-seven years ago oil cost only $ 10 per barrel and its price had been relatively stable for almost fifty years. Those who carefully craft future oil price scenarios know that they are not predicting but rather attempting to define alternative paths of central tendency. Even the best official oil price projections look nothing like the past thirty-five years of history. It is important to understand why this is so. Since 1972, world oil prices have been strongly and unpredictably influenced by the actions of the OPEC cartel. It is very likely that they will be for the next thirty years, as well. ...|$|R

It must be said that Mr. Jenks has succeeded admirably in his purpose, and has made a book which ought to be of great value to the public. It is written in an attractive style; the presentation, though full enough and accurate, is not technical; and the subjects to be emphasized are so well selected that the account is clear and easily retained. The understanding of the various institutions and their operation is made easier by brief historical accounts of their origin and development, going often to remote beginnings, which explain how their especially important features came to be what they are. The book begins with an account of the king 2 ̆ 7 s position and of the limited monarchy. Then the position in the Empire of the Dominions and other colonies and possessions is described. There follow chapters on the Cabinet, Parliament, the army and navy, and the Treasury and the other Departments. Particularly interesting to Americans should be the last four chapters dealing with institutions which are essentially the same as ours but rather differently organized: the courts of justice, the established churches, and the two last on local government, allusions to which are often a puzzle to us.

40|$|Nixtamalized (alkaline cooked) corn (Zea mays L.) {{products}} are increasing in popularity {{due to their}} affordable cost, ease of production, and the diversity of products {{that can be made}} using similar unit operations. The nixtamal produced after alkaline cooking depends on the processing parameters used during cooking and steeping, as well as the physicochemical properties of the corn hybrids used. Processors incur high costs in narrowing down hybrids suitable for a given process, or they must be able to adjust cooking conditions to obtain the desired end-product characteristics. Improper processing generates large quantities of waste. Researchers have developed small scale cooking procedures that can mimic industrial nixtamalization process. Many of these methods, however, still require significant quantities of grain, such that the screening processes are expensive. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} develop a small scale bench top method with 100 g corn, using simple apparatus that can be used to analyze multiple samples at a time. The method was compared to a previously established 500 g method using a range of commercially used cook times, steep times and cook temperatures. Previous studies on relating physico-chemical parameters and nixtamal characteristics have concluded that it is essential to cook corn, at least in small quantities, to understand how corn will process when nixtamalized. The results indicate that the 100 g method can replicate industrial cooking process at a range of processing conditions as the intercept and slopes for response surface models were not significantly different (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The second aim of this study was to understand the effect of physicochemical properties of nine different hybrids, grown in the same season on nixtamal characteristics using the 100 g cooking method. The study found regressions for dry matter loss with thousand kernel weight and kernel calcium content (r 2 = 0. 98) and for nixtamal moisture with test weight (r 2 = 0. 52) when corn was cooked for 25 min and steeped for 12 h. Consistent with previous studies, this study found that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> grain parameter <b>can</b> <b>predict</b> all nixtamalized corn properties, confirming the need to cook corn to best understand its potential alkaline cooking performance.
