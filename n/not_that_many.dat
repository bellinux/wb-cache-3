25|$|The Jain {{religion}} {{places a}} great deal of emphasis on purity of conduct and the ability of the soul to attain liberation through the highest level of meditation. However, there are <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> books on meditation written by the Jains. This automatically places this text in an exclusive category, along with Jinabhadra Gani's Dhyanashataka, Pujyapada's Samadhitantra, Haribhadra's Yogabindu and Yogadrshtisamuccaya, Jinasena's Adipurana, Amitagati's Yogasara Prabhrta and Shravakacara, Gunabhadra's Atmanushasana and Hemacandra's Yogashastra. There is an uncanny resemblance between this text and Hemacandra's ‘Yogashastra’. Clearly, one has influenced the other. Since Shubhacandra precedes Hemacandra, it is likely that Hemacandra is influenced by Shubhacandra.|$|E

The researchers used Russian-built mini-subs. William N.

[...] The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.|$|E

This is more support than we’ve ever given an artist in the U.S., let alone all over the world. We love the association with Britney; she has always been a core part of this channel and our fans love Britney".|$|E

500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> people writing in 1965, so you had the feeling that you had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{music and}} choreography have {{inspired}} numerous performers. Virgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed: [...] "Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She's {{one of those}} gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, {{that people want to}} believe in... there's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> superstars that stand the test of time." [...] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald remarked: [...] "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child." [...] Music critic Gene Stout commented she [...] "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." [...] 'N Sync and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance. Kesha, Beyoncé, Toni Braxton, Aaliyah, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Crystal Kay, Kelly Rowland, Rihanna, and Brazilian singer Kelly Key have all named her an inspiration, while others such as Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas of TLC, Cassie, Nicki Minaj, Keri Hilson, and DJ/singer Havana Brown, have all expressed desire to emulate her. Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: [...] "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style." [...] Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated [...] "scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson" [...] who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as [...] "Janet-come-lately's." [...] Other artists who have drawn comparison to her include Mýa, Brandy, Tatyana Ali, Christina Milian, Lady Gaga, Namie Amuro, and BoA. Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that [...] "s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyoncé emerges as her likely successor." [...] Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: [...] "Jackson's Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyoncé live in the house that Janet built." ...|$|E

They then won the doubles {{tournament at}} the 2016 Australian Open, {{defeating}} Andrea Hlaváčková and Lucie Hradecká in the final, for their third consecutive Grand Slam title. Afterwards, Hingis said of their partnership: [...] "There's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{people who can}} match her in the forehand rallies and me on the backhand side and at the net.

[...] Even though <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> people were forced to serve {{until the end of}} the war, the decision made by Mackenzie King to allow conscription was very unpopular in Québec. [...] Opposition Leader Maurice Duplessis, whose criticism of the federal encroachments to the constitutional autonomy of the provinces capitalized on the population’s mistrust of the federal government, had a field day.|$|E

Writing in 1992 in the Daily Telegraph, 47 years after his father wrote his melancholy novel prophesying the decline of country house life, Auberon Waugh felt confident enough of {{the survival of the}} country house as a domestic residence to declare: [...] "I would be surprised if there is any greater happiness than that provided by a game of croquet played on an English lawn through a summer's afternoon, after a good luncheon and with the prospect of a good dinner ahead.
