40|$|Fission-product {{technetium}} accumulated during {{treatment of}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} will ultimately be disposed of in a geological repository. The exact form of Tc for disposal {{has yet to be}} determined; however, a reasonable solution is to incorporate elemental Tc into a metallic waste form similar to the waste form produced during the pyrochemical treatment of spent, sodium-bonded fuel. This <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form, produced at the Idaho National Laboratory, has undergone extensive qualification examination and testing for acceptance to the Yucca Mountain geological repository. It is from this extensive qualification effort that the behavior of Tc and other fission products in the waste form has been elucidated, and that the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form is extremely robust in the retention of fission products, such as Tc, in repository like conditions. This manuscript will describe the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form, the behavior of Tc in the waste form; and current research aimed at determining the maximum possible loading of Tc into the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> and subsequent determination of the performance of high Tc loaded <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> forms...|$|R
40|$|Waste form alloys {{are being}} {{developed}} at Argonne National Laboratory for the disposal of remnant metallic wastes from an electrometallurgical process developed to treat spent nuclear fuel. This <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form consists of the fuel cladding (stainless steel or Zircaloy), noble metal fission products (e. g., Ru, Pd, Mo and Tc), and other metallic wastes. The main constituents of the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> stream are the cladding hulls (85 to 90 wt%); using the hulls as the dominant alloying component minimizes the overall waste volume as compared to vitrification or metal encapsulation. Two nominal compositions for the waste form {{are being developed}}: (1) stainless steel- 15 wt% zirconium for stainless steel-clad fuels and (2) zirconium- 8 wt% stainless steel for Zircaloy-clad fuels. The noble metal fission products are {{the primary source of}} radiation in the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form. However, inclusion of actinides in the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form is being investigated as an option for interim or ultimate storage.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how to estimate the ecological costs form <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> based on life cycle assessment (LCA) environmental impacts generated from the management of the construction waste. Design/methodology/approach – LCA methodology and eco-indicators 95 were used to calculate the impact from <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> based on three waste management strategies. Findings – The results of this study establish that the ecological impact from <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> management is mainly due to the burning of diesel from machinery during the dismantling processes and the use of vehicles for transportation. The results proposed equations and curves for estimating the ecological cost from <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> based on waste management strategies. Research limitations/implications – The research could affect members of the engineering and construction industry, since it provides methods for costing the ecological impact from construction waste. The eco-costs will assist in implementing sustainable strategies that help to reduce the amount of waste generated by the construction industry. Originality/value – This paper presents an exploratory study to conceptualise eco-costing issues in relation to waste from construction activities in the UK construction industry...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} pyrometallurgical {{treatment}} of used Experimental Breeder Reactor-II fuel, a <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> stream is generated consisting primarily of cladding hulls laden with fission products noble to the electrorefining process. Consolidation by melting at high temperature [1873 K (1600 degrees C) ] has been developed to sequester the noble metal fission products (Zr, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Te, and Pd) which remain in the iron-based cladding hulls. Zirconium from the uranium fuel alloy (U- 10 Zr) is also deposited on the hulls and forms Fe-Zr intermetallics which incorporate the noble metals as well as residual actinides during processing. Hence, Zr has been chosen as the primary indicator for consistency of the <b>metal</b> <b>waste.</b> Recently, the first production-scale <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> ingot was generated and sampled to monitor Zr content for Fe-Zr intermetallic phase formation and validation of processing conditions. Chemical assay of the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> ingot revealed a homogeneous distribution of the noble metal fission products {{as well as the}} primary fuel constituents U and Zr.

40|$|Foamed {{lightweight}} materials made from mixed scrap <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> powder and sewage sludge ash The porous properties and pozzolanic effects {{of sewage sludge}} ash (SSA) {{make it possible to}} produce {{lightweight materials}}. This study explored the effects of different metallic foaming agents, made from waste aluminium products, on the foam-ing behaviours and engineering characteristics, as well as the microstructure of sewage sludge ash foamed lightweight mate-rials. The results indicated that aluminium powder and mixed scrap <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> powder possessed similar chemical compo-sitions. After proper pre-treatment, waste aluminium products proved to be ideal substitutes for metallic foaming agents. Increasing the amount of mixed scrap <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> by 10 – 15 % compared with aluminium powder would produce a similar foaming ratio and compressive strength. The reaction of the metallic foaming agents mainly produced pores larger than 10 µm, different from the hydration reaction of cement that pro-duced pores smaller than 1 µm mostly. To meet the require-ments of the lightweight materials characteristics and the compressive strength, the amount of SSA could be up to 60 – 80 % of the total solids. An adequate amount of aluminium powder is 0. 5 – 0. 9 % of the total solids. Increasing the fineness of the mixed scrap <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> powder could effectively reduce the amount required and improve the foaming ratio...|$|R

40|$|The pyroprocessing of spent {{nuclear fuel}} results in two {{high-level}} waste streams [...] ceramic and <b>metal</b> <b>waste.</b> Ceramic <b>waste</b> contains active <b>metal</b> fission product-loaded salt from the electrorefining, while the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> contains cladding hulls and undissolved noble metals. While pyroprocessing was successfully demonstrated for treatment of spent fuel from Experimental Breeder Reactor-II in 1999, it was done so without a specific objective to minimize high-level waste generation. The ceramic waste process uses “throw-away” technology that is not optimized with respect to volume of waste generated. In looking past treatment of EBR-II fuel, {{it is critical to}} minimize waste generation for technology developed under the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). While the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> cannot be readily reduced, there are viable routes towards minimizing the ceramic waste. Fission products that generate high amounts of heat, such as Cs and Sr, can be separated from other active metal fission products and placed into short-term, shallow disposal. The remaining active metal fission products can be concentrated into the ceramic waste form using an ion exchange process. It has been estimated that ion exchange can reduce ceramic high-level waste quantities by as much as a factor of 3 relative to throw-away technology...|$|R
40|$|Increased volumes and {{varieties}} of toxic heavy <b>metal</b> <b>wastes</b> {{from a number}} of industries, coupled with higher emission standards and dwindling waste repositories, have necessitated the introduction of greatly improved technology for the safe and effective handling of heavy <b>metal</b> laden <b>wastes.</b> Present and future requirements of toxic metal source reduction technology are best summarized by terms llConcentrate and Contain"; concentrate, meaning improved efficiency of metal recovery and contain, meaning production of a <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form in which toxic metals can either be recovered and reused or transformed to a stable state. This paper describes a new technology-the DeVoe-Holbein Technology,-which provides highly efficient and effective means of closed-loop source reduction of aqueous heavy <b>metal</b> <b>wastes</b> from both nuclear and non-nuclear industries. The DeVoe-Holbein technology consists of a novel series, of synthetic compositions and various processes for their use. The compositions are highly efficient at metal recovery (typically achieving 99. 99 % source reduction) are selective for individual or groups of metals, allow high flow throughputs, are mechanically and chemically robust and stable and are completely regenerable with small volumes of regenerant. Case studies are presented to illustrate how this new technology {{can be applied to the}} closed-loop recovery of mercury, chromium and radioactive fission products such as cesium and strontium. In addition, examples are shown to illustrate the effective recovery of <b>metal</b> finishing <b>wastes</b> such as cadmium, zinc, copper, cobalt, nickel and lead...|$|R
40|$|An electrometallurgical {{treatment}} {{process has}} been developed by Argonne National Laboratory to convert various types of spent nuclear fuels into stable storage forms and waste forms for repository disposal. The first application of this process will be to treat spent fuel alloys from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II. Three distinct product streams emanate from the electrorefining process: (1) refined uranium; (2) fission products and actinides extracted from the electrolyte salt that are processed into a mineral waste form; and (3) metallic wastes left behind {{at the completion of}} the electrorefining step. The third product stream (i. e., the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> stream) {{is the subject of this}} paper. The <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> stream contains components of the chopped spent fuel that are unaffected by the electrorefining process because of their electrochemically ``noble`` nature; this includes the cladding hulls, noble metal fission products (NMFP), and, in specific cases, zirconium from metal fuel alloys. The selected method for the consolidation and stabilization of the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> stream is melting and casting into a uniform, corrosion-resistant alloy. The waste form casting process will be carried out in a controlled-atmosphere furnace at high temperatures with a molten salt flux. Spent fuels with both stainless steel and Zircaloy cladding are being evaluated for treatment; thus, stainless steel-rich and Zircaloy-rich waste forms are being developed. Although the primary disposition option for the actinides is the mineral waste form, the concept of incorporating the TRU-bearing product into the <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> form has enough potential to warrant investigation...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that a large amount of <b>metal</b> <b>waste</b> is produced annually by nuclear fuel processing and nuclear power plants. These <b>metal</b> <b>wastes</b> are contaminated with radioactive elements, such as uranium and plutonium. Current Department of Energy guidelines require retrievable storage of all metallic wastes containing transuranic elements above a certain level. Because of high cost, it is important to develop an effective decontamination and volume reduction method for low level contaminated metals. It has been shown by some investigators that a melt refining technique can be used for the processing of the contaminated <b>metal</b> <b>wastes.</b> In this process, contaminated metal is melted wit a suitable flux.
