The gray wolf was common until the 1940s. There {{is also a}} large population of moose. Inari–Pasvik has a shared population of 6,000 reindeer, which are herded to different areas depending on the season. Fences have been installed to hinder reindeer from wandering across the <b>national</b> <b>borders.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Italy and Germany, 1945 saw the {{collapse}} of Fascism; many memorials in Italian towns and cities were used to execute and display {{the bodies of the}} overthrown regime, and the inter-war Fascist pilgrimages and ceremonies around the memorials were abandoned and quickly forgotten. The World War I memorial sites continued to be used, but a combination of anti-war feelings and their residual Fascist links limited the attendance at their public ceremonies. Due to the changes in <b>national</b> <b>borders,</b> in the post-war era some sites favoured by the Nazi government, such as the Tannenberg Memorial, found themselves in Poland; the demolition of Tannenberg began in 1949 and its stonework was reused for Soviet party buildings.|$|E

25|$|Arendt {{argues that}} the {{consistent}} mistreatment of refugees, {{most of whom were}} placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, they must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state. Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state, national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over <b>national</b> <b>borders.</b> State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse <b>national</b> <b>borders.</b> In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests. This presents a dilemma for liberalism in that liberal theorists are typically committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.|$|E
25|$|Importing {{books and}} texts across <b>national</b> <b>borders</b> can {{sometimes}} be subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned.

25|$|This trade helps lower food prices, {{increase}} food security, relieve border tensions, {{and promote}} regional integration. However, the unregulated and undocumented {{nature of this}} trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across <b>national</b> <b>borders.</b> Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.

Since ERTMS is already installed and tested, the changeover can be done overnight.|$|E
25|$|King Mongkut's son Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910) was {{set upon}} modernizing the country. He engaged in wide-ranging reforms, abolishing slavery, corvée (unfree labour) and the feudal system, and {{creating}} a centralized bureaucracy and a professional army. The Western concept of nationhood was adopted, and <b>national</b> <b>borders</b> demarcated against British and French territories. Disputes with the French resulted in the Paknam Incident in 1893, when the French sent gunboats up the Chao Phraya to blockade Bangkok, resulting in Siam's concession of territory to France.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{and lack}} of {{educational}} and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work. As globalization opened up <b>national</b> <b>borders</b> to greater exchange of goods and capital, labor migration also increased. Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people to make conscious decisions to migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. Gender inequalities that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors.|$|E
