40|$|Flow {{injection}} analysis {{systems are}} often used to enhance the performance of chemical sensors. To reduce the liquid consumption of such a system microtechniques offer many possibilities. There are two classes of microanalytical systems: systems consisting of highly selective chemical sensors in combination with fluidic elements using the flow injection principle and systems using separation techniques and a <b>non-selective</b> <b>detector.</b> Both possibilities were studied by different research groups. More work deals with systems using separation (liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis) than with microanalytical systems using chemical microsensors and micropumps. In this poster concepts and results of the German joint research project "Integrated Micro Analysis System - IMAS" are demonstrated. The concept {{is based on a}} miniaturized flow injection analysis scheme...|$|E
40|$|Salt {{taste in}} mammals can trigger two {{divergent}} behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one {{functions as a}} <b>non-selective</b> <b>detector</b> {{for a wide range}} of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with inter-symbol interference (ISI) where signal detection is highly complex {{due to the}} large signal state-space dimensionality. A common strategy is to apply a front-end filter (FEF) to eliminate the ISI dimension (i. e. full ISI equalization). This FEF is then followed by a frequency <b>non-selective</b> MIMO <b>detector.</b> However, another, much less researched, strategy is to apply an FEF that eliminates the MIMO dimension and results {{in a set of}} parallel ISI channels followed by a bank of parallel single-input single-output (SISO) detectors. Which of the two strategies is better in a Shannon capacity sense? In this paper, we show that {{the answer to this question}} depends on system parameters such as SNR, number of antennas, ISI duration, and spatial correlation properties...|$|R

The objectives are to select a gas adsorbent material, to produce a silicon micro-reactor with an integrated heater, and finally to introduce the most suitableadsorbent into the micro-channels of the device. Preliminary results related to the characterization of a carbon adsorbent for the development of adevice for the preconcentration of benzene are reported. Carbon nano-powders have been tested as adsorbent material by the determination of the breakthrough time on a dedicated test bench consisting of gas sensors and a <b>non-selective</b> photoionization <b>detector</b> (micro-PID) analyzer. A fluidic deposition process allows filling up the silicon micro-channels with the carbon nano-powder. The interest in using porous silicon to enhance the binding of the carbon nano-particles in the micro-channels was also investigated. A silicon micromachined preconcentrator filled with 0. 30 mg of commercial activated charcoal powder (Aldrich, 30 - 100 nm) was designed and built up. The total capacity of adsorption was determined by using the breakthrough time, which is of 2. 2 min under a gas flow of 100 ppm of benzene at 1 l/h. Preliminary tests of preconcentration with 100 and 1. 3 ppm benzene in dry air were performed...|$|R
40|$|For future {{development}} of simple miniaturized sensors based on pulsed atmospheric pressure ionization as known from ion mobility spectrometry, we investigated the reaction kinetics of ion-ion-recombination to establish selective ion suppression as an easy to apply separation technique for otherwise <b>non-selective</b> ion <b>detectors.</b> Therefore, the recombination rates of different positive ion species, such as protonated water clusters H +(H 2 O) n (positive reactant ions), acetone, ammonia and dimethyl-methylphosphonate ions, all recombining with negative oxygen clusters O 2 -(H 2 O) n (negative reactant ions) in a field-free reaction region, are measured and compared. For all experiments, {{we use a}} drift tube ion mobility spectrometer equipped with a non-radioactive electron gun for pulsed atmospheric pressure ionization of the analytes. Both, ionization and recombination times are controlled by the duty cycle and repetition rate of the electron emission from the electron gun. Thus, {{it is possible to}} investigate the ion loss caused by ion-ion-recombination depending on the recombination time defined as the time delay between the end of the electron emission and the ion injection into the drift tube. Furthermore, the effect of the initial total ion density in the reaction region on the ion-ion-recombination rate is investigated by varying the density of the emitted electrons. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{programmed}} temperature vaporiser (PTV) with {{a packed}} liner was evaluated for the injection of large volumes (up to 100 mu l) of plasma extracts in a gas chromatograph. Solvent purity, which is essential when large volumes are injected into the GC system, was determined. Special {{attention was paid to}} the purity of the solvents used for the solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. For this SPE method, ethyl acetate was used as the extraction and reconstitution solvent, and thus the purity of the ethyl acetate was critical, especially when a <b>non-selective</b> GC <b>detector</b> was applied. The liquid capacity and inertness of different packed liners were investigated. The liner packed with ATAS "A" (modified Chromosorb-based material with special treatment) was found to be the most suitable for the analysis of the tested drugs. Good linearity in response for variations in volume and concentration was observed. A comparison was made between the applicability of flame ionisation detection (FID) and mass-selective detection (MSD). When 50 -mu l volumes of plasma extracts were injected with the PTV, the detection limits for secobarbital, lidocaine, phenobarbital and diazepam were about 50 -times lower than when 1 -mu l volumes were injected. The detection limits of the tested compounds in plasma for injection of 50 - 100 mu l plasma extract are 5 - 10 ng/ml for GC-FID whereas plasma concentrations of 250 pg/ml can be detected using the selected ion monitoring (SUI) mode of a MSD. For non-selective GC-FID, the background from a 50 -mu l injection was substantially larger than with 1 -mu l injection as a result of co-injected plasma matrix components and solvent impurities. These background effects were less with GC-MSD in the total ion current mode and virtually absent with GC-MSD in the SIM mode. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{development}} of several highly sensitive liquid chromatography post-column reaction detectors based on chemiluminescence (CL) for the ion chromatography (IC) determination of metal species {{in a range of}} sample types. The first chapter describes a <b>non-selective</b> multi-element CL <b>detector</b> based on metal-ligand reactions involving cobalt (11) and EDTA. A complexation reaction was designed so that eluting metal species displaced or produced equivalent amount of free cobalt ions which then catalysed the CL oxidation of luminol. The effect of pH, temperature and reaction time was investigated and optimised. It was found that the detector responded {{to a wide range of}} metals capable of forming EDTA complexes, even the relatively weak complexes such as those of magnesium and calcium. However, problems with the high back-ground signal limited sensitivity to the low ug 1 - 1 range. The next chapter deals with {{the development of}} a highly sensitive IC method for the determination of two environmentally important chromium species, namely chromium (III) and chromium (VI). A rapid ion exchange separation was achieved using a single column with potassium chloride eluent. This was incorporated into a luminol-H 2 O 2 CL detector, specific for chromium (III). On-line reduction was required in order to visualise the chromium (VI). Detection limits for chromium (III) and chromium (VI) wer 0. 05 ug 1 - 1 and 0. 1 /ug 1 - 1 respectively. Good results were obtained with a freshwater standard reference material and lyophilised samples as part of the author’s participation in a Bureau Communtaire de reference (BCR) certification exercise. Sample pH was found to have considerable influence on the stability of the species and this is described and discussed. The third and largest part of the study involved the development of an IC system for the ultra-trace determination of silver in pressurised water reactor (PWR) primary coolant, of particular concern to the nuclear power industry. A novel ion exchange separation was achieved on hydrophillic resins giving excellent separation from divalent cations. A CL post column reaction detector was designed based on the oxidation of luminol with persulphate. Good quantitative performance was accomplished based on the analysis of a certified reference material and simulated PWR coolant with detection limit for silver of 0. 05 /ug 1 - 1. Finally, a CL detection system was developed for determining gold (III) after IC separation. A novel aspect was that no added co-oxidant was required for the luminol reaction. Results for a standard reference metal alloy sample was in good agreement with the certified value. Again, high sensitivity was achieved with a detection limit of 0. 25 ug 1 - 1.
