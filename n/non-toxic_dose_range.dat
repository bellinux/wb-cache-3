In a <b>non-toxic</b> <b>dose</b> <b>range,</b> the effect of PS on mast-cell-mediated angiogenesis, effected by 48 / 80, was quantified as the number of vessels per mm of mesenteric window in histological sections at x 400. No intelligible dose-effect relationship was discernible between the dose of PS given and the effect on angiogenesis. Only in a tight interval, at 40 mg PS/kg but not at 20 or 60 mg PS/kg, was the angiogenesis statistically significantly suppressed. Hence, it was concluded that PS can be angiostatic but does not exert a more general angiostatic effect in the autogenous systems used...|$|E
40|$|Polyamines are {{necessary}} for tumour cell growth. Inhibition of endogenous polyamine biosynthesis results in compensatory up-regulation of polyamine uptake. Here, the combined effect of suramin and the polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on human carcinoma cell proliferation was studied. Suramin selectively inhibited the growth of tumour cells made dependent on extracellular polyamines by DFMO-treatment. In an animal tumour model, low <b>non-toxic</b> <b>doses</b> of suramin resulted in a 2 -fold increase in DFMO tumour growth reduction. Moreover, suramin bound strongly to polyamine-agarose and significantly inhibited polyamine uptake in DFMO-treated cells. Our results indicate that <b>non-toxic</b> <b>doses</b> of suramin augment tumour growth inhibition by DFMO, and {{that a combination of}} these well-studied anticancer drugs may represent an additional strategy for cancer treatment...|$|R

40|$|SiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} (NPs), {{in addition}} to their widespread utilization in consumer goods, are also being engineered for clinical use. They are considered to exert low toxicity both in vivo and in vitro, but the mechanisms involved in the cellular responses activated by these nanoobjects, even at <b>non-toxic</b> <b>doses,</b> have not been characterized in detail. This is of particular relevance for their interaction with the nervous system: silica NPs are good candidates for nanoneuromedicine applications. Here, by using two neuronal cell lines (GT 1 - 7 and GN 11 cells), derived from gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we describe the mechanisms involved in the perturbation of calcium signaling, a key controller of neuronal function. At the <b>non-toxic</b> <b>dose</b> of 20 μgmL(- 1), 50 nm SiO 2 NPs induce long lasting but reversible calcium signals, that in most cases show a complex oscillatory behavior. Using fluorescent NPs, we show that these signals do not depend on NPs internalization, are totally ascribable to calcium influx and are dependent in a complex way from size and surface charge. We provide evidence of the involvement of voltage-dependent and transient receptor potential-vanilloid 4 (TRPV 4) channels. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Although telmisartan, an {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker (ARB), has an agonistic {{action for}} proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -γ in vitro, {{it remains to}} be determined whether telmisartan exerts such an action in vivo using a <b>non-toxic</b> <b>dose</b> (< 5  mg/kg in rats). To address the issue, telmisartan (2  mg/kg) and olmesartan (2  mg/kg), another ARB without PPAR-γ agonistic action, were given to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed a high fat diet (HFD). HFD decreased plasma adiponectin, and caused insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and renal damage, which were improved by ARBs. Protective effects of telmisartan and olmesartan did not significantly differ. In addition, in vitro study showed that 1  μM of telmisartan did not elevate the mRNA expression of adipose protein 2, which is a PPAR-γ-stimulated adipogenic marker gene, in preadipocytes with 3 % albumin. To obtain 1  μM of plasma concentration, oral dose of telmisartan was calculated to be 6  mg/kg, which indicates that PPAR-γ agonistic action is negligible with a <b>non-toxic</b> <b>dose</b> of telmisartan (< 5  mg/kg) in rats. This study showed that 2  mg/kg of telmisartan and olmesartan ameliorated insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and renal damage in SHR fed a HFD.

40|$|In this study, several {{short-term}} microbial and mammalian {{in vitro}} assays {{were used to}} evaluate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of four plant volatiles showing antifungal activity: cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, thymol and S(+) -carvone. All inhibited viability and proliferation of Hep- 2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. IC 50 ranged from 0. 3 mM (cinnamaldehyde) to 0. 7 mM (thymol) in viability tests and from 0. 2 mM (carvacrol) to 0. 9 mM (carvone) in the proliferation test. The morphological analysis suggested an involvement of apoptosis {{in the cases of}} carvone, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde. At <b>non-toxic</b> <b>doses,</b> carvacrol and thymol increased the number of revertants in the Ames test by 1. 5 - 1. 7 times, regardless of metabolic activation. In the SOS-chromotest, none of the four plant volatiles caused DNA damage at <b>non-toxic</b> <b>doses.</b> In the DNA repair test, a marked dose-dependent differential toxicity was observed with carvone and, to a lesser extent, with cinnamaldehyde, while with thymol and carvacrol, this effect was less pronounced.

To comprehensively address the action of Ag NPs to the gastrointestinal systems in real situations, i. e., the long-term low-dose exposure, we evaluated and compared the toxicity of three Ag NPs (20 – 30 nm with different surface coatings) to the human intestine cell Caco- 2 after 1 -day and 21 -day exposures, using various biological assays. In both the short- and long-term exposures, the variety of surface coating predominated the toxicity of Ag NPs in a descending order of citrate-coated Ag NP (Ag-CIT), bare Ag NP (Ag-B), and poly (N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone) -coated Ag NP (Ag-PVP). The short-term exposure induced cell growth inhibition and death. The cell viability loss appeared after cells were exposed to 0. 7 μg/mL Ag-CIT, 0. 9 μg/mL Ag-B or > 1. 0 μg/mL Ag-PVP for 24 h. The short-term and higher-dose exposure also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial damage, cell membrane leakage, apoptosis, and inflammation (IL- 8 level). The long-term exposure only inhibited the cell proliferation. After 21 -day exposure to 0. 4 μg/mL Ag-CIT, the cell viability dropped to less than 50 %, while cells exposed to 0. 5 μg/mL Ag-PVP remained normal as the control.
