50|$|HU-210 is {{apparently}} {{the most active}} cannabinoid used at present. It is up to 800 times more active than THC in mice. AM-404 (a paracetamol metabolite) is an inhibitor of endocannabinoid cellular uptake, prolonging their effects. <b>Nabitan,</b> O-1057 and TMA are water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nabitan</b> (Nabutam, Benzopyranoperidine, SP-106, Abbott 40656) is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid analog of dronabinol (Marinol). It exhibits antiemetic and analgesic effects, most likely by binding to and activating the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, and reduced intraocular pressure in animal tests, making it potentially {{useful in the}} treatment of glaucoma.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nabitan</b> has the {{advantage}} of being water-soluble, unlike most cannabinoid derivatives, and was researched for potential use as an analgesic or sedative, although it was never developed for clinical use and is not currently used in medicine, as dronabinol or nabilone were felt to be more useful. However it is sometimes used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of THC analogs (synhexyl, nabilone, <b>nabitan,</b> nantradol) featured slight variations of the THC molecule, such as esterifying the phenolic hydroxy group, extending and branching of the pentyl side chain, or substituting nitrogen for oxygen in the benzopyran ring. These analogs can be grouped into classical (HU-210), bicyclic (CP-55,940), and tricyclic (CP-55,244). Tritium-labelled cannabinoids such as Â³HCP-55,940 were instrumental in discovering the cannabinoid receptors in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|On 1 April {{speaking}} to representatives of international organizations and diplomats, Prime Minister Kabi {{called on the}} international community to assist in raising the 3.7 billion CFA francs required for the election's budget. He said that the Portuguese government had agreed to supply the necessary electoral material. Three months later, Cristian <b>Nabitan,</b> the Secretary of State for Administrative Reform, announced the approval of a large shipment of electoral materials from Portugal, including ballots, ballot boxes, voting booths, and indelible ink, on July 1; he said that this shipment represented 75% of the materials Guinea-Bissau needed for the election and that another shipment would arrive in Bissau on the next day. The materials were valued at about 41 million CFA francs. The Portuguese government also said that it would send electoral observers if asked to do so.|$|E
