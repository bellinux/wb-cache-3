40|$|Numerous {{experiments}} {{showed that}} on cold compression graphite transforms {{into a new}} superhard and transparent allotrope. Several structures with different topologies have been proposed for this phase. While experimental data are compatible with most of these models, {{the only way to}} solve this puzzle is to find which structure is kinetically easiest to form. Using state-of-the-art molecular-dynamics transition path sampling simulations, we investigate kinetic pathways of the pressure-induced transformation of graphite to various superhard candidate structures. Unlike hitherto applied methods for elucidating nature of superhard graphite, transition path sampling realistically models nucleation events necessary for physically meaningful transformation kinetics. We demonstrate that <b>nucleation</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> <b>kinetics</b> lead to M-carbon as the final product. W-carbon, initially competitor to M-carbon, is ruled out by phase growth. Bct-C 4 structure is not expected to be produced by cold compression due to less probable nucleation and higher barrier of formation...|$|E

Although electrocrystallization processes have been studied for long time, a dearth of fundamental knowledge and understanding still persists in the <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> <b>kinetics</b> of <b>nucleation</b> <b>and</b> growth of nano-size crystals at aqueous-substrate interfaces. The main objective of the present work is to investigate the effect of applied potential and electrolyte concentration on the <b>nucleation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> <b>kinetics</b> of electrocrystallization of copper onto glassy carbon and gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were used for electrodeposition investigations facilitating the characterization of the nucleation behaviour. Tapping mode Atomic Force Microscopy imaging revealed the film deposit comprised a plethora of smaller nuclei and higher population density with increasing potential. The nucleation rate correlated positively with the applied potential and current. Diffusion coefficients of Cu 2 +ions obtained from CV and CA curves are close to values typical of diffusion limited electrodeposition process. The Cu (II) electrocrystallization behaviour {{was found to be}} substantially the same for both gold and glassy carbon electrodes. ...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{nanoparticles}} {{are often}} poorly-crystalline or metastable structures, whose <b>kinetics</b> of formation <b>and</b> growth are poorly understood. Further, the sorption or growth of nanoparticles on mineral surfaces may control the mineral surface's reactivity and modify {{its ability to}} influence contaminant transport. Due to the characteristic length scale, a holistic understanding of the <b>nucleation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> <b>kinetics</b> of nanoparticle formation on mineral surfaces is difficult to achieve with traditional methodology. In this work, our intent {{is to determine the}} molecular nature of nucleation on surfaces, the kinetics of surface nucleation and growth, and the effect of crystal surface topology using new synchrotron-based techniques. We have approached these objectives by: (1) combining state-of-the-art crystal-truncation rod diffraction (CTR) and grazing incidence x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (GIXAS) techniques to investigate the three-dimensional molecular-scale geometry of silicate monomer sorption on the r-plane of hematite; and (2) developing a new grazing-incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) setup at SSRL (0. 08 nm{sup - 1 } < q < 8 nm{sup - 1 }) to explore the initial development of environmental nanoparticles on various mineral surfaces.

Three new insights were obtained. First, the plate-like β-intermetallics appeared to nucleate mainly {{on or near the}} primary aluminium dendrites {{and to a lesser extent}} off the oxide skin on the surface of the specimen. Second, for this alloy composition, β-intermetallic formation was largely complete before the formation of Al–Si eutectic. Third, the β-intermetallics formed via fast lateral growth, wrapping around and in between the primary dendrite arms. Further, the nucleation and growth dynamics of β-intermetallics were quantified as a function of undercooling in a functional form that could be easily used in microstructural simulations. The frequency of intermetallic interaction mechanisms, such as plate nucleation vs. impingement and branching, were also quantified...|$|R

UV-exposure produces silver nanoclusters, and NaF nanocrystals upon heating, {{giving rise to}} permanent refractive index changes. This {{is the basis for}} the production ofBragg gratings. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of the photo-thermoinduced effects in PTR glass. We first give a general introduction of PTR glasses and their applications.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{probabilistic model}} for simulating microstructure formation and evolution during solidification has been developed, based on coupling a Finite Differential Method (FDM) for macroscopic modelling of heat diffusion to a modified Cellular Automaton (mCA) for microscopic modelling of nucleation, growth of microstructures and solute diffusion. The mCA model {{is similar to}} Nastac 2 ̆ 7 s model for handling solute redistribution in the liquid and solid phases, curvature and growth anisotropy, but differs {{in the treatment of}} nucleation and growth. The aim is to improve understanding {{of the relationship between the}} solidification conditions and microstructure formation and evolution. A numerical algorithm used for FDM and mCA was developed. At each coarse scale, temperatures at FDM nodes were calculated while nucleation-growth simulation was done at a finer scale, with the temperature at the cell locations being interpolated from those at the coarser volumes. This model takes account of thermal, curvature and solute diffusion effects. Therefore, it can not only simulate microstructures of alloys both on the scale of grain size (macroscopic level) and the dendrite tip length (mesoscopic level), but also investigate <b>nucleation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> growth <b>kinetics</b> of alloys solidified with various solute concentrations and solidification morphologies.

The activation energy values for crystallization ranging from 472 to 832 kJ. mol(- 1) were found to be close to those typical for aluminosilicate glasses; moreover, the possibility to vitrify and devitrify up to 100 wt% of slag and up to 40 - 50 wt% of ash mixed with glass cullet and dolomite makes the vitrification treatment a suitable disposal procedure...|$|R

40|$|A polythermal {{methodology}} {{to assess}} the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> the <b>kinetics</b> of solution crystallisation is described and used {{in connection with a}} recently proposed model for the dependence of the critical undercooling for crystallisation on the cooling rate (D.

This first principles model allows determination of crystallisation parameters that could otherwise only be obtained by combined application of both the isothermal and the polythermal methods. The methodology is validated through analysis of experimental data measured for methyl stearate crystallising from kerosene solutions with concentrations from 200 to 350 g l- 1. The analysis reveals a progressive heterogeneous <b>nucleation</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> crystallite interfacial tension values between 1. 64 and 1. 79 with no obvious dependence on the solution concentration, in good agreement with values derived by isothermal methods. Sensitivity analysis leads to the conclusion that a minimum of four different cooling rates spanning at least one order of magnitude together with at least five repeats for crystallisation temperature values at each cooling rate are appropriate.
