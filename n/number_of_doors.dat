Most of the Z1-class trams were withdrawn following the introduction of the C, D and E class trams; the last Z1-class withdrawn on 23 April 2016.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>door</b> opening rates on air quality in the operation room during hip revision surgery by measuring the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colony forming units per cubic meter (CFU/m(3)). METHODS: During 70 hip revision operations the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> CFU/m(3) was measured at four time points. Factors that may influence air quality were recorded, including the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> persons present, duration <b>of</b> surgery, and <b>door</b> opening rates. The measured CFU/m(3) was dichotomized as either acceptable ( 20 CFU/m(3)). To determine whether door openings were associated with CFU/m(3) values, we used generalized linear mixed models to model the dichotomized repeatedly measured CFU/m(3) values. RESULTS: The median <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> openings per operation was eight (range, 0 - 72), the median duration of surgery was 145 min (range, 60 - 285), and the median <b>number</b> <b>of</b> persons present during surgery was eight (range, 5 - 10). Adjusted for <b>number</b> <b>of</b> persons in the operation room and duration <b>of</b> surgery, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> openings per operation was associated (odds ratio [OR] 1. 05 [95 % confidence interval {CI} 1. 02 - 1. 09]; p = 0. 003) with an unacceptable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> CFU/m(3). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a substantial association between <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> openings and an unacceptable <b>number</b> (> 20) <b>of</b> CFU/m(3) was found. Adjusted for <b>number</b> <b>of</b> persons in the operation room and duration <b>of</b> surgery, every <b>door</b> opening increased the odds of unacceptable CFU/m(3) values by 5 %. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> persons present during surgery and duration of surgery were not related to CFU/m(3) ...|$|R

2500|$|The R44 was {{the first}} [...] car for the New York City Subway. The cars were {{introduced}} under {{the idea that a}} train of eight [...] cars would be more efficient than one of ten [...] cars. Despite the increase in length, the R44s had eight pairs of doors per car (four on each side) like other B Division cars. As a result, eight [...] cars have only 64 (32 per side) pairs whereas ten cars have 80 (40 per side). The reduced <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> on a train of eight 75-foot cars increased boarding and dwelling times, so recent car orders have returned to ten 60-foot (18.29 m) cars, starting with the R143.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{very lonely}} place--a colony of half-finished streets, and half-inhabited houses, which {{had grown up in}} the {{neighbourhood}} of a great railway station. I heard the fierce scream of the whistle, and the heaving, heavy throb of the engine starting on its journey, as I advanced along the gloomy Square in which I now found myself. The cab I had been following stood at a turning which led into a long street, occupied towards the farther end, by shops closed for the night, and at the end nearest me, apparently by private houses only. Margaret and Mr. Mannion hastily left the cab, and without looking either to the right or the left, hurried down the street. They stopped at the ninth house.

They pass through {{nearly the same}} conditions of change as the windows, with these three differences: first, that no arches of the fantastic fourth order occur in any doorways; secondly, that the pure pointed arch occurs earlier, and much oftener, in doorways than in window-heads; lastly, that the entrance itself, if small, is nearly always square-headed in the earliest examples, without any arch above, but afterwards the arch is thrown across above the lintel. The interval between the two, or tympanum, is filled with sculpture, or closed by iron bars, with sometimes a projecting gable, to form a porch, thrown over the whole, as in the perfect example, 7 a, Plate XIV., above. The other examples in the two lower lines, 6 and 7, of that Plate are each characteristic of an enormous <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors,</b> variously decorated, from the thirteenth to {{the close of the}} fifteenth century.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the effects of}} different operating variables on energy consumption of refrigerator-freezer that had two phases. The first phase is to investigate the effects <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> opening, duration <b>of</b> each <b>door</b> remain open, ambient temperature, cabinet load and thermostat setting position on energy consumption during the open door conditions. The second phase is to investigate {{the effects of the}} ambient temperature, cabinet load, thermostat setting position and open surface water pan area inside the cabinet on energy consumption during the closed door conditions. All the experiments were conducted in the environmental controlled chamber. The result shows that there is a great influence of different variables on energy consumption and average consumption is about 3. 3 kWh day - 1. The effects <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> opening, ambient temperature and cabinet load are more compared to the others. The open door energy consumption is 40 % more compared to the closed door test. It is found that the average of the maximum energy consumption is 27. 3 % more compared to average consumption and 55. 6 % more compared to average of the minimum consumption. If the users be serious, a significant amount of energy could be saved with the proper utilization of refrigerator-freezer...|$|R

Every evening I {{go out into the}} streets and buy the latest editions of the evening journals. If there is {{anything}} in them worthy commemoration in verse, I compose. There is generally something. I cannot say to which paper I send most of my poems, as I send to all. One of the weaknesses of the St. John's Gazette is its poetry. It is not worthy of the name. It is doggerel. I have sought to improve it, but the editor rejected my contributions. I continued to send them, hoping that they would educate his taste. One night I had sent him a very long poem which did not appear in the paper next day. I was very indignant, and went straight to the office. That was on Jubilee Day. I was told that the editor had left word that he had just gone into the country for two days. (Hisses.) I forced my way up the stairs, however, and when I reached the top I did not know which way to go. There were a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> with [...] "No admittance" [...] printed on them. (More hissing.) I heard voices in altercation in a room near me. I thought that was likely to be the editor's. I opened the door and went in. The prisoner was in the room. He had the editor on the floor and was jumping on him. I said, [...] "Is that the editor?" [...] He said, [...] "Yes." [...] I said, [...] "Have you killed him?"

60|$|Belton Castle was not {{in truth}} a castle. Immediately before the front door, so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running {{between it and the}} {{entrance}} porch, there stood an old tower, which gave its name to the residence,--an old square tower, up which the Amedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means of the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner corners,--and this tower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the village of Belton. The house itself was an ugly residence, three stories high, built in the time of George II., with low rooms and long passages, and an immense <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors.</b> It was a large unattractive house,--unattractive, that is, as regarded its own attributes,--but made interesting by the beauty of the small park in which it stood. Belton Park did not, perhaps, contain much above a hundred acres, but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys, in so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the verdure, there were in it so many stunted old oaks, so many points of vantage for the lover of scenery, that no one would believe it to be other than a considerable domain. The farmer who took it, and who would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than seventeen shillings an acre for it, could not be made to think that it was in any way considerable. But Belton Park, since first it was made a park, had never before been regarded after this fashion. Farmer Stovey, of the Grange, was the first man of that class who had ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in Belton chase,--as the people around were still accustomed to call the woodlands of the estate.|$|E
