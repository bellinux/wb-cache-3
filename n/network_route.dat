5|$|Bridgwater Docks, {{in which}} the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and {{fittings}} are listed buildings, is now a marina, and the old warehouse, built in 184050 has been converted into apartments, with new apartment blocks built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal Feed Mill. The towpath forms part of Sustrans' National Cycle <b>Network</b> <b>route</b> NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. Plans have been proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E
5|$|For cycling, {{although}} hilly, Sheffield is {{compact and}} has few major trunk roads. It {{is on the}} Trans-Pennine Trail, a National Cycle <b>Network</b> <b>route</b> running from West to East from Southport in Merseyside to Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire and North to South from Leeds in West Yorkshire to Chesterfield in Derbyshire. There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city, though very few cycle lanes in the city itself.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, {{was opened}} along the B3114 {{on the western}} part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle <b>Network</b> <b>Route</b> 3. It has {{all-weather}} surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.|$|E

5|$|Separating {{provision}} for cyclists from other road traffic {{was not part}} of the remit of the 1960s town redevelopment, and in 1996 the perception of {{provision for}} cyclists was very poor. A Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy was developed in 1999 and subsequently an extensive cycle network has been developed mainly utilising on-road routes or off-road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads. Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the National Cycle <b>Network</b> <b>route</b> 23 in May 2003 and the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006.|$|E
5|$|Two further series {{ideas were}} {{developed}} from Roddenberry's notes, Genesis and Andromeda. After an initial order for two seasons, 110 episodes of Andromeda were aired over five seasons. Tribune also worked on another Roddenberry series. Titled Starship; they aimed to launch it via the <b>network</b> <b>route</b> rather than into syndication. Rod Roddenberry, president of Roddenberry Productions, announced in 2010, at his father's posthumous induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame, {{that he was}} aiming to take The Questor Tapes to television. Rod was developing the series alongside Imagine Television. Rod {{would go on to}} create the two-hour television movie Trek Nation regarding the impact of his father's work.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of these}} former railway lines {{form part of}} the British National Cycle Network, {{connecting}} with long-distance paths and towpaths along Britain's extensive network of canals. For example, the Milton Keynes redway system runs throughout Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, England, in parts using the former trackbed of the defunct Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line (closed 1962) and the Grand Union Canal towpath. Together, these paths form part of the long-distance National Cycle <b>Network</b> <b>Route</b> 6 and Route 51. Other urban and suburban rail trails include the Fallowfield Loop Line in Manchester, the Middlewood Way in Cheshire and the Ebury Way in Watford. Notable rural rail trails include the Dava Way, running along {{the route of the}} former Highland Railway between Grantown and Forres in the Scottish Highlands, and the High Peak Trail in the English Peak District. In London, a more unusual scheme has been proposed to convert some disused London Underground tunnels into subterranean rail trails under the city, but this scheme has not been officially approved.|$|E
500|$|The Beverley Brook Walk {{runs through}} the park between Roehampton Gate and Robin Hood Gate. The Capital Ring walking route passes through the park from Robin Hood Gate to Petersham Gate. The Thames Cycle Route runs across the park from Ham Gate to Roehampton Gate (also known as [...] – the speed limit on this route through {{the centre of the}} park, where it is off the main road, is 10mph). London Cycle <b>Network</b> <b>route</b> no. 3 goes through the park.|$|E

500|$|Several {{proposals}} for a cut-and-cover subway tunnel under 3rd Avenue in Downtown Seattle {{were presented to}} the City of Seattle by predecessors of the Seattle Planning Commission throughout the 20th century. The first major proposal was part of urban planner Virgil Bogue's [...] "Plan for Seattle" [...] in 1911, as Route 1 of a proposed rapid transit <b>network.</b> <b>Route</b> 1 ran southeast on 3rd Avenue from a circular ring around a proposed civic center in the Denny Regrade neighborhood to King Street Station, paralleled to the west by a subway on 1st Avenue known as Route 17; stations on the line were to have additional entrances from department stores and other major businesses on 3rd Avenue. The plan was supported by City Engineer Reginald H. Thomson and the Municipal League among others, but opposed by businesses fearing it would shift the commercial district further north, and by the three daily newspapers published in Seattle. A special municipal election for the comprehensive plan was held on March 5, 1912, in which Seattle voters rejected it by a 10,000-vote margin.|$|E
