However, the seasons alone account for {{only a small part}} of their total variability with demand factors being much more important. Demand fluctuations account for 35 % 80 % and 17 % 43 %, respectively, of the seasonal and cyclical variability of <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> in various industries.

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that business expectations are crucial for investment {{in research and}} development (R&D) as well as for process and product innovations. However, there are controversial theoretical predictions about the causal linkage between business expectations and <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> In addition, most empirical studies have neglected so far business expectations as an important determinant of <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> due to absence of data. To address this shortcoming, it is investigated in this study whether business expectations do affect <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> and whether the net impact is positive or negative. The empirical analysis is based on panel data from 14 branches of the German food industry for six years (1993 - 1998). Our findings suggest that a strong pressure exists in stagnating or declining food industries to respond to unfavourable expectations by <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> In addition, we identify the influence of market structure and industry-specific variables as significant for <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since Comanor and Scherer (1969), {{researchers}} have been using patents {{as a proxy for}} <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development. In this paper, we reevaluate this relationship by using novel new data.

Moreover, we also find that the relationship between R&D expenditures and <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> is considerably smaller than previously reported. While measures of patenting remain important in predicting the arrival of <b>product</b> <b>introductions,</b> the most important predictor is the loss of exclusivity protection on a current product.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that market structure variables influence technical change, growth and <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions.</b> Based on a broad data set for <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> in various food industries, it is elaborated in this article how market structure variables affect innovative activities in the US food sector. It is different from earlier studies {{in the way that}} cross-sectional and time-series data are combined and panel data models are used in the econometric analysis. A major result is that <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> are driven by market structure variables and industry-specific characteristics, i. e. fixed effects. A significant determinant of <b>new</b> food <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> is the concentration ratio which affects the number of innovations in a nonlinear form. The fixed-effects estimates reveal a U-type effect of concentration on innovations. Furthermore, the number of firms, the degree of existing product differentiation and the size of a market show a positive influence on the number of innovations. From a methodological point of view, plain OLS models yield biased results on the concentration-innovation linkage and on the relationship between the size of a market and innovations. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} include sector-specific characteristics as is done in the fixed-effects models. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to a top ten global consumer trend, firms are increasingly introducing environmentally sustainable (“green”) <b>new</b> <b>products.</b> Firms allocate significant resources to this area; thus, the authors consider the brand-level implications by investigating how the <b>introduction</b> of green <b>new</b> <b>products</b> changes attitude toward the brand.

Estimating a three-stage least squares model based on <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> from 75 brands across a four year time period (2009 – 2012), the authors find that green <b>new</b> <b>product</b> <b>introductions</b> can indeed improve brand attitude and that both the brand and category’s positioning influence the <b>introduction</b> of green <b>new</b> <b>products.</b> They also find that the quantity of green messages, the product type, and their source credibility influence the extent to which green <b>new</b> <b>products</b> change brand attitude.
