25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication {{that sounds like a}} short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorder,</b> and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|Hartnup {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorder</b> resulting in niacin deficiency. [...] This condition was first identified in the 1950s by the Hartnup family in London. [...] It {{is due to a}} deficit in the intestines and kidneys, making it difficult for the body to break down and absorb dietary tryptophan (an essential amino acid that is utilized to synthesize niacin). [...] The resulting condition is similar to pellagra, including symptoms of red, scaly rash, and sensitivity to sunlight. [...] Oral niacin is given as a treatment for this condition in doses ranging from 40–200mg, with a good prognosis if identified and treated early. Niacin synthesis is also deficient in carcinoid syndrome, because of metabolic diversion of its precursor tryptophan to form serotonin.|$|E

5000|$|The higher {{echelons of}} the Army Medical Corps, {{including}} writer Mori Ōgai, favored the German view that beriberi, {{a disease that}} caused an even heavier death toll than typhoid, was caused by an undiscovered transmittable pathogens (in contrast, British-trained doctors in the navy correctly {{saw it as a}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorder).</b> Prompted by their misguided view, the army distributed vast quantities of Seirogan (with their proven antiseptic properties) among the troops to be administered daily throughout the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5. In an army medical journal of 1901 there is mention of the pill as Kureosōto gan (クレオソート丸), but in the journals of 1904-5 appears the name Seirogan (征露丸 [...] "Conquer Russia pills"). The name Seirogan was widely used as the academic term by army doctors for about a 4-year span.|$|E
50|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorder</b> {{which can}} become serious, even fatal, if allowed to progress untreated. It can occur in people of any age, ancestry, or gender. Biotin {{is part of the}} B vitamin family.Biotin deficiency rarely occurs among healthy people because the daily requirement of biotin is low, many foods provide adequate amounts of it, intestinal bacteria synthesize small amounts of it, and the body effectively scavenges and recycles it from bodily waste. However, deficiencies can be caused by consuming raw egg whites over a period of months to years. Egg whites contain high levels of avidin, a protein that binds biotin strongly. When cooked, avidin is partially denatured and binding to biotin is reduced. However one study showed that 30-40% of the avidin activity was still present in the white after frying or boiling. But cooked egg whites are safer to consume. Genetic disorders such as Biotinidase deficiency, Multiple carboxylase deficiency, and Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency can also lead to inborn or late-onset forms of biotin deficiency. In all cases - dietary, genetic, or otherwise - supplementation with biotin is the primary method of treatment.|$|E
5000|$|But {{this was}} in the days when drug use as {{preventive}} medicine was not a widely embraced concept, and soldiers resisted swallowing this weird-smelling and unfamiliar pill, even when so instructed. The top brass decided to invoke the name of Emperor Meiji, telling the men that taking the pill was [...] "according to the wishes of His Imperial Majesty". This subterfuge reportedly greatly improved the soldiers' compliance towards taking the pill, making them less prone to be forced out of action due to stomach aches or diarrhea. The army doctors were however disappointed to find that the pill did not show any of the desired combative effect towards the (non-existent) beriberi microbe. The army insisted on feeding their men pure white rice to boost morale, but that led to vitamin-deficient diet, so that one in three men serving the Russo-Japanese War were afflicted by beriberi, and 27,800 succumbed to it. Meanwhile, the Japanese navy deduced early on that beriberi was a <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorder,</b> and added breads and mugimeshi (麦飯) (wheat or wheat-rice mixture steam-cooked like rice) to their rations, so that none of their servicemen fell ill with beriberi.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this new {{publication}} is to help workers in bean research and development to recognise in the field, the biotic and abiotic stresses that affect the crop in Africa. The authors describe insect pests and their biology and distribution. They explain the symptoms and consequences of damage and suggest the type of control measures available. The distribution and importance of disease is discussed as well as disease symptoms, diagnosis, spread and control. The pests described include mites, nematodes and parasitic angiosperm weeds. In the <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorders</b> section, the authors present steps to follow when diagnosing problems and describe tissue-sampling procedures. For each disorder the authors describe its symptoms and {{the conditions under which}} it occurs. The appendix provides several aids to the diagnosis of <b>nutritional</b> <b>disorders.</b> All illustrations are in colour for ease of identification.
