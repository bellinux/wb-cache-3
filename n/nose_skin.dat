(For more on this, see Definition of sense.) But the idea of five senses/wits from Aristotelian, medieval, and 16th century thought still lingers so strongly in modern thinking that a sense beyond the natural ones is still called a [...] "sixth sense".|$|E

The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with tampons.In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS cases were reported; 38 deaths resulted from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble. The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E

5000|$|Aside from simply elucidating the {{composition}} of the human microbiome, one of the major questions involving the human microbiome is whether there is a [...] "core", that is, whether there is a subset of the community that is shared among most humans. If there is a core, then {{it would be possible to}} associate certain community compositions with disease states, which is one of the goals of the Human Microbiome Project. It is known that the human microbiome is highly variable both within a single subject and between different individuals. For example, the gut microbiota of humans is markedly dissimilar between individuals, a phenomenon which is also observed in mice. [...] On 13 June 2012, a major milestone of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was announced by the NIH director Francis Collins. The announcement was accompanied with a series of coordinated articles published in Nature and several journals in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) on the same day. By mapping the normal microbial make-up of healthy humans using genome sequencing techniques, the researchers of the HMP have created a reference database and the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans. From 242 healthy U.S. volunteers, more than 5,000 samples were collected from tissues from 15 (men) to 18 (women) body sites such as mouth, <b>nose,</b> <b>skin,</b> lower intestine (stool), and vagina.

40|$|In many mammals, {{the skin}} of the rhinarium {{includes}} a thick epidermal layer. The skin surface can be smooth but can also display a structure formed of domes, ridges, and polygonal areas: a dermatoglyphic or rhinoglyphic pattern. Each structure consists of an easily visible, large area of the epidermis. The abdominal epidermis {{may or may not have}} a dermatoglyphic pattern. The abdominal skin examined in our study had no pattern and was consequently unstructured and smooth. The ultrastructural surface pattern is formed in the granular and corneous regions of nasal epidermis by desmosome protrusions projecting into adjacent keratinocytes. Complete retraction of the keratinocyte protrusions with desmosomes in the abdominal epidermis creates an unstructured, smooth surface. The cornification process differs morphologically in nasolabial and abdominal skin. In this study, we report a novel structure in the <b>nose</b> <b>skin.</b> It is related only to the surface of a single corneocyte (keratinocyte) and consists of submicrometer pores or furrows, an ultrastructure pattern. It is not related to the rhinoglyphic pattern. The <b>nose</b> <b>skin</b> can thus have 2 unrelated patterns. This structure seems to be widespread among the Mammalia. We suggest the function of the structure is to keep the rhinarium evenly moist...|$|E

30|$|The {{abnormal}} {{insertion of}} orbicularis oris muscle into base of columella in cleft lip creates unfavorable forces to pull columella and caudal nasal septum to the non-affected side. Furthermore, insertion of orbicularis oris muscle into the subalar cartilage forces the cleft {{side of the}} nose to retract laterally and inferiorly, which results in flattening of the lower lateral alar cartilage. Correction of these anatomic displacement is indispensable to restore normal nasal structure. It is bound up with dissecting, releasing, and repositioning of lower lateral alar cartilage from the margin of medial and lateral flaps {{on the base of}} nose. After completion of lip <b>nose</b> <b>skin</b> suture, trans alar cartilage suture initiates from intranasal mucosa and passes lower lateral cartilage and anchors to dermis of nasal skin with 4 - 0 PDS® [4] (Fig.  2 e).|$|E

40|$|The design, {{fabrication}} {{and analysis}} of aluminum wind turbine rotor blades is discussed. The blades are designed to meet criteria established for a 100 -kilowatt wind turbine generator operating between 8 and 60 -mile-per-hour speeds at 40 revolutions per minute. The design wind speed is 18 miles per hour. Two rotor blades are used on a new facility which includes a hingeless hub and its shaft, gearbox, generator and tower. Experience shows that, for stopped rotors, safe wind speeds are strongly dependent on blade torsional and bending rigidities which the basic D spar structural blade design provides.

A study reported that 23.1 % (n =  44 / 190) of high-school football players in the USA had nasal colonization with methicillin-susceptible SA, and none with MRSA [24]. On contrary, another study reported <b>nose</b> and <b>skin</b> MRSA carriage in 35.0 % of 233 healthy athletes in the USA, and found that most isolates also harbored the PVL-encoding gene [16]. When our study started, most published data on MRSA carriage in the general and athlete populations came from the USA. A European study published during our study showed an MRSA carriage of 0.4 % in the French general population [15], close to the 0.3 % observed here in French athletes.|$|R
