He said of his experience with Jackson, [...] "He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is... but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War almost stranded Fauré in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris. He remained in France {{for the duration of}} the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Saëns. Fauré did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art [...] "a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation." [...] Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting Frankfurt and Cologne for concerts of his music, he had written, [...] "The criticisms of my music have been that it's a bit cold and too well brought up! There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> French and German are two different things." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Nel {{places the}} book's title {{character}} {{in the tradition of}} con artists in American art, including the title characters from Meredith Willson's The Music Man and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in The Saturday Evening Post on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that [...] "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him." [...] Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it [...] "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled [...] "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, {{and the use of the}} term [...] "cat" [...] to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, [...] "Even as [...] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject." ...|$|E

Otherwise the film never quite faces up to the moral implications of Sullivan and his cabbie friend, as they do business with criminals while thinking they are not doing anything wrong.

The screenwriter was Sidney Sheldon, who by the 1970s was to go on to bigger and better things in the mystery genre." ...|$|R
500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E

He stated that since he did not meet his objective of reaching the Liga MX playoffs with the club, he had nothing more to do with the Club, citing that Toluca was a big club with directors and fans that expected a lot more of the team than he could continue to offer.

2500|$|Despite the {{increasing}} international profile the boycott was garnering {{in the world}} press, the contest went ahead in Nigeria after being rescheduled to avoid taking place during Ramadan, with many prominent nations sending delegates.

[...] The trouble did not end there, however. A ThisDay (Lagos, Nigeria) newspaper editorial suggesting that Muhammad would probably have chosen one of his wives from among the contestants had he been alive to see it, resulted in inter-religious riots that started on 22 November in which over 200 {{people were killed in}} the city of Kaduna, along with many houses of worship being burned by religious zealots. Because of these riots, the 2002 pageant was moved to London, following widely circulated reports that the representatives of Canada and Korea had withdrawn from the contest and returned to their respective countries out of safety concerns. A fatwa urging the beheading of the woman who wrote the offending words, Isioma Daniel, was issued in Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant Saudi Arabian authorities.

50|$|As in all {{societies}} {{of the ancient}} Near East, it was {{the duty of the}} priests {{to keep track of the}} calendar so that agricultural activities and religious festivals could be conducted at the proper time. In the case of Israel, there was the extra responsibility of keeping track of the years so that it would be known when Sabbatical and Jubilee years were due. The seven-year Sabbatical cycle was short enough that there should have been <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> which year <b>it</b> was in a Sabbatical cycle, and the fact that at the end of seven Sabbatical cycles the Jubilee was due provided a more extended means of measuring the years. The Jubilee and Sabbatical year legislation therefore provided a long-term means for dating events, a fact that must have become obvious soon after the legislation was put into effect. It is of some interest, then, that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate Sanhedrin 40a,b) records that in the time of the judges, legal events such as contracts or criminal cases were dated according to the Jubilee cycle, the Sabbatical cycle within the Jubilee cycle, and the year within the Sabbatical cycle. Keeping track of the years of these cycles would therefore have served a societal purpose in addition to their importance as specified in the Mosaic legislation. The Samaritan community apparently used this method of dating as late as the 14th century AD, when an editor of one of the writings of the Samaritans wrote that he finished his work in the sixty-first Jubilee cycle since the entry into Canaan, in the fourth year of the fifth Sabbatical of that cycle. These cases of usage of the Jubilee/Sabbatical cycles make no provision for the possibility of the Sabbatical cycles being out of phase with the Jubilee cycles, which is additional evidence that the Jubilee was contemporaneous with the seventh Sabbatical year.|$|R
