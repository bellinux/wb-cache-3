Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ, but only in conjunction with elements such as schooling, money, and <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> from childhood onwards. In 2003, he and colleagues published a study showing that heritability was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status (SES) people than among low SES people, i.e., genes influenced differences between children's test scores more among high SES than among low SES children.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{close to}} 1 billion people suffer from hunger and food insecurity, defined as {{not having enough}} {{calories}} to live a healthy life. While this number is staggering, {{the number of people}} with poor access to <b>nutritious</b> <b>foods</b> rich in essential micronutrients—such as fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, dairy products, and biofortified staple foods—is even more daunting. Deficiencies in micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc affect the survival, health, development, and well-being of billions of people; low fruit and vegetable consumption is also associated with increased risk of chronic diseases. Increasing poor people’s consumption of <b>nutritious</b> <b>foods</b> is therefore essential to solving malnutrition in all its forms. Limited availability, economic constraints, lack of knowledge and information, and related lack of demand for <b>nutritious</b> <b>foods</b> are critical factors that limit poor people’s access to such foods. In theory, the agriculture sector could help address this problem by helping at-risk groups generate more income and by making <b>nutritious</b> <b>foods</b> more available, affordable, acceptable, and of higher quality.

The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes.

25|$|Most amphipods are detritivores or scavengers, {{with some}} being grazers of algae, omnivores or predators of small insects and crustaceans. Food is grasped {{with the front}} two pairs of legs, which are armed with large claws. More {{immobile}} species of amphipods eat higher quantities of less <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> rather than actively seeking more <b>nutritious</b> <b>food.</b> This {{is a type of}} compensatory feeding. This behaviour may have evolved to minimise predation risk when searching for other foods. Ampithoe longimana, for example, is more sedentary than other species and have been observed to remain on host plants longer. In fact, when presented with both high- and low-nutrition food options, the sedentary species Ampithoe longimana does not distinguish between the two options. Other amphipod species, such as Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis, which have superior predator avoidance and are more mobile, are better able to pursue different food sources. In species without the compensatory feeding ability, survivorship, fertility, and growth can be strongly negatively affected in the absence of high-quality food. Compensatory feeding may also explain the year-round presence of A.longimana in certain waters. Because algal presence changes throughout the year in certain communities, the evolution of flexible feeding techniques such as compensatory feeding may have been beneficial to survival.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations {{where there is}} a lack of <b>nutritious</b> <b>food,</b> but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutrition is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kwashiorkor, a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect physical and mental development. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, oysters were cheap and mainly eaten by the working class. Throughout the 19th century, oyster beds in New York Harbor became the {{largest source of}} oysters worldwide. On any day in the late 19th century, six million oysters could be found on barges tied up along the city's waterfront. They were {{naturally}} quite popular in New York City, and helped initiate the city's restaurant trade. New York's oystermen became skilled cultivators of their beds, which provided employment for hundreds of workers and <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> for thousands. Eventually, rising demand exhausted many of the beds. To increase production, they introduced foreign species, which brought disease; effluent and increasing sedimentation from erosion destroyed most of the beds by the early 20th century. Oysters' popularity has put ever-increasing demands on wild oyster stocks. This scarcity increased prices, converting them from their original role as working-class food to their current status as an expensive delicacy.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} {{pioneering}} {{a program that}} has now {{become part of the}} World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of <b>nutritious</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} types {{of access to}} food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere. Location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on. The assets of a household, including income, land, products of labor, inheritances, and gifts can determine a household's access to food. However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services. Demographics and education levels {{of members of the}} household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that are purchased. A household's access to enough and <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> may not assure adequate food intake of all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household. The USDA adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways, without, for example, resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies.|$|E
