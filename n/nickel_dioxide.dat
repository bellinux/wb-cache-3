50|$|When {{constructing}} bulk-heterojunction solar cells, p-type {{nickel oxide}} {{is an effective}} anode layer. Its function as a wide band-gap semiconductor helps planarize the anode surface, and helps maximum photon flu to reach the active layer. In this case, NiO thickness was also measured, and increasing the thickness decreases cell efficiency. In these cells, nickel oxide replaces poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, or PEDOT:PSS, resulting in a dramatic increases in performance while still maintaining stability of the cell. Compared to the cadmium selenide cell, <b>nickel</b> <b>dioxide</b> cells provide a power-conversion efficiency to 5.2%.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{applicability}} {{and accuracy}} of the generalized active space self-consistent field, (GASSCF), and (SplitGAS) methods are presented. The GASSCF method enables the exploration of larger active spaces than with the conventional complete active space SCF, (CASSCF), by fragmentation of a large space into subspaces and by controlling the interspace excitations. In the SplitGAS method, the GAS configuration interaction, CI, expansion is further partitioned in two parts: the principal, which includes the most important configuration state functions, and an extended, containing less relevant but not negligible ones. An effective Hamiltonian is then generated, with the extended part acting as a perturbation to the principal space. Excitation energies of ozone, furan, pyrrole, <b>nickel</b> <b>dioxide,</b> and copper tetrachloride dianion are reported. Various partitioning schemes of the GASSCF and SplitGAS CI expansions are considered and compared with the complete active space followed by second-order perturbation theory, (CASPT 2), and multireference CI method, (MRCI), or available experimental data. General guidelines for the optimum applicability of these methods are discussed together with their current limitations. 1...|$|E

40|$|Nickel {{hydroxide}} and {{manganese dioxide}} {{are used in}} alkaline cells as positive electrode materials. Positive electrodes comprising a <b>nickel</b> oxyhydroxide/manganese <b>dioxide</b> composite, with modification by Bi 2 O 3, deliver a combined reversible discharge capacity of 2. 25 e per metal atom (650 mAh g− 1 metal content), which is higher than that realized from electrodes of either component taken singly. The composite discharges with two potential plateaux, the first appearing at 325 mV corresponds to the discharge of the nickel component, whereas the second at − 600 mV {{is due to the}} manganese component.

40|$|We {{developed}} a hybrid nanoimprint-soft lithography technique with sub- 15 nm resolution. It {{is capable of}} patterning both flat and curved substrates. The key component of the technology is the mold, which consists of rigid features on an elastic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) support. The mold was fabricated by imprinting a reverse image onto the PDMS substrate using a UV-curable low-viscosity prepolymer film. Patterns with sub- 15 -nm resolution were faithfully duplicated on a flat substrate without applying external pressure. Gratings at 200 nm pitch were also successfully imprinted onto the cylindrical surface of a single mode optical fiber with a 125 µm diameter. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has been demonstrated as a high-throughput and low cost lithographic technique with sub- 10 nm resolution. 1, 2 It has significant potential for various fields, such as electronics, 3 photonics, 4 bit-patterned media, 5 and biological applications. 6 The mold (also called a “stamp” or “template ” in soft lithography 7 and in step and flash imprint lithography 8) is the crucial component for NIL and is typically fabricated on a stiff material such as silicon, <b>nickel,</b> silicon <b>dioxide,</b> or quartz.

40|$|As {{applications}} for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation have been identified, {{the demand for}} better optics has also increased. Thorium and thorium oxide thin films (19 to 61 nm thick) were RF-sputtered and characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), spectroscopic ellipsometry, low-angle x-ray diffraction (LAXRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) {{in order to assess}} their capability as EUV reflectors. Their reflectance and absorption at different energies were also measured and analyzed at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley. The reflectance of oxidized thorium is reported between 2 and 32 nm at 5, 10, and 15 degrees from grazing. The imaginary component of the complex index of refraction, β, is also reported between 12. 5 and 18 nm. Thin films of thorium were found to reflect better between 6. 5 and 9. 4 nm at 5 degrees from grazing than all other known materials, including iridium, gold, <b>nickel,</b> uranium <b>dioxide,</b> and uranium nitride. The measured reflectance does not coincide with reflectance curves calculated from the Center for X-Ray Optics (CXRO) atomic scattering factor data. We observe large energy shifts of up to 20 eV, suggesting the need for better film characterization and possibly an update of the tabulated optical constants...|$|R
50|$|Nickel malonate, {{and nickel}} {{hydrogen}} malonate both crystallise with two molecules of water. They decomposes when heated to yield gaseous water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ethanol, acetic acid, methyl formate and ethyl formate. Nickel acetate exists {{as an intermediate}} and the final result is that solid nickel, nickel oxide, Ni3C and carbon remain. With malonate nickel can form a bis-malonato-nickelate anion, which can form double salts. Nickel maleate {{can be made from}} maleic acid and nickel carbonate in boiling water. A dihydrate crystallises from the water solution. Nickel fumarate prepared from fumaric acid and nickel carbonate is pale green as a tetrahydrate, and mustard coloured as an anhydride. It decomposes when heated to 300° to 340° in vacuum. Decompostion mostly produces <b>nickel</b> carbide, carbon <b>dioxide,</b> carbon monoxide and methane. But also produced were butanes, benzene, toluene, and organic acid.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of the}} [...] "Fleet {{study in}} {{electric}} mobility" [...] project that began in 2008, VW developed 20 Golf Variant twinDRIVE plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. These research vehicles have an all-electric range of 57 km and {{the internal combustion engine}} provides for a total range of 900 km. The plug-in hybrid drive of the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is equipped with either an 11.2 kWh or a 13.2 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, as Volkswagen is testing packs from two vendors. Ten vehicles are equipped with batteries from the American-German manufacturer GAIA with cathode type <b>nickel</b> cobalt aluminium <b>dioxide</b> (NCA). The other ten are powered by lithium-ion batteries with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathodes from the Korean-German joint venture SB LiMotive (Samsung and Bosch). These 10 vehicles have been in use since early 2011. Both battery systems offer high power and energy density. They each weigh about 150 kg.

30|$|Ni/(C, silicides) nanocapsules were {{fabricated}} by the {{arc discharge}} method {{as described in}} [8]. A mixture of <b>nickel</b> and silicon <b>dioxide</b> powders with a mole ratio of Ni/SiO 2 [*]=[*] 96 : 4 was compacted into a target and used as an anode. A graphite needle served as a cathode. A mixture gas of high-purity Ar (2.0 [*]×[*] 104 Pa) and H 2 (4.0 [*]×[*] 103 Pa) was introduced into the evacuated chamber (5.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 Pa) serving {{as the source of}} plasma. Twenty milliliters of 99.7 % C 2 H 5 OH was introduced into the chamber as the carbon source. During the experimental process, the current was maintained at 80 A, and the voltage, at 18 V. The products were collected from the chamber after passivation for 12 h in Ar atmosphere. In order to study the effects of inclusions of silicides on the absorption properties of Ni/(C, silicides) nanocapsules, Ni/C nanocapsules were also prepared using a pure Ni target as an anode under the same conditions.|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{reduction}} of Cr(VI) in aqueous solution was carried out through some batch photocatalytic studies. The photocatalysts used were silica coated nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NiFe 2 O 4 -SiO 2), <b>nickel</b> ferrite titanium <b>dioxide</b> (NiFe 2 O 4 -TiO 2), nickel ferrite silica titanium dioxide (NiFe 2 O 4 -SiO 2 -TiO 2), and titanium dioxide (TiO 2). The characterization of the materials prepared via stepwise synthesis using coprecipitation and sol-gel methods were carried out {{with the aid of}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The reduction efficiency was studied as a function of pH, photocatalyst dose, and contact time. The effects of silica interlayer between the magnetic photocatalyst materials reveal that reduction efficiency of NiFe 2 O 4 -SiO 2 -TiO 2 towards Cr(VI) was higher than that of NiFe 2 O 4 -TiO 2. However, TiO 2 was observed to have the highest reduction efficiency at all batch photocatalytic experiments. Kinetics study shows that photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) obeyed Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and first-order rate kinetics. Regenerability study also suggested that the photocatalyst materials can be reused...|$|R
40|$|Layered Li[Li 0. 2 Mn 0. 56 Ni 0. 16 Co 0. 08]O- 2 cathode {{materials}} were synthesized via a solid-state reaction for Li-ion batteries, in which lithium hydroxide monohydrate, manganese <b>dioxide,</b> <b>nickel</b> monoxide, and cobalt monoxide were employed as metal precursors. To uncover {{the relationship between}} the structure and electrochemical properties of the materials, synthesis conditions such as calcination temperature and time as well as quenching methods were investigated. For the synthesized Li[Li 0. 2 Mn 0. 56 Ni 0. 16 Co 0. 08]O- 2 materials, the metal components were found to be in the form of Mn 4 +, Ni 2 +, and Co 3 +, and their molar ratio was in good agreement with stoichiometric ratio of 0. 56 : 0. 16 : 0. 08. Among them, the one synthesized at 800 degrees C for 12 h and subsequently quenched in air showed the best electrochemical performances, which had an initial discharge specific capacity and coulombic efficiency of 265. 6 mAh/g and 84. 0 %, respectively, and when cycled at 0. 5, 1, and 2 C, the corresponding discharge specific capacities were 237. 3, 212. 6, and 178. 6 mAh/g, respectively. After recovered to 0. 1 C rate, the discharge specific capacity became 259. 5 mAh/g and the capacity loss was only 2. 3 % of the initial value at 0. 1 C. This work suggests that the solid-state synthesis route is easy for preparing high performance Li[Li 0. 2 Mn 0. 56 Ni 0. 16 Co 0. 08]O- 2 cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.

40|$|Self-assembling micron-scale {{structures}} {{based on}} standard photolithographic and thin film deposition techniques are investigated. Differences in residual stress between successive thin film layers causes the structures {{to roll up}} when an underlying sacrificial layer is removed. The primary structure of interest was a swiss-roll structure comprised of alternating layers of metal and insulator so that the self-assembled system forms an RCL electrical circuit with a well-defined resonant frequency. So-called nanoscroll structures, comprised of two swiss-rolls attached at a common end, were the most commonly observed fabrication result {{and are expected to}} have electrical properties very similar to swiss rolls. It has been predicted that such electrical properties lead to, a negative effective magnetic permeability for a narrow frequency band, potentially in the far infrared region. These structures thus can contribute a vital component ([mu]eff < 0) necessary for developing a LHM (left-handed material). Many successful materials combinations have been demonstrated. The layers in the recommended system are (from the bottom up) silicon dioxide, chrome, gold, and chrome. The smallest rollup diameter was achieved for a system of <b>nickel</b> on silicon <b>dioxide</b> and was measured to be 2 [mu]m. Processing conditions such as film thickness and releasing etchant were also optimized. The mechanical behavior of the films was modeled using standard beam theory modified for application to thin films and predicted stresses that are comparable to those found in literature. Other applications for these rollup structures were considered, including a high-speed switching polarizer. Fold-up structures that self-assemble into origami-like shapes due(cont.) to the same basic principles were also fabricated, though an application for them was not identified. by James Stanley Cybulski.
