In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E

5|$|Other {{investigations}} (such {{as blood}} tests and viral culture) are discouraged, {{as they may}} cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway. While viral cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, {{can be used to}} confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In those who do <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E

5|$|Anti-communist {{resistance}} in Poland was also bolstered, {{and a group}} of opposition leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub Krzywego Koła (Skewed Wheel Club) in Warsaw. It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy, and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland did <b>not</b> <b>improve,</b> contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E
5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success did <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E

PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese. This policy further damaged relations.
