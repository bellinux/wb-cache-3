5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E

The restaurant used to be frequented by Mannerheim and Mannerheim’s table at the Savoy was always reserved and, out of respect, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> consider demanding to be seated there. Savoy still today keeps a similar style decor and menu as in the days of Mannerheim.|$|E

John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

But Satanta could not bring himself to be quiet.

2500|$|As Wilhelm himself {{stated in}} private [...] "in {{order not to}} alarm world opinion", the Kaiser left on his annual North Sea cruise. Shortly after, Wilhelm's close friend Gustav Krupp von Bohlen wrote that the Emperor had told him: He [...] would declare war at once, if Russia mobilized. This time people would {{see that he was}} not [...] "falling out". The Emperor's {{repeated}} protestations that in this case <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> again be able to reproach him with indecision were almost comic to hear In the same way, Berchtold suggested that Austrian leaders go on vacation [...] "to prevent any disquiet" [...] about what had been decided.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} episode of series sixteen, Hammond {{suggested}} that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> {{want to own}} a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be [...] "lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence, asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket {{with a hole in}} the middle on as a coat." [...] Hammond finished with the remark [...] "I'm sorry, but can you imagine waking up and remembering you're Mexican?!" [...] Following complaints, the BBC defended the broadcast of this segment on the grounds that such national stereotyping was a [...] "robust part" [...] of traditional British humour.|$|E

[...] Wild animals had torn parts of the body, especially the upper torso, apart. This forced forensics to identify the body with a DNA match. Police {{think it is very}} probable that she was the victim of a rape-murder crime. Although on September 19, 2007, the police said, they didn't find any evidence that she was raped before or after she was murdered. The cause of her death was toluol poisoning.|$|R

The chapter on him is entitled [...] "Entering the Mainstream" [...] - but Finkelstein considers that, {{were it not for}} the likes of Lipstadt, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have heard of Arthur Butz. Holocaust deniers have as much influence in the US as the Flat Earth Society (p.69).

2500|$|Minos {{justified}} his accession as {{king and}} prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull {{out of the}} sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided to substitute a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë, Minos' wife, with zoophilia. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasiphaë was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated [...] "chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" [...] called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To make sure <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> know the secret of who the Minotaur was {{and how to get}} out of the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E
2500|$|Latvian President Andris Bērziņš urged a {{thorough}} and conclusive {{investigation of the}} MH17 disaster to pinpoint the perpetrators responsible for the downed passenger airliner.

He added [...] "the guilty must be punished so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> again feel the itch to play with such heavy sophisticated weapons without considering the consequences" [...] – [...] "let it loose, see where it hits". While Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has banned three popular Russian musicians - Oleg Gazmanov, Joseph Kobzon and Alla Perfilova from travelling to Latvia for an indefinite period of time. The {{decision has been made}} in accordance with the Immigration Law and Rinkēvičs previously announced that he had decided to ban [...] "apologists of Russian imperialism and aggression from attending [...] "high society" [...] events in Latvia".

50|$|The {{first story}} holds that in 1869, {{a man named}} William Jones, while chasing his cows about a pasture, {{stumbled}} across some quartz with gold flecks dotting it. The site was so remote and so far above town, that he erroneously assumed <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> find it. Contented, he continued on his way, gathering his stray cattle. When he returned later {{to the site of}} the gold lode, however, he found others working the claim. He tried to relate his tale of the discovery to the other miners, but they would have none of it, and ran him off.|$|R

5000|$|As with Orthodox Judaism, capital {{punishment}} and animal sacrifice are not practiced {{because there are}} strict Biblical conditions on how these are to be practiced, requiring a functioning Temple in Jerusalem with its Levite priesthood. When the power of {{capital punishment}} is available, often its exercise is only after exhausting loopholes in Torah which are used to set a suspect free.
