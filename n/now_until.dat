25|$|The Battle of the Nablus Plain {{ranks with}} Ludendorff's Black Days of the German Army in {{the effect that}} it had on the {{consciousness}} of the Turkish General Staff. It was now apparent to all but the most diehard nationalists that the Turks were finished in the war. In spite of the great victories in Armenia and in Azerbaijan, Turkey was now in an indefensible condition, which could not be remedied with the resources on hand. It was also apparent that the disintegration of the Bulgarian Army at Salonika and the dissolution of the Austro–Hungarian Army spelled disaster and defeat for the Central Powers. From <b>now</b> <b>until</b> the Armistice, the focus of the Turkish strategy would be to retain as much Ottoman territory as possible.|$|E

[...] MuuMuse editor Bradley Stern commended Minogue's breathy delivery and felt that its instrumentation and Minogue's vocals were reminiscent of [...] "I Believe in You". Stern rated it five out of five stars and concluded that [...] " [...] a sing-along track, it's sad disco, it's everything you've been waiting for." [...] The Popjustice review of the song was also positive; they pointed out that it would please fans of the singer and become the [...] "sound of dancefloor stampedes from <b>now</b> <b>until</b> the end of time" [...] due to its mature style.
