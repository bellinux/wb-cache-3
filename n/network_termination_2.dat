50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>Termination</b> 1 (NT1) or <b>Network</b> <b>Termination</b> type 1 {{refers to}} {{equipment}} in an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) that physically and electrically terminates the network at the customer's premises.

In a Basic Rate Interface, the NT1 connects to line termination (LT) {{equipment in the}} provider's telephone exchange via the local loop two wire U interface and to customer equipment via the four wire S interface or T interface. The S and T interfaces are electrically equivalent, and the customer equipment port of a NT1 is often labelled as S/T interface. There are many types of NT1 available.|$|R

50|$|The router {{provides}} the logical <b>network</b> <b>termination.</b> Common link access methods include PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE), PPP over ATM (PPPoA) encapsulated sessions, bridged Ethernet over ATM or Frame Relay (RFC 1483/RFC 1490), {{or just plain}} Ethernet. In the case of ATM or Frame Relay based access, individual subscribers are identified by Virtual Circuit IDs. Subscribers connected over Ethernet-based remote access devices are usually identified by VLAN IDs or MPLS tags.

INTRODUCTION Within the project "ATM Radio in the Local Loop" (RL/A), sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the focus project 'ATMmobil', a RLL-HW-Demonstrator (Radio in the Local Loop) has been developed and was tested in the EU sponsored ACTS-project 'AMUSE'.

5000|$|A {{hardware}} loop is {{a simple}} device that physically connects the receiver channel to the transmitter channel. In {{the case of a}} <b>network</b> <b>termination</b> connector such as X.21, this is typically done by simply connecting the pins together in the connector.

50|$|The U {{interface}} or U {{reference point}} is a Basic Rate Interface (BRI) in the local loop of an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).

It is not as distance sensitive as a service using an S interface or T interface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{subscriber}} line {{interface circuit}} (SLIC) provides DC power, ringing and supervision functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone {{is a prerequisite}} but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs have also been used in Terminal Adapters (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and <b>Network</b> <b>Termination</b> (NT) applications. This application note provides a detailed design procedure for the flyback transformer {{that can be used}} with MAX 1856 in SLIC power supplies. The MAX 1856 offers a low cost solution for generating subscriber line interface circuits (SLIC) power supplies. The SLIC provides DC power, ringing and supervision functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone is a prerequisite but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs which incorporate the ringer function, have been used in Terminal Adapters (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and <b>Network</b> <b>Termination</b> (NT) applications. This document presents a sampling of power supply reference designs for use with typical SLICs in two- channel and four-channel POTS loops. Each application has specialized requirements depending on the number of channels serviced and loop length. The requirements for three typical applications are presented in Table 1...|$|R
