5|$|Animal test based studies (mice) with aqueous {{extracts}} of Amanita abrupta {{have demonstrated}} hepatotoxic potential. Liver cell <b>necrosis</b> can be encountered. 2-Amino-4,5-hexadienoic acid {{is associated with}} these effects.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat <b>necrosis</b> may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat <b>necrosis</b> is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by <b>necrosis</b> or by apoptosis. In contrast to <b>necrosis,</b> which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of <b>necrosis</b> occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular <b>necrosis</b> and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|Less {{severe trauma}} might contuse the bone to cause {{an area of}} <b>necrosis</b> which might then separate.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked by}} {{complications}} of massive liver <b>necrosis</b> leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the liver <b>necrosis</b> runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin <b>necrosis,</b> which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin <b>necrosis</b> and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel {{and other}} sources, during the {{physical}} after the trade, Favre {{was diagnosed with}} avascular <b>necrosis</b> of the hip, the same degenerative condition that ended running back Bo Jackson's football career, and doctors recommended his physical be failed, which would nullify the trade. Wolf overruled them.|$|E
5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} the leaves, as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip <b>necrosis</b> virus (NTNV) which produces <b>necrosis</b> of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|Drilling at high speed: After {{reflecting}} the soft tissue, {{and using a}} surgical guide or stent as necessary, pilot holes are placed with precision drills at highly regulated speed to prevent burning or pressure <b>necrosis</b> of the bone.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mold-like fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection {{results in}} <b>necrosis</b> of the {{mushroom}} tissue, {{and a yellow}} color caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin <b>necrosis</b> in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin <b>necrosis</b> is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, <b>necrosis</b> will spread, causing skin, {{subcutaneous}} tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of <b>necrosis</b> (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal <b>necrosis</b> and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Protein C {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} purpura fulminans, a severe clotting disorder in the newborn {{that leads to}} both tissue death and bleeding into the skin and other organs. The condition has also been described in adults. Protein C and protein S deficiency have also been {{associated with an increased}} risk of skin <b>necrosis</b> on commencing anticoagulant treatment with warfarin or related drugs.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp <b>necrosis</b> (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp <b>necrosis,</b> the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain {{is generally}} {{more severe than}} bites from the copperhead, but less so than those from rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites, although <b>necrosis</b> can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and <b>necrosis</b> within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral <b>necrosis</b> of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|The mucosal {{lining of}} the trachea may also be injured by {{inhalation}} of hot gases or harmful fumes such as chlorine gas. This can lead to edema (swelling), <b>necrosis</b> (death of the tissue), scar formation, and ultimately stenosis. However, TBI due to inhalation, foreign body aspiration, and medical procedures is uncommon.|$|E
5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can {{be performed}} to show <b>necrosis</b> of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is {{used to assess the}} degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{should not}} be given to people with heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} until platelet count has improved or normalised. Warfarin is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency as these thrombophilic conditions {{increase the risk of}} skin <b>necrosis,</b> which is a rare but serious side effect associated with warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver <b>necrosis</b> with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic <b>necrosis,</b> a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and <b>necrosis</b> are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular <b>Necrosis</b> of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. <b>Necrosis</b> and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, Emery {{was placed}} on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally {{expected}} to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when {{it was discovered that}} he had avascular <b>necrosis.</b> In March 2010, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren announced that Emery would be out for remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor <b>necrosis</b> factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to <b>necrosis</b> of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{taste of}} the fruit body may have some role in insects {{avoiding}} it. The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T.felleus in North America, though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in <b>necrosis</b> of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} causes of <b>necrosis,</b> {{and as such}} {{treatment}} is based upon how the <b>necrosis</b> came about. Treatment of <b>necrosis</b> typically involves two distinct processes: Usually, the underlying cause of the <b>necrosis</b> must be treated before the dead tissue itself can be dealt with.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{pancreatitis}} (acute hemorrhagic pancreatic <b>necrosis)</b> {{is characterized by}} acute inflammation and <b>necrosis</b> of pancreas parenchyma, focal enzymic <b>necrosis</b> of pancreatic fat and vessel <b>necrosis</b> (hemorrhage). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes. Lipase activation produces the <b>necrosis</b> of fat tissue in pancreatic interstitium and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (hematoxylinophilic). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. Inflammatory infiltrate is rich in neutrophils. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and <b>necrosis</b> can extend to include fascial layers {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Aponecrosis is {{a hybrid}} of {{apoptosis}} and <b>necrosis</b> and refers to an incomplete apoptotic process that is completed by <b>necrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Avascular <b>necrosis</b> (aseptic bone <b>necrosis)</b> {{of the hip}} {{and other}} major joints may occur {{as a result of}} ischaemia.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, <b>necrosis</b> {{was thought}} to be an {{unregulated}} process. There are two broad pathways in which <b>necrosis</b> may occur in an organism.|$|E
25|$|Coagulative <b>necrosis</b> is {{characterized}} by the formation of a gelatinous (gel-like) substance in dead tissues in which the architecture of the tissue is maintained, and can be observed by light microscopy. Coagulation occurs as a result of protein denaturation, causing albumin to transform into a firm and opaque state. This pattern of <b>necrosis</b> is typically seen in hypoxic (low-oxygen) environments, such as infarction. Coagulative <b>necrosis</b> occurs primarily in tissues such as the kidney, heart and adrenal glands. Severe ischemia most commonly causes <b>necrosis</b> of this form.|$|E
