5|$|The Oriental Republic of Uruguay in South America had been, {{since its}} {{independence}} in 1828, troubled by strife between the Blanco Party and the Colorado Party. They were not {{political parties in}} the modern sense, but factions that engaged in internecine rebellion whenever the other dominated the government. The nation was deeply divided into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron–client relationships fostered by local caudillos in the cities and countryside. Rather than a unity based upon common <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments,</b> each had differing aims and loyalties informed by their respective, insular political frameworks.|$|E
25|$|India's {{concept of}} {{nationhood}} is based not merely on territorial extent of its sovereignty. <b>Nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> and expression encompass that India's ancient history, as {{the birthplace of}} the Indus Valley Civilization and Vedic Civilization, as well as four major world religions – Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Indian nationalists see India stretching along these lines across the Indian Subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{after the}} {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union after which the newly independent Ukraine was able to choose its own currency, trial runs of coins of 1 shah and 50 shahiv were issued, but were not approved. Therefore, the kopiyka (копійка) was confirmed as a numismatic term for Ukrainian currency, despite <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> that kopiyka (Ukrainian for Russian kopeyka) is a Russian term.|$|E
50|$|While {{some historians}} and philologists {{continue}} {{to question the}} text's authenticity for various reasons (for example, believing that it has an uncharacteristically modern <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment)</b> (Omeljan Pritsak inter alia), linguists are not so skeptical. The overall scholarly consensus accepts Slovo's authenticity.|$|R

50|$|Orwell {{discusses}} {{nationalism and}} argues that it causes people to disregard common sense and to become more ignorant towards facts. Orwell shows his concern for the social state of Europe {{and the rest of}} the world because of the increasing influence of <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment</b> in a large number of countries.|$|R
25|$|Indian {{nationalism}} {{is as much}} a diverse blend of <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> as its people are ethnically and religiously diverse. Thus the most influential undercurrents are more than just Indian in nature. The most controversial and emotionally charged fibre in the fabric of Indian {{nationalism is}} religion. Religion forms a major, and in many cases, the central element of Indian life. Ethnic communities are diverse in terms of linguistics, social traditions and history across India.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} before the war, the Dutch had been {{overwhelmingly}} successful in suppressing the small nationalist movement in Indonesia {{such that the}} Japanese proved fundamental for coming Indonesian independence. During the occupation, the Japanese encouraged and backed Indonesian <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments,</b> created new Indonesian institutions, and promoted nationalist leaders such as Sukarno. The openness now provided to Indonesian nationalism, combined with the Japanese destruction {{of much of the}} Dutch colonial state, were fundamental to the Indonesian National Revolution that followed World War Two.|$|E
25|$|During the 1940s and 50s, vanguard Central African {{nationalist}} {{and first}} Prime Minister of the autonomous territory, Barthélemy Boganda, explicitly equated himself to Karnou and utilised the mass {{appeal of the}} rebellion to successfully mobilise <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> among Central Africans for political purposes. Boganda incidentally {{died in a plane}} crash in Lobaye, near where one version of the story tells of Karnou having seen a sign from God in the form of a shooting star. Boganda's former lieutenant, Abel Goumba, also overtly identified with the story in his nationalist movement against the alleged French puppet, President David Dacko.|$|E
50|$|Some neo-Nazi {{organizations}} {{continue to}} use the swastika, but many have moved away from such inflammatory symbols of early fascism. Some neo-fascist groups use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika or other cultural or ancestral symbols that may evoke <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment</b> but do not carry the same racist connotations.|$|R
5000|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and Armenian Revolutionary Federation (also {{known as}} [...] "Dashnak"), were two Armenian {{organizations}} of Armenian national movement {{active in the}} region. In 1894, Sultan Abdul Hamid II began to target the Armenian people in a precursor of the Hamidian massacres. This persecution strengthened <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment</b> among Armenians.|$|R
50|$|The German Hunting Terrier Club (Deutscher Jagdterrier-Club) {{was founded}} in 1926, and the dog was warmly embraced {{in part because it}} fit well with the rising <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment</b> within Germany at the time. It did not hurt at all that Lutz Heck was a darling of the Nazi regime and counted Hermann Göring among his closest friends.|$|R
25|$|Following World War II, <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> were on {{the rise}} in the Middle East; most notable being Iranian nationalism, and Arab Nationalism. In Iran, the AIOC and the pro-western Iranian {{government}} led by Prime Minister Ali Razmara resisted nationalist calls to revise AIOC's concession terms in Iran's favour. In March 1951, Razmara was assassinated and Mohammed Mossadeq, a nationalist, was elected as the new prime minister by the Majlis of Iran (parliament). In April 1951, the Iranian government nationalised the Iranian oil industry by unanimous vote, and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) was formed, displacing the AIOC. The AIOC withdrew its management from Iran, and Britain organized an effective worldwide embargo of Iranian oil. The British government, which owned the AIOC, contested the nationalisation at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, but its complaint was dismissed.|$|E
500|$|A {{reconciliation}} of these views {{is suggested by}} William Atwood: [...] "Undoubtedly [...] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> {{and a sense of}} cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World... While some sought solace in , others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people..." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, the <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> that {{exacerbated}} the naval arms race {{gave way to}} slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead. Commenting on this, the United States' Minister to Chile, Henry Prather Fletcher, wrote to Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan: [...] "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps {{they are much more}} in need of money than of battleships." ...|$|E
50|$|The first spurts of <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment</b> {{that rose}} amongst Congress members were when {{the desire to}} be {{represented}} in the bodies of government, to have a say, a vote in the lawmaking and issues of administration of India. Congressmen saw themselves as loyalists, but wanted an active role in governing their own country, albeit as part of the Empire.|$|R
50|$|The {{release of}} the film coincided with World War II {{and the quest for}} Swaraj or Quit India at its peak. In India, the {{political}} atmosphere was tense, following Gandhi's call to civil disobedience. Sikander further aroused patriotic feelings and <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment.</b> Thus, though Sikander was approved by the Bombay censor board, it was later banned from some of the theatres serving British Indian Army cantonments.|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} parties {{created in the}} wake of the country's defeat in World War I combined <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment</b> and occultist practices to forge an image of a superior German people. Hitler's imprisonment after the failed 1923 Munich Beer Hall Putsch would make him a national hero for his defense of a strong German state, convincing him that he was the Messiah who could save Germany.|$|R
2500|$|The {{invasion}} {{is often}} recognized as making Castro even more popular, adding <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> {{to the support}} for his economic policies. Following the air attacks on Cuban airfields on 15 April, he declared the revolution [...] "Marxist-Leninist". After the invasion, he pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union, partly for protection, that helped {{pave the way for}} the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Castro was then increasingly wary of further US intervention, and more open to Soviet suggestions of placing nuclear weapons on Cuba to ensure its security.|$|E
2500|$|Marxism {{was also}} {{introduced}} into Vietnam {{with the emergence}} of three separate Communist parties; the Indochinese Communist Party, Annamese Communist Party and the Indochinese Communist Union, joined later by a Trotskyist movement led by Tạ Thu Thâu. In 1930, the Communist International (Comintern) sent Nguyễn Ái Quốc to Hong Kong to coordinate the unification of the parties into the Vietnamese Communist Party (CPV) with Trần Phú as the first Secretary General. Later the party changed its name to the Indochinese Communist Party as the Comintern, under Stalin, did not favor <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Being a leftist revolutionary living in France since 1911, Nguyễn Ái Quốc participated in founding the French Communist Party and in 1924 traveled to the Soviet Union to join the Comintern. Through the late 1920s, he acted as a Comintern agent to help build Communist movements in Southeast Asia. During the 1930s, the CPV was nearly wiped out under French suppression with the execution of top leaders such as Phú, Lê Hồng Phong, and Nguyễn Văn Cừ.|$|E
2500|$|Middle Persian was a {{lingua franca}} {{of the region}} before the Arab invasion, but {{afterwards}} Arabic became a preferred medium of literary expression. Instrumental in {{the spread of the}} Persian language as a common language along the Silk Road between China and Parthia in the second century BCE, that lasted well into the sixteenth century, were many Bukharian Jews who flocked to Bukhara in the Central Asia and as a merchant class played a great role in the operation of the Silk Road. In the ninth century emerged a new Persian language as the idiom of administration and literature. Tahirids and Saffarids continued using Persian as an informal language, although for them Arabic was the [...] "only proper language for recording anything worthwhile, from poetry to science", but the Samanids made Persian a language of learning and formal discourse. The language that appeared in the ninth and tenth centuries was a new form of Persian, based on the Middle Persian of pre-Islamic times, but enriched by ample Arabic vocabulary and written in Arabic script. The Samanids began recording their court affairs in Arabic and in this language, and they used it as the main public idiom. The earliest great poetry in New Persian was written for the Samanid court. Samanids encouraged translation of religious works from Arabic into Persian. Even the learned authorities of Islam, the ulama, began using the Persian lingua franca in public, although they still used Arabic as a medium of scholarship. The crowning literary achievement in the early New Persian language, the Book of Kings of Ferdowsi, presented to the court of Mahmud of Ghazni (998-1030), was more than a literary achievement; {{it was a kind of}} Iranian nationalistic memoir, Ferdowsi galvanized Persian <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiments</b> by invoking pre-Islamic Persian heroic imagery. Ferdowsi enshrined in literary form the most treasured stories of popular folk-memory.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{nationalism}} {{has been}} identified as a critical component of <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment,</b> influencing cognitions, attitudes, evaluation and purchase intentions.

50|$|In January 2003, a Cambodian {{newspaper}} article falsely alleged that a Thai actress claimed that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand.

5000|$|Under French {{colonial rule}} over Dahomey, French {{authorities}} forbade the colony from having its own regional flag.

5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event.

5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted {{a large segment}} of the population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival of Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire <b>nationalistic</b> <b>sentiment.</b> He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|R
