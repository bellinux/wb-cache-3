50|$|The 1966 Cincinnati Reds season {{consisted}} of the Reds finishing in seventh place in the National League {{with a record of}} 76-84, 18 games behind the <b>NL</b> Champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers. The Reds were managed by Don Heffner (37-46) and Dave Bristol (39-38), who replaced Heffner in mid-July.|$|R
50|$|The 1966 World Series {{matched the}} American League (AL) {{champion}} Baltimore Orioles against the defending World Series champion and National League (<b>NL)</b> champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers, with the Orioles sweeping the Series {{in four games}} to capture their first championship in franchise history. It was also the last World Series played before Major League Baseball (MLB) introduced the Commissioner's Trophy the following year.|$|R
50|$|The 1966 San Francisco Giants {{season was}} the Giants' 84th year in Major League Baseball, their ninth year in San Francisco since their move from New York {{following}} the 1957 season, and their seventh at Candlestick Park. The Giants {{finished second in}} the National League with a record of 93 wins and 68 losses, a game-and-a-half behind their arch-rivals, the <b>NL</b> champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers.|$|R
25|$|The 2017 World Series was the {{championship}} series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2017 season. The 113th {{edition of the}} World Series was played between October 24 and November 1. It was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (<b>NL)</b> champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers and the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros. It {{was sponsored by the}} internet television service YouTube TV and officially known as the World Series presented by YouTube TV.|$|R
50|$|The 1966 Baltimore Orioles season {{involved}} the Orioles finishing {{first in the}} American League {{with a record of}} 97 wins and 63 losses, nine games ahead of the runner-up Minnesota Twins. It was their first AL pennant since 1944, when the club was known as the St. Louis Browns. The Orioles swept the <b>NL</b> champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers in four games to register their first-ever World Series title. The team was managed by Hank Bauer, and played their home games at Memorial Stadium.|$|R
50|$|The 1966 Chicago Cubs {{season was}} the 95th {{season of the}} Chicago Cubs franchise, the 91st in the National League and the 51st at Wrigley Field. The Cubs {{finished}} tenth and last in the National League {{with a record of}} 59-103, 36 games behind the <b>NL</b> Champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers. The Cubs would not lose 100 or more games in a season for another 46 seasons. One of the defining trades in Cubs history occurred on April 21, when the Cubs acquired future Cy Young Award winner Ferguson Jenkins in a trade with the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|R
50|$|Jaster {{spent most}} of 1966 {{in the big leagues}} where he {{finished}} with a record of 11-5 with an ERA of 3.26 which earned him a tie for 4th in the Rookie of the Year balloting for that season. The main highlight of Jaster's 1966 season, were his league leading five shutouts, all of which were against the <b>NL</b> pennant winning <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{the wheels}} {{fell off the}} [...] "Big Red Machine's" [...] {{pitching}} staff. The Reds ended {{the season with a}} 4.21 team ERA [...] - [...] third highest in the <b>NL.</b> The <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers, meanwhile, had a league leading 3.22 staff ERA to take the division by ten games over the Reds. Murray finished with a 7-2 record and 4.94 ERA his first season in Cincinnati. With the starting rotation depleted, he made his one and only career start on July 28 against the Chicago Cubs. He pitched a little over an inning, giving up six earned runs. A month into the [...] season, he was dealt to the New York Mets for Ken Henderson.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 National League Championship Series (NLCS), {{the second}} round of the 2008 National League playoffs, was a best-of-seven {{baseball}} game series. The series matched the <b>NL</b> West Champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers against the NL East Champion Philadelphia Phillies, who had home field advantage for this series due to their better regular-season record. The teams split their season series, with the home team sweeping their two four-game series in August.|$|R
25|$|The Tigers {{would not}} make the playoffs again until 2011, when they won the AL Central title {{for the first time}} with their last {{division}} title being the 1987 AL East crown. The Tigers would win the AL Central in 2012 again and would return to the World Series in 2012 after winning the 2012 American League pennant where they would be swept by the San Francisco Giants in four games. The Cardinals' would later make the playoffs in 2009, when the NL Central champions were swept by the <b>NL</b> West champions <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers in the 2009 NLDS. The Cardinals also made it to the playoffs as the Wildcard entry in 2011, winning the 2011 National League pennant and going on to beat Texas Rangers in the 2011 World Series, but failing to defend that title in the 2012 NLCS losing to the Giants in seven games.|$|R
5000|$|Hall's 1965 would {{basically}} be {{a carbon}} {{copy of the}} previous season and would see him hit career highs in average (.285), RBI (86), doubles (25), and stolen bases (14), but would also see another drop in home runs to 20. Showcasing both his power and speed, Hall not only hit 20 home runs in 1965 but also beat out 20 infield singles. He would be named to his last all-star team in the July 13 game that was played at Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium, along with five fellow Twins (first baseman Harmon Killebrew, catcher Earl Battey, pitcher Mudcat Grant, and shortstop Zoilo Versalles and Tony Oliva), and went hitless with a walk and a run in two plate appearances after pinch hitting for pitcher Pete Richert {{in the bottom of}} the fifth inning and moving over to center field in place of starter Vic Davalillo to start the sixth. Due to his struggles against lefties in 1965 (a [...]240 batting average), in a World Series against the <b>NL</b> champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers with five of the seven games started by 1965 Cy Young Award winner Sandy Koufax or fellow lefty Claude Osteen, Hall would only play in two games (both started by right hander Don Drysdale) and would strike out five times with one hit and one walk in 7 plate appearances. Instead, little used fourth outfielder Joe Nossek, who'd been to bat only 170 times and only hit [...]228 against lefties himself in 1965, but who unlike Hall was righthanded, received the bulk of the playing time in the outfield and the Twins would go down in defeat to the Dodgers four games to three.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the tutelage}} of Twins' third base coach Billy Martin, Versalles put it all {{together}} during his 1965 MVP season and led the American League in plate appearances (728), at-bats (666), runs scored (126), doubles (45), triples (12), extra-base hits (76) and total bases (308), and was second in assists (487) and third in stolen bases (27). He was a near-unanimous winner of the MVP award, receiving 19 of 20 first-place votes. The remaining first-place vote went to teammate and fellow Cuban Tony Oliva. He also led the league and set career highs in both strikeouts (122) and errors (39), which underlined his career-long struggles both at the plate and in the field in these areas. Versalles was named to his second All-Star team for the July 13 game (played in his home park, Bloomington, Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium) along with five fellow Twins (first baseman Harmon Killebrew, catcher Earl Battey, pitcher Mudcat Grant and outfielders Jimmie Hall and Tony Oliva), but went hitless with a walk in two plate appearances after subbing for starter Dick McAuliffe in the sixth inning. Before the World Series began, Versalles was pictured {{on the cover of the}} October 4 issue of Sports Illustrated and was featured in the article which discussed the Twins' chances against possible National League opponents. In the Series against the <b>NL</b> champion <b>Los</b> Angeles Dodgers, Versalles started all seven games, hit [...]286 with his only home run and all four RBI coming in the lopsided Game 1 win, but it was not enough as the Twins lost to the Dodgers four games to three.|$|R
40|$|Periodontal {{diseases}} are initiated primarily by Gram-negative, tooth-associated microbial biofilms that elicit a host response that causes osseous and soft tissue destruction. Carvedilol is a b-blocker {{used as a}} multifunctional neurohormonal antagonist that {{has been shown to}} act not only as an anti-oxidant but also as an anti-inflammatory drug. This study evaluated whether Carvedilol exerted a protective role against ligature-induced periodontitis in a rat model and defined how Carvedilol affected metalloproteinases and RANKL/RANK/OPG expression in the context of bone remodeling. Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 10 /group) : (1) non-ligated (<b>NL),</b> (2) ligature-only (<b>LO),</b> and (3) ligature plus Carvedilol (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg daily for 10 days). Periodontal tissue was analyzed for histopathlogy and using immunohistochemical analysis characterized the expression profiles of MMP- 2, MMP- 9, COX- 2, and RANKL/RANK/OPG and determined the presence of IL- 1 b, IL- 10 and TNF-a, myeloperoxidase (MPO), malonaldehyde (MDA) and, glutathione (GSH). MPO activity in the group with periodontal disease was significantly increased compared to the control group (p, 0. 05). Rats treated with 10 mg/k...|$|R
5000|$|... {{would mark}} the end of the [...] "Whiteyball" [...] era in St. Louis. Amidst poor overall team performance, Herzog {{surprisingly}} announced his retirement on July 6. In an effort to begin the team's re-building process, McGee was traded to the American League's Oakland Athletics on August 29 for 25-year-old outfielder Félix José and two minor-league players (third baseman Stan Royer and pitcher Daryl Green). McGee's brief stint with Oakland, managed by Tony La Russa, helped propel the team to the 1990 World Series. This would be McGee's fourth trip to the Fall Classic; the Athletics however were pounded in the Series as the Cincinnati Reds would sweep the defending champions in four games. Despite being traded to the AL, McGee had already accumulated 542 plate appearances in the National League, enough for him to qualify for the <b>NL</b> batting crown. <b>Los</b> Angeles' Eddie Murray (.330 average), the New York Mets' Dave Magadan (.328) and others gave chase, but as none were able to catch McGee's [...]335 NL batting mark, he won his second batting title. McGee's accomplishment marked an odd first in major league history, in which the batting champion for one league ended the season {{as a member of the}} other league. In 1990, George Brett of the Kansas City Royals led the American league with a [...]329 batting average. Because McGee's batting average over the entire season was only [...]324, neither league's batting champion led the Major Leagues in batting; that honor fell to Eddie Murray.|$|R
