This direct method was then implemented using C programming language. The source code of the implementation was given for four variables.

40|$|A multiple-variable linear {{regression}} direct solution model and a statistical model were developed for marine propeller design, optimization and prototype. Computing implementation for the direct solution model {{was made to}} create an integrated tool for the marine propeller development process. An error analysis for a simple case with only 4 independent variables was performed. This direct solution model was constructed to provide two functionalities: generation {{of a set of}} {{linear regression}} coefficients to establish a multiple-variable polynomial equation and interpolation of the multiple-variable data set that are generated by the polynomial equations. An application case was given using a set of data from a marine <b>nozzle</b> <b>propeller</b> series both to cover interpolation to produce curves and linear regression coefficients for interpolation, for both the direct solution model and the statistical model that was computed under a commercial software package. Though much higher than the statistical model, interpolation by the direct solution model showed an error of less than one-tenth of a percent for a group of nozzle propellers.

40|$|A ducted {{propeller}} {{is well known}} to offer significant advantages for bollard pull performance of tugboats. A study about <b>nozzle</b> and <b>propeller</b> shape has been done for a long time, and a Ka series propeller and a conventional 19 A nozzle is used ordinarily for a {{ducted propeller}}. In late years a demand of the energy saving becomes very high because of a remarkable rises of the fuel oil price, and high bollard pull performance are demanded for tugboats at the same horsepower. Therefore, an improved design of a ducted propeller with high bollard pull performance is required. This present paper will describe the advanced design method of a ducted propeller which has high bollard pull performance. A nozzle section shape and a propeller are newly designed by a parametric study of the numerical simulation to have higher performance than a conventional ducted propeller. And the optimum arrangement between <b>nozzle</b> and <b>propeller</b> combination is studied. In order to confirm high bollard pull performance of the improved ducted propeller, the open water tests are carried out in a towing tank of Akishima Lavoratories (MITSUI ZOSEN) Inc. After {{the evaluation of the}} test results, the ducted propeller with high bollard pull performance is designed for actual tugboat. The newly designed ducted propeller is equipped for “Z-peller ” of Niigata Power Systems Co., Ltd as a propulsor of a tugboat, and the full-scale bollard pull test is conducted in the actual field.

50|$|Kort <b>nozzles</b> or ducted <b>propellers</b> can be {{significantly}} {{more efficient than}} unducted propellers at low speeds, producing greater thrust in a smaller package. Tugboats and fishing trawlers {{are the most common}} application for Kort nozzles as highly loaded propellers on slow moving vessels benefit the most. Nozzles have the additional benefits of reducing paddlewheel-effect (e.g. the tendency of a right-hand wheel to back to the left) and reduce bottom suction while operating in shallow water.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a couple}} of {{propulsion}} techniques for AUVs. Some of them use a brushed or brush-less electric motor, gearbox, Lip seal, and a propeller which may be surrounded by a nozzle or not. All of these parts embedded in the AUV construction are involved in propulsion. Other vehicles use a thruster unit to maintain the modularity. Depending on the need, the thruster may be equipped with a <b>nozzle</b> for <b>propeller</b> collision protection or to reduce noise submission, or it may be equipped with a direct drive thruster to keep the efficiency at the highest level and the noises at the lowest level. Advanced AUV thrusters have a redundant shaft sealing system to guarantee a proper seal of the robot even if one of the seals fails during the mission.|$|R
50|$|A ducted propeller, {{also known}} as a Kort <b>nozzle,</b> is a <b>propeller</b> fitted with a {{non-rotating}} nozzle. It is used to improve the efficiency of the propeller and is especially used on heavily loaded propellers or propellers with limited diameter. It was developed by Luigi Stipa (1931) and Ludwig Kort (1934). The Kort nozzle is a shrouded propeller assembly for marine propulsion. The hydrodynamic design of the shroud, which is shaped like a foil, offers advantages for certain conditions over bare propellers.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 One of {{the unique}} {{problems}} associated with salmon gillnet fishing is of preventing the fouling of the boat's propeller in the net and associated fishing gear. Presently, {{the solution to this}} problem has been the addition of a basket type propeller guard which may produce a drag increase of 50 percent on small planing boats. Recognizing the need for a greater understanding of the interrelationship of boat drag and engine power to the effect of propeller selection and propeller guard design, this study analytically models planing boat power performance including the experimentally determined effects of <b>nozzle</b> type <b>propeller</b> guard design. The model predicts the drag forces acting on a prismatic planing hull and existing data on marine propeller performance is incorporated in the model such that the propeller shaft speed and shaft power for a particular boat propeller combination can be predicted. The model will also optimize propeller diameter. Three variations of <b>nozzle</b> type <b>propeller</b> guards were tested on a 16 ft. planing boat. The guards were a commercially produced outboard motor propeller weed guard, a short (1 /D = 0. 275) flow accelerating nozzle and the nozzle equipped with prerotation vanes. Computer modeling the effect of the three nozzle guards on the performance of a hypothetical 11500 lb. planing boat with a 265 Hp engine predicted that the top speed of the boat (with an optimum diameter propeller) would be 34. 6 knots, with the weed guard 25. 5 knots (a speed loss of 26 percent), with the flow accelerating nozzle 32. 3 knots (seven percent loss) and the nozzle with vanes 27. 4 knots (21 percent loss). The validity of the model is demonstrated by a comparison of the predicted values of propeller shaft speed and boat top speed, with an open propeller and the weed guard, to the actual values observed in operation of the 16 ft. test boat. Shaft speed predictions were within five percent and boat top speed predictions were within about ten percent of actual observations...|$|R

Here we analyze additional methods for exhaust jet noise reduction without essential thrust loss and even with thrust augmentation. Such additional approaches are: (1) to add some solid, fluid, or gas mass at discrete locations to the main supersonic gas stream to minimize the negative influence of strong shock waves formed in propulsion systems. This mass addition may be accompanied by heat addition to the main stream {{as a result of the}} fuel combustion or by cooling of this stream as a result of the liquid mass evaporation and boiling; (2) Use of porous or permeable nozzles and additional shells at the nozzle exit for preliminary cooling of the hot jet exhaust and pressure compensation for off-design conditions (so-called continuous ejector with small mass flow rate); and (3) to propose and analyze new effective methods of fuel injection into the flow stream in air-breathing engines.
