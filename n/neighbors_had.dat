5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble and its <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> {{to be routed}} through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois. Weston {{attended}} Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating high school in 1974, Weston moved to Rimini, Montana, rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it. Many of Weston's Montana <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television satellite dish to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, February 25, 1917, Danebod Folk School {{burned to}} the grown. Fortunately, the fire burned slowly. The {{students}} and the quickly summoned <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> time to rescue much of the furniture and other items of high value. Nearby buildings were saved, but the Folk School was beyond rescue. In the fall of 1917, nine months after the disastrous fire, a new and larger Folk School was dedicated. Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen, C.P. Højbjerg, Aage Møller, P.Rasmussen, and Kristian Østergaard. Meanwhile, a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county, and all churches and schools were temporarily closed {{in an effort to}} halt the deadly disease; but many people died. Another catastrophe followed on August21, 1918, when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County. It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured a dozen more.|$|E

25|$|Relations between Deir Yassin and its Jewish <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> started {{reasonably}} well under the Ottomans, particularly early on when Arabic-speaking Sephardic Yemenite Jews comprised {{much of the}} surrounding population. Relations rapidly deteriorated {{with the growth of}} Zionism in Palestine and reached their apex during the Arab revolt in 1936-1939. Relations picked up again during the economic boom years of full employment of World War II. Thus, in 1948, Deir Yassin was a prosperous, expanding village at relative peace with its Jewish neighbors with whom much business was done.|$|E

Thiệu kept a low profile, and in 1990 even the Foreign Office claimed to have no information on his whereabouts. In the early 1990s, Thiệu took up residence in Foxborough, Massachusetts, where he lived reclusively. He never produced an autobiography, rarely assented to interviews and shunned visitors. <b>Neighbors</b> <b>had</b> little contact with him or knowledge of him, aside from seeing him walking his dog. He did, however, appear in the 1980 documentary television mini-series , discussing his time as president of South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the system}} worked {{when it came}} to quelling rebellions, it was a failure in {{defending}} China and asserting its power. The Song had to rely on new gunpowder weapons introduced during the late Tang and bribes to fend off attacks by its enemies, such as the Khitan, Tanguts, Jurchens, and Mongols, as well as an expanded army of over 1 million men. In addition, the Song was greatly disadvantaged by the fact their <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> taken advantage of the era of chaos following the collapse of the Tang to advance into Northern China unimpeded. The Song also lost the horse-producing regions which made their cavalry extremely inferior.|$|E

25|$|Large {{parts of}} the world devastated by World War II did not benefit from the Marshall Plan. The only major Western European nation {{excluded}} was Francisco Franco's Spain, which did not overtly participate in World War II. After the war, it pursued a policy of self-sufficiency, currency controls, and quotas, with little success. With the escalation of the Cold War, the United States reconsidered its position, and in 1951 embraced Spain as an ally, encouraged by Franco's aggressive anti-communist policies. Over the next decade, a considerable amount of American aid would go to Spain, but less than its <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> received under the Marshall Plan.|$|E

In an interview in early 2007, Hirsi Ali noted that the Dutch state had spent about €3.5 million on her protection; threats against her produced fear, but she believed it important to speak her mind. While regretting van Gogh's death, she said she was proud of their work together.|$|E

[...] A coroner's inquest into the matter was held the following week, starting on May 23. The Clinton County Prosecutor conducted the examination, and more than 50 people testified before the jury. [...] During his testimony, David Hart testified that Kehoe had told him that Kehoe had [...] "killed a horse". and the New York Times reported people as saying that Kehoe had [...] "an ungovernable temper" [...] and [...] "seemed to have a mania for killing things."

500|$|In 1837 at Fort Gibson, {{leaders of}} the Kiowa tribe signed their first treaty with the United States. [...] By 1854, the need for another treaty became apparent, and the United States entered into a treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa-Apache (KCA) at Fort Ackinson, Indian Territory. [...] The treaty did not {{specifically}} designate a reservation, but was, for the most part, {{an extension of the}} 1837 treaty. [...] There was an attempt to place some of the tribes on a reservation on the Brazos River in Texas near Fort Belknap, under Indian Agent Robert S. Neighbors. [...] By 1858, Neighbors resolved to move the reservation into Indian Territory. [...] By August 1859, <b>Neighbors</b> <b>had</b> moved the Indians from the Brazos Reservation to Indian Territory, south of the Washita River near Fort Cobb. [...] In 1865, near present-day Wichita, Kansas, the three tribes signed another treaty that provided for the reservation in present-day Oklahoma and Texas. [...] Finally, in 1867, the tribes agreed to the Medicine Lodge Treaty. [...] This treaty provided for a much smaller reservation, and stipulated that whites were not allowed to encroach on the reservation. Also, to further reduce the reserve's land would require the approval of three-fourths of the tribal members.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Commit This to Memory, which were booked by Hoppus, were scheduled over six weeks at Seedy Underbelly Studios in Valley Village, a district of Los Angeles, California, which {{was actually a}} rented house that had once belonged to Jeff Porcaro, the drummer for Toto. The band had, according to Hoppus, [...] "a million ideas {{and a lot of}} energy and enthusiasm to make a great record". Pierre strove for the record to have a sound that resembled the bands Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> called police to the band and Hoppus several times for being too loud at night time, especially when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to work on a song late at night. According to Pierre, Hoppus was not interested in putting his own stamp on the music, but rather bringing out the best in what he saw in the group. Hoppus generally modeled his production after Jerry Finn (a longtime producer of Blink-182), and therefore it involved much watching and listening. [...] "Mark kept telling us, 'Your name {{is going to be a}} lot bigger on the front than mine is on the back'," [...] recalled Justin Pierre, [...] "So he would throw suggestions out there but always say, 'Feel free to turn these down.'

2500|$|Many of the Hebrews' <b>neighbors</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "combat myth" [...] {{about the}} good god battling the demon of chaos; one example of this mytheme is the Babylonian Enûma Eliš.

The myth of God's triumph over Leviathan, a symbol of chaos, has {{the form of a}} combat myth. In addition, McGinn thinks the Hebrews applied the combat myth motif to the relationship between God and Satan. Originally a deputy in God's court, assigned to act as mankind's [...] "accuser" [...] (satan means [...] "to oppose"), Satan evolved into a being with [...] "an apparently independent realm of operation as a source of evil" [...] — no longer God's deputy but his opponent in a cosmic struggle.|$|E
