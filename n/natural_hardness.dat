The crop was then gone, but the debt remained. An universal treasury extent and process of execution followed on the cattle and stock, and was enforced with more or less rigor in every quarter. We have it in evidence, that in those sales five cows were sold for not more than seven or eight shillings. All other things were depreciated in the same proportion. The sale of the instruments of husbandry succeeded to that of the corn and stock. Instances there are, where, all other things failing, the farmers were dragged from the court to their houses, in order to see them first plundered, and then burnt down before their faces. It was not a rigorous collection of revenue, it was a savage war made upon the country.|$|E

This ADC is characterized by superior power efficiency and small area, realized by employing a lateral metal–metal capacitor array and a dynamic two-stage comparator. To avoid {{the need for a}} highspeed clock and its associated power consumption, an asynchronous logic was implemented in a logic control cell. A test chip has been developed in a 65 nm CMOS technology, including eight ADC channels with different layout flavors of the capacitor array, a transimpedance amplifier as a signal input structure, a serializer, and a custom-made LVDS driver for data transmission.

40|$|The Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis (Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010) is a <b>natural</b> <b>hardness</b> {{assumption}} {{concerning the}} problem of approximating the edge expansion of small sets in graphs. This hardness assumption is closely connected to the Unique Games Conjecture (Khot, STOC 2002). In particular, the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis implies the Unique Games Conjecture (Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010). Our main {{result is that the}} Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis is in fact equivalent to a variant of the Unique Games Conjecture. More precisely, the hypothesis is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture restricted to instance with a fairly mild condition on the expansion of small sets. Alongside, we obtain the first strong hardness of approximation results for the Balanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement problems. Before, no such hardness was known for these problems even assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. These results not only establish the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis as a natural unifying hypothesis that implies the Unique Games Conjecture, all its consequences and, in addition, hardness results for other problems like Balanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement, but our results also show that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis problem lies at the combinatorial heart of the Unique Games Conjecture. The key technical ingredient is a new way of exploiting the structure of the Unique Games instances obtained from the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis via (Raghavendra, Steurer, 2010). This additional structure allows us to modify standard reductions in a way that essentially destroys their local-gadget nature. Using this modification, we can argue about the expansion in the graphs produced by the reduction without relying on expansion properties of the underlying Unique Games instance (which would be impossible for a local-gadget reduction) ...|$|E

40|$|The crests on the molar {{teeth of}} the koala are an ideal model for {{studying}} the interaction between an invariable diet, a unidirectional jaw movement and an enamel with regional variations in its ultrastructure. Three zones exist within this enamel; leading, intermediate, and trailing. In leading and trailing enamel, the prisms are aligned so that they oppose the predominantly labial to lingual chewing stroke, but those in the intermediate zone are random. Twenty-seven crests from six koala molars were viewed under the scanning electron microscope. Qualitatively, microwear on worn surfaces varied between the three zones. The number of striae per mm of crest length and width of striae in μm in each zone was measured on enlarged electron micrographs using a digital image analysis system. The indentation hardness (Knoop) of each zone was also measured. The number and the width of striae varied significantly (P < 0. 01) between zones and individuals. Further, analysis of striae which spanned all three zones showed they were narrower in the leading zone, broader in the intermediate and narrower again in the trailing zone.

While running (3. 0 m/s ? 5 %) and performing a 180 ? turn (consistent self-selected ? 5 %), data were collected using Footscan pressure insoles (500 Hz, (RSscan, Belgium)). These data included peak impact force, peak impact force loading rate and the peak pressures and peak pressure loading rate at the medial and lateral heel and first and fifth metatarsals. Multiple two-way repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted on the data and p-values, effect size and confidence intervals determined.

40|$|Since its {{proposal}} by Regev in 2005, the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem {{was used as}} the underlying problem for a great variety of schemes. Its applications are many-fold, reaching from basic and highly practical primitives like key exchange, public-key encryption, and signature schemes to very advanced solutions like fully homomorphic encryption, group signatures, and identity based encryption. One of the underlying reasons for this fertility is the flexibility with that LWE can be instantiated. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: It makes selecting parameters for cryptographic applications complicated. When selecting parameters for a new LWE-based primitive, a researcher has to take the influence of several parameters on the efficiency of the scheme and the runtime of a variety of attacks into consideration. In fact, the missing trust in the concrete hardness of LWE {{is one of the main}} problems to overcome to bring LWE-based schemes to practice. This thesis aims at closing the gap between the theoretical knowledge of the hardness of LWE, and the concrete problem of selecting parameters for an LWE-based scheme. To this end, we analyze the existing methods to estimate the hardness of LWE, and introduce new estimation techniques where necessary. Afterwards, we show how to transfer this knowledge into instantiations that are at the same time secure and efficient. We show this process on three examples: - A highly optimized public-key encryption scheme for embedded devices that is based on a variant of Ring-LWE. - A practical signature scheme that served as the foundation of one of the best lattice-based signature schemes based on standard lattices. - An advanced public-key encryption scheme that enjoys the unique property of <b>natural</b> double <b>hardness</b> based on LWE instances similar to those used for fully homomorphic encryption...|$|R

40|$|In {{the near}} future, there {{will likely be}} {{special-purpose}} quantum computers with 40 - 50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations for how to use such devices to demonstrate "quantum supremacy": that is, a clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, {{along the lines of}} a recent proposal by by the Quantum AI group at Google. We show that there 2 ̆ 7 s a <b>natural</b> average-case <b>hardness</b> assumption, which {{has nothing to do with}} sampling, yet implies that no polynomial-time classical algorithm can pass a statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure 2 ̆ 7 s outputs do pass. Compared to previous work - for example, on BosonSampling and IQP - the central advantage is that we can now talk directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being sampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new algorithm, inspired by Savitch 2 ̆ 7 s Theorem, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates in polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known algorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem - of the form "if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses" - must be non-relativizing. This sharply contrasts with the situation for exact sampling. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant versus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities. Fifth, in search of a "happy medium" between black-box and non-black-box arguments, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work implies that, if one-way functions exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to such oracles. We show, conversely, that some computational assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP is in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to oracles with small circuits...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{approach}} to the hoary problem of (im) proving circuit lower bounds. We define notions of hardness condensing and hardness extraction, in analogy to the corresponding notions from the computational theory of randomness. A hardness condenser is a procedure that takes in a Boolean function as input, {{as well as an}} advice string, and outputs a Boolean function on a smaller number of bits which has greater hardness when measured in terms of input length. A hardness extractor takes in a Boolean function as input, as well as an advice string, and outputs a Boolean function defined on a smaller number of bits which has close to maximum hardness. We prove several positive and negative results about these objects. First, we observe that hardness-based pseudo-random generators can be used to extract deterministic hardness from non-deterministic hardness. We derive several consequences of this observation. Among other results, we show that if E has exponential non-deterministic hardness, then E with linear advice has close to maximum deterministic hardness. We demonstrate a rare downward closure result: there is δ> 0 such that E with sub-exponential advice is contained in non-uniform space 2 δn if and only if there is k> 0 such that P with quadratic advice can be approximated in non-uniform space n k. Next, we consider limitations on <b>natural</b> models of <b>hardness</b> condensing and extraction. We show lower bounds on the length of the advice required for hardness condensing in a very general model of “relativizing ” condensers. We show that non-trivial black-box extraction of deterministic hardness from deterministic hardness is essentially impossible. Finally, we prove positive results on hardness condensing in certain special cases. We show how to condense hardness from a biased function without any advice, using a hashing technique. We also give a hardness condenser without advice from average-case hardness to worst-case hardness. Our technique involves a connection between hardness condensing and certain kinds of explicit constructions of covering codes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{results of}} {{experiments}} conducted in 1957 and 1958 {{to isolate the}} cause of post-transportation mortalities among hatchery-reared rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri Richardson, in Oregon are reported. Although death rate varies greatly, the average loss occurring from one to seven days following liberation has been estimated to be {{ten percent of the}} fish transported. Studies conducted over the past 15 years on problems arising from the live shipment of fishes are reviewed. General experimental procedure was to place fish in aquaria and subject them to certain environmental conditions perhaps associated with delayed planting mortalities. After a specified interval, animals were removed from test containers and placed in observation troughs. Subsequent losses were recorded and compared to the measured experimental conditions in an effort to identify causal relationships. Simulated in-transit motion, density of fish transported, and pre-hauling starvation period ha. d no apparent influence on the magnitude of delayed trout deaths. Zinc from zinc chloride and from galvanized iron plating was toxic to trout, and, at low concentrations, produced delayed mortalities characteristic of those that occurred following tank truck transportation in Oregon. The toxic effect of zinc increased with increasing zinc concentration, and with increasing length of exposure to the metal. Of the trout exposed for six hours to an initial zinc concentration of 0. 10 mg/ 1, an average of 8. 2 percent suffered a delayed mortality. When the concentration was increased to 1. 00 mg/ 1 for the same time period, the delayed loss increased to an average of 63. 2 percent. When length of trout exposure to various zinc concentrations was increased from two to eight hours, the mean delayed mortality increased from 39 to 68 percent. The toxicity of zinc increased with decreasing total water hardness. At 0. 75 mg/ 1 zinc, mean trout mortalities increased from five to 28 percent when total water hardness was decreased from 40 to 20 p. p. m. When hardness was decreased from 20 to zero p. p. m., mean mortalities increased from 28 to 88 percent. On the basis of research previously conducted in Oregon, it was shown that delayed trout losses were inversely correlated with total alkalinity of the transporting water. Assuming that calcium was the principal cation involved, the relationship was attributed to the effects of increased water hardness. Samples of transportation water from 32 inter-hatchery transfers of fish were taken at the completion of the station to station trips and analyzed for zinc. In every instance where delayed mortalities greater than one percent occurred, appreciable quantities of zinc were detected. When delayed losses of trout were much less than one percent, no zinc was detected in the water used during the transfer. Based on the results of the field and laboratory tests reported, it was concluded that zinc from galvanized iron surfaces was responsible for the post-transportation mortalities of trout in Oregon. Fish exposed to low zinc concentrations in liberating tanks were subjected to threshold toxic conditions in which a varying portion of the animals died a delayed death. Relatively small changes in the <b>natural</b> water <b>hardness</b> or zinc concentration could either increase or eliminate subsequent mortalities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{considered}} with the Carbonate Looping (CL) process {{and in particular}} the impact of improved sorbents on the process performance. A broad overview about solid state chemistry was given. Crystal systems of CaCO 3, CaO, Ca(OH) 2 and CaSO 4 have been presented. It was shown that CaO has the most dense package of all substances. However, CaO has the highest melting point in the group which indicates that sintering phenomena like loss of specific surface area and irreversible pore mouth blockage {{are much more likely to}} happen during the re-carbonation than during the calcination step. Impurities of the coal appear to become a challenge for the operation of the CL process: On the one hand impurities might get enriched in the loop causing high circulating mass flows and on the other hand melting phases are very likely to occur. Special emphasis should be put on the usage of a fuel containing very low amounts of alkali metals. As well, reducing conditions should be avoided in the calciner to avoid any undesired effects resulting of the system CaSO 4 -CaSO 3 -CaO. Theoretical investigations of the CaCO 3 decomposition showed that the majority of sorbent particles should be calcined within seconds in the calciner. Low residential times and rather low mass loadings in the calciner seem to be achievable. The literature review on CL sorbents revealed a critical response of the CO 2 capture ability of sorbents on changed TGA test conditions. In this perspective a lot of promising approaches, like special thermal pre-treatments became less promising. It was speculated that the good reported outcomes on these materials, was only an effect of randomly beneficial chosen TGA test conditions. Own experiments under harsh TGA test conditions with improved and synthetic products did not indicate any benefits for the CL process in terms of CO 2 capture ability. Mechanical and chemical reactivation routes were presented. The only process discussed within literature offering both reactivations at the same time is the SD process. Increased mechanical stability and refreshed CO 2 capture ability were reported by [86]. However, this process would have to be repeated after each third cycle leading to huge additional efforts for the sorbent reactivation. The sophisticated CL process model showed that optimisations could be done with a variety of targets. Optimising the economics, for example, would only require large utilities that should be operated with a sorbent as hard as possible. In contrast, an optimal efficiency could only be reached with special sorbents offering an optimal compromise between CO 2 capture ability and hardness. Minimal CO 2 capture costs were calculated to 20 €/t (including the compression of the CO 2 produced by the power plant and the CL process). The calculations indicate that the handling of the huge amount of make-up and bleed might become a problem. Sorbent research was categorised into basic, advanced and synthetic materials. Basic materials are common, now available limestones, advanced materials are thermally treated oxides and synthetic products are tailor-made lab samples. Based on TGA experiments it turned out that neither advanced nor synthetic materials had any long term advantages under harsh TGA conditions compared to good performing <b>natural</b> sorbents. <b>Hardness</b> investigations with different experimental setups created a confusing picture in that no real correlations between the measurements of the individual test were achieved. Basically, two reasons were identified for this observation: First, depending on experimental conditions attrition by surface wear or impact stress was dominant. According to the nature of the products, the reaction on surface wear and impact might be completely different. Second, the cyclic change of sorbent properties that change from a carbonate shell to a soft CaO shell to a sintered particle. Additionally, the duration of the appearance of the different Ca-forms depends strongly on process conditions...|$|R
