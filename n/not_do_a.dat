25|$|After {{a couple}} of years, his skill began {{attracting}} other musicians. One such musician was Guy Lombardo, who would remain friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted {{a job at the}} H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|Baum's avowed {{intentions}} {{with the}} Oz books and other fairy tales was to retell tales such as {{are found in}} the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. The first books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased with the series; in The Emerald City of Oz, Ozma objected to doing violence even to the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginnings of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 2004–2005 season, Memphis Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, a {{broadcasting}} legend with CBS, TBS and TNT, {{was forced}} into retirement due to health issues and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers as Al Michaels' broadcast booth partner. Brown called his first ABC game with Michaels on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated a Heat-Lakers game pitting those team's respective star players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. After that game, the two did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> game together again until March 2005. Michaels began covering NBA games sporadically, doing two games in early March and three additional games in April. Meanwhile, Brown worked every week of ABC's coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster Mike Breen.

25|$|On 22 March at 9:38pm Islamabad, (16:38 GMT), Gillani {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the peoples party as its candidate for the premiership of the country.

It was reported on 24 March 2008, that Zardari said he was not interested in the job of prime minister and that Gillani would serve until 2013 in the position. Speculation that Zardari might be gunning for the premiership grew stronger when he picked the less popular Gillani over Ameen Faheem, a much powerful member of the central executive committee. Fahmida Mirza, the newly elected Speaker of the Assembly, insisted there was no plan to replace Gillani. She added, however, that if Gillani did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> good job, all options were open.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the war, Belgium {{had been}} {{regarded}} as the foremost European country for the manufacture of armaments. Its Sillon industriel, or industrial valley, {{was one of the}} first fully industrialized and mechanized regions in Europe. The Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was among the oldest armament manufacturers on the Continent, known for its manufacture of mortars, artillery shells, and land mines. Graham Spicer, an official in the Ministry of Munitions who had worked in Belgium before the war and knew its armaments manufacturing capabilities, suggested that perhaps the Belgians might be able to help. An approach was made, and the result was that 1000 skilled Belgian armaments workers volunteered help train other volunteers. As the result of another suggestion (possibly from Spicer as well) most of these volunteers were drawn from the pool of soldiers who had been badly wounded at the front and declared unfit to return there; they were not so unfit they could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> job of work, but were not capable of resuming life at the Front.|$|E
25|$|Shawn Layden {{formally}} reintroduced The Last Guardian at {{the beginning}} of Sony's E3 2015 conference. Sony affirmed that that game was now slated for release on the PlayStation 4 with a 2016 release date. Sony also assured fans that Ueda still remained a main developer of the game despite his prior departure from Sony. According to Chris Plante of Polygon, the gameplay presented shows the same gameplay from previous demos, where the young boy and the large creature work together to solve various platforming puzzles. The presentation at the 2015 E3 was based on the milestone of the game being fully playable, affirmed by selected members of the press, though Yoshida stated they did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> live gameplay demo as the artificial intelligence behavior of the animal creature could be sporadic and impact the demonstration. Ueda said that the fundamentals of the gameplay had not changed from the original PlayStation 3 version to the PlayStation 4, only that with the more-powerful PlayStation 4, they were able to put more detail into the characters and the environment.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{had other}} issues with Alienation. GameSpot Jason D'Aprile was annoyed by his {{inability}} to pause the game even in single-player mode. Although Metro David Jenkins found its creatures' design [...] "uninspired", the game's overall graphics were decent. According to gamesTM reviewers, Housemarque did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> good job of combining two gameplay elements—the incremental loot system (accomplished through grinding) and the gameplay mechanic in which players repeat stages to increase scores—resulting in a [...] "gameplay cycle that doesn’t match the purity or compulsion of either".|$|E
500|$|Though Iones {{described}} Anniversarys one-year {{development cycle}} as a [...] "very smooth ride", some production {{issues that were}} not discovered until late in development contributed to bugs and other problems.

500|$|In 1864 the war {{was nearing}} its end, but many Hoosiers were war weary and saw {{no end in sight}} as they {{prepared}} for the state's next gubernatorial election. Indiana's constitution prohibited a governor to serve more than four years in any eight-year period, but Morton was elected as Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane's term, so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election.

The Aquarium of the Pacific also loaned a variety of fish for display within the attraction. With a budget of $100 million, the film opened at #2 on its debut weekend, behind Lara Croft: Tomb Raider earning $20.3 million in 3,011 theaters. The film's international release began September 20 in Australia and other markets followed suit. During its 25-week theatrical run, Atlantis: The Lost Empire grossed over $186 million worldwide ($84 million from the United States and Canada).

500|$|The episode {{includes}} a gag in which Quagmire rapes Marge Simpson, {{and the two}} later {{end up in the}} Simpson family's house, where Quagmire kills the family by shooting them.

MacFarlane, however, claimed that there was no feud and told them: [...] "You are afraid of [...] James L. Brooks. [...] And that's why we can't do it." [...] Fox eventually cut the gag, which left the episode without a joke {{at the end of the}} first act.

Cinquemani ended the review praising the [...] "Animal (Billboard Remix)" [...] for its [...] "promise of something deeper, something beyond Dr. Luke's latest recycled formula." [...] Gary Graff from Billboard wrote [...] "Kesha sinks her teeth into some fresh flavors on Cannibal, which will certainly enhance her 'Animal' attraction." [...] Spin magazine's Barry Walters reviewed Cannibal with a mixed outcome giving the album five out of a possible ten stars. Walters criticized the album as a whole stating that it was full of contradictions, noting that on [...] "We R Who We R" [...] "she sends out pride vibes to bullied gays," [...] while on [...] "Grow a Pear", [...] "she emasculates a potential boyfriend." [...] The production of the album was stated as a positive, praising Dr. Luke for his consistent club-pop hooks and ability to [...] "render the hypocrisy [...] nearly irrelevant." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from The Boston Globe was mixed in his review of the album. Fekadu criticized the album's lyrical depth and use of auto-tune writing that the album was [...] "filled with vapid lyrics and battles any T-Pain album for most use of the auto-tune." [...] Kesha's mother, Pebe, was also targeted in the review criticizing her for helping write the album's title track, [...] "Cannibal" [...] which was called [...] "disturbing" [...] and [...] "sad".|$|E
