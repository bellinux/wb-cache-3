40|$|Abstract Background One of the {{national}} mortality databases in the U. S. is the Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) Death File that contains death dates {{of those who have}} received any benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The completeness of this database was shown to vary widely from cohort to cohort in previous studies. Three other sources of death dates are available in the VA that can complement the BIRLS Death File. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the completeness and accuracy of death dates in the four sources available in the VA and to examine whether these four sources can be combined into a database with improved completeness and accuracy. Methods A random sample of 3, 000 was drawn from 8. 3 million veterans who received benefits from the VA between 1997 and 1999 and were alive on January 1, 1999 according to at least one source. Death dates found in BIRLS Death File, Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets, Medicare Vital Status, and Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File were compared with dates obtained from the <b>National</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Index.</b> A combined dataset from these sources was also compared with <b>National</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Index</b> dates. Results Compared with the <b>National</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Index,</b> sensitivity (or the percentage of death dates correctly recorded in a source) was 77. 4 % for BIRLS Death File, 12. 0 % for Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets, 83. 2 % for Medicare Vital Status, and 92. 1 % for SSA Death Master File. Over 95 % of death dates in these sources agreed exactly with dates from the <b>National</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Index.</b> Death dates in the combined dataset demonstrated 98. 3 % sensitivity and 97. 6 % exact agreement with dates from the <b>National</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Index.</b> Conclusion The BIRLS Death File is not an adequate source of mortality data for the VA population due to incompleteness. When the four sources of mortality data are carefully combined, the resulting dataset can provide more timely data for death ascertainment than the <b>National</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Index</b> and has comparable accuracy and completeness. </p...|$|E
