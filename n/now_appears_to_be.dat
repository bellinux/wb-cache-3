Mnemiopsis also reached the eastern Mediterranean in the late 1990s and <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thriving in the North Sea and Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declining, the decrease is not rapid or {{large enough to}} trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to}} the loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declining, {{the decrease}} is not rapid or {{large enough to}} trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; {{this means that the}} problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E
25|$|What <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the most}} ancient {{surviving}} image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (an inn for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating {{from the time of}} Trajan (98–117) or Hadrian (117–138). The cross has the T shape.|$|E

A 2006 survey found no individuals of the Yangtze river dolphin, which <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> functionally extinct.|$|E
25|$|Morcellation {{has been}} widely used {{especially}} in laparoscopic techniques and sometimes for the vaginal technique, but <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with a considerable risk of spreading benign or malignant tumors. In April 2014, the FDA issued a memo alerting medical practitioners to the risks of power morcellation.|$|E
25|$|However, new archeological {{discoveries in}} the late 20th century {{revealed}} several buildings {{in various parts of}} Scandinavia that do appear to have functioned purely as cult sites. Some of them, for example the hall at Tissø, Denmark, were associated with the aristocracy, but others, for example Uppåkra in Scania (formerly in Denmark, now in Sweden) functioned as places of assembly for the local population. The temple found in England, at Yeavering, <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an early example of a hall-associated hof, rather than an anomaly.|$|E

There, Doc finds Mickey, who is being eyed by the FBI, and manages to talk to him. The man tells him he had been feeling guilty for the negativity that his real-estate business has caused and wants to give away all his money.

500|$|The {{general view}} <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that the {{decision}} to attack Damascus was somewhat inevitable. Historians, such as Martin Hoch, regard the decision as the logical outcome of Damascene foreign policy shifting into alignment with the Zengid dynasty. [...] King Baldwin III had previously launched a campaign with the sole objective of capturing the city. [...] This damaged the Burid dynasty's relations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited. [...] In her article Tolentino stated: [...] "Five years after I'd left the UVA Greek system, I read 'A Rape on Campus' as an outsider account about a true problem, written by someone good at cherry-picking... So {{it took me a}} day or two to admit that I found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections... Jackie was lying, and railroaded into the spotlight on a story that <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a PTSD-laced delusional flashback." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{cockroach}} species, such as Blaptica dubia, {{are raised}} as food for insectivorous pets. A few cockroach species are raised as pets, most commonly the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa. [...] Whilst the hissing cockroaches {{may be the}} most commonly kept species, there are many species that are kept by cockroach enthusiasts; there is even a specialist society: the Blattodea Culture Group (BCG), which was a thriving organisation for about 15 years although <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dormant. [...] The BCG provided a source of literature for people interested in rearing cockroaches which was otherwise limited to either scientific papers, or general insect books, or books covering a variety of exotic pets; {{in the absence of an}} inclusive book one member published Introduction to Rearing Cockroaches which still appears to be the only book dedicated to rearing cockroaches.|$|E

5000|$|The {{situation}} grew complex after Barmen. Müller's ineptitude {{in political}} matters did not endear {{him to the}} Führer.
