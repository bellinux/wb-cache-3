50|$|Polymer fibers are, in general, {{produced}} on a technical scale by extrusion, i.e., a polymer melt or a polymer solution is pumped through cylindrical dies and spun/drawn by a take-up device. The resulting fibers have diameters typically on the 10-µm scale or above. To {{come down in}} diameter into the range of several hundreds of nanometers or even down to a few nanometers, Electrospinning is today still the leading polymer processing technique available. A strong electric field {{of the order of}} 103 V/cm is applied to the polymer solution droplets emerging from a cylindrical die. The electric charges, which are accumulated {{on the surface of the}} droplet, cause droplet deformation along the field direction, even though the surface tension counteracts droplet evolution. In supercritical electric fields, the field strength overbears the surface tension and a fluid jet emanates from the droplet tip. The jet is accelerated towards the counter electrode. During this transport phase, the jet is subjected to strong electrically driven circular bending motions that cause a strong elongation and thinning of the jet, a solvent evaporation until, finally, the solid <b>nanofibre</b> is deposited on the counter electrode.|$|E

40|$|Calcitic <b>nanofibres</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{habits of}} sec- ondary calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) accumulations observed in calcareous vadose environments. Despite their widespread occurrence, {{the origin of}} these nanofeatures remains enig- matic. Three possible mechanisms fuel the debate: (i) purely physicochemical processes, (ii) mineralization of rod-shaped bacteria, and (iii) crystal precipitation on organic templates. <b>Nanofibres</b> can be either mineral (calcitic) or organic in na- ture. They are very often observed in association with needle fibre calcite (NFC), another typical secondary CaCO 3 habit in terrestrial environments. This association has contributed to some confusion between both habits, however they are truly two distinct calcitic features and their recurrent asso- ciation {{is likely to be}} an important fact to help understanding the origin of <b>nanofibres.</b> In this paper the different hypotheses that currently exist to explain the origin of calcitic <b>nanofibres</b> are critically reviewed. In addition to this, a new hypothe- sis for the origin of <b>nanofibres</b> is proposed {{based on the fact that}} current knowledge attributes a fungal origin to NFC. As this feature and <b>nanofibres</b> are recurrently observed together, a possible fungal origin for <b>nanofibres</b> which are associated with NFC is investigated. Sequential enzymatic digestion of the fungal cell wall of selected fungal species demonstrates that the fungal cell wall can be a source of organic <b>nanofibres.</b> The obtained organic <b>nanofibres</b> show a striking morpho- logical resemblance when compared to their natural coun- terparts, emphasizing a fungal origin for part of the organic <b>nanofibres</b> observed in association with NFC. It is further hy- pothesized that these organic <b>nanofibres</b> may act as templates for calcite nucleation in a biologically influenced mineraliza- tion process, generating calcitic <b>nanofibres.</b> This highlights the possible involvement of fungi in CaCO 3 biomineraliza- tion processes, a role still poorly documented. Moreover, on a global scale, the organomineralization of organic nanofi- bres into calcitic <b>nanofibres</b> might be an overlooked process deserving more attention to specify its impact on the biogeo- chemical cycles of both Ca and C...|$|R

In NFES, a straight-line jet between the spinneret and the collector can be utilized to direct-write an orderly <b>nanofibre.</b> Perturbation stemming from residual charges on the collector caused the oscillation of the charged jet, and the deposition of the non-woven <b>nanofibre</b> on the planar substrate.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a unique approach for the fabrication of enzyme aggregate coatings on the surfaces of electrospun polymer <b>nanofibres.</b> This approach employs covalent attachment of seed enzymes onto <b>nanofibres</b> consisting of a mixture of polystyrene and poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride), followed by a glutaraldehyde (GA) treatment that cross-links additional enzyme molecules and aggregates from the solution onto the covalently attached seed enzyme molecules. These cross-linked enzyme aggregates, covalently attached to the <b>nanofibres</b> via the linkers of seed enzyme molecules, are expected to improve the enzyme activity due to increased enzyme loading, and also the enzyme stability.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{population}} growth, mounting energy concerns and increasing environmental crisis, {{the development of new}} and more energy efficient membranes for water and air purification is becoming an important task. Currently, membranes made from petro-based polymers are used. Although they have been widely recognized because of their excellent properties, they pose environmental problems during production and disposal stages of the life cycle. The essential characteristics of next generation membranes should be high efficiency, high durability, low operating pressure, low cost, and be able to be fabricated using environmentally friendly processes. Cellulose nanofibres are of technological interests as renewable, sustainable and eco-and bio-friendly raw materials to produce such nanomembranes. They possess excellent properties and can be used in environmental, biomedical and other functional filtration applications. The research in this thesis focused on developing the ‘green’ nano-membrane having high mechanical strength and pore size control. Cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> dimensions, diameter and length, are critical for establishing the structure-property relationships in the later part of this research. Cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> diameter controls the pore size of the <b>nanofibre</b> membranes and aspect ratio controls the preparation of <b>nanofibre</b> membrane via filtration. There is currently no easy means of rapidly quantifying aspect ratio of nanofibres because the two ends of nanofibres cannot be seen in microscopic images due to entanglement between fibres, although diameter distributions can be measured from microscopic images at high magnification. A simple method was developed to estimate aspect ratio of nanofibres from sedimentation and yield stress measurements. The gel-point was measured both from the height of a layer of cellulose nanofibres sedimented from a dilute suspension or from the lowest solids concentration at which a yield stress could be measured using a vane rheometer. The two methods were closely in agreement for all samples. Aspect ratio was then calculated using either the Effective Medium (EMT) or Crowding Number (CN) theories. Fabrication of <b>nanofibre</b> sheet is time consuming for the existing methods because they use fine filter media to retain the cellulose nanofibres on filter medium. A rapid and commercially feasible method for preparing cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> sheet was developed to produce high quality <b>nanofibre</b> sheets using large pore size filter medium. The retention of nanofibres is improved by using the concentration of the forming suspension higher than connectivity threshold to allow the connected fibre suspension to bridge over the large pore openings. <b>Nanofibre</b> sheet preparation required 13 minutes in total. The mechanical strength of cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> paper is a key property but tensile strength measurement requires a substantial amount of test material. To minimise the time for testing mechanical properties and the loss of sample, it has been established that zero/short span test can be used instead of standard tensile test to measure the tensile strength for <b>nanofibre</b> sheets. This is because there are no fibres bridging between and directly gripped by both jaws, just as the case in tensile tests. The zero-span test was shown to be a sensitive measure of the sheet strength at a short scale. Cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> sheets possess good dry and wet strength compared to standard cellulose fibre sheets. However, wet strength of <b>nanofibre</b> sheet is low for use in certain applications like filtration. The effect of the addition of two cationic polymers, CPAM and PAE, on cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> sheet forming characteristics such as water drainage and <b>nanofibre</b> retention and strength of cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> sheet is investigated. It is found that the retention of <b>nanofibre</b> increased with the addition of either polymer; in addition wet strength of <b>nanofibre</b> sheet greatly increased with the addition of PAE. The method developed to prepared <b>nanofibre</b> sheet with high wet strength, was adapted to prepare <b>nanofibre</b> membranes and <b>nanofibre</b> composite membranes. Their performance in filtration applications was then evaluated. Cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> composite membranes were prepared using suspensions of cellulose nanofibres, silica nanoparticles (22 nm) and polyamide-amine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) via filtration. It was demonstrated that silica nanoparticles act as spacers to control pore size of <b>nanofibre</b> network. PAE was added to adhere the negatively-charged nanoparticles to the nanofibres and also to improve the wet strength of the membrane. Membranes prepared with nanofibres alone showed high flux but low rejection due to large pore size. In contrast, <b>nanofibre</b> composite membranes showed water flux of 80 LMH (litres per square meter per hour) and Molecular Weight Cut Off of 200 kDa. The addition of silica nano particles controlled pore size. These results demonstrate the potential of cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> composite membranes in ultrafiltration. The produced membranes are readily recyclable as a feed stock to a conventional paper making process. By conducting these studies, a novel strategy to rapidly produce eco-friendly cellulose <b>nanofibre</b> composite membranes for ultrafiltration applications was developed...|$|E

In addition, the <b>nanofibre</b> can be direct-written in a special pattern by controlling the motion track of the collector. Therefore, {{it can be concluded}} that a micro-strip pattern was a good guidance for <b>nanofibre</b> deposition, and the <b>nanofibre</b> deposition track followed well along the top surface of the micro-strip pattern. The position-controlled deposition of a single <b>nanofibre</b> provides a new aspect for applications of electrospinning...|$|E
40|$|Nanofibres {{prepared}} by electrospinning have shown enormous potential for various applications. They are obtained predominantly {{in the form}} of nonwoven fibre webs. The 2 -dimensional nonwoven feature and fragility have considerably confined their further processing into fabrics through knitting or weaving. <b>Nanofibre</b> yarns, which are <b>nanofibre</b> bundles with continuous length and a twist feature, show improved tensile strength, offering opportunities for making 3 -dimensional fibrous materials with precisely controlled fibrous architecture, porous features and fabric dimensions. Despite a few techniques having been developed for electrospinning <b>nanofibre</b> yarns, they are chiefly based on the needle electrospinning technique, which often has low <b>nanofibre</b> productivity. In this study, we for the first time report a <b>nanofibre</b> yarn electrospinning technique which combines both needle and needleless electrospinning. A rotating intermediate ring collector was employed to directly collect freshly-electrospun nanofibres into a fibrous cone, which was further drawn and twisted into a <b>nanofibre</b> yarn. This novel system was able to produce high tenacity yarn (tensile strength 128. 9 MPa and max strain 222. 1 %) at a production rate of 240 m h - 1, with a twist level up to 4700 twists per metre. The effects of various parameters, e. g. position of the electrospinning units, operating conditions and polymer concentration, on <b>nanofibre</b> and yarn production were examined...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} yarn spinning from electrospun nanofibres. The concepts of staple and core yarn spinning on electrospun nanofibres has been investigated by examining <b>nanofibre</b> uniformity, alignment, twist insertion and yarn take up by engining and engineering a new take up mechanism. Nylon 6 nanofibres have been fabricated and used throughout this work. The effects of varying the electrospinning parameters such as applied voltage, polymer solution concentration and electrospinning distance on fibre morphology have been established for process optimization. A novel <b>nanofibre</b> aligning mechanism has been devised and systematically revised to enable optimization of alignment process parameters. MWCNTs have been successfully dispersed into nylon 6 nanofibres and have been aligned along the <b>nanofibre</b> body by manipulating the electric and stretching forces {{with the aid of}} the alignment mechanism. Novel mechanisms for spinning continuous twisted nanofibre/composite <b>nanofibre</b> yarn and core electrospun yarn have been researched, developed and implemented by making samples. It has been found that defining the velocity and count of the nanofibres entering the spinning zone is important for controlling the yarn count and twist per unit length. By modelling the electrospinning jet, mathematical equations for theoretically calculating the velocity of the jet and nanofibres and their count have been established, necessary for process control. Aspects of practical measurement and comparison of jet and <b>nanofibre</b> velocities have been described and discussed. Tensile testing of single <b>nanofibre</b> and <b>nanofibre</b> mats has been attempted for mechanical characterization. Initial results show the range of tensile strength of nylon 6 <b>nanofibre</b> assemblies and indicate the effect of change of process parameters. A review of those engineering mechanisms related to various <b>nanofibre</b> architectures and their industrial and commercial importance has also been reviewed, described and discussed.

40|$|<b>Nanofibres</b> having {{shape memory}} effect (SME) were {{successfully}} spun from shape memory polyurethanes solution by electrospinning method in this experiment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images {{showed that the}} resulted <b>nanofibres</b> had ultrafine diameter {{in a range of}} 50 to 700  nm. Uniform <b>nanofibres</b> could be prepared by adjusting applied voltage, concentration and feeding rate. Especially, the concentration {{played a key role in}} controlling its diameters. In addition, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated that the obtained <b>nanofibres</b> would satisfy the structure requirement of segmented polymer having SME.

30|$|The SEM images {{show that}} the electrospun PAN-Nafion <b>nanofibres</b> {{modified}} by ZrP nanoparticles obtained a reduced diameter and roughness without the formation of beads. In addition, PAN shows a more reduced diameter of 100 [*]nm due to the ZrP nanoparticles being well distributed within the <b>nanofibres.</b> The XRD results also show well-crystallised zirconium phosphates within the modified PAN <b>nanofibres.</b> Moreover, the obtained results {{show that the}} thermal degradation properties of PAN-Nafion/ZrP <b>nanofibres</b> improve at a high temperature of 500 [*]°C and with a high conductivity under CV and Nyquist plots. It can be concluded that the addition of ZrP nanoparticles within PAN and PAN/Nafion <b>nanofibres</b> can reduce the diameter while improving the conductivity. When PAN is blended with Nafion solution, it stabilised the high decomposition temperature of Nafion. Furthermore, PAN-Nafion/ZrP <b>nanofibres</b> show a high stability in Nyquist plots due to the incorporation of zirconium phosphate nanoparticles that allow improved electrode surface accessibility. The plots obtained rectangular curves at high electronic conductivity and good charge dissemination. This makes composited <b>nanofibres</b> with ZrP nanoparticles suitable to be used as the electrolyte of a promising fuel cell application.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{technique}} for the fabrication of <b>nanofibres</b> of polypropylene by meltblowing process with the injection of different fluids (such as nitrogen and water) has been explained. Low molecular weight polypropylene polymers {{were used in}} this study. The surface morphology of <b>nanofibres</b> was analysed by scanning electron microscopy. It was observed {{that the use of}} water gave better results compared to nitrogen for the fabrication of <b>nanofibres.</b> Nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed similar chemical shifts for polymers and <b>nanofibres,</b> which indicated no change to the chemical functionality of the <b>nanofibres</b> by the application of fluids and high temperature during meltblowing. The mechanical properties of the <b>nanofibres</b> were investigated by using dumb-bell-shaped specimens in a universal tensile tester. The fibres fabricated with nitrogen were weaker and lower in tensile modulus compared to the fibres fabricated with water. The use of a rotating collector increased the tensile strength compared to a stationary collector due to higher degree of fibre alignment in the rotating drum. The tensile strength and modulus values were increased after annealing due to the increase in the crystallinity. The meltblown <b>nanofibres</b> showed hydrophobic nature as indicated by the high values of water contact angle. The hydrophobicity of the <b>nanofibres</b> fabricated with the injection of fluids did not change noticeably from the as-spun fibres fabricated without the fluids...|$|R
