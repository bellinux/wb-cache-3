5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid.</b> The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
5|$|Other known localities of wild N. rajah populations {{include the}} Marai Parai plateau, Mesilau East River near Mesilau Cave, the Upper Kolopis River, {{and the eastern}} slope of Mount Tambuyukon. On Pig Hill, N.rajah grows at 1950–2320m and is {{sympatric}} with N.burbidgeae, N.tentaculata, and the <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> N.×alisaputrana.|$|E
5|$|Almonds (Prunus dulcis) have a {{long and}} {{important}} history of religious, social and cultural significance as a food.

40|$|Groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) are {{generally}} considered to be self-pollinated, but <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids</b> due to outcrossing have been observed in cv. Robut 33 - 1.

40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids</b> were {{discovered}} in populations of three Hexagrammos species (Teleostei: Hexagrammidae) distributed off the southern coast of Hokkaido in the North Pacific Ocean. Both hybrids reproduce by hybridogenesis, in which the maternal haploid genome is transmitted to offspring without recombination and the paternal haploid genome is eliminated during gametogenesis. While <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids</b> are unisexual and reproduce hemiclonally by backcrossing with the paternal species (BC-P), artificial F 1 -hybrids between the pure species produce recombinant gametes. Thus, despite having the same genome composition, the <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids</b> and the F 1 -hybrids are not genetically identical. Here, to clarify the differences between both hybrids, we examined the karyotypes of the three Hexagrammos species, their <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids,</b> the artificial F 1 -hybrids, and several backcrosses. Artificial F 1 -hybrids have karyotypes and chromosome numbers that are intermediate between those of the parental species. Conversely, the <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids</b> differed from F 1 -hybrids by having several large metacentric chromosomes and microchromosomes. Since the entire maternal haploid genome is inherited by the <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids,</b> maternal backcrosses (BC-M) between <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids</b> and males of the maternal species (H. octogrammus; Hoc) have a hemiclonal Hoc genome with large chromosomes from the mother and a normal Hoc genome from the father. However, the large chromosomes disappear in offspring of BC-M, probably due to fissuring during gametogenesis. Similarly, microsatellite DNA analysis revealed that chromosomes of BC-M undergo recombination. These findings suggest that genetic factors associated with hemiclonal reproduction may be located on the large metacentric chromosomes of <b>natural</b> <b>hybrids...</b>|$|R
50|$|N. ampullaria flowers once {{or twice}} {{annually}} for several weeks at a time.

5|$|Even {{though many}} species of Stylidium may coexist in the same location, natural hybrids between species have not often been reported. Both natural {{hybridisation}} {{in the field and}} artificial hybridisation in cultivation are rare.

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|During data {{collection}} for The Banksia Atlas project, a single presumed <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> between B.prionotes and B.lindleyana (porcupine banksia), with fruit like B.lindleyana but leaves intermediate {{between the two}} parents, was found north of Kalbarri National Park. At the time this was considered an important discovery, as the parent species were thought not to be closely related. Mast's analyses, however, place them both in a clade of eight species, though B.lindleyana remains less closely related to B.prionotes than B.hookeriana. Hybrids of B.prionotes with B.menziesii (firewood banksia) have also been produced by artificial means, and presumed natural hybrids have been recorded.|$|E

25|$|The hybrid {{nature of}} A.×ebenoides was {{suspected}} {{at the time}} of its discovery in 1862, but the existence of fern hybrids was scientifically controversial at the time. (The existence of the fertile individuals in Havana Glen, discovered in 1873, further confused the issue.) In 1902, Margaret Slosson hybridized A.rhizophyllum and A.platyneuron in pure culture to produce specimens effectively identical to A.×ebenoides, one of the first uses of this technique to demonstrate the parentage of a <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> fern. In 1957, Herb Wagner and Robert S. Whitmire experimentally converted sterile diploid A.×ebenoides to the fertile tetraploid form, the first creation of an allopolyploid fern in the laboratory.|$|E

500|$|All North American Drosera species produce sterile hybrids. The <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> D. rotundifolia × D. linearis (conventionally but {{incorrectly}} {{referred to}} as Drosera ×anglica), is also sterile but is morphologically similar to the modern D. anglica. Errors in meiosis during ovule and pollen production, however, {{can result in a}} chromosome doubling which can allow for [...] seed to be produced. The resulting plants, known as amphiploids, would be fertile. Woods noted that this appeared to be an ongoing process with D. anglica speciating from D. rotundifolia × D. linearis through amphidiploidy in multiple locations. The question remains as to why D. anglica is so widespread, whereas the range of D. linearis is limited to the Great Lakes region of North America. The greater adaptability of D. anglica to varied habitat conditions could be a major factor.|$|E

500|$|Nepenthes × kinabaluensis {{is another}} {{impressive}} plant. The pitchers get large also, {{but do not}} compare to those of N. rajah or N. × alisaputrana. It is a well-known <b>natural</b> <b>hybrid</b> of what many {{consider to be the}} two most spectacular Nepenthes species of Borneo: N. rajah and N. villosa. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is only found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species are occur sympatrically. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south-east ridge, which lies {{on the west side of}} the Upper Kolopis River. The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between Layang-Layang and the helipad, where it grows at about 2900m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees. [...] Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030m. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. This hybrid can be distinguished from N. rajah by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. [...] These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and are clue as to the hybrid's parentage (N. villosa has highly developed peristome ribs). The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of N. rajah), the lid orbiculate or reniformed and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1–2cm below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. [...] Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. [...] In all respects N. × kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was labelled as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World (Cheers, 1992).|$|E
