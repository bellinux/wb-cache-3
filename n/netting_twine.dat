40|$|Although various {{deformations}} may {{be noted}} on netting, {{when it is}} set into the flowing water, it is not impossible to regard {{a small portion of}} the netting as a plane. It is proper for us to make clear the fluid dynamic properties of the netting, by using a simplified net-models. For the purpose of this, it was planned to make the knotless plane net-models, using vinyl-chloride cylindrical-bar instead of <b>netting</b> <b>twine.</b> In this paper, some descriptions were made comparative experiments on netting materials consisting of the vinyl-chloride cylindrical-bar, and the cremona <b>netting</b> <b>twine.</b> The measurements were carried out with the hand-made equipment, which was capable of measuring simultaneously both the dragging component and the lifting component to be derived from the netting material, when they were set into the flowing water. The drag-coefficient C_D, the lift-coefficient C_L, and friction-coefficient C_F are to be calculated from the measured values of C_Dm and C_Lm as in the following formulae：－ ･･･[the rest omitted...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{tendency}} in some {{sectors of the}} fishing industry has been to use thicker and stiffer twines {{in the manufacture of}} netting material. This increases the mesh’s resistance to opening and, consequently, reduces the selective performance of fishing gears. The main characteristic of <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> contributing to mesh resistance to opening is flexural rigidity (EI). We present a methodology for quantifying mesh resistance to opening {{through the use of a}} prototype called the resistance to opening and deflection meter (ROD-m). It incorporates four tension load cells and four stepping motors that are driven by four ministep bipolar chopper drives. Small panels of netting (3 3 meshes) can be mounted on ROD-m, which can measure the forces acting on the netting and the position of the knots. Estimates of the flexural rigidity of the <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> can be made from these data. We present the results of the analysis of Mediterranean polyamide netting, and standard and Brezline polyethylene (PE) netting from the North Sea. In all netting, regardless of the material used, EI increases with increasing linear density. Furthermore, Brezline is much stiffer than standard green PE, although they are equally thick...|$|E
40|$|Visual stimuli of nets, which affect fishing selectivity, vary by twine diameter, color, and {{material}} under different light conditions and visual geometries. In this study, two cylindrical model codends of two mesh sizes, 28 and 43 mm, {{were made of}} high-contrast, dark brown polyethylene (PE) <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> and low contrast, light-blue polyamid (PA) monofilament twine. Each model codend was filled with juvenile seabream and set in the water channel of a light-blue circular tank under a flow speed 0. 8 m/s for 30 min. Light conditions were set to relatively bright, dim, and dark. The resulting retention rates of juvenile seabream were 15 - 35 % lower for the low-contrast codend with PA monofilament than for the high contrast PE twine netting under bright and dim light conditions, while no difference was observed under dark conditions. The effects of mesh size and netting contrast on the retention rate were dependent on the light level, while the retention rate due to netting contrast was independent of mesh size. Therefore, low-contrast nets in the codend could help to reduce juvenile bycatch by disturbing the orderly optomotor response...|$|E
40|$|In India, {{open sea}} cage {{culture has been}} {{successfully}} demonstrated and several experimental offshore cages for mariculture were installed along the coast for on-farm demonstration by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Cochin. In the present study, a model cage was fabricated and tested in a towing tank under different waves and current load conditions. The tension on the mooring chain was measured during the experimental study, besides the towing speed and wave parameters. Based on the experimental data, drag coefficient for the cage <b>net</b> <b>twine</b> was estimated. The tensions in the mooring chain and the cage <b>net</b> <b>twine</b> of the prototype cage were predicted based on the model data. The maximum tension on a single twine of the outer and inner fish net were estimated as 0. 15 N and 0. 028 N respectively. The force on the net was more than 1. 7 times the force on the floating collar and sinker pipe. The tension in the mooring line is mainly due to the force on the net. Further {{it was observed that}} the force on the net due to current was 10 times higher than that due to wave. This information will be useful in future while deciding the diameter of the cage, the type of net to be used for cage according to the site where the cage is to be installed...|$|R

40|$|After due {{consideration}} the EU Commission has decided in December 2005 to admit cod-ends made of netting turned 90 de-grees (T 90) as an allowable alternative for the cod fishery of the Baltic. The construction was included {{as one of}} two admissibles versions into the newly issued EU regulation 2187 / 2005 on technical measures {{for the conservation of}} fishery resources of the Baltic. This contribution describes some of the investigations preceeding that decision with which some of the previous demurs could be dispelled. In the course of these experiments it was detected that the cod-end netting material plays an important role for the mesh selection of a T 90 cod-end, whereas the <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> diameter is negligible. Problems with modern twine mate-rial have to be taken in consideration for constructional changes of T 90 cod-ends. A relation of 1 to 2 in the circumferences in meshes at the joining round between last row of the belly and extension/cod-end turned out to be acceptable. Both the hauling technique (sidetrawler or sterntrawler) and an extensive use in the commercial fishery proved to be of no relevance for to the selection of T 90 cod-ends. Taken alone, the different hydrodynamic conditions in a cod-end are insufficient to fully explain the selection phenomena. This was demonstrates by the material-related differences in selectivity of T 90 cod-ends...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we deal with 76 {{specimens}} of the fishing net from Mr. Y. Amano and Mr. S. Takahashi in Peru, which excavated in 9 ruins-Paracas, Casma, Lurin, Chancay, Huarmey, Pachacamac, Chaquitanta, Marquez and Salinas, where the civilizations were existed about 400 ～ 600 years ago. Fibre of fishing net were used cotton, junco and other fibres. Structure of <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> were left hand twist and cross hand twist, they were monstly two folded twist, few of them were three fold twist. The size of thread show in Japanese style in cotton 20 count were 6 ～ 40, mostly 16 ～ 20. Threads of junco were 3 ～ 4 mm. in diameter, mesh size were 1. 0 ～ 6. 5 cm. We found that the material of fishing net had four kinds of netting knot, as flat-knot (thief knot, reef knot, square knot), trawler knot (sheet knot, mesh knot, wearveisknot), movable-flat knot and half-knot, last of two were remarkable in Peruvian net, which were mostly used but never used in Japanese net. Movable-flat-knot was made by use of the same technique in knotting of flat-knot, but it was differ only from the finished from. So we thought movable-flat-knot was a modification of flat-knot. Half-knot was alike half-hitch (a method of hitch and bend in seamanship), therefore, it seems that they resemble {{each other in the}} form (c. f. text. fig. No. 5).

40|$|Trap gear such as {{set nets}} and pots are usually {{operated}} to fix {{on the sea}} bottom for several weeks. In order to be clear function changes in trap gear frameworks of this thesis were consisted of the following three steps by fishing gear constructions. 1) The <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> consisted of the fundamental part of a fishing gear may be changed the breaking strength and elongation. 2) The nettings consisted of the minimum unit of function of capture. 3) Pot fishing gears are considered to the simplest model of an actual fishing gear. On the other hand, {{it is important for}} establishing and carrying out of environment-friendly to improve the fishing technology. In fact, trap gear are well-known as never-overfishing gear. It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> having thickness of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing ground for cuttlefish basket traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} type of baler in industrialized {{countries}} today is the round baler. It produces cylinder-shaped [...] "round" [...] or [...] "rolled" [...] bales. The design has a [...] "thatched roof" [...] effect that withstands weather well. Grass is rolled up inside the baler using rubberized belts, fixed rollers, or a combination of the two. When the bale reaches a predetermined size, either <b>netting</b> or <b>twine</b> is wrapped around it to hold its shape. The back of the baler swings open, and the bale is discharged. The bales are complete at this stage, but they may also be wrapped in plastic sheeting by a bale wrapper, either to keep hay dry when stored outside or convert damp grass into silage. Variable-chamber large round balers typically produce bales from 48 to 72 in in diameter and up to 60 in in width. The bales can weigh anywhere from 1100 to 2200 lb, depending upon size, material, and moisture content. Common modern small round balers (also called [...] "mini round balers" [...] or [...] "roto-balers") produce bales 20 to 22 in in diameter and 20.5 to 28 in in width, generally weighing from 40 to 55 lb.|$|R

5000|$|Pier 59 is {{the site}} of the main {{building}} of the Seattle Aquarium, built on a pier shed first constructed in 1905.In 1896 fish and grain dealers Ainsworth and Dunn (see below) built a pier at the location of today's designated city landmark Pier 59, originally Pier 8, also known as the Pike Street Pier. [...] The pier had to be reconfigured because the 1897 Thomson/Cotterill plan dictated that all piers run parallel to one another. Ainsworth and Dunn left this pier around the time the present shed was constructed; subsequent tenants were grain dealer Willis Robinson and the Northwestern Steamship Company. By 1912, the pier was owned and largely occupied by steamship agent Dodwell Dock and Warehouse Company, owened by Dodwell & Co. (Hong Kong). It became known as the Dodwell Dock. That name fell out of usage when the pier was sold in 1916 to the Pacific <b>Net</b> and <b>Twine</b> Company, later merged into Pacific Marine Supply Company. In the 1950s through early 60s, Pier 59 was the home of Puget Sound Tug & Barge. Crowley moved the operations to the Duwamish Waterway in the 1960s.The two [...] "stubby" [...] piers known as the Fish and Salt Docks (later Piers 60 and 61) were purchased by the Port of Seattle in the mid-1940s, and were removed in 1975 {{to make room for the}} Seattle Aquarium. Prior to acquisition by the Port, they had housed the Whiz Fish Company and the Palace Fish Company.|$|R
30|$|We used a 1 m 2 aluminum-sided throw trap {{to sample}} aquatic prey within an {{approximately}} 884 ha prescribed burn and {{an area of}} similar size immediately adjacent to the prescribed burn to compare habitats with similar water depths. The area of unburned sawgrass was east and adjacent to the prescribed burn. Of the other two prescribed burns conducted in 2011, one was dry before sampling began and the other unit did not burn sufficiently due to deeper water depths to be comparable to the other prescribed burns sampled. The prescribed Apple Camp burn was conducted on 2 March 2011 (Figure 1) over minimum water depths of 15 cm to 20 cm. Starting one day post burn, we measured small fish and macroinvertebrate density and environmental characteristics at randomly generated points in burned and adjacent unburned sawgrass ridges. We threw three throw traps in each sampling location and removed vegetation to facilitate clearing of traps. We cleared all traps with bar seine and dip net following methods of Jordan et al. (1997 a) and preserved all aquatic organisms that were ≥ 5 mm in length. Within each throw trap, we measured water depth, vegetation height, estimated percent periphyton cover to the nearest 5 %, and counted sawgrass stems. At each sampling point with adequate water depths (≥ 10 cm), we set 3 Gee minnow traps (23 × 45 cm, 3.2 mm mesh, Memphis <b>Net</b> & <b>Twine</b> Co., Inc., Memphis, Tennessee, USA) for two hours. After the two hours, we collected and preserved all aquatic organisms captured. Organisms that were too large for collection vials were measured {{in the field and}} released. All organisms were identified to species and measured (standard length [SL] for fish and snout:vent length [SVL] for amphibians) to the nearest millimeter.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth-Jane {{developed}} early into womanliness. One day a {{month or}} so after receiving intelligence of Newson's death off the Bank of Newfoundland, when the girl was about eighteen, she was sitting on a willow chair in the cottage they still occupied, working <b>twine</b> <b>nets</b> for the fishermen. Her mother was in a back corner of the same room engaged in the same labour, and dropping the heavy wood needle she was filling she surveyed her daughter thoughtfully. The sun shone in at the door upon the young woman's head and hair, which was worn loose, so that the rays streamed into its depths as into a hazel copse. Her face, though somewhat wan and incomplete, possessed the raw materials of beauty in a promising degree. There was an under-handsomeness in it, struggling to reveal itself through the provisional curves of immaturity, and the casual disfigurements that resulted from the straitened circumstances of their lives. She was handsome in the bone, hardly as yet handsome in the flesh. She possibly might never be fully handsome, unless the carking accidents of her daily existence could be evaded before the mobile parts of her countenance had settled to their final mould.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{fish farming}} is an {{important}} and growing industry. Fouling organisms that grow on the net cages and other structural components of the fish farms are a substantial problem for the industry. The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of <b>net</b> <b>twine</b> with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a test tube brush. The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small net sections and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few twines can be extrapolated to net panel applications. The drag coefficients for the net sections in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the net sections with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|R
40|$|The works {{presented}} are, by presumption and by choice, a materialistic {{extension of}} my psyche. My pieces are executed directly and very personally. Being a "tactile" person, I enjoy the direct contact of touch and feel with materials as I create. I dream in color. Because of my heritage, (my Father was a builder of buildings and I was born {{under the sign}} of the 2 " x 4 "), I inherently tend to think in the "round". These factors, combined with other traits, past experiences and my education, dictate to me, sensibilities that encompass the manipulations of Basketry. Basketry, the earliest form of weaving, was common to primitive and tribal peoples throughout the world. Their baskets were created for utilitarian purposes and survival; they {{had to do with the}} mysteries of birth, life and death. Natural grasses and fibers, indigenous to their geographical regions, (reed, willow, seagrass, rush, raffia, etc.) were used for construction. Feather, hair, bone, beads, shells and natural dyes were often added for embellishment. Research of these cultures, promotes a quickening of insight and a feeling of kinship to their creativity. A study of basketry and its history opens doorways to the exploration of all other fiber traditions. My personal discovery of the basket, the mask, batik, varied looms, Peruvian weaving and all the other ramifications of the exploration became an inspiration for me. My work evolves from the excitement I experience as I assess the unlimited scope of fiber. Touching is a part of seeing, and as I "touch", I realize that fiber is a media through which I can fulfill my need for self-expression. It provides an ???open-end" for concept, composition and involvement with construction. Through research, study, practice and patience, I eventually became proficient in the arts of weaving, coiling, <b>twining,</b> <b>netting</b> and other fiber techniques which I incorporate into my work with meaning and focus.
