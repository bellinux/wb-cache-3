5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Seychellum {{are the two}} species of Deckenia from the African mainland. The two-lobed shape of the last segment of the mandibular palp, which {{had been used to}} argue for a close relationship between Seychellum and Indian crabs of the family Gecarcinucidae, does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reliable phylogenetic character.|$|E
5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities. Since they are globally distributed – described on all continents except Antarctica – geographical boundaries do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor; the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes (the latitude where the fossil was created, accounting for continental drift) and in separate sedimentary basins.|$|E
5|$|The hero, {{who comes}} from a land beyond Alefgard, is a {{descendant}} of the legendary Erdrick. When the hero arrives, he does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> warrior – he arrives without weapons or armor – and is ignorant of the situation. The populace thinks his claim {{of the ability to}} defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating on ash mounds {{associated}} with Neolithic cultures in South India {{date back to}} 8000BCE. Artefacts such as ground stone axes, and minor copper objects {{have been found in}} the region. Towards the beginning of 1000BCE, iron technology spread through the region; however, there does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India. The region {{was in the middle of}} a trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean and East Asia. Trade with Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, Jews and Chinese began from the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BC to c. 4th century AD). The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the Asian continent in the East and the West.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{may include}} beetles and sciomyzid fly larvae, {{many of which}} {{specialize}} in feeding upon snails. Other potential predators may include the northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata), northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), and Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), which are common in the talus and on the ledges, as well as various small mammals or passerine birds such as robins and pigeons, which are often seen {{in or near the}} habitat. Although predation does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> limiting factor at this time, its potential impact on a low or stressed population is unclear. The 1978 listing rule included predation by the introduced European snails, Discus rotundatus and Oxychilus spp. as serious threats to Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Little is currently known about this relationship.|$|E
5|$|The common endemic Fiji goshawk is a {{specialist}} predator {{of small and}} medium-sized birds, and the swamp harrier is also a widespread predator, often taking fledglings. The local subspecies of the peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus nesiotes will hunt finches, but is itself rare and declining. Barn owls eat mainly rats, but sometimes take small birds. Rats and mice use Fiji parrotfinch nests, and may be significant predators of the species, and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground. The fan-tailed cuckoo, which has an endemic Fijian subspecies, is a brood parasite, but the parrotfinch does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> host of this large cuckoo.|$|E

5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime did <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated {{at the time of the}} assault.|$|E
5|$|There does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders {{there is an}} incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated {{with an increase in}} consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

25|$|Studies of the {{benefits}} of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes. A 2013 review by the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine if supplementation with calcium and vitamin D results in greater harm or benefit in men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF did not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1g of calcium and 400IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difference in fracture risk. It is unknown what effect higher doses have. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures.|$|E
25|$|Within the entropy-coded data, after any 0xFF byte, a 0x00 byte is {{inserted}} by the encoder {{before the next}} byte, so that there does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> marker where none is intended, preventing framing errors. Decoders must skip this 0x00 byte. This technique, called byte stuffing (see JPEG specification section F.1.2.3), is only applied to the entropy-coded data, not to marker payload data. Note however that entropy-coded data has a few markers of its own; specifically the Reset markers (0xD0 through 0xD7), which are used to isolate independent chunks of entropy-coded data to allow parallel decoding, and encoders are free to insert these Reset markers at regular intervals (although not all encoders do this).|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} ego {{depletion}} do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> product of mood or arousal. In most studies, mood and arousal {{has not been}} found to differ between participants who exerted self-control {{and those who did}} not. Likewise, mood and arousal was not related to final self-control performance. The same is true for more specific mood items, such as frustration, irritation, annoyance, boredom, or interest as well. Feedback about success and failure of the self-control efforts does not appear to affect performance. In short, the decline in self-control performance after exerting self-control appears to be directly related to the amount of self-control exerted and cannot be easily explained by other, well-established psychological processes.|$|E
25|$|On June 24th, 2017, a 14-year-old {{girl from}} Greenwood, Delaware fell {{approximately}} 25 feet from her gondola, striking a tree before {{falling to the}} ground. The girl had slipped under the chair's safety bar while the ride was in motion. The ride was stopped when park visitors alerted the operators to the incident, while other visitors gathered underneath the girl to prepare to catch her. She ultimately fell into the group of visitors below her, with an unidentified 47-year-old man receiving a back injury from the attempt. The passenger received no serious injuries, and {{was taken to a}} local hospital. Park officials stated there did <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> malfunction of the ride, but closed the ride pending review.|$|E
25|$|Not {{smoking is}} the single best way to prevent the disease. Other methods of {{prevention}} include treating high blood pressure, treating high blood cholesterol and not being overweight. Surgery is usually recommended when an AAA's diameter grows to >5.5cm in males and >5.0cm in females. Other reasons for repair include the presence of symptoms and a rapid increase in size (more than one centimeter per year). Repair may be either by open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). As compared to open surgery, EVAR has a lower risk {{of death in the}} short term and a shorter hospital stay, but may not always be an option. There does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difference in longer term outcomes between the two. With EVAR there is a higher need for repeat procedures.|$|E
