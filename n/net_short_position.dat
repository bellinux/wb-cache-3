50|$|The economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks {{argued that}} in general, the natural hedgers of a {{commodity}} are {{those who wish to}} sell the commodity at a future point in time.

Thus, if speculators are holding a net long position, it must be the case that the expected future spot price is greater than the forward price.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{study the}} informational value of <b>short</b> <b>position</b> {{announcements}} and market participants' {{reactions to the}} disclosed positions. The EU wide regulation on short selling has significantly improved the transparency and publication frequency of significant <b>short</b> <b>positions.</b> Institutional investors have expressed concerns towards the regulation, particularly regarding the observing market participants' improved ability to react to disclosures in ways that hinder {{the performance of the}} well-performing star funds in the market. This paper specifically focuses on the concerns expressed by BlackRock. By analyzing the abnormal returns and timing of position disclosures, I study if the reactions of observing markets affect the target stocks' return development and if mimicking of star funds occurs. This study employs the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> disclosures made to the competent market authority of UK in the London Stock Exchange. As the regulatory environment came in to force in November 2012, it requires disclosure of a <b>net</b> <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> if the amount of shares being shorted reaches, crosses or drops below 0. 5 % of the company's issued share capital. Subsequently, disclosures are required on 0. 1 % intervals. From November 2012 to October 2014, 201 <b>short</b> traders disclosed <b>positions</b> on 327 different target stocks. Altogether, 8, 917 disclosures were made. This study is based on event study methodology and employs the market model in calculating expected returns. For the degree of mimicking, I calculate the percentage of perceivably mimicked <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> of the total amount of disclosures made by a short trader. I find no significant reactions by observing market participants that would affect the return development of target stocks. No significant publication day return reactions exist within 30 days from position disclosures. However, the mimicking activity by observing market participants is considerably high. Within 20 days from disclosures made by the 41 star funds, 60 % of the disclosures by all the other short traders occur. Despite the notable mimicking behavior, the performance of the mimicked and perceivably skillful short traders is below average. Measured with 30 days subsequent to position disclosure, the average cumulative abnormal return of a target stock is - 1. 67 %. For star funds and separately for BlackRock the figures amount to - 1. 08 % and - 0. 41 %. The high mimicking activity indeed proves that the concerns of star funds are legitimate as such. However, the behavior is actually the most detrimental for mimicking investors whose performance is impaired due to the mimicking of short traders who actually underperform the average short trader...|$|R
40|$|It’s {{a salient}} {{observation}} {{in the literature}} that hedgers’ <b>net</b> <b>short</b> futures <b>positions</b> for agricultural commodities, {{as reported in the}} Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Disaggregated Commitment of Traders reports (DCOT), correlate strongly with futures prices. However, the DCOT data limits researchers’ ability to discern what influences producers’ hedging decisions from other activities such as storage hedges and spread trades. This is because the DCOT data aggregates open positions of all active contracts. This paper addresses this issue by examining the potential economic stimuli of corn producers’ forward contracting decisions before harvest using a unique data set of forward contracts between producers and large grain and farm supply cooperative over a five-year period. We find that producers forward price more of their crops when the futures price is trending up, and they are reluctant to hedge when the futures price is falling. We show that the producer level hedging data and the DCOT hedge series respond in a remarkably similar manner to economic stimuli despite this dissimilarity...|$|R

40|$|This article {{undertakes}} {{an empirical}} examination of pure rights issues in Malaysia. Though pricing efficiency {{is the main}} focus, we also examine related issues. We study a total of 38 pure rights issues that occurred over the 8 -year period January 1998 to December 2005. Using two alternative valuation models, the adjusted Black-Scholes Call Option Model (BSOPM) and the traditional Implied Rights Valuation Model (IRVM), we find the Malaysian market to be inefficient in pricing the rights. Mispricing is quite extensive with a predominance of overpricing. Significantly, both pricing models, despite their different theoretical underpinnings produce similar results. These results are further validated by the returns to our two arbitrage strategies. The trading strategy, which establishes a <b>net</b> <b>short</b> <b>position</b> in the rights produces substantial positive returns, whereas the strategy which effectively goes long the rights, produced marginally negative returns. We found underlying stock price volatility, liquidity and moneyness of the rights {{to be the key}} determinants of the extent of mispricing.

40|$|This study investigates a {{well-documented}} enigma in {{the finance}} literature, the aftermarket behavior of closed-end fund {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs). Many models with rational agents attribute the underpricing of industrial IPOs to information asymmetry between the IPO issues and the investing public. Since closed-end funds typically do not have pre-existing assets or proprietary rights, there is little information asymmetry about their asset valuation. Consequently, these models suggest that closed-end funds should exhibit less underpricing than industrial IPOs. However, information asymmetry theories cannot explain why closed-end funds are successfully brought to market overpriced. Specifically, closed-end funds are overpriced at issue relative to their net asset values (NAVs) due to substantial underwriting fees that average approximately 8 % of total issue size. The study investigates these anomalies and describes regulatory and institutional mechanisms {{that contribute to the}} pattern of aftermarket returns. The authors perform an intraday analysis of aftermarket trades and quotes in the first 100 days of trading. They find that underwriting arrangements, identified during discussions with underwriters, help to explain not only the their primary observations, but also several unusual patterns in the transactions data. The authors show {{that the vast majority of}} volume in the first four weeks of trading is seller-initiated. Since short selling is not possible during this time period, the selling imbalance confirms the presence of flippers. However, these imbalances do not immediately translate into price declines. As the number of issues that are stabilized declines over time, the proportion of issues trading at unencumbered, market-determined prices increases. The authors also provide evidence that underwriters manage the cost of stabilizing by creating a <b>net</b> <b>short</b> <b>position</b> in the number of shares issued during the pre-market. Selling imbalance in the first few trading days has predictive power for the timing of subsequent price decline: the faster the short position is covered through stabilizing purchases, the sooner the price drops. Funds that exercise the over-allotment option experience longer stabilization periods. The authors document that seller-initiated trades are both larger and more profitable than buyer-initiated trades in the after market period. Small investors who buy shares in the aftermarket engage in open market transactions that they believe are at unencumbered prices. The authors believe that their findings support a marketing hypothesis for closed-end fund IPOs. To protect their reputation and improve the likelihood of a successful offer, lead underwriters promise to stabilize prices in the aftermarket, essentially granting free put options with a strike price equal to the offer price. The stabilization bid provides the opportunity for some syndicate members to sell large blocks to flippers during the pre-issue period. The number and size of sell orders in the first few days of trading show that a sizable number of these traders exercise this options and flip their shares back to the syndicate. The size of the trades suggest that they are small, retail customers. The legality of this scenario appears to be within the guidelines of current securities regulation The authors speculate that flippers are wiling to participate because of other inducements they receive through their ongoing relationships with underwriters. On the cost side, underwriters may incur significant costs from flipping and protracted stabilization. However, the cost of stabilization may well be offset by the benefits of assuring a successful initial distribution. Small investors face substantial information processing costs and may be highly susceptible to "marketing" tactics. The authors believe their findings raise questions about the adequacy of current disclosure rules for IPOs, and the propriety of securities regulation that permit short term stabilization in closed-end fund IPO aftermarkets. They also suggest that similar patterns of selling pressure, price stabilization, and asymmetric behavior between large and small trades may be found in two other securities - master limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts. ...|$|E

40|$|Fixed {{exchange}} rate, pegs to hard currencies {{that can}} be adjusted, are fragile, the more so the more mobile are capital funds across currencies and national markets. Once market participants doubt, for whatever reason, {{the ability of a}} developing or emerging economy's central bank to meet its commitment to redeem it currency in hard currency at the promised rate, they will race to claim the country's external reserves. Vulnerability to crises becomes greater as financial markets become less regulated and more internationally open. To escape currency crises, a country may lock its money to that of a reserve-currency country, as by a "currency board. " This may, if an only if reserves are ample and all other economic objectives are subordinated, maintain the peg and hold down inflation. But it sacrifices monetary autonomy and seignorage, leading in effect and perhaps literally to substitution of the reserve currency for the local currency as unit of account and means of payment. When crises hit, the IMF and other lenders give highest priority to restoration of credibility and confidence in the currency under attack. They require the victim country to take drastic restrictive monetary and fiscal measures, whether or not irresponsibility in these policies brought on the crisis. Since these measures damage the economy, businesses, and banks, they may not restore confidence. Lenders of last resort are essential and should concentrate above all on replenishing liquidity. The adjustable-peg system has outlived its usefulness. For most countries it is better to let exchange rates float in markets, like those of the big three currencies, dollar, yen, and deutsche mark (or euro). Even so, unimpeded inflows and outflows of liquid funds result in unwelcome exchange rate movements. Protection against them, by taxes or special reserve requirements, are desirable, and need not curtail useful capital flows. Banks and businesses need to be prevented from incurring <b>net</b> <b>short</b> term debt <b>positions</b> in hard currency. Equity and direct fixed capital are the desirable vehicles for developmental capital movements. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{case study}} of Goldman Sachs exemplifies this {{conflict}} of interest. They underwrote about $100 billion in RMBS and CDO securities in 2006 and 2007. They saw their securities were defaulting, and instead of warning investors {{to stay away from}} those products, they began developing a <b>short</b> <b>position</b> {{that would allow them to}} profit off of the inevitable collapse of the mortgage market. They amassed a $13.9 billion <b>net</b> <b>short,</b> and made $3.7 billion in profit in 2007 from the decline of the mortgage market. They sold RMBS and CDO securities to their own clients without notifying them of their conflict, that they had a multibillion-dollar short against that same product. The case study further examines four CDOs sold by Goldman known as Hudson 1, Anderson, Timberwolf, and Abacus 2007-AC1. The study found that Goldman would sometimes take risky assets they held in their inventory and dump them into these CDOs. They knowingly included low-value and poor quality assets in them, and in three of the CDOs, they had taken a <b>short</b> <b>position</b> against the CDO. Goldman sold their own toxic assets to their clients, then proceeded to bet against them, without ever notifying anyone about their conflict of interest. In the case of Hudson 1, Goldman took a 100% short against the $2 billion CDO, and then sold the CDO to their clients. The security soon lost value, and while their clients lost their investments, Goldman made $1.7 billion.In the Timberwolf CDO, Goldman sold the securities above book value to their clients, then soon dropped the price after the sale, causing their clients to incur quick losses. The Timberwolf security lost 80% of its value within 5 months and is worthless today. In the case of the Abacus CDO, Goldman did not take a <b>short</b> <b>position,</b> but allowed Paulson & Co. Inc., a hedge fund with relations to former Treasury Secretary and Goldman executive Henry Paulson, to select the assets included in the CDO. Goldman marketed and sold the security to their clients, never disclosing the role of Paulson & Co. Inc. in the asset selection process or the fact that the CDO was designed to lose value in the first place. Today, the Abacus securities are worthless, while the Paulson hedge fund made about $3 billion.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the nature}} (capital or revenue) {{of the proceeds}} arising {{from the use of}} <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in South African hedge fund fundamental paired trades. Hedge funds, which typically avail themselves of an array of alternative investment strategies such as short selling in addition to the traditional asset classes, were recently brought into the South African investment regulatory net. This was achieved by classifying regulated hedge funds as a separate category of collective investment scheme in terms of the CISCA. This categorisation brought regulated hedge funds into the ambit of section 25 BA of the Income Tax Act which carries an important distinction between amounts of a capital nature and amounts of a revenue nature. Given that hedge funds may use <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> for both profit-seeking and risk-mitigation purposes, the resulting proceeds from short sales could be capital or revenue in nature from a tax perspective based on the surrounding facts of the trade. The onus of discharging the proof that the proceeds resulting from a short sale are capital in nature is significant. The South African case law emphasises the importance of applying the various principles to the specific facts of the case. The importance of the dominant intention of the trade is highlighted, given the potentially competing purposes of profit-seeking and risk-mitigation present. Factors that should be analysed in such a scenario include the overall portfolio positioning, the size of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> relative to each other, the degree of specificity of the risk that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> purports to hedge against, the manner of re-investment of the short sale proceeds, the level of trading activity in the hedge fund, the level of <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the hedge fund, the absolute sizes of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the context of the}} overall portfolio, the exposure of the hedge fund to the long position after the close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position,</b> the manner of close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> and the holding period of the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b> While the analysis reveals factors that may be indicative of capital treatment, the classification of short sale proceeds as capital or revenue in nature remains a challenging task to undertake due to the potentially wide variety of facts and circumstances and the potential for undesirable consequences should an incorrect classification be made. Consequently, improved clarity through the provision of de jure guidance as to the nature of short sale proceeds would be welcome...|$|R
