40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficiency}} of leachate treatment by microbial oxidation in four connected on-site aerated lagoons at a landfill site. The landfill site was found to be in an ageing methanogenic state, producing leachate with relatively low COD (mean <b>value</b> 1740 <b>mg</b> <b>l</b> - 1) and relatively high ammonium concentrations (mean <b>value</b> 1241 <b>mg</b> <b>l</b> - 1). Removal of COD averaged 75 %, with retention times varying from 11 to 254 days. Overall 80 % of the N load was removed within the plant, some by volatilisation of ammonium. Microbial community profiling of the water from each lagoon showed a divergent community profile, presumably a reflection of the nutrient status in each lagoon. In municipal solid waste landfills under similar conditions, leachate treatment through a facultative aerobic system in which sequential aerobic and anaerobic microbial oxidations occurred can readily be achieved using a simple two-lagoon system, suggesting this technology can be economic to install and simple to ru...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was {{to assess the impact of}} abattoir effluents on River Illo in Ota, Nigeria. In order to achieve this set objective seven sampling locations were chosen along the river course. The choice of locations was to reflect the variations in concentrations of the following important parameters of water quality issue: pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia and nitrate among others. The choice of these parameters was based on their relative importance in abattoir effluents composition. Results of analyses revealed impairment in the quality of River Illo by the wash down from the abattoir activities. Dissolved oxygen concentrations ranged between 0. 01 and 4. 6 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1 while the highest concentrations of TSS and TS of 1026 and 1071. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> - 1, respectively were obtained at the point of abattoir effluents discharge.

The analyses encompassed 23 chemical parameters and phenolics profiles. The most important parameter, differentiating cloudy juice from clear juice, was turbidity. Cloudy juices were characterised by having an average total turbidity of 1, 210 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) and a stability of turbidity of 42 %. Some {{of the results}} deviated from the accepted ranges given in reference values for apple juices in the Code of Practice of the European Fruit Juice Association.

In the pot experiment, the dose-dependent accumulation of REs in corn root and stem was observed, but {{it could not be}} detected in corn leaf under the dosage of 20 mg REs kg(- 1) soil (oven-dry mass). The non-observed effect concentration (NOEC) for accumulation of REs in corn seedling with the pot experiment was 1. 0 mg REs kg(- 1). In the plot experiment, the dose-dependent accumulation was observed at an early stage after application of REs and the <b>NOEC</b> <b>value</b> of 32 <b>mg</b> REs m(- 2) was obtained. At harvest, no dose-dependent accumulation of REs was observed in any part of the corn. These results fan be confirmed by the fingerprinting analysis based on the differences between La to RE ratios in the REs mixture and in pot or plot soil. We observed that the plant shows no preference on individual RE and the results of fingerprinting indicated clearly the incorporation of exogenous REs in plant tissues, in a similar manner as that observed in the dose-dependent distribution of RE concentrations. The results indicated also a translocation process of REs From plant root to leaf when applied to soil or from leaf to root when applied to leaf.

30|$|The NOEC-values (BLM v. 0.0. 0.17) {{exceeded}} the bioassay EC 50 -values for the algae, with {{a factor of}} 2.5 – 9.3. They also {{exceeded the}} calculated PNEC-values {{by a factor of}} 2.2 in Abiskojaure up to a factor of 9.1 in Älgsjön and St. Envättern. Since the Cu <b>NOEC</b> <b>value</b> reflects the concentration where there should be no negative effect on the algal growth rate, it is notable that the <b>NOEC</b> <b>value</b> was higher than the measured EC 50, i.e. the estimated Cu concentration for 50  % growth reduction. However, since the use of <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> in ecotoxicology is strongly questioned by international standardisations bodies [22], the BLM software should use an ECx endpoint instead. BLM v. 0.0. 0.17 overall gave a larger deviation between calculated and measured values than BLM v. 2.2. 3. BLM v. 2.2. 3, which uses a conversion factor to calculate chronic toxicity, produced results for the two Daphnia species within a factor of two. Thus, in these soft waters BLM v. 2.2. 3 calculated more similar results compared to the bioassays. This since BLM v. 0.0. 0.17 calculated algae <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> (where no growth inhibition is expected), which were higher than the measured EC 50 values (concentration where there was a 50  % growth inhibition). Furthermore, even though BLM v. 2.2. 3 is an acute model, the approach of using the conversion factor seems to be working, at least for the investigated waters.|$|R
30|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of a combination}} product with n active substances was calculated according to CA using the equation given in Figure 1. It is important to notice that any contribution of the additives in the combination products was disregarded in the prediction, i.e., {{it was assumed that}} the {{toxicity of}} the commercial mixture solely depends on the toxicity of the a.s. In the case of chronic toxicity towards aquatic invertebrates and fish, <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> were used instead of EC 50 values as the latter are usually not reported from such tests. This use of <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> (conducted here as exemplification) is a violation of the basic scientific concept of CA, because it assumes implicitly (and wrongly) that <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> (in analogy to ECx values) relate to a defined effect level, while in fact biological effects occurring at the NOEC differ among independent tests and depend strongly on the experimental design [13]. Only CA-based predictions were calculated in the present study because the available data pool did not allow for an application of IA.|$|R

30|$|<b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> as {{toxicity}} measures {{derived by}} hypothesis testing depend strongly on the statistical {{design of a}} study (e.g., the number of selected test concentrations and replicates), {{but they do not}} relate to an identical fixed-effect level across studies with identical designs [19]. Yet, the CA concept assumes that the effect concentrations used for the individual components in the mixture relate to a defined fixed-effect level, e.g., 50 % inhibition. The large and frequent deviations between predicted and measured chronic Daphnia and fish toxicity of the combination products in the present study demonstrate that the use of <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> results in a much higher unreliability of mixture toxicity predictions in comparison to using ECx values as input data. The use of ECx values for the growth inhibition of Lemna and algae (a chronic endpoint) resulted in an overall good compliance between mixture toxicity prediction and observation. This indicates that the reason of unreliable predictions for chronic Daphnia and fish toxicity is not a per se non-predictability of chronic effects by mixture toxicity concepts but rather due to the violation of the fixed-effect level assumption of the CA concept by using <b>NOEC</b> <b>values.</b> As heterogeneity in the input data decreases the reliability of the mixture toxicity prediction, {{it could be argued that}} the large variability particularly in the chronic fish studies caused the poor compliance. However, using <b>NOEC</b> <b>values</b> from highly standardized D. magna reproduction tests (relatively low data heterogeneity) achieved a similar frequency distribution of MDR values as for chronic fish toxicity. Overall, the use of NOEC data for CA-based mixture toxicity predictions is not advocated.|$|R

The {{experiment was}} a 2 ?? 3 factorial arrangement with two levels of nutrient solution Zn concentrations, 0. 01 or 0. 10 <b>mg</b> <b>L,</b> and three levels of foliar applied Zn, 0, 23, or 230 <b>mg</b> <b>L.</b> Low (0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>L)</b> nutrient solution Zn seems to be inadequate for optimum plant growth; in this treatment plants showed Zn deficiency symptoms. Foliar application of Zn at 23 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> alleviated Zn deficiency by enhancing Zn concentration in the leaves, dry weight, and chlorophyll content. However, foliar application of Zn at 230 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> Zn caused adverse effects on both dry weight and chlorophyll content. Phosphorus (P) reached a detrimental level in the leaves of plants grown at 0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> Zn in nutrient solution, but 23 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> Zn applied via the leaves reduced P concentrations from toxic to adequate levels. Concentration of iron (Fe) was also higher but not detrimental in the leaves of plants grown at 0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> Zn. Foliar application of both concentrations of Zn slightly reduced Fe concentration in the leaves. Membrane permeability was impaired both in the plants grown at low Zn and in those receiving the high (230 <b>mg</b> <b>L)</b> foliar application. Foliar Zn at 23 <b>mg</b> <b>L</b> maintained membrane permeability by decreasing electrolyte leakage from leaves of Zn-deficient plants.
