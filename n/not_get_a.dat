5|$|Bungie had {{previously}} released soundtracks for their games due to fan request, but Microsoft was hesitant {{to commit to}} producing a soundtrack for Halo; at the time most video games did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> commercial soundtrack release. The publisher finally relented after pressure from O'Donnell and the outside solicitation of musician Nile Rodgers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This {{was not enough to}} convince the state selectors and Harvey did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E

5|$|I {{think we}} all know that we're going to hear {{announcements}} like this more often. A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|In week four, the Pros {{played against}} the Cincinnati Celts. The Celts were not {{directly}} {{affiliated with the}} APFA and would not join the league until the following year. Fullback Rip King scored the first touchdown by a five-yard rush in the first quarter. Pollard also scored a touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}} en route to a 13–0 Akron victory. The Pro's kicker for that game, Charlie Copley, made one extra point and missed the other. The Pros' defense was so dominant that the Celts did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> single first down all game long.|$|E
5|$|Moore did {{not make}} any screen {{appearances}} in 2003, but returned in 2004 with three films. There was no success in her first two ventures of the year: Marie and Bruce, a dark comedy co-starring Matthew Broderick, did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> cinematic release; Laws of Attraction followed, where she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, but the film was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with The Forgotten, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, the All-Americans {{played their}} second {{game against the}} Bulldogs, winning 7–3. The Bulldogs did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> first down or complete a pass during the game, but Thorpe kicked a field goal {{in the third quarter}} after a fumble recovery for the team's only score. In the fourth quarter, All-Americans tackle Youngstrom blocked a Thorpe punt and returned it for a touchdown. The Sunday Chronicle named Thorpe, Henry and Lowe as the Bulldogs' stars, while Anderson, Youngstrom, and Miller were the standouts for the All-Americans.|$|E
5|$|The tournament format was {{adjusted}} for 2006. The NHL went on hiatus {{for the duration}} of the games, allowing all players to compete. The number of teams was lowered to 12; the top six teams did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bye and played five preliminary round games. Sweden won the gold medal over Finland and the Czech Republic won the bronze medal. Three months later, Sweden won the 2006 World Championships and became the first team to win the Olympic and World Championship gold in the same year.|$|E

5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E
5|$|At JAMMA's 1992 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, {{held during}} 27–19 August 1992, Namco debuted a racing game called Sim Drive for the Namco System 22 arcade system board. It was {{a sequel to}} Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator, a Mazda MX-5 driving {{simulation}} arcade game that Namco developed with Mazda and released in 1990. Its 3D polygon graphics stood out for its use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping. After a location test at the show, where it was previewed by the November 1992 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Sim Drive had a limited Japanese release in December 1992, but did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> mass-market release. It served as a prototype for Ridge Racer.|$|E
5|$|He was {{selected}} for the Commonwealth Bank Series, playing four games and scoring 96 runs {{at an average of}} 24 with a top score of 47. He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16; his best figures were 3/16. His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad. He played three matches and did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4/32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka. He picked up two more wickets in the next two games. He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4–0–44–1 but was yet to bat. Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012, taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Men on a Mission {{challenged}} The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel but did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pinfall. Men on a Mission regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, {{to pull his}} wrestlers out of the ring. Men on a Mission won the match by countout, {{but they did not}} win the belts.|$|E
