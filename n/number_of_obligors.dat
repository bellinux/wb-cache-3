50|$|In {{the less}} common {{unassigned}} case, the defendant or property/casualty insurer retains the periodic payment obligation and funds it by purchasing an annuity {{from a life}} insurance company, thereby offsetting its obligation with a matching asset. The payment stream purchased under the annuity matches exactly, in timing and amounts, the periodic payments agreed to in the settlement agreement. The defendant or property/casualty company owns the annuity and names the claimant as the payee under the annuity, thereby directing the annuity issuer to send payments directly to the claimant. One of the reasons an unassigned case is less popular is that the obligation is not truly off the books, and the defendant or casualty insurer retains a contingent liability. While a default is a rare occurrence, contingent liability did come into play with the liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York.

40|$|Introduction and {{motivation}} The {{problem of how}} to specify a correlation matrix occurs in several important areas of finance and of risk management.

For those applications where the most important desideratum is the recovery of the real-world correlation matrix, the problem is in principle well defined and readily solvable by means of wellestablished statistical techniques.

Especially in inhomogeneous portfolios, i. e. portfolios with multiple areas of factors resulting in high losses, rotational invariant importance sampling is advantageous. Furthermore, rotational invariant importance sampling allows to calculate contributions to risk measures of different customer clusters in credit portfolios quicker and more precisely.

40|$|Abstract. The Basel II {{internal}} ratings-based (IRB) {{approach to}} capital adequacy for credit risk {{plays an important}} role in protecting the Australian banking sector against insolvency. We outline the mathematical foundations of regulatory capital modelling for credit risk, and extend the model specification of the IRB approach to a more general setting than the usual Gaussian case. It rests on the proposition that quantiles of the distribution of conditional expectation of portfolio percentage loss may be substituted for quantiles of the portfolio loss distribution. We present a more compact proof of this proposition under weaker assumptions. The IRB approach implements the so-called asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model, an asset value factor model of credit risk. The robustness of the model specification of the IRB approach to a relaxation in model assumptions is evaluated on a portfolio that is representative of the credit exposures of the Australian banking sector. We measure the rate of convergence, in terms of <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligors,</b> of empirical loss distributions to the asymptotic (infinitely fine-grained) portfolio loss distribution; and we evaluate the sensitivity of credit risk capital to dependence structure as modelled by asset correlations and elliptical copulas. A separate time series analysis takes measurements from the ASRF model of the prevailing state of Australia's economy and the level of capitalisation of its banking sector. These readings find general agreement with macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and external credit ratings. However, given the range of economic conditions, from mild contraction to moderate expansion, experienced in Australia since the implementation of Basel II, we cannot attest to the validity of the model specification of the IRB approach for its intended purpose of solvency assessment. With the implementation of Basel II preceding the time when the effect of the financial crisis of 2007 - 09 was most acutely felt, our empirical findings offer a fundamental assessment of the impact of the crisis on the Australian banking sector. Access to internal bank data collected by the prudential regulator distinguishes our research from other empirical studies on the IRB approach and recent crisis...|$|E

Guidelines began replacing court awarded support payments in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and were eventually mandated {{by the federal government}} in 1988. Two fundamentally different types of guidelines are used: percentage <b>of</b> <b>obligor</b> income, and income shares models. This paper explores the incentives to divorce under the two schemes, and uses the NLSY data set to test the key predictions. We find that percentage <b>of</b> <b>obligor</b> income models are destabilizing for some families with high incomes.

The dynamics of the survival probabilities and credit spreads <b>of</b> individual <b>obligors</b> are derived and it is shown that in situations with positive dependence, the default <b>of</b> one <b>obligor</b> causes the credit spreads <b>of</b> the other <b>obligors</b> to jump upwards, as it is experienced empirically in situations with credit contagion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new nonparametric {{approach}} to interacting failing systems (FS), that is systems whose probability of failure is not negligible in a fixed time horizon, a typical example being firms and financial bonds. The main purpose when studying a FS is to calculate the probability of default and the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> failures that may occur during the observation period. A model used to study a failing system is defined default model. In particular, we present a general recursive model constructed by the means of inter- acting urns. After introducing the theoretical model and its properties we show a first application to credit risk modeling, showing how to assess the idiosyncratic probability of default <b>of</b> an <b>obligor</b> and the joint probability of failure of a set <b>of</b> <b>obligors</b> in a portfolio of risks, that are divided into reliability classes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new approach}} in modelling dependent defaults within a top-down approach. First, a general framework to map the default of a set <b>of</b> <b>obligors</b> is developed by using a marked Poisson Process. Then, a characteri-zation of the default intensity for a set <b>of</b> <b>obligors</b> is derived, which allows to incorporate elements of structural models into the intensity modelling frame-work. As a result the approach combines the advantages of reduced-form and structural approaches in modelling dependent defaults. Based on adequate dependency measures {{the ability of the}} top-down construc-tion is pointed out. Furthermore, the dependencies induced by this approach are compared to the ones obtained within basic multi-entity structural and reduced-form models. Finally, valuation formulas for the three major payment blocks are derived and applied to credit derivative pricing...|$|R

In the process of model construction, the classical structural approach and option pricing formula contribute to estimate dynamic default probabilities <b>of</b> single <b>obligor,</b> which helps to obtain the dynamic Poisson intensities under the model assumption. Finally, given the values of coefficients in this model calculated by a nonlinear estimation, Monte Carlo technique simulates the progress of loss occurrence. Relationship between default probability and loss level reflected through the MC simulation has practical features. This study illustrates the practical value and effectiveness of mixed Poisson model in risk measurement for credit portfolio...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the price {{calibration}} of basket default swap from Japanese market data. The value of this instruments depend on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> factors including credit rating <b>of</b> the <b>obligors</b> in the basket, recovery rates, intensity of default, basket size and the correlation <b>of</b> <b>obligors</b> in the basket. A fundamental part of the pricing framework is the estimation of the instantaneous default probabilities for each obligor. Because default probabilities depend on the credit quality <b>of</b> the considered <b>obligor,</b> well-calibrated credit curves are a main ingredient for constructing default times. The calibration of credit curves take into account internal information on credit migrations and default history. We refer to Japan Credit Rating Agency to obtain rating transition matrix and cumulative default rates. Default risk is often considered as a rare-event and then, many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. Subsequently, the choice of copula and the choice of procedures for rare-event simulation govern the pricing of basket credit derivatives. Joshi and Kainth (2004) introduced an Importance Sampling technique for rare-event that forces a predetermined <b>number</b> <b>of</b> defaults to occur on each path.
