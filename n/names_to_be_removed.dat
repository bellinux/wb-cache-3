50|$|Latter-day Saints {{may view}} ex-Mormons as {{stronger}} candidates for eternal damnation {{based on their}} former devotion to Mormonism, since those who were never adherents will be judged more lightly. In addition, one who {{goes so far as}} to deny the Holy Spirit could become a son of perdition and be cast into outer darkness. Outright apostasy of members will lead to a church disciplinary council, which may result in disfellowshipment or excommunication. However, members who ask for their <b>names</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from church records or who have joined another church are not subject to a disciplinary council.|$|E
50|$|Second unit {{director}} James Sbardellati, {{who later}} directed Deathstalker, {{was hired to}} enliven the film; he filmed explicit scenes in which the humanoids rape women.

After Peeters and Turkel saw the additional sequences, they asked for their <b>names</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the film but were refused.

5000|$|In 2005, {{a report}} by {{economist}} Christopher Smallwood, personally commissioned by Prince Charles, claimed that CAM was cost-effective and should {{be available in the}} National Health Service (NHS).

5000|$|Scott Bizar {{wanted to}} produce a science-fiction {{role-playing}} game, and asked Edward E. Simbalist, Phil McGregor, and Ratner to develop it.

Accordingly, he met privately with the president to ask for his <b>name</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from consideration.|$|R
50|$|Linton {{directed}} the 2016 thriller Exposed starring Keanu Reeves, which was mired in controversy.

2500|$|Moore has {{subsequently}} {{stated that}} he wishes his <b>name</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from all comic work {{that he does not}} own, including Watchmen and V for Vendetta, much as unhappy film directors often choose <b>to</b> have their <b>names</b> <b>removed</b> and <b>be</b> credited as [...] "Alan Smithee".
