5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E

25|$|Transcription {{fidelity}} {{is achieved}} through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding {{base in the}} DNA is admitted to the active center. RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing. The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation. Note that all reactions (phosphodiester bond synthesis, pyrophosphorolysis, phosphodiester bond hydrolysis) are performed by RNA polymerase by using a single active center.|$|E
50|$|Most {{transcripts}} originate using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and, to {{a lesser}} extent, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) (purine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates)</b> at the +1 site. Uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) and cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) (pyrimidine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates)</b> are disfavoured at the initiation site.|$|R
50|$|Note that, originally, {{biochemical}} nomenclature distinguished synthetases and synthases. Under {{the original}} definition, synthases {{do not use}} energy from <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> (such as ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP), whereas synthetases do use <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates.</b> However, the Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (JCBN) dictates that 'synthase' {{can be used with}} any enzyme that catalyzes synthesis (whether or not it uses <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates),</b> whereas 'synthetase' is to be used synonymously with 'ligase'.|$|R
40|$|Removal of <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> from {{extracts}} prepared from bacteriophage T 7 -infected Escherichia coli {{results in}} a stringent requirement for added ATP to form infective phage particles by in vitro packaging of bacteriophage T 7 DNA. Optimal packaging efficiency was achieved at a concentration of about 1. 25 mM. Other <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> could be substituted for ATP, {{but none of the}} common <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> was as effective as ATP in promoting in vitro encapsulation...|$|R
500|$|From the {{perspective}} of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> which indicates that it consists of three components, a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. [...] It is used in cells as a coenzyme.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> and H2O, whereas its two {{products are}} nucleotide and diphosphate.|$|E
5000|$|The terms ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP {{refer to}} those <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> that contain ribose. The <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> {{containing}} deoxyribose are called dNTPs, {{and take the}} prefix deoxy- in their names and small d- in their abbreviations: deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP), deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). The dNTPs are the building blocks for DNA replication (they lose two of the phosphate groups {{in the process of}} incorporation).|$|R

5000|$|Biochemical {{nomenclature}} {{has sometimes}} distinguished synthetases from synthases and sometimes treated {{the words as}} synonymous. Under one definition, synthases do not use energy from <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> (such as ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP), whereas synthetases do use <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates.</b> It is also said that a synthase is a lyase (a lyase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breaking of various chemical bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation, often forming a new double bond or a new ring structure) and does not require any energy, whereas a synthetase is a ligase (a ligase is an enzyme that binds two chemicals or compounds) and thus requires energy. However, the Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (JCBN) dictates that [...] "synthase" [...] {{can be used with}} any enzyme that catalyses synthesis (whether or not it uses <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates),</b> whereas [...] "synthetase" [...] is to be used synonymously.|$|R

40|$|The {{triphosphates}} of 9 -(2 -hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine and 9 -(1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl) guanine {{were examined}} for their inhibitory effect on highly purified cellular DNA polymerase alpha and human cytomegalovirus (Towne strain) -induced DNA polymerase. These two <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> competitively inhibited {{the incorporation of}} dGMP into DNA catalyzed by the DNA polymerases. The virus-induced DNA polymerase had greater binding affinity for the triphosphate of 9 -(2 -hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine (Ki, 8 nM) than for the triphosphate of 9 -(1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl) guanine (Ki, 22 nM), although the nucleoside of the latter compound was strikingly more effective against human cytomegalovirus replication in cell cultures than the nucleoside of the former. The Ki values of these two <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> for alpha polymerase were 96 and 146 nM, respectively, and were 7 - to 12 -fold higher than those for the virus-induced enzyme.

40|$|Modified <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> (NTPs) {{represent}} powerful {{building blocks}} to generate nucleic acids with novel properties by enzymatic synthesis.

In the present note, we introduce the chemical synthesis of the novel 2 ′-methylseleno- 2 ′-deoxyadenosine and -guanosine 5 ′-triphosphates (2 ′-SeCH 3 -ATP and 2 ′-SeCH 3 -GTP) that represent further candidates for the enzymatic RNA synthesis with engineered RNA polymerases...|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that acylphosphatase possesses ATP-diphosphohydrolase (apyrase-like) activity. In fact, acylphosphatase first catalyses the hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate group of <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates,</b> and then attacks the beta-phosphate group of the initially produced nucleoside diphosphates, generating nucleoside monophosphates. In contrast, it binds nucleoside monophosphates but does not catalyse their hydrolyses. The calculated k(cat) values for the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of acylphosphatase are of the same order of magnitude as those displayed by certain G-proteins. An acidic environment enhances the apyrase-like activity of acylphosphatase. The true nucleotide substrates of acylphosphatase are free <b>nucleoside</b> di- and <b>triphosphates,</b> {{as indicated by the}} Mg(2 +) ion inhibition of the activity. We have also demonstrated that, although <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> are still hydrolysed at pH 7. 2 and 37 degrees C, in the presence of millimolar Mg(2 +) concentrations this occurs at a lower rate. Taken together with the previously observed strong increase of acylphosphatase levels during induced cell differentiation, our findings suggest that acylphosphatase plays {{an active role in the}} differentiation process (as well as in other processes, such as apoptosis) by modulating the ratio between the cellular levels of nucleoside diphosphates and <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates...</b>|$|R

5000|$|... where Pi denotes {{inorganic}} phosphate, NDP denotes {{nucleoside diphosphate}} (either GDP or ADP), and NTP denotes <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (either GTP or ATP). As mentioned, the enzyme facilitates coupling of {{the conversion of}} succinyl CoA to succinate {{with the formation of}} NTP from NDP and Pi. The reaction has a biochemical standard state free energy change of -3.4 kJ/mol. [...] The reaction takes place by a three-step mechanism which is depicted in the image below. The first step involves displacement of CoA from succinyl CoA by a nucleophilic inorganic phosphate molecule to form succinyl phosphate. The enzyme then utilizes a histidine residue to remove the phosphate group from succinyl phosphate and generate succinate. Finally, the phosphorylated histidine transfers the phosphate group to a nucleoside diphosphate, which generates the high-energy carrying <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate.</b>|$|E
