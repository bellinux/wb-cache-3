40|$|In {{pursuit of}} a {{tractable}} bioassay to assess blood prion infectivity, we have generated prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila, which show a neurotoxic phenotype in adulthood after exposure to exogenous prions at the larval stage. Here, we determined the sensitivity of ovine PrP transgenic Drosophila to ovine prion infectivity by exposure of these flies to a dilution series of scrapie-infected sheep brain homogenate. Ovine PrP transgenic Drosophila showed a significant <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> to dilutions of 10 (- 2) to 10 (- 10) of the original scrapie-infected sheep brain homogenate. Significantly, we determined that this prion-induced <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> in ovine PrP transgenic Drosophila was transmissible to ovine PrP transgenic mice, which is indicative of authentic mammalian prion detection by these flies. As a consequence, we considered that PrP transgenic Drosophila were sufficiently sensitive to exogenous mammalian prions {{to be capable of}} detecting prion infectivity in the blood of scrapie-infected sheep. To test this hypothesis, we exposed ovine PrP transgenic Drosophila to scrapie-infected plasma, a blood fraction notoriously difficult to assess by conventional prion bioassays. Notably, pre-clinical plasma from scrapie-infected sheep induced neurotoxicity in PrP transgenic Drosophila and this effect was more pronounced after exposure to samples collected at the clinical phase of disease. The neurotoxic phenotype in ovine PrP transgenic Drosophila induced by plasma from scrapie-infected sheep was transmissible since head homogenate from these flies caused neurotoxicity in recipient flies during fly-to-fly transmission. Our data show that PrP transgenic Drosophila can be used successfully to bioassay prion infectivity in blood from a prion-diseased mammalian host...|$|E

Drugs of abuse can cause long-lasting damage to the brain and HIV infection frequently leads to a dementing illness. To determine how these drugs interact with HIV to cause CNS damage, we used an in vitro human neuronal culture characterized {{for the presence of}} dopaminergic receptors, transporters and estrogen receptors. We determined the combined effects of dopaminergic drugs, methamphetamine, or cocaine with neurotoxic HIV proteins, gp 120 and Tat. Results Acute exposure to these substances resulted in synergistic <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> as measured by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and neuronal cell death. Neurotoxicity occurred in a sub-population of neurons. Importantly, the presence of 17 beta-estradiol prevented these synergistic neurotoxicities and the neuroprotective effects were partly mediated by estrogen receptors.

Several studies reported effects on behaviour at concentrations orders of magnitudes below lethal concentrations [228, 229].

A variety of activities are used as behavioural endpoints to screen for effects of chemicals, for example avoidance, feeding and locomotion [1]. Some of these behavioural endpoints may be applicable to investigate rapid acute <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> or effects of longer exposures with consequences that may have larger impact, such as neurodevelopmental effects. Such effects on behaviour may be caused by acute neurotoxic effects on neuronal functioning (inter- and intracellular signalling and neuronal network function to receive, conduct, and transmit signals via chemical or electrical synapses and relay information between specific brain regions for information processing as well as learning and memory formation) or to mechanisms related to neurodevelopmental processes (proliferation, migration, differentiation, formation of axons, and dendrites, synaptogenesis, network formation and apoptosis).

40|$|Synaptic {{function}} {{is critical for}} the brain to process experiences dictated by the environment requiring change over the lifetime of the organism. Experience-driven adaptation requires that receptors, signal transduction pathways, transcription and translational mechanisms within neurons respond rapidly over its lifetime. Adaptive responses communicated through the rapid firing of neurons are dependent upon the integrity and function of synapses. These rapid responses via adaptation underlie the organism’s ability to perceive, learn, remember, calculate and plan. Glutamate, the endogenous neurotransmitter required for physiological excitation in the brain, is critically involved in neuronal adaptive responses and in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Using neuronal experimental systems, we will discuss how compounds with low dose effects mediated via glutamate receptors can result either in a neuroprotective or <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response.</b> Because the brain has evolved to respond rapidly to environmental cues, expo- sure of neurons to stressful stimuli {{can result in a}} pivotal response toward either synaptic adaptation or dysfunction and neuronal cell death.

40|$|Several {{effects of}} the {{endogenous}} opioid peptide dynorphin A (Dyn A) are not mediated through the opioid receptors. These effects are generally excitatory, and result in cell loss and induction of chronic pain and paralysis. The mechanism(s) is not well defined but may involve formation of pores in cellular membranes. In the 17 -amino acid peptide Dyn A we have recently identified L 5 S, R 6 W, and R 9 C mutations that cause the dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder Spinocerebellar ataxia type 23. To gain further insight into non-opioid neurodegenerative mechanism(s), we studied the perturbation effects on lipid bilayers of wild type Dyn A and its mutants in large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles encapsulating the fluorescent dye calcein. The peptides were found to induce calcein leakage from uncharged and negatively charged vesicles to different degrees, thus reflecting different membrane perturbation effects. The mutant Dyn A R 6 W was the most potent in producing leakage with negatively charged vesicles whereas Dyn A L 5 S was virtually inactive. The overall correlation between membrane perturbation and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> [3] suggests that pathogenic Dyn A actions may be mediated through transient pore formation in lipid domains of the plasma membrane...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} further the hormone-dependent processes underlying sex differences in <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> within the rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic (NSDA) pathway after partial lesioning with 6 -OHDA, a state thought to mimic the early stages of Parkinson's disease where, in humans and animal models alike, males appear to be more susceptible. Contrary to our hypotheses, hormone manipulations (gonadectomy +/- oestrogen or androgen treatment) failed to alter survival of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) after lesioning; this indicates that, unlike inherent sex differences in toxin-induced striatal dopamine depletion, sex differences in cell loss were not hormonally generated, and that hormone-dependent changes in dopamine depletion can occur independently of cell survival. In addition, hormonally induced changes in striatal expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT), an important factor for 6 -OHDA toxicity, did not correlate with hormonal influences on striatal dopamine loss and, in males, central inhibition of aromatase prior to 6 -OHDA infusion exacerbated striatal dopamine loss with no effect on SNc tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive survival, suggesting locally generated oestrogen is neuroprotective. These results support the novel view that sex steroid hormones produced peripherally and centrally play a significant, sex-specific role within the sexually dimorphic NSDA pathway to modulate plastic, compensatory responses aimed at restoring striatal dopamine functionality, without affecting cell loss...|$|R

Lesions of the basal forebrain were made in rats by infusing different doses of either a-amine- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole propionic acid, ibotenic acid, quisqualic acid, quinolinic acid or N-methyl-u-aspartic acid and measuring choline acetyltransferase ven days later. All of the excitotoxins exerted a differential response on cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain projecting to the cortex or amygdala. Quinolinic acid was a more potent neurotoxin to cholinergic neurons innervating the amygdala than those projecting to the cortex.

40|$|The major {{pathological}} {{features of}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include amyloid plaques composed primarily of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, degenerating neurons and neurofibrillary tangles, {{and the presence}} of numerous activated astrocytes and microglia. Although extensive genetic data implicate Aβ in the neurodegenerative cascade of AD, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on neurons and glia and the relationship between glial activation and neuronal death are not well defined. Aβ has been shown to induce glial activation, and a growing body of evidence suggests that activated glia contribute to neurotoxicity through generation of inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals, such as nitric oxide (NO), potent sources of oxidative stress known to occur in AD. It is therefore crucial to identify specific Aβ-induced molecular pathways mediating these responses in activated glia. We report that Aβ stimulates the activation of the transcription factor NFκB in rat astrocytes, that NFκB activation occurs selectively from p 65 transactivation domain 2, and that Aβ-induced NO synthase expression and NO production occur through an NFκB-dependent mechanism. This demonstration of how Aβ couples an intracellular signal transduction pathway involving NFκB to a potentially <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> provides a key mechanistic link between Aβ and the generation of oxidative damage.

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA), a {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminant, {{has been}} shown to cause developmental toxicity and carcinogenic effects. BPA may have physiological activity through estrogen receptor (ER) -α and -β, which are expressed in the central nervous system. We previously found that exposure of BPA to immature mice resulted in behavioral alternation, suggesting that overexposure of BPA could be neurotoxic. In this study, we further investigated the molecular neurotoxic mechanisms of BPA. BPA increased vulnerability (decrease of cell viability and differentiation, and increase of apoptotic cell death) of undifferentiated PC 12 cells and cortical neuronal cells isolated from gestation 18 day rat embryos in a concentration-dependent manner (more than 50 µM). The ER antagonists, ICI 182, 780, and tamoxifen, did not block these effects. The cell vulnerability against BPA was not significantly different in the PC 12 cells overexpressing ER-α and ER-β compared with PC 12 cells expressing vector alone. In addition, there was no difference observed between BPA and 17 -β estradiol, a well-known agonist of ER receptor in the induction of <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>responses.</b> Further study of the mechanism showed that BPA significantly activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but inhibited anti-apoptotic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. In addition, ERK-specific inhibitor, PD 98, 059, reversed BPA-induced cell death and restored NF-κB activity. This study demonstrated that exposure to BPA can cause neuronal cell death which may eventually be related with behavioral alternation in vivo. However, this neurotoxic effect may not be directly mediated through an ER receptor, as an ERK/NF-κB pathway may be more closely involved in BPA-induced neuronal toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} a brain with Alzheimer disease (AD) include the presence of neuritic plaques composed of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and reductions in the levels of cholinergic markers. <b>Neurotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> to Abeta {{have been reported in}} vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the cholinergic deficit in AD brain may be secondary to the degeneration of cholinergic neurons caused by Abeta. However, it remains to be determined if Abeta contributes to the cholinergic deficit in AD brain by nontoxic effects. We examined the effects of synthetic Abeta peptides on the cholinergic properties of a mouse cell line, SN 56, derived from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Abeta 1 - 42 and Abeta 1 - 28 reduced the acetylcholine (AcCho) content of the cells in a concentration-dependent fashion, whereas Abeta 1 - 16 was inactive. Maximal reductions of 43 % and 33 % were observed after a 48 -h treatment with 100 nM of Abeta 1 - 42 and 50 pM of Abeta 1 - 28, respectively. Neither Abeta 1 - 28 nor Abeta 1 - 42 at a concentration of 100 nM and a treatment period of 2 weeks was toxic to the cells. Treatment of the cells with Abeta 25 - 28 (48 h; 100 nM) significantly decreased AcCho levels, suggesting that the sequence GSNK (aa 25 - 28) is responsible for the AcCho-reducing effect of Abeta. The reductions in AcCho levels caused by Abeta 1 - 42 and Abeta 1 - 28 were accompanied by proportional decreases in choline acetyltransferase activity. In contrast, acetylcholinesterase activity was unaltered, indicating that Abeta specifically reduces the synthesis of AcCho in SN 56 cells. The reductions in AcCho content caused by Abeta 1 - 42 could be prevented by a cotreatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (10 nM), a compound previously shown to increase choline acetyltransferase mRNA expression in SN 56 cells. These results demonstrate a nontoxic, suppressive effect of Abeta on AcCho synthesis, an action that may contribute to the cholinergic deficit in AD brain...|$|R
40|$|One {{mechanism}} {{leading to}} neurodegeneration during Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is amyloid β peptide (Aβ) neurotoxicity. Aβ elicits in cultured {{central nervous system}} neurons a biphasic response: a low-dose neurotrophic response and a high-dose <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response.</b> Previously we reported that NF-κB is activated by low doses of Aβ only. Here we show that NF-κB activation leads to neuroprotection. In primary neurons we found that a pretreatment with 0. 1 μM Aβ-(1 – 40) protects against neuronal death induced with 10 μM Aβ-(1 – 40). As a known neuroprotective agent we next analyzed the effect of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Maximal activation of NF-κB was found with 2 ng/ml TNF-α. Pretreatment with TNF-α protected cerebellar granule cells from cell death induced by 10 μM Aβ-(1 – 40). This protection is described by an inverted U-shaped dose response and is maximal with a NF-κB-activating dose. The molecular specificity of this protective effect was analyzed by specific blockade of NF-κB activation. Overexpression of a transdominant negative IκB-α blocks NF-κB activation and potentiates Aβ-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Our findings show that activation of NF-κB is the underlying mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of low-dose Aβ and TNF-α. In accordance with these in vitro data we find that nuclear NF-κB immunoreactivity around various plaque stages of AD patients is reduced in comparison to age-matched controls.

40|$|Activation of the microglial <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> by {{components}} of the senile plaque plays {{a critical role in}} the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia induce neurodegeneration primarily by secreting nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF?), and hydrogen peroxide. Central to the activation of microglia is the membrane receptor CD 40, which is the target of costimulators such as interferon-? (IFN?). Chromogranin A (CGA) is a recently identified endogenous component of the neurodegenerative plaques of AD and Parkinson's disease. CGA stimulates microglial secretion of NO and TNF?, resulting in both neuronal and microglial apoptosis. Using electrochemical recording from primary rat microglial cells in culture, we have shown in the present study that CGA alone induces a fast-initiating oxidative burst in microglia. We compared the potency of CGA with that of {beta}-amyloid ({beta}A) under identical conditions and found that CGA induces 5 – 7 times greater NO and TNF? secretion. Coapplication of CGA with {beta}A or with IFN? resulted in a synergistic effect on NO and TNF? secretion. CD 40 expression was induced by CGA and was further increased when {beta}A or IFN? was added in combination. Tyrphostin A 1 (TyrA 1), which inhibits the CD 40 cascade, exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of the CGA effect alone and in combination with IFN? and {beta}A. Furthermore, CGA-induced mitochondrial depolarization, which precedes microglial apoptosis, was fully blocked in the presence of TyrA 1.

Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize the earliest events of M. leprae-induced nerve damage. We find that demyelination and axonal damage are not directly initiated by M. leprae but by infected macrophages that patrol axons; demyelination occurs in areas of intimate contact. PGL- 1 confers this <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> on macrophages: macrophages infected with M. marinum-expressing PGL- 1 also damage axons. PGL- 1 induces nitric oxide synthase in infected macrophages, and the resultant increase in reactive nitrogen species damages axons by injuring their mitochondria and inducing demyelination.

40|$|Proteolytic {{processing}} of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) produces beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide fragments that accumulate in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), but APP may also regulate multiple aspects of neuronal development, albeit via mechanisms {{that are not}} well understood. APP {{is a member of}} a family of transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by all higher organisms, including two mammalian orthologs (APLP 1 and APLP 2) that have complicated investigations into the specific activities of APP. By comparison, insects express only a single APP-related protein (APP-Like, or APPL) that contains the same protein interaction domains identified in APP. However, unlike its mammalian orthologs, APPL is only expressed by neurons, greatly simplifying an analysis of its functions in vivo. Like APP, APPL is processed by secretases to generate a similar array of extracellular and intracellular cleavage fragments, as well as an Aβ-like fragment that can induce <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>responses</b> in the brain. Exploiting the complementary advantages of two insect models (Drosophila melanogaster and Manduca sexta), we have investigated the regulation of APPL trafficking and processing with respect to different aspects of neuronal development. By comparing the behavior of endogenously expressed APPL with fluorescently tagged versions of APPL and APP, we have shown that some full-length protein is consistently trafficked into the most motile regions of developing neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Concurrently, much of the holoprotein is rapidly processed into N- and C-terminal fragments that undergo bi-directional transport within distinct vesicle populations. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that APPL can be transiently sequestered into an amphisome-like compartment in developing neurons, while manipulations targeting APPL cleavage altered their motile behavior in cultured embryos. These data suggest that multiple mechanisms restrict the bioavailability of the holoprotein to regulate APPL-dependent responses within the nervous system. Lastly, targeted expression of our double-tagged constructs (combined with time-lapse imaging) revealed that APP family proteins are subject to complex patterns of trafficking and processing that vary dramatically between different neuronal subtypes. In combination, our results provide a new perspective on how the regulation of APP family proteins can be modulated to accommodate a variety of cell type-specific responses within the embryonic and adult nervous system...|$|R
40|$|A {{key part}} of the innate immune system is a network of pattern {{recognition}} receptors (PRRs) and their associated intracellular signalling pathways. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one such group of PRRs that detect pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Activation of the TLRs with their respective agonists results in the activation of intracellular signalling pathways leading to the expression of proinflammatory mediators and anti-microbial effector molecules. Activation of the innate immune system through TLRs also triggers the adaptive immune response, resulting in a comprehensive immune program to eradicate invading pathogens. It is now known that immune surveillance and inflammatory responses occur in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore it is becoming increasingly clear that TLRs have a role in such CNS responses and are also implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of conditions in the CNS, such as Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s, stroke and multiple sclerosis. This is likely due to the generation of endogenous TLR agonists in these conditions which amplifies a detrimental <b>neurotoxic</b> inflammatory <b>response.</b> However TLRs in some situations can be neuroprotective, if triggered in a favourable context.

Here we report that the NSAIDs ibuprofen, indomethacin and sulindac sulphide preferentially decrease the highly amyloidogenic Aβ 42 peptide (the 42 -residue isoform of the amyloid-β peptide) produced {{from a variety of}} cultured cells by as much as 80 %. This effect was not seen in all NSAIDs and seems not to be mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, the principal pharmacological target of NSAIDs. Furthermore, short-term administration of ibuprofen to mice that produce mutant β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) lowered their brain levels of Aβ 42. In cultured cells, the decrease in Aβ 42 secretion was accompanied by an increase in the Aβ(1 – 38) isoform, indicating that NSAIDs subtly alter γ-secretase activity without significantly perturbing other APP processing pathways or Notch cleavage. Our findings suggest that NSAIDs directly affect amyloid pathology in the brain by reducing Aβ 42 peptide levels independently of COX activity and that this Aβ 42 -lowering activity could be optimized to selectively target the pathogenic Aβ 42 species...|$|R

Furthermore, the effect of DOM was confirmed by culturing primary astrocytes from the hippocampus and the brain stem and subsequently exposing them to domoic acid. The RNA was extracted and used for biomarker analysis. The biomarker analysis was done for the early response genes including c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, Hsp- 72; specific marker for the astrocytes- GFAP and the glutamate receptors including GluR 2, NMDAR 1, NMDAR 2 A and B. Although, the astrocyte-GFAP and c-fos were not affected, c-jun and GluR 2 were down-regulated. The microarray analysis revealed that the chemokines / cytokines, tyrosine kinases (Trk), and apoptotic genes were altered. The chemokines that were up-regulated included - IL 1 -a, IL- 1 B, IL- 6, the small inducible cytokine, interferon protein IP- 10, CXC chemokine LIX, and IGF binding proteins. The Bax, Bcl- 2, Trk A and Trk B were all downregulated. Interestingly, only the hippocampal astrocytes were affected. Our findings suggest that astrocytes may present a possible target for pharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of amnesic shellfish poisoning and for other brain pathologies involving excitotoxicit...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} dementia ultimately leading to death. Characteristic of neuropathological {{findings of the}} disease at autopsy is the extracellular accretion of beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein into senile plaques (SPs). Reports of immune activated microglia, members of the mononuclear phagocyte system (mø) in intimate contact with these lesions {{have led to the}} theory that AD has a chronic inflammatory component. Furthermore, reports of the expression of inflammatory mediators in AD brain have implicated these brain mø as mediators of neural cell death in AD. These findings strongly suggest that mø-mediated toxicity in AD may result from mø interaction with Aβ. As phagocytic stimuli can activate mø to a cytopathic state, a key issue in AD etiopathogenesis is the relationship between phagocytosis of Aβ by mø, and mø-mediated neurotoxicity. The objective of this investigation was to examine the hypothesis that the phagocytosis of Aβ by mø is a prerequisite for neurotoxicity. While phagocytosis of Aβ by mø has been studied by a variety of methods, none have unequivocally established whether Aβ is internalized, or is just partially surrounded by mø processes. Additionally, the link between phagocytosis of Aβ by mø, and mø-mediated neurotoxicity remains undemonstrated. A novel approach employing confocal microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction was used to confirm that mø completely internalize Aβ. Results demonstrate that mø unequivocally phagoeytose Aβ, exerting a graded <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response</b> that appears to be related to their extent of Aβ phagocytosis. Decreasing Aβ aggregate size resulted in increased aggregate internalization by mø, and Aβ present in high-speed supernatant fractions were potently neurotoxic, and taken up more avidly by mø than unfractionated Aβ. Both phagocytosis of Aβ and mø-mediated neurotoxicity were found to be partially dependent on mø generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, these findings reveal that Aβ phagocytosis is associated with increased mø-mediated neurotoxicity, and highlights the prospect that internalization of Aβ by mø in the brain might contribute to the neuroinflarrimation observed in AD. ...|$|E

Treatment of 0. 5 or 1 mM dopamine with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or lactoperoxidase (LPO) in {{the presence}} of 1 or 2 mM H 2 O 2 with NO 2 - at a concentration of 0. 5 - 10 mM resulted in the formation of 1 and 2 in up to 8 and 2 mu M yields, respectively, depending on the substrate concentration and the NO 2 H 2 O 2 ratio. Nitration and hydroxylation of 0. 1 mM dopamine was observed with 1 mM NO 2 - using HRP and the D-glucose/glucose oxidase system to generate H 2 O 2 in situ. In {{the presence of}} NO 2 [...] , Fe 2 +-, or Fe 2 +/EDTA-promoted oxidations of dopamine with H 2 O 2 also {{led to the formation of}} 1 and 2, the apparent product ratios varying with peroxide concentration and the partitioning of the metal between EDTA and catecholamine chelates. In the presence of NO 2 -, Fe 2 +-promoted autoxidation of dopamine gave 2 but no detectable 1. When injected into the brains of laboratory rats, 2 caused sporadic behavioral changes, indicating that it could elicit a <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>response,</b> albeit to a lower extent than 1. Model experiments using tyrosinase as an oxidizing system and mechanistic considerations suggested that formation of 2 does not involve reactive nitrogen radicals but results mainly from nucleophilic attack of NO 2 - to dopamine quinone. Generation of 1, on the other hand, may be derives from different H 2 O 2 -dependent pathways. Collectively, these results outline a complex interplay of NO 2 [...] and peroxide-dependent oxidation pathways of dopamine, which may contribute to impair dopaminergic neurotransmission and induce cytotoxic processes in neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E
40|$|Microglia and macrophages are {{recruited}} to sites of retinal degeneration where local cytokines and chemokines determine protective or <b>neurotoxic</b> microglia <b>responses.</b> Defining {{the role of}} Ccl 2 -Ccr 2 and Cx 3 cl 1 -Cx 3 cr 1 signalling for retinal pathology {{is of particular interest}} because of its potential role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Ccl 2, Ccr 2, and Cx 3 cr 1 signalling defects impair macrophage trafficking, but have, in several conflicting studies, been reported to show different degrees of age-related retinal degeneration. Ccl 2 /Cx 3 cr 1 double knockout (CCDKO) mice show an early onset retinal degeneration and have been suggested as a model for AMD. In order to understand phenotypic discrepancies in different chemokine knockout lines and to study how defects in Ccl 2 and/or Cx 3 cr 1 signalling contribute to the described early onset retinal degeneration, we defined primary and secondary pathological events in CCDKO mice. To control for genetic background variability, we compared the original phenotype with that of single Ccl 2, Cx 3 cr 1 and Ccl 2 /Cx 3 cr 1 double knockout mice obtained from backcrosses of CCDKO with C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. We found that the primary pathological event in CCDKO mice develops in the inferior outer nuclear layer independently of light around postnatal day P 14. RPE and vascular lesions develop secondarily with increasing penetrance with age and are clinically similar to retinal telangiectasia not to choroidal neovascularisation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a third autosomal recessive gene causes the degeneration in CCDKO mice and in all affected re-derived lines and subsequently demonstrated co-segregation of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{associated with}} brain innate immune activation mainly mediated by microglia. These cells {{are known to}} be activated in the brain of AD patients and to produce inflammatory cytokines and <b>neurotoxic</b> molecules in <b>response</b> to Amyloid beta (Aβ). Activation of microglia can also promote Aβ clearance via Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD 88) is the adaptor molecule for most of these innate immune receptors, transducing the intracellular signal from TLRs to nucleus. Results Here, we report that more than 50 % reduction in MyD 88 expression in a mouse model of AD accelerated spatial learning and memory deficits. Brain of APP swe /PS 1 -MyD 88 +/- mice was characterized by a delay in accumulation of Aβ plaques and increased soluble levels of Aβ oligomers. Furthermore, inflammatory monocyte subset and brain IL- 1 β gene expression were significantly reduced in APP swe /PS 1 mice with impaired MyD 88 signaling. Conclusions These data indicate that activation of MyD 88 intracellular signaling pathway, likely by TLRs, acts as a natural innate immune mechanism to restrict disease progression of APP swe /PS 1 mice. </p...|$|R
40|$|The [gamma]-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is {{the major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter in vertebrate CNS. At GABAergic synapses, a high-affinity transporter exists, {{which is responsible for}} GABA reuptake and release during neurotransmission. GABA transporter activity depends on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state, being modulated by Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2 B (calcineurin). Aluminium is known to interfere with the Ca 2 +/calmodulin signalling pathway. In this work, we investigate the action of aluminium on GABA translocation mediated by the high-affinity transporter, using synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) vesicles and synaptosomes isolated from brain cortex. Aluminium completely relieved Ca 2 + downregulation of GABA transporter, when mediating uptake or release. Accordingly, aluminium inhibited Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent calcineurin activity present in SPM, in a concentration-dependent manner. The deleterious action of aluminium on the modulation of GABA transport was ascertained by comparative analysis of the aluminium effect on GABA uptake and release, under conditions favouring SPM dephosphorylation (presence of intracellular micromolar Ca 2 +) or phosphorylation (absence of Ca 2 + and/or presence of W- 7, a selective calmodulin antagonist). In conclusion, aluminium-induced relief of Ca 2 + modulatory action on GABA transporter may contribute significantly to modify GABAergic signalling during <b>neurotoxic</b> events in <b>response</b> to aluminium exposure.

40|$|The {{foundations}} of innate immunity in neurodegenerative disorders were first laid by Del Rio Hortega (1919). He identified and named microglia, recognizing them as cells of mesodermal origin. Van Furth in 1969 elaborated the monocyte phagocytic system with microglia as the brain representatives. Validation of these concepts {{did not occur}} until 1987 when HLA-DR was identified on activated microglia in a spectrum of neurological disorders. HLA-DR had already been established as a definitive marker of immunocompetent cells of mesodermal origin. It was soon determined that the observed inflammatory reaction was an innate immune response. A rapid expansion of the field took place as other markers of an innate immune response were found that were made by neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and endothelial cells. The molecules included complement proteins and their regulators, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, acute phase reactants, prostaglandins, proteases, protease inhibitors, coagulation factors, fibrinolytic factors, anaphylatoxins, integrins, free radical generators, and other unidentified neurotoxins. The Nimmerjahn movies demonstrated that resting microglia were constantly active, sampling the surround, and responding rapidly to brain damage. Ways of reducing the <b>neurotoxic</b> innate immune <b>response</b> and stimulating a healing response continue to be sought {{as a means for}} ameliorating the pathology in a spectrum of chronic degenerative disorders...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Reactive {{microglia}} {{are commonly}} seen in retinal degenerative diseases, and <b>neurotoxic</b> microglia <b>responses</b> {{can contribute to}} photoreceptor cell death. We and others have previously shown that translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) is highly induced in retinal degenerations and that the selective TSPO ligand XBD 173 (AC- 5216, emapunil) exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects on microglia in vitro and ex vivo. Here, we investigated whether targeting TSPO with XBD 173 has immuno-modulatory and neuroprotective functions in two mouse models of acute retinal degeneration using bright white light exposure. METHODS BALB/cJ and Cx 3 cr 1 (GFP/+) mice received intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg XBD 173 or vehicle for five consecutive days, starting 1 day prior to exposure to either 15, 000 lux white light for 1 h or 50, 000 lux focal light for 10 min, respectively. The effects of XBD 173 treatment on microglia and Müller cell reactivity were analyzed by immuno-stainings of retinal sections and flat mounts, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and mRNA expression of microglia markers using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Optical coherence tomography (OCT), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) stainings, and morphometric analyses were used to quantify the extent of retinal degeneration and photoreceptor apoptosis. RESULTS Four days after the mice were challenged with bright white light, {{a large number of}} amoeboid-shaped alerted microglia appeared in the degenerating outer retina, which was nearly completely prevented by treatment with XBD 173. This treatment also down-regulated the expression of TSPO protein in microglia but did not change the TSPO levels in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RT-PCR analysis showed that the microglia/macrophage markers Cd 68 and activated microglia/macrophage whey acidic protein (Amwap) as well as the pro-inflammatory genes Ccl 2 and Il 6 were reduced after XBD 173 treatment. Light-induced degeneration of the outer retina was nearly fully blocked by XBD 173 treatment. We further confirmed these findings in an independent mouse model of focal light damage. Retinas of animals receiving XBD 173 therapy displayed significantly more ramified non-reactive microglia and more viable arrestin-positive cone photoreceptors than vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS Targeting TSPO with XBD 173 effectively counter-regulates microgliosis and ameliorates light-induced retinal damage, highlighting a new pharmacological concept for the treatment of retinal degenerations...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by extracellular deposits of amyloid beta peptide in the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid beta peptide injures neurons both directly and indirectly by triggering <b>neurotoxic</b> innate immune <b>responses.</b> Myeloid differentiation factor 88 is the key signalling molecule downstream to most innate immune receptors crucial in inflammatory activation. For this reason, we investigated the effects of myeloid differentiation factor 88 -deficient bone marrow cells on Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms and pathology by establishing bone marrow chimeric amyloid beta peptide precursor transgenic mice, in which bone marrow cells differentiate into microglia and are recruited to amyloid beta peptide deposits. We observed that myeloid differentiation factor 88 -deficient bone marrow reconstruction reduced both inflammatory activation and amyloid beta peptide burden in the brain. In addition, synaptophysin, a marker of neuronal integrity, was preserved and the expression of neuronal plasticity-related genes, ARC and NMDA-R 1, was increased. Thus, myeloid differentiation factor 88 -deficient microglia significantly improved the cognitive function of amyloid beta peptide precursor protein transgenic mice. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 -deficiency enhanced amyloid beta peptide phagocytosis by microglia/macrophages and blunted toxic inflammatory activation. Both the expression of amyloid beta peptide precursor protein and amyloid beta peptide degrading enzymes and also the efflux of amyloid beta peptide from brain parenchyma were unaffected by myeloid differentiation factor 88 -deficient microglia. By contrast, the activity of beta-secretase was increased. beta-Secretase is expressed primarily in neurons, with relatively little expression in astrocytes and microglia. Therefore, microglial replenishment with myeloid differentiation factor 88 -deficient bone marrow cells might improve cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease mouse models by enhancing amyloid beta peptide phagocytosis and reducing inflammatory activation. These results could offer a new therapeutic option that might delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
