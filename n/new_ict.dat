This thesis looks at what <b>new</b> features <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> have given to these specific communities sociologically as well as technologically.

Methodology of this thesis includes an analysis of the in-depth interviews done with the project co-ordinators, and relevant literature. As main results I would mention the willingness of the people living in these communities, to include <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> as a way of communication. Some community spirit was improved by the discussions and local news articles seen in the ICTs. But the main result, in my opinion is that there is still a long way to go in order to make <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> available to all (lack of education and guidance exists), and the fact that community spirit can be only reinforced by ICTs. Face-to-face communication is still a necessity in local community communication...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in telecommunications technologies have initiated debates {{on the changing}} balance between centralizing and decentralizing forces driving economic activities. The literature reveals that new information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs) have been driving new economic activities {{into a number of}} cities and regions with well-developed information infrastructures while within these cities and regions new industries tend to disperse {{as a result of the}} safe and sufficient communications across distance enabled by <b>new</b> <b>ICTs.</b> This finding suggests that the application of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> is a strong decentralizing force in a firm’s location at the local scale. It is against such a background that this paper examines the Xingwang Industrial Park located in the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area (BDA) as a case study to focus on the dynamics of local industrial clusters enabled by <b>new</b> <b>ICTs.</b> The authors argue that <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> are an enabling or facilitating agent rather than a deterministic force. The application of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> tends to lead to a “virtual clustering ” of firms as this is an essential step of integration of supply chains while whether or not suppliers choose to locate in proximity to each other and to assemblers depends on a number of other factors. [Key words: new information and communication technologies, local industrial cluster, telecommunications industry, Xingwang Industrial Park. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} that new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been {{changing the way}} by which firms conduct their businesses. Examples are the application of enterprise resources planning (ERP) and business process reengineering (BPR) {{to increase the efficiency}} of internal resources management, adoption of Business-to-Business e-commerce (B 2 B e-com) to integrate supply chain, and invention of new marketing channels such as Business-to-Customer (B 2 C) e-com. These new ways of conducting businesses are believed to help firms to reduce transaction costs and increase productivity. As a result, <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> have {{played an important role in}} recent growth of many small firms into multi-functional and multi-product corporations and in their spatial expansion towards internationalization as well. This paper takes Haier in China as a case to study the role of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> in the growth of firms and reveal how the new technologies have facilitated the expansion of Haier into a transnational corporation (TNC) by examining the internationalization process of the firm in relation to its adoption of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> in the period from 1990 to 2002. The study reveals that the adoption of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> has helped Haier to integrate its functional units located in dozens of places across the world, which is essential to the internationalization of a firm, and to link closely together its worldwide suppliers and customers to achieve just-in-time (JIT) production and delivery. As such, the authors of the paper argue that, without the facilitation of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs,</b> Haier could not have developed into a TN...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{application}} {{of information and}} communication technologies (ICTs) has been argued to be critical to spatial transformation of firms. Recent advances in the studies along this line have challenged traditional location theory. The existing literature, however, focuses mainly on the impacts of ICTs on locational conditions and industrial spatial distribution. The dynamics behind such changes have not yet been given sufficient attention by geographers. Given this background, this paper investigates the impact of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> on traditional location theory and the dynamics of industrial re-location that are enabled by <b>new</b> <b>ICTs,</b> based on data collected from an investigation of 178 firms. The paper argues that the {{application of}} <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> has been a key location factor in the information age, and that the time-cost is becoming critical to the spatial organization of firms, particularly {{as a result of a}} shorter product life and mass customization, among other dynamics...|$|R
40|$|<b>New</b> <b>ICTs,</b> such as {{mobile phones}} and social media, are {{increasingly}} being seen as catalysers for political engagement, the spark of revolutions, or breaking power relations between political elites and the ‘information poor’. They have been centralised in the explanation of the Arab Spring and the wave of popular uprisings that occurred from 2010 onwards. It {{is safe to say}} that <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> indeed play a role in how information is spread and how people are mobilised for protest. However, the need for a reflection on why these <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> have a part in the outcome of uprisings within its respective context was often lacking. Moreover, it has often been left undiscussed what happens after a revolution or popular uprising. Is there actual social or political change, or does it often lead to an illusion or deception? <b>New</b> <b>ICTs</b> can prove to be extremely useful in mobilisation, the creation and spread of information and awakening a sense of political agency. Nevertheless, a country’s history, and its social, political and economic context might prove to be just as important when understanding the complexities of popular uprisings and their aftermath. This thesis discusses the case of Burkina Faso, where in the period of one year, the population rose up twice to demand change, justice and accountability. In October 2014, the Burkinabè massively hit the streets and within a ‘ten day revolution’ they ousted Blaise Compaoré who had been in power for 27 years. In September 2015, the Burkinabè again hit the streets to condemn a coup d’état that was executed by the former right-hand of Blaise Compaoré. Both uprisings were successful, meaning that those protesting achieved their short-term goals of ousting Blaise Compaoré and stopping a coup d’état. However, the question remains if they ensured change on the long-term and why <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> played a role in these successes. This thesis draws upon six months of extensive fieldwork in Burkina Faso and months of employing digital ethnographies, to understand if, why and how <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> played a role in the growth, outcome and aftermath of the Burkinabè uprisings. It argues that <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> played a major role in both uprisings because it brought together a collective of like-minded people and it ensured rapid mobilisation. However, we should be careful in putting them at the forefront of the explanation of political unrest and uprisings, because the socio-political context, historical background, existing political tensions and social structures may affect its effects.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> in education is usually discussed {{in terms of}} the many benefits new technologies offer, or of the negative impact they might have on the lives of their users. Focusing on the {{introduction of}} the 3 D online world "Second Life" into higher education, this article shows how such discourses lead to an impasse between the advocates and the critics of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> in education. To break the impasse, and to understand the impact of Second Life, or other ICTs, on education, requires a far more differentiated approach than the discourses around Second Life have shown so far. Based on the experiences of the author in creating a virtual campus for the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Second Life, the article advocates a shift in focus from the discussion of powerful ICTs and their impact on largely passive users, to the study of active individuals, {{and the ways in which}} they integrate <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> into their pre-existing social and technological practices.

However, while many claims are made for the poverty reduction potential of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs,</b> very little research has been done on how access affects firm strategies, and innovation and consequently may contribute to broader economic transformation; vital to sustainable poverty reduction. This paper contextualises the adoption of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> and then examines evidence of the uses and impacts of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> in the wood products industry in Durban, South Africa and its surrounding region.

40|$|It is {{frequently}} asserted {{in the literature}} that new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are {{on the point of}} a breakthrough into rapid growth. Although we cannot say whether this breakthrough will indeed take place and ― should it do so ― on what scale, in this paper we nevertheless anticipate the potential impact of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> on the spatial configuration of opportunities: that is to say, on accessibility. For this purpose we distinguish between a spatiotemporal and a perceptual dimension of accessibility. On the basis of both of these perspectives, we reveal how <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> may impact on three components of accessibility: the reference location from which access to destinations is determined; the set and attractiveness of opportunities; travel impedance. The study has been undertaken within an action space framework. The concept of action space refers to the area within which people undertake activities, or could do so if they wished. In the concluding section, 8 hypotheses formulated for future research are set out. We conclude that the use of <b>new</b> <b>ICTs</b> may cause a time-space convergence, a revaluation of travel time, activities and acts, and thereby a revaluation of travel opportunities and an awareness of unprecedented opportunities. The ultimate anticipated result is that all types of action space will expand, the various types of action space will overlap, and that known and visited activity places will become more widely spread within action space...|$|R
