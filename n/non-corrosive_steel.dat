The methods of optical metallography, X-ray struc-ture analysis, transmission electronic micros-copy are used. The parameters of electron beam providing {{formation of a}} uniform smooth frit-ted surface coating are defined.

The bimetallic bars are more often applied in concrete construction. Design/methodology/approach: The simulations of the bar rolling were carried out using the Forge 2007 ® commercial program.

50|$|The coolant also {{contains}} 1 mol% zirconium metal (which dissolves forming 2 mol% ZrF2). This reduces its redox potential {{to a level}} making it virtually <b>non-corrosive</b> to standard <b>steels.</b> The reactor tank, support structures and heat exchangers can therefore be constructed from standard 316L stainless steel.|$|R

All components are connected by steel pipes (Herfurth and Orywall 2015). The pipes, the autoclave, and the reservoir tanks {{are made from}} <b>non-corrosive</b> austenitic <b>steel</b> (DIN EN 10088 - 3 2014) 1.4571 with the following composition of the main elements: Fe 66.7 wt %, Cr 16.7 wt %, and Ni 10.72 wt %. The steel can be used up to temperatures of 550  °C.|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber {{composite}} cable (CFCC) reinforcement has been broadly {{accepted as a}} non-corrosive alternative to the conventional steel reinforcement in bridge construction. Although the flexural behavior of beams prestressed with CFCC strands has been thoroughly examined, their shear behavior when steel stirrups are replaced with CFCC stirrups remains uncertain. This study outlines an extensive research program conducted to evaluate the shear behavior of prestressed decked bulb T beams with CFCC stirrups. The investigation addresses {{the effect of the}} shear-span-to-depth (a/d) ratio and the type of transverse reinforcement on the shear carrying capacity. Four 9. 45 -m-long beams reinforced and prestressed with CFCC reinforcement were constructed and tested under shear loading to failure. Half of the span of each test beam was reinforced with CFCC stirrups and the other half was reinforced with steel stirrups. To assess the performance of CFCC stirrups versus that of steel stirrups, both ends of each beam were tested under identical shear load. The obtained experimental results were compared with developed finite element (FE) models to validate the results. Beam ends with CFCC stirrups failed due to either concrete web crushing or top concrete compression failure, while beam ends with steel stirrups failed in shear tension mode due to yielding of stirrups. The developed FE models predicted the shear behavior and capacity of the test beams with a difference of less than 10 %. This investigation demonstrates that CFCC stirrups can be regarded as a <b>non-corrosive</b> alternative to <b>steel</b> stirrups in highway bridge girders...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{experimental}} results on boiling from a horizontal platinum wire, 0. 1 mm in diameter, submerged in saturated liquids as carbon dioxide (CO,) and Freon 13 (CF,Cl) {{in the critical}} region. Three discrete regimes without steady transition could be observed: natural convection, nucleate boiling, and film boiling. Near the critical point particuler flow patterns appeared in the rising vapour in film boiling: regular bubbles, vapour columns, and vapour hazes with garland-like boundaries. These flow patterns could be simulated in model experiments with liquids and were also photographed with a high-speed camera. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE A PLATINUM WIRE of 0. 1 mm in diameter was arranged horizontally in a pressure vessel made of <b>non-corrosive</b> <b>steel.</b> This cuvette had an inside height of 60 mm, an inside length of 150 mm, and an inside depth of 20 mm; two opposite long sides were provided with glass windows. Carbon dioxide (CO,) (critical values p, = 73. 8 bar, 8, = 31. 1 "C) and Freon 13 (CF,Cl) (Pc = 38. 6 bar, OC = 28 - 8 "C), were used as test fluids and the test regio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Bimetallic bars which possess higher {{corrosion}} resistance and mechanical properties, {{it is the}} newkind of bimetallic bars which are better than standard bars. The bimetallic bars are more often applied in concreteconstruction. There are few methods which ensure a good strength of bimetallic layer bond. Hydrostatic extrusion,rotary rolling and explosive cladding are most often used methods. Design/methodology/approach: The simulations of the bar rolling in a three-high skew mill were carriedout using the Forge 2005 ® commercial program. Findings: The higher value of yield stress of the cladding layer does not produce the effect of “flowing down” ofthis layer over the core surface and it’s folding between the rolls. The use of <b>non-corrosive</b> <b>steel</b> on plating layerassures receipt on a high durability and esthetics bimetallic bars. Practical implications: Bimetallic bars are chiefly used in the building industry at production of concreteconstructions, and as working elements in bridge building in aggressive environment. Originality/value: Production of bimetallic bars is very difficult. One from many problems during productionbimetallic bars is assurance good strength of bimetallic layer bond. A theoretical analysis of bimetallic bar rollingin a three-high skew mill {{is presented in the}} paper and the distributions of stress and strain intensities in thebimetallic bar during skew rolling are shown...|$|E
40|$|Sodium formate, {{potassium}} acetate and {{a mixture of}} calcium and magnesium acetate (CMA) have all been identified as effective de-icing agents. In this project an attempt {{has been made to}} elucidate potentially deleterious effects of these substances on the durability of reinforced concrete. Aspects involving the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel along with the chemical and physical degradation of the cementitious matrix were studied. Ionic diffusion characteristics of deicer/pore solution systems in hardened cement paste were also studied since rates of ingress of deleterious agents into cement paste are commonly diffusion-controlled. It was found that all the compounds tested were generally <b>non-corrosive</b> to embedded <b>steel,</b> however, in a small number of cases {{potassium acetate}} did cause corrosion. Potassium acetate was also found to cause cracking in concrete and cement paste samples. CMA appeared to degrade hydrated cement paste although this was apparently less of a problem when commercial grade CMA was used in place of the reagent grade chemical. This was thought to be due to the insoluble material present in the commercial formulation forming a physical barrier between the concrete and the de-icing solution. With the test regimes used sodium formate was not seen to have any deleterious effect on the integrity of reinforced concrete. As a means of restoring the corrosion protective character of chloride-contaminated concrete the process of electrochemical chloride removal has been previously developed. Potential side-effects of this method and the effect of external electrolyte composition on chloride removal efficiency were investigated. It was seen that the composition of the external electrolyte has a significant effect on the amount of chloride removed. It was also found that, due to alterations to the composition of the C 3 A hydration reaction products, it was possible to remove bound chloride as well as that in the pore solution. The use of an external electrolyte containing lithium ions was also tried as a means of preventing cathodically-induced alkali-silica reaction in concretes containing potentially reactive aggregates. The results obtained were inconclusive and further practical development of this approach is needed...|$|R
