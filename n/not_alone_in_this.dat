Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E

He was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> prejudice—their mutual teacher Rimsky-Korsakov was as profoundly conservative {{by the end of}} his life, wedded to the academic process he helped instill at the Conservatory. Unlike Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov was not anxious about the potential dead end Russian music might reach by following academia strictly, nor did he share Rimsky-Korsakov's grudging respect for new ideas and techniques.|$|E

Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and especially as Hutton gave no reason for it. Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E

Assyria however, {{remained}} a compact and strong nation, which continued to provide much written record. The 10th century BC is even worse for Babylonia, with very few inscriptions. Mesopotamia was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> obscurity: the Hittite Empire fell {{at the beginning of}} this period and very few records are known from Egypt and Elam.

25|$|On the 11th of March 2017 the Dutch {{government}} has made a decision which changed the relationship between both countries for worse. When the Turks decided to sent the minister of foreign affairs for the 400.000 Turks living in the Netherlands, to have them vote for the Turkish constitutional referendum, the Dutch government denied access into the Netherlands. Later that day minister of family affairs Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya traveled by road to the Netherlands but was escorted {{out of the country}} on orders of the Dutch government. This led to problems in Rotterdam where Dutch police used dogs and water cannon on Sunday to disperse demonstrators. The Dutch are <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> decision, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland all have denied the Turkish government to rally in their countries for the referendum.|$|E
25|$|Aware {{that there}} was a war in Sudan, Churchill {{determined}} to be part of it. He was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> because in a time generally of peace, many British Army officers wanted experience of battle to further their careers. In Churchill's case, he did not see his career as lying with the army, but had already started writing about wars and wanted a new campaign to write about. He first attempted to obtain a transfer from his regiment stationed in India to the 21st Lancers, which was the unit taking part in the war. This was granted by the War Office, but rejected by the commander of the British force in Sudan, General Kitchener. Churchill next took leave to Britain, where he enlisted friends and family to lobby Kitchener to permit him to take part. This continued to be unsuccessful, even when the prime minister Lord Salisbury made an inquiry on his behalf. Eventually, however, he prevailed upon Sir Evelyn Wood, Adjutant General of the Horse Guards, who had authority over appointments to the regiment in England, and he received an attachment to the Lancers in place of an officer who had died, on 24 July 1898. On 5 August he was in Luxor and on 24 August the regiment set out from Atbara to attack the Mahdist forces.|$|E

500|$|A month later, {{things had}} changed. The enemy were engaged by the UN forces at the Battle of Unsan in late October, which {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of}} Chinese soldiers in Korea and rendered significant losses to the American and other UN troops. Nevertheless, Willoughby downplayed the evidence about Chinese intervention in the war. He estimated that up to 71,000 Chinese soldiers were in the country, while the true number was closer to 300,000. He was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> miscalculation.

500|$|The 1927 New York Yankees team is {{considered}} one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderer's Row because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2–2 tie. [...] "Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted [...]356, drove in 164 runs and slugged [...]772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field. According to Appel, [...] "The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{influence}} with the British government was, however, limited. Lord Salisbury, the Prime Minister, despised jingoism and jingoists.

Salisbury was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> concern over the treatment of black South Africans; Roger Casement, already {{well on the way to}} becoming an Irish Nationalist, was nevertheless happy to gather intelligence for the British against the Boers because of their treatment of black Africans.|$|E

He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous.

2500|$|Henry worked {{together}} with James Madison, a delegate {{after three years}} in Congress, on a [...] number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia's Protestant churches. [...] Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation {{between church and state}} that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that taxpayers who were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, [...] "the general assessment plan {{is one of the main}} reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history." [...] The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons—his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County—but the cost was Henry's bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.|$|E
