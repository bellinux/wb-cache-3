40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the connection between <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation rates and their theoretically substantiated regional determinants, using regression modelling. The dynamics of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation is evaluated comparing the influence of regional determinants in two time periods - 2001 - 2002 and 2011 - 2012. The Czech Republic is the area of interest. Empirical results indicate the coexistence of persistent and changing influences of regional determinants on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. The quality of the entrepreneurial environment, industrial diversity and population change have a persistent and positive impact on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. There is also a positive connection between agglomeration economies and <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. The increasing influence of agglomeration economies is indicated. The presence of foreigners is not a statistically significant determinant of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation in the 2001 - 2002 models. Nevertheless, the importance of this determinant is increasing. It is suggested that unemployment vulnerability has a negative impact on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation but has increasing importance on entrepreneurship in disadvantaged regions. Finally, spatial interactions are an inevitable part when considering the determinants of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation...|$|R

The increase in <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> can be attributed to low taxes, reasonably priced real estate and cooperation between the city and entrepreneurs.

The framework of this study, model to the <b>new</b> <b>business</b> development, is created at the literature re-view part of this study and it is tested for incumbent pharmaceutical companies in Finland. Model enables to study differences between traditional and <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> in incumbent firms, innovation process for <b>new</b> <b>business</b> develop-ment and business ecosystem structure of incumbent firm. The goal of the re-search is to identify ways of incumbent firms to develop <b>new</b> <b>business</b> {{to be able to}} compete against more agile companies. Technological development has enabled new players to enter to market. The results reveal that to be able to re-spond to the needs of fast changing markets would incumbent firms benefit if they separate innovation development of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> from traditional busi-ness, structured innovation process in their <b>new</b> <b>business</b> development and of resources from outside the organisation. In addition this study suggests that firms are trying to benefit from co-operation with the parties outside the organ-isation in short or long term.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{research has found}} that the effect of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation on employment emerges over a period of about ten years and has identified a 'wave' pattern of these effects. In this study, we decompose the overall contribution of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation on employment change into direct and indirect effects. The results indicate that indirect effects of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation are quantitatively much more important than the direct effects. Furthermore, we find that regional differences of the employment change generated by <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation can to a large part be explained by respective differences of the indirect effects. Hence, the interaction of the start-ups with their regional environment plays a great role for explaining their impact on regional development.

40|$|Complexity science perspective, {{covering}} {{many different}} disciplines, mainly describes the dynamic properties of a non-linear system. Due to the fast-changing environment and increasing emphasis on process research orientation, social sciences {{are trying to}} apply complexity science perspective in related studies. Based on this direction, <b>new</b> <b>business</b> development can be explored from complexity science perspective, because it is basically a social process with considerable complexity and dynamics. Therefore, this paper, from complexity science perspective, adopts process-oriented and longitudinal research method to analyze a successful business development case – VISA. Under the leadership of Dee Hock from 1968 to 1980, VISA had been developed as the leading brand of a worldwide value exchange system, connecting a number of banks, stores and consumers. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to interpret and analyze the process regarding to the participation and interaction of business agents and the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>business,</b> and to gain insights on management practices through the application of complexity science perspective.
