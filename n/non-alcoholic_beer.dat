5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic drink that is mixed with water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beer</b> for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
25|$|Some {{soft drinks}} contain {{measurable}} amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural fermentation {{used to build}} the carbonation. In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other beverages such as <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beer)</b> are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon dioxide for carbonation, {{but there is some}} speculation that alcohol might result from fermentation of sugars in a non-sterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.|$|E
500|$|Zayat {{returned}} to Egypt in 1995 and formed an investment group, which purchased the Al-Ahram Beverages Company in 1997, outbidding Anheuser-Busch and Heineken International. Al-Ahram had been {{owned by the}} Egyptian government and Zayat had helped find American investors to take over government-owned businesses that had been nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser back in the 1950s. The original beer product was of poor quality, mocked as being able to [...] "power heavy machinery {{if there was no}} diesel fuel available." [...] Under Zayat's leadership, additional brands of beer were introduced, and he developed a <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>beer,</b> Fayrouz, designed specifically for the Muslim market. The company was modernized from a run-down operation to a publicly traded business that sold in 2002 to Heineken International for $280 million, more than three times its pre-acquisition valuation, in what was then the largest corporate buyout in Egyptian history.|$|E

Research results prove that logistic regression analysis is a suitable method for determining why consumers opt for specifi c beverages in specifi c consumption situations. To analyse targeted marketing, the application of heuristic methods, and decision trees provide a high degree of accuracy.
