40|$|Objective: The {{widespread}} use of antibiotics in humans and animals has contributed to growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Previously treatable bacterial infections now require {{the last line of}} antibiotics or are untreatable. The current antibiotic of last resort for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is often colistin. Evidence for the shifting pattern of colistin resistance and how the international community should respond are discussed in this review. Methods: The literature on colistin resistance was reviewed. Results: Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by mcr- 1 was first documented in China during the routine surveillance of food animals. This has been followed by similar reports across a wide geographic area, in humans, animals, and the environment. The mcr- 1 gene has been reported among human isolates in 29 countries, related to environmental samples in four countries, and in food animals and other animals in 28 countries. More recently, a second gene encoding resistance, mcr- 2, has been isolated from porcine and bovine Escherichia coli.

In particular, the need amongst regulatory and financial authorities [...] both in the health sector and in local government [...] to know about the potential impact of intervention has encouraged further interest in the use of quality of life measures to assist resource allocation and assessing the impact of policy decisions. In this paper it is argued that whilst such measures may be the ultimate goal of research, this can only be constructed on a fuller understanding of quality of life measures of current conditions and the relationship between components of life quality.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Branding {{refers to}} a process whereby third degree burns are inflicted on the skin with a hot iron rod or {{metallic}} object. Branding employs the phenomenon of "counter irritation," and is widely used by faith healers in developing countries for therapeutic purposes. Some methods, which are very crude and inhuman, carry a large risk of complications. The {{purpose of this study}} is to present a series of complications and to familiarize clinicians with this dangerous method of treatment. Case presentation Four Pakistani patients, three male and one female, ranging from 25 to 60 years of age "branded" with a red hot iron rod for various medical reasons presented with severe medical complications to our tertiary care hospital. The mean duration between the procedure and presentation to the hospital was 6 days. At the time of admission, two patients had septic shock, one patient had cavernous sinus thrombosis and one patient had multiple splenic abscesses. All patients received standard care for wound management and systemic infections. Two patients eventually died during the course of treatment. Conclusion Severe complications from branding are troublesome and the potential risks of this treatment outweigh its benefits. Globally, there is a great <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> awareness about the dangers of branding among patients and physicians, as this will have an important effect on patients who seek branding for various medical conditions. </p...|$|R

Using an emancipatory approach, within a qualitative framework, semi-structured and increasingly open {{interviews were conducted with}} 54 Asian girls, 14 non-Asian girls and 16 members of college staff. Asian young women were found to be dealing with complex and multiple issues as they faced competing tensions between the 2 values and beliefs of their families and communities and the Westernised objectives of the college system. Asian young women were found to seek support from each other rather than reveal emotional difficulties to staff, who themselves were endeavouring to cope in the competitive market culture of the FE environment. The research hypothesis, that the emotional needs of Asian girls are all but invisible to college staff, was proved to be correct in this context. Although a small minority of Asian young women were visibly experiencing extreme anxiety and difficulties in coping, the majority of Asian girls appeared to be achieving a positive sense of self, thus challenging the stereotypical notion of 'Asian girl as victim'. The girls' responses indicated that this may be an opportune time to present an alternative descriptive lexicon, that takes into account the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> awareness of adolescent development in globalised, pluralistic and multi-ethnic societies...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Heavy chain {{diseases}} (HCD) are neoplastic proliferations of B cells which secrete truncated immunoglobulin heavy chains without {{associated light}} chains. Being rare and probably underdiagnosed diseases {{the aim of}} this report is to show an additional case of gamma heavy chain disease in a 48 year old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis focusing on the laboratory presentation. Materials and methods: Laboratory work-up included agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), immunofixation and nephelometrically determined immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin subclasses of the patient’s serum. Urine samples were also subjected to immunofixation and to a SDS-PAGE with consecutive immunoblot. Results: Nephelometrically measured elevated IgG concentrations were noted in combination with a decreased gamma globulin region and an increased beta globulin region on AGE. A definite monoclonal spike was not identified on AGE but at least suspected on CZE; finally serum and urine immunofixation demonstrated a monoclonal gamma heavy chain devoid of any corresponding light chains confirming the diagnosis of HCD. Analysis of the gamma heavy chain (HC) with means of SDS-PAGE revealed proteins of 40 kD and 80 kD most likely presenting a truncated HC in its monomeric and dimeric form and possibly leading to the failure of IgG-subclass typing with the applied IgG subclass antisera. Conclusion: This case report illustrates a new case of gamma HCD demonstrating variable laboratory manifestations and therefore the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> awareness concerning this disease when confronted with abnormal and discrepant protein profiles in routinely applied laboratory tests...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{reports have}} shown an {{expansion}} of Lassa virus from the area where it was first isolated in Nigeria {{to other areas of}} West Africa. Two Ghanaian soldiers on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia were taken ill with viral haemorrhagic fever syndrome following the death of a sick colleague and were referred to a military hospital in Accra, Ghana, in May 2013. Blood samples from the soldiers and five asymptomatic close contacts were subjected to laboratory investigations. Objective: We report the results of these investigations to highlight the importance of molecular diagnostic applications and the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> awareness about Lassa fever in West Africa. Methods: We used molecular assays on sera from the two patients to identify the causativeorganism. Upon detection of positive signals for Lassa virus ribonucleic material by two differentpolymerase chain reaction assays, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Results: The presence of Lassa virus in the soldiers’ blood samples was shown by L-gene segment homology to be the Macenta and las 803792 strains previously isolated in Liberia, with close relationships then confirmed by phylogenetic tree construction. The five asymptomatic close contacts were negative for Lassa virus. Conclusions: The Lassa virus strains identified in the two Ghanaian soldiers had molecular epidemiological links to strains from Liberia.
