[...] "I supported an administration whose intentions I didn't trust," [...] he averred, [...] "believing that the consequences would repay the gamble. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that intentions do shape consequences." [...] He eventually recanted his support for the war entirely. In a 2007 New York Times Magazine article, he wrote: [...] "The unfolding catastrophe in Iraq has condemned the political judgment of a president, but it has also condemned the judgment of many others, myself included, who as commentators supported the invasion." [...] Ignatieff partly interpreted what he now saw as his particular errors of judgment, by presenting them as typical of academics and intellectuals in general, whom he characterised as [...] "generalizing and interpreting particular facts as instances of some big idea". In politics, by contrast, [...] "Specifics matter more than generalities". Samuel Moyn, Harvard University historian of human rights and humanitarian intervention, asserts that Ignatieff is among those whose who [...] "soiled their reputations" [...] through their defence of the Iraq war, and labelled his later public apology [...] "embarrassingly vacuous." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{to such a}} {{powerful}} embodiment of the local patriotism that our driver had brought us from another civic palace overlooking the Plaza de la Constitution, chiefly notable now for having been the old theater of the bull-fights. The windows in the houses round still bear the numbers by which they were sold to spectators as boxes; but now the municipality has built a beautiful brand-new bull-ring in San Sebastian; and I do not know just why we were required to inspect {{the interior of the}} edifice overlooking this square. I only know that at sight of our bewilderment a workman doing something to the staircase clapped his hands orientally, and the custodian was quickly upon us in response to a form of summons which we were to find so often used in Spain. He was not so crushingly upon us as that other custodian; he was apologetically proud, rather than boastfully; at times he waved his hands in deprecation, and would have made us observe that the place was little, very little; he deplored it like a host who wishes his possessions praised. Among the artistic treasures of the place from which he did not excuse us there were some pen-drawings, such as writing-masters execute without lifting the pen from the paper, by a native of South America, probably of Basque descent, since the Basques have done so much to people that continent. We not only admired these, but we would not consent to any of the custodian's deprecations, especially when it came to question of the pretty salon in which Queen Victoria was received on her first visit to San Sebastian. We supposed then, and in fact I had supposed till this moment, that it was Queen Victoria of Great Britain who was meant; but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that {{it must have been the}} queen consort of Spain, who seems already to have made herself so liked there.|$|E

5000|$|The Buddhist traditions {{themselves}} have always held that Asaṅga received the texts in question from Maitreya {{directly in the}} Tuṣita heaven. Asaṅga {{is said to have}} spent many years in intense meditation, during which time tradition says that he often visited Tuṣita to receive teachings from the Maitreya. Heavens such as Tuṣita are said to be accessible through meditation. Xuanzang tells the account of these events: In the great mango grove five or six li to the southwest of the city (Ayodhyā), there is an old monastery where Asaṅga Bodhisattva received instructions and guided the common people. At night he went up to the place of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Tuṣita Heaven to learn the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, the Mahāyāna-sūtra-alaṃkāra-śāstra, the Madhyānta-vibhāga-śāstra, etc.; in the daytime, he lectured on the marvelous principles to a great audience. Confusion over the idea of [...] "supernaturally" [...] visiting heavens {{may be due to the}} unfamiliarity of scholars with the Indian concept of heavens as being accessible through samādhi. Other advanced meditators recorded similar experiences of visiting Tuṣita Heaven at night. One such example of this is Hanshan Deqing during the Ming dynasty. In his autobiography, Hanshan describes the palace of Maitreya in Tuṣita, and hearing a lecture given by Bodhisattva Maitreya to a large group of his disciples. In a moment I saw that tall, dignified monks were standing in line before the throne. Suddenly, a bhikṣu, holding a sutra in his hands, came down from behind the throne and handed the sutra to me, saying, [...] "Master is going to talk about this sutra. He asked me to give it to you." [...] I received it with joy but when I opened it I saw that it was written in gold Sanskrit letters which I could not read. I put it inside my robe and asked, [...] "Who is the Master?" [...] The bhiksu replied, [...] "Maitreya." [...] Hanshan Deqing recalls the teaching given as the following: Maitreya said, [...] "Discrimination is consciousness. Nondiscrimination is wisdom. Clinging to consciousness will bring disgrace but clinging to wisdom will bring purity. Disgrace leads to birth and death but purity leads to Nirvana." [...] I listened to him as if I were in a dream within the dream. His voice, like the sound of tinkling crystal, floated on the air. I could hear him so clearly that even when I awoke his words kept on repeating in my mind. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> the difference between consciousness and wisdom. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> also that the place where I had been in my dream was Maitreya Buddha's Chamber in Tushita Heaven.|$|R
