Gardens also contribute to climate change. Greenhouse gases can be produced by gardeners in many ways. The three main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

Gardeners produce methane by compacting the soil and making it anaerobic, and by allowing their compost heaps to become compacted and anaerobic.

In the five case studies, the GHG emissions of sunflower cultivation exceed the default value (18 g [CO 2 eq] MJ - 1) indicated by the RED.

40|$|Understanding {{water and}} {{nitrogen}} redistribution {{in the soil}} profile is important to improve water and nitrogen use efficiency for sustainable agriculture. This thesis evaluates the interactions between water and fertiliser management factors affecting water and nitrogen use efficiency, based on field experiments on a semi-arid loamy sandy soil. The impact on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and other crop properties was also assessed. Cropping periods in two hot-wet seasons and two cold-dry seasons were compared. The treatments involved two irrigation methods (furrow and drip), two irrigation levels (full and reduced) and two top dressing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> types (quick-release and slow-release). Overall, there were trends for better nitrogen uptake, water and nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield in the cold-dry than in the hot-wet season, especially under reduced irrigation. Furrow irrigation with reduced irrigation level tended to give higher grain and dry matter nitrogen use efficiency in both hot-wet and cold-dry cropping periods. Soil moisture distribution, water flow direction and deep percolation were primarily affected by irrigation method and irrigation level in the cold-dry season and by a combined effect of irrigation level and rainfall events in the hot-wet season. In both seasons, full irrigation level with quick-release <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was found to induce more net downward redistribution of water and nitrogen in the soil profile, irrespective of irrigation method. Reduced irrigation, particularly in the hot-wet season, resulted in less deep percolation. In the cold-dry cropping period, reduced irrigation combined with slow-release <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> resulted in longer nitrogen residence time at 30 and 60 cm depth, irrespective of irrigation method. Drip irrigation resulted in a moister soil profile overall in both seasons, and thus allowed better growth and elongation of coarse and fine roots, which were denser in the uppermost 56 cm of soil and reached a maximum depth of 80 cm. These results indicate that reduced irrigation {{should be considered as}} a potential irrigation management option for semi-arid loamy sandy soil in both hot-wet and cold-dry seasons.

40|$|These {{rootstock}} and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> studies {{confirmed that}} rootstock race can significantly affect {{the development of}} postharvest disease and mineral nutrient accumulation in Hass avocado fruit. When Hass (Guatemalan race) was grafted to seedling Velvick (West Indian race) rootstock, the severity and incidence of anthracnose in fruit were significantly reduced by up to 64 and 37 %, respectively, compared with seedling Duke 6 (Mexican race) rootstock. Stem-end rot was also influenced by rootstock in some seasons, and significant reductions (up to 87 %) in the severity and incidence of stem-end rot were recorded in Hass fruit from Velvick compared with Duke 6 rootstock trees. These improvements in postharvest diseases were associated with significantly lower concentrations of nitrogen and potassium, higher concentrations of calcium and magnesium, lower ratios of nitrogen: calcium and higher ratios of calcium+magnesium: potassium in Hass leaves and fruit from Velvick compared with Duke 6 rootstock trees. Altering the rate of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> had minimal impact on postharvest disease development. However, in one season, reducing the rate of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to nil significantly reduced the concentration of nitrogen in the fruit skin, decreased the nitrogen: calcium ratio and significantly reduced the severity and incidence of anthracnose in Hass fruit from both Velvick and Duke 6 rootstock trees. The form of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (ammonium compared with nitrate) applied to the trees did not significantly affect the postharvest disease susceptibility of Hass avocado fruit on either Velvick or Duke 6 rootstock. The Guatemalan race rootstocks, Anderson 8 and Anderson 10, were also found to be superior to the Mexican race rootstock, Parida 1, for reducing anthracnose severity. This again, {{was associated with a}} better balance of mineral nutrients (significantly lower nitrogen: calcium and higher calcium+magnesium: potassium ratios) in the fruit. This rootstock effect, however, was only observed in the first season of a 3 -year experiment, possibly because of a better balance between vegetative growth and fruit production in Parida 1 in the latter two seasons.

The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> stock for the district can be calculated by multiplying the total planting areas with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> rate per hectare. The aims were to evaluate the nitrogen balance of terraced paddy field systems under conventional farmer practices and improved technologies during the wet season 2003 - 04 and dry season 2004 and to predict how much <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertiliser</b> should be provided in every planting season for wetland cultivation in the Semarang district. The nitrogen input-output assessments were carried out in terraced paddy fields for the conventional farmer practices (CFP), conventional farmer practices + rice straw (CFP+RS), improved technology (IT), and improved technology + rice straw (IT+RS) treatments. Balances were computed based on the differences between input and output. Nitrogen originating from fertiliser (IN- 1), recycled rice straw (IN- 2), irrigation (IN- 3), and precipitation (IN- 4) were grouped as input. Nitrogen removal by rice grains (OUT- 1) and rice straw (OUT- 2) was considered as output. The input-output analyses showed negative nitrogen balances for all the treatments, both in the wet season 2003 - 04 and the dry season 2004. The more nitrogen deficit was observed when the nitrogen volatilisation was considered. The nutrient inputs, particularly coming from inorganic fertilisers, were not sufficient to replace the nitrogen removed by rice grains and straw. The application of only 50 kg of urea/ha/season with and without returning rice straw {{was not enough to}} reach the optimal yield and should be left out.

40|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the anthropogenic emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. In this paper, a review is presented of the agriculture related sources of methane and nitrous oxide, and of the main strategies for mitigation. The rumen {{is the most important}} source of methane production, especially in cattle husbandry. Less, but still substantial, amounts of methane are produced from cattle manures. In pig and poultry husbandry, most methane originates from manures. The main sources of nitrous oxide are: <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> land applied animal manure, and urine deposited by grazing animals. Most effective mitigation strategies for methane comprise a source approach, i. e. changing animals¿ diets towards greater efficiencies. Methane emissions, however, can also be effectively reduced by optimal use of the gas produced from manures, e. g. for energy production. Frequent and complete manure removal from animal housing, combined with on-farm biogas production is an example of an integrated on-farm solution. Reduced <b>fertiliser</b> <b>nitrogen</b> input, optimal <b>fertiliser</b> form, adding nitrification inhibitors, land drainage management, and reduced land compaction by restricted grazing are the best ways to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from farm land, whereas, management of bedding material and solid manure reduce nitrous oxide emissions from housing and storage. Other than for methane, mitigation measures for nitrous oxide interact with other important environmental issues, like reduction of nitrate leaching and ammonia emission. Mitigation strategies for reduction of the greenhouse gases should also minimize pollution swapping...|$|R
