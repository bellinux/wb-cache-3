5|$|You'll <b>Never</b> <b>Eat</b> Lunch in This Town Again is an {{autobiography}} by Julia Phillips, detailing {{her career as}} a film producer and disclosing the power games and debauchery of New Hollywood in the 1970s and 1980s. It was first published in 1991 and became an immediate cause célèbre and bestseller. The book was reissued in 2002 after the author's death.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll <b>Never</b> <b>Eat</b> Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
25|$|Lebanese cuisine is {{influenced}} by other Mediterranean cuisines. Pita bread is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy hummus (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. Rice is nearly a staple, and pasta is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. Red meat and chicken are common but are usually eaten {{as part of a}} dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost <b>never</b> <b>eat</b> alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Halloween, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. Wine is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with , many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life. Estimates of strict lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) who <b>never</b> <b>eat</b> any meat, fish or eggs vary between 20% and 42%, {{while others are}} either less strict vegetarians or non-vegetarians. Those who eat meat seek Jhatka (quick death) method of meat production, and dislike Halal (slow bled death) method, believing that quick death method reduces suffering to the animal. The food habits vary with region, with Bengali Hindus and Hindus living in Himalayan regions, or river delta regions, regularly eating meat and fish. Some avoid meat on specific festivals or occasions. Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef. The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, and Hindu society honours the cow {{as a symbol of}} unselfish giving.|$|E
25|$|In {{both males}} and females the legs are short and sturdy, with an {{enlarged}} tarsomere on the first pair, containing the silk-producing glands. The abdomen has ten segments, with a pair of cerci on the final segment. These cerci are highly sensitive to touch, and allow the animal to navigate while moving backwards through the gallery tunnels, which are too narrow to allow the insect to turn round. Because morphology is so similar between species, it makes species identification extremely difficult. For this reason, the main form of taxonomic identification used in the past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males, (although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail). Although males <b>never</b> <b>eat</b> during their adult stage, they do have mouthparts similar to the females. These mouthparts are used to hold onto the female during copulation.|$|E
25|$|After molting, {{the female}} lays a single batch of eggs either within the {{existing}} gallery, or will find new territory {{to start a}} new colony. Here, the eggs hatch into nymphs that resemble small, wingless adults (images right and below). After a short period of parental care, the nymphs undergo hemimetabolosis (moulting into several instars before emerging as a fully grown adult after the last moult), molting a total of four times before reaching adult form. Adult males <b>never</b> <b>eat,</b> and leave the home colony almost immediately to find a female and mate. Those males that can not fly will often mate with females in nearby colonies, meaning their chosen mates are often siblings or closely related. In some species, the female will eat the male after mating, but in any event, the male will not survive for long after mating. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, meaning they are able to produce viable offspring without fertilisation of eggs. This phemonenon occurs when a female is, for whatever reason, unable to find a male to mate with, thus giving her and her species reproductive security at all times.|$|E

500|$|... "I saw Derketo's {{likeness}} in Phoenicia, {{a strange}} marvel. It is woman for half its length; {{but the other}} half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they <b>never</b> <b>eat</b> them; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove, for they believe it is holy. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the Egyptians some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before Radish {{became a}} Buddhist, he went abroad on {{business}} {{and gave his}} mother money for feeding monks and beggars.

[...] Mulian becomes a Buddhist and uses his new powers to travel to heaven. There his father informs him that his mother is suffering extremely in the Avīci Hell, the cruelest of the purgatories.

But by the time Mulian locates his mother she has been nailed down with forty-nine iron spikes. [...] He seeks Buddha's help and is given a rod to smash prison walls and release the prisoners of hell to a higher reincarnation, but his mother is not released. Mulian's mother is reborn as a hungry ghost who can <b>never</b> <b>eat</b> her fill because her neck is too thin. Mulian tries to send her food by placing it on the ancestral altar, but the food bursts into flame just as it reaches her mouth. To rescue her from this torture, the Buddha instructs Mulian and all filial sons to provide a grand feast of [...] "yülan bowls" [...] on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the time when monks emerge from their summer retreat. When his mother is reincarnated once gain, this time as a black dog, Mulian recites sutras for seven days and seven nights, and his mother is reborn as a human again. In the end she is reborn again and can attain the joys of heaven.|$|E

60|$|He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; <b>never</b> <b>eats</b> a dinner, {{properly}} speaking; {{he must be}} {{a vegetarian}} then; but no; he <b>never</b> <b>eats</b> even vegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts. Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby. Probably he preferred it should have none.|$|R
