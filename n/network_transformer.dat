40|$|Thin' power {{electronics}} {{concentrates on the}} design of minimal and cost effective power converters. Part of the research effort targets the direct processing of an AC input to an AC output without the use of an intermediate DC stage. Particular examples include the inverterless active filter and the controllable <b>network</b> <b>transformer,</b> both of which in their simplest form employ a buck switcher as the active element. Existing analysis of these circuits has dealt with a continuous approximation to the modulating function with applications to relatively high switching frequencies. This paper addresses the problem of selecting a low frequency switching pattern that achieves the correct transformation of an AC input composed of a set of arbitrary harmonics into an AC output containing a desired set of harmonics. This is achieved by constructing a model of the converter in the frequency domain so as to allow a systematic description of the interaction between linear filters and the buck converter via a set of non-linear equations that closely approximate the behaviour of the physical circuit. These equations are set {{in the form of a}} constrained optimization problem, the solution of which represents an optimal switching pattern that satisfies a set of harmonic constraints. The method is presented in a general way, facilitating direct application to other systems composed of linear filters and a buck converter. The inverterless active filter is considered as an example problem and the method is used to construct optimal switching patterns that provide harmonic correction of the current drawn by a three phase passive rectifier...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{is to develop a}} cost-effective, dynamic grid controller called the controllable <b>network</b> <b>transformer</b> (CNT) that can be implemented by augmenting existing load tap changing (LTC) transformers with an AC-AC converter. The concept is based on using a fractionally rated direct AC-AC converter to control the power through an existing passive LTC. By using a modulation strategy based on virtual quadrature sources (VQS), it is possible to control both the magnitude and the phase angle of the output voltage of the CNT without having any inter-phase connections. The CNT architecture has many advantages over existing power flow controllers, like absence of low frequency storage, fractional converter rating, retro-fitting existing assets and independent per-phase operation making it potentially attractive for utility applications. The independent control of the magnitude and the phase angle of the output voltage allow independent real and reactive power flow control through the CNT-controlled line. In a meshed network with asymmetric network stresses this functionality can be used to redirect power from critically loaded assets to other relatively under-utilized parallel paths. The power flow controllability of CNT can thus be used to lower the overall cost of generation of power. The solid state switches in the CNT with fast response capability enable incorporation of various additional critical functionalities like grid fault ride through, bypassing internal faults and dynamic damping. This bouquet of features makes the CNT useful under both steady state and transient conditions without compromising the grid reliability.

40|$|A new hybrid {{diverter}} {{design for}} an On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) is presented and experimentally validated. The design differs from existing semiconductor-assisted OLTC systems {{in that the}} part of the system containing semiconductor devices is connected in a purely shunt con guration to the main current path, resulting in a system that is electrically robust and very low loss. The new design provides zero-current, zero-voltage operation of both diverter switches at all times, eff ectively eliminating arc-induced contact wear. Contact lifetime of over twenty-five million operations is demonstrated. Contact wear rates under the new design are compared experimentally with those under alternative contact protection schemes and are shown to be dramatically reduced. A fast electromechanical switch intended for use under the new hybrid diverter is presented. The low-wear conditions created by the new diverter allows a dramatic reduction in the switch moving mass when compared to that of the standard OLTC, allowing sub-half-cycle actuation times to be achieved. A study of switch topology is made in order to guide the design process. An analysis of a magnetic actuator providing both high actuation and static contact forces is also presented. In a second strand of this thesis, a general method of formulating optimal modulation problems for thin power electronic systems incorporating a buck converter is presented. The method is employs a frequency domain representation of the buck converter where the describing equations are formed into a square matrix relating a set of input harmonics to sets of output harmonics. This allows the interaction between the buck converter and a set of linear filters to be modelled in a systematic way.

40|$|Although {{the design}} {{lifetime}} of transmission transformers was 40 years or less, operational {{experience has been}} very good with transformers up to this age, as the majority of transformers on National Grid’s UK system were installed between 1955 and 1975 {{it is important to understand}} and predict the future reliability of ageing transformers. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the failure history of the transformer fleet and its age profile in order to understand the trend and whether/how the failure rate is associated with age. Data from failures to date only show random failure modes and no correlation with transformer age. As we know that transformers are subject to ageing mechanisms it is not reasonable to base a prediction of future reliability on this historical data. A further problem arises because with the asset condition assessment techniques available, transformers are being replaced somewhat ahead of actual failure, so a method of predicting the ‘age of failure’ of the replaced transformers has had to be developed using DP analysis. For in-service transformers a calculation of life based on the physical ageing process of paper insulation using design data, loading condition and ambient temperature, under the normal IEC assumptions, has been made. This analysis shows that for a typical <b>network</b> <b>transformer,</b> the ageing rate depends more on transformer design and cooler operation temperature settings than on loading. If the cooler on temperature setting is low and the transformer thermal behaviour is as designed, then the expected lifetime would be in excess of 100 years. Despite this there have been examples of age related failures indicating that operating temperatures for at least some transformers are significantly higher than designed. Further statistical and thermal modelling is required to fully understand how the range of thermal parameters of transformers will affect the ageing rate of the transformers, their future reliability and hence the replacement plans required to maintain the future reliability of the power system...|$|E
