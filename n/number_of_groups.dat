40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for automatic recognition <b>of</b> <b>group</b> activities for video surveillance applications. We propose to use a group representative to handle the recognition with a varying <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> members, and use an asynchronous hidden Markov model (AHMM) to model the relationship between people. Furthermore, we propose a group activity detection algorithm which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric group activities, and demonstrate that this approach enables the detection of hierarchical interactions between people. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach. Index Terms—Group event detection, group representative, varying group member, video surveillance. set [3], [4]. However, most of these works are designed to recognize group activities with a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> members, where the dimension of the input feature vectors is fixed. They cannot handle the case where the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> members is varying, which often occurs in our daily life (e. g., people may leave or join a group activity). In this case, the input feature vector length varies with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> members. Although some previous works [5], [6] tried {{to deal with the}} detection <b>of</b> <b>group</b> activities with a varying <b>number</b> <b>of</b> members, most of them have assumptions under some specific scenarios which restrict their applications.

40|$|The {{legalisation}} of share repurchases in South Africa since July 1999 introduced additional complexity {{to financial}} reporting. The repurchasing of shares by subsidiaries or share trusts {{has led to}} a new concept: the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> company shares differs from the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> shares. Ratios like earnings per share and headline earnings per share are governed by accounting standards and circulars, and prescribe the use <b>of</b> the (weighted) <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> shares. No guidance exists on the calculation of market capitalisation. This article aims to determine the methods used by companies listed on the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa (JSE) to calculate their <b>number</b> <b>of</b> shares when publishing market capitalisation. It was found that only about 25 % of companies participating in share repurchases and publishing market capitalisation in their annual reports calculated market capitalisation based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> shares. About 75 % of the companies did not calculate their market capitalisation based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> shares (i. e. they omitted to deduct subsidiary repurchases and/or trust consolidations in their calculation <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> shares). It was also found that the JSE, when compiling the Top 40 index, calculates market capitalisation based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> company shares (i. e. ignoring subsidiary repurchases and trust consolidations). Accounting guidance is needed on the reporting of market capitalisation to ensure that this aspect is not overstated by the reporting entities. Articl...|$|R
