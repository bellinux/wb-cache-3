Efforts to seal the highway began in Norseman in 1960, with the Western Australian section completed in 1969 and the South Australian section finished in 1976. Further improvement works have been undertaken since the 1980s, including widening and reconstructing portions of the road.|$|E
5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{hole in the}} ground. He {{was probably}} buried {{in such a way}} as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E

500|$|While initial {{estimates}} {{placed the}} construction cost at £125,000 {{over a period}} of four months, it actually cost twice as much, and was not completed until June 1942, though the road was sufficiently trafficable and in use by January of that year.

500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular viewers will be curious to see which one Angela picks, and they’ll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian audience will watch. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should [...] "pass" [...] on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better [...] "solid game format." ...|$|E

The fort, completed June 2, was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> wooden stockade [...] high and about [...] in diameter {{surrounded by a}} ditch. It was so poorly sited (surrounded by higher hills and woods providing cover to the enemy) that Tanacharison tried to point out its defects. Washington dismissed these concerns, convinced the fort could withstand [...] "the attack of 500 Indians." [...] Over the next month, his force grew by 200 men from Virginia and an independent company of 100 British regulars that had marched up from South Carolina, while he continued to build the road toward the forks. [...] The arriving Virginians brought congratulations from Governor Dinwiddie on his success at Jumonville Glen, and word that Washington had been promoted to colonel, owing {{to the death of}} Colonel Joshua Fry in a fall from his horse.|$|E

2500|$|Beware of a Holy Whore was based, {{like many}} of Fassbinder's films, on a {{personal}} experience – the shooting of his earlier film, the revisionist western Whity (1970). The film shows an egomaniacal director, beset by a stalled production, temperamental actors, and a frustrated crew. When asked what the movie he is making is about, he replies: [...] "brutality." [...] The film ends with a typical Fassbinder-esque irony, as the crew gang up on the director. Beware of a Holy Whore {{marked the end of}} Fassbinder's avant-garde period. It presented such an embittered and radical self-critique that his future films would have to be quite different from the ones made before. After spinning out ten films in <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year (this film was shot only a few months after Whity) in a frenzied burst of creativity, his anti-film anti-theater drive seemed to conclude.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the best}} {{examples}} of this method is the Plautine slave, a form that {{plays a major role in}} quite a few of Plautus' works. The [...] "clever slave" [...] in particular is a very strong character; he not only provides exposition and humor, but also often drives the plot in Plautus' plays. C. Stace argues that Plautus took the stock slave character from New Comedy in Greece and altered it for his own purposes. In New Comedy, he writes, [...] "the slave is often <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> comedic turn, with the added purpose, perhaps, of exposition". This shows that there was precedent for this slave archetype, and obviously some of its old role continues in Plautus (the expository monologues, for instance). However, because Plautus found humor in slaves tricking their masters or comparing themselves to great heroes, he took the character a step further and created something distinct.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{it still}} {{retained}} some older trains, the NYS began purchasing a small fleet of ACF Motorailers, {{a type of}} self-propelled rail car, to run the rapid transit route between North Hawthorne and Susquehanna Transfer. [...] These were supplemented by leased Electro Motive Company motor cars from the Erie Railroad, which the NYS utilized until 1944. [...] The railroad also purchased two used Brill motor cars and rebuilt them to look more like its ACF cars. [...] All of these cars, including the leased Erie cars, were repaired at the North Hawthorne car shop until 1946. [...] After 1946, repairs were shifted to NYS Little Ferry facility. [...] However, as North Hawthorne remained a starting point of local and rapid transit service, cars were continually stored there. [...] North Hawthorne’s roundhouse was subsequently sold the same year, and the old car shop became <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> garage. [...] Though both Brill and ACF cars were stored at North Hawthorne overnight, the NYS favored using the ACF cars over the Brills whenever possible, {{so it was not}} uncommon for the Brills to be held on standby in North Hawthorne.|$|E

2500|$|Mad Love was {{released}} in the United States on July 12, 1935 and, as Hands of Orlac, in the United Kingdom on August 2, 1935. Official reaction in the UK was mixed with Edward Shortt of the BBFC initially declaring his intention to ban the film. The initial critical reception, however, was focused on praise for Lorre's performance. The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "Lorre triumphs in a characterization that is sheer horror", Time magazine called him [...] "perfectly cast", Graham Greene described his performance as [...] "convincing", and Charlie Chaplin called him [...] "the greatest living actor". Reviews {{for the rest of}} the cast were less positive. The New York Times said that [...] "Ted Healy, a highly amusing comedian, has gotten into the wrong picture", and The Hollywood Reporter said that Colin Clive [...] "jitters his way through". The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was [...] "neither important or particularly compelling... falls right in the middle between Art and Box Office". Time magazine called it [...] "completely horrible", and The New York Times wrote that [...] "Mad Love is <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> super-Karloff melodrama, an interesting but pretty trivial adventure in Grand Guignol horror." [...] Mad Love was not a hit at the box office, and had a small domestic gross of $170,000. Its foreign gross was larger, at $194,000.|$|E
