5|$|The {{composition}} of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called <b>nodules</b> and crystals {{that come from}} the mantle. These green <b>nodules</b> are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and <b>nodules</b> they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The <b>nodules</b> help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of four Root-Zone Temperatures (RZT) (5, 10, 15 and 25 °C) on {{nodulation}} and nitrogen percent of four grasspea ecotypes (ardabil, zanjan, mashhad and sharkord), an experiment was conducted in a controlled-environmental chamber in 2005. There were differences (p< 0. 01) among ecotypes, RZT and ecotypes*RZT for root length, forage dry matter, root dry matter, <b>nodule</b> dry weight, <b>nodule</b> number, <b>nodule</b> cluster number, <b>nodule</b> cluster diameter, <b>nodule</b> diameter, <b>nodule</b> distribution (root length that has <b>nodule)</b> and plant nitrogen percent. Mashad and ardabil ecotypes produced the most and least <b>nodule</b> number at 25 and 5 °C, respectively. The maximum and minimum <b>nodule</b> cluster number were observed in ardabil ecotype under 25 and 5 °C RZT, respectively. Root distribution was the most and the least in mashhad and ardabil ecotypes under 25 and 5 °C RZT, respectively. Ardabil produced the highest dry <b>nodule</b> weight at 25 °C RZT. The least dry <b>nodule</b> weight was belonged to ardabil ecotype under 5 °C RZT. Plant nitrogen percent was the highest in ardabile ecotype at 15 °C RZT and the lowest in mashhad ecotype under 5 °C RZT. This experiment showed that at low RZT (i. e., 5 and 10 °C) none of ecotypes had preferred on other ecotypes in point of view measured traits except <b>nodule</b> diameter. Ardabile and mashhad ecotypes were better than other ecotypes at 15 and 25 °C RZT respectively for most traits...|$|R

5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between <b>nodules</b> and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place.

40|$|<b>Nodule</b> worms infect the {{gastrointestinal}} {{tracts of}} a number of mammalian species, including humans and other primates. This study sought to identify the species of <b>nodule</b> worms causing infections within and around an East African national park in Uganda where monkeys and apes co-occur and overlap with people. Some primates, particularly those traversing large distances in small groups, were most susceptible to <b>nodule</b> worm infection. Additionally, molecular analyses identified three separate groups of <b>nodule</b> worm that could not be distinguished based on microscopic examination of their eggs. One of these groups was found in humans as well as other primates and had not previously been genetically characterized. These results suggest that certain types of <b>nodule</b> worm may be restricted to particular hosts, while others may be transmitted among primates, including humans. <b>Nodule</b> worms are currently thought to be a human health concern only in some West African countries. This research suggests that <b>nodule</b> worms have a broader geographic impact in humans than previously appreciated...|$|R

5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; <b>nodules</b> viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the <b>nodules</b> are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{lung cancer}} screening, a <b>nodule</b> {{management}} protocol describes <b>nodule</b> assessment and thresholds for <b>nodule</b> size and growth rate to identify patients who require immediate diagnostic evaluation or additional imaging exams. The Netherlands-Leuvens Screening Trial and the National Lung Screening Trial used different selection criteria and <b>nodule</b> management protocols. Several modelling {{studies have reported}} variations in screening outcomes and cost-effectiveness across selection criteria and screening intervals; however, the effect of variations in the <b>nodule</b> management protocol remains uncertain. This study evaluated {{the effects of the}} eligibility criteria and <b>nodule</b> management protocols on the benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of lung screening scenarios in a population-based setting in Germany. Methods: We developed a modular microsimulation model: a biological module simulated individual histories of lung cancer development from carcinogenesis onset to death; a screening module simulated patient selection, screening-detection, <b>nodule</b> management protocols, diagnostic evaluation and screening outcomes. Benefits included mortality reduction, life years gained and averted lung cancer deaths. Harms were costs, false positives and overdiagnosis. The comparator was no screening. The evaluated 76 screening scenarios included variations in selection criteria and thresholds for <b>nodule</b> size and growth rate. Results: Five years of annual screening resulted in a 9. 7 - 12. 8 % lung cancer mortality reduction in the screened population. The efficient scenarios included volumetric assessment of <b>nodule</b> size, a threshold for a volume of 300 mm 3 and a threshold for a volume doubling time of 400 days. Assessment of volume doubling time is essential for reducing overdiagnosis and false positives. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the efficient scenarios were 16, 754 - 23, 847 euro per life year gained and 155, 287 - 285, 630 euro per averted lung cancer death. Conclusions: Lung cancer screening can be cost-effective in Germany. Along with the eligibility criteria, the <b>nodule</b> management protocol influences screening performance and cost-effectiveness. Definition of the thresholds for <b>nodule</b> size and <b>nodule</b> growth in the <b>nodule</b> management protocol should be considered in detail when defining optimal screening strategies...|$|R

5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese <b>nodules</b> found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these <b>nodules</b> has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
