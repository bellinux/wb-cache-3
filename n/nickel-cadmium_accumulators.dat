40|$|The {{goal of this}} bachelorÂ´s thesis {{project is}} to explain the {{influence}} of lithium hydroxide on nickel accumulators, on their positive electrode. This project describes several different kinds of avaliable accumulators, mainly <b>nickel-cadmium</b> <b>accumulators.</b> In {{the next couple of}} chapters I will be describing their positive electrode, cyclic voltammetry and influences of different additaments on positive electrode. Last part is dedicated to experiments of the cyclic voltammetry with different solutions and tempratures. Comparing these characteristics and evaluating influences of different variables on these measurments is main goal of this thesis...|$|E
