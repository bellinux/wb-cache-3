5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVP's by that time. Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Los Angeles. He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse put to sail on 5 July, {{bound for}} Saint-Domingue where he arrived on 16 July.

Letters from Washington and Rochambeau {{requested}} that de Grasse set sail either to <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>or</b> into Chesapeake Bay.

For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11.

5|$|On July 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} Nash in a sign-and-trade {{deal with}} Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Toronto, {{but he decided}} that Los Angeles was the best fit {{for him and his}} family. Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain. Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number. Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back.|$|E
5|$|Production {{originated}} at {{the studios}} of PBS affiliate WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce Double Dare because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Los Angeles where national television production is more common. The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986. Double Dare premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986. New episodes aired weekdays at 5:30p.m. ET during the original series' run on Nickelodeon. After {{the success of the}} first 65 episodes, a second 65-episode season was ordered.|$|E

5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign.

This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{had hoped}} {{to work in a}} more modern {{facility}} than EMI's London studios at Abbey Road, and so sent Epstein to Memphis in March 1966 to investigate the possibility of their recording at Stax Studio.

The idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative plans to use either Atlantic Studios in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Motown's facility in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in {{promoting}} international {{economic and social}} co-operation and development.

Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations. Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{approximately}} 5,500 French soldiers {{landed in}} Rhode Island to assist their American allies in operations against British-controlled New York City. Following {{the arrival of}} dispatches from France that included the possibility {{of support from the}} French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse, Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>or</b> in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton, was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown, Virginia. Cornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette.|$|E
5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at the Chesapeake {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded {{that they were going to}} join forces at the Chesapeake. He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place after hours of maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E

5|$|The first {{shipments}} {{took place}} in 1806 when Tudor transported an initial trial cargo of ice, probably harvested from his family estate at Rockwood, to the Caribbean island of Martinique. Sales were hampered, however, {{by the lack of}} local storage facilities, both for Tudor's stock and any ice bought by domestic customers, and as a result the ice stocks quickly melted away. Learning from this experience, Tudor then built a functioning ice depot in Havana and, despite the U.S. trade embargo declared in 1807, was trading successfully again by 1810. He was unable to acquire exclusive legal rights to import ice into Cuba, but was nonetheless able to maintain an effective monopoly through his control of the ice houses. The 1812 war briefly disrupted trade, but over subsequent years Tudor began to export fruit back from Havana to the mainland on the return journey, kept fresh with part of the unsold ice cargo. Trade to Charleston and to Savannah in Georgia followed, while Tudor's competitors began to supply South Carolina and Georgia by ship from <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>or</b> using barges sent downstream from Kentucky.|$|E
