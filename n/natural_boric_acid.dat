40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} changes in coolant {{activity}} due to corrosion products of extended burn-up cycles of 18 - 24 months duration, in a typical pressurized water reactor, under pH and boric acid variations. It deals with non-linearly changing corrosion rates coupled with pH effects. The CPAIR-P computer program was modified to accommodate for time-dependent rising corrosion and effects of coolant chemistry. These simulations suggest {{that the effect of}} an increase in pH value for an extended 24 -month cycle on a specific activity, {{in the form of a}} decrease in the said activity, is smeared by the rising corrosion. The new saturation values for activity at the end-of-cycle are lower than with a reactor operated at constant low pH/natural boric acid in the coolant. For a non-linear rise in the corrosion rate coupled with a pH rise from 6. 9 to 7. 4 and the use of enriched boric acid (30 %- 40 %), coolant activity first rises to a peak value during the cycle and then approaches a much smaller saturation value at the end of the cycle, when compared with the activity for the system having a constant low pH value (6. 9) in the coolant. In this work, we have shown that the use of enriched boric acid as a chemical shim actually lowers primary coolant activity when higher pH values, rather than <b>natural</b> <b>boric</b> <b>acid,</b> are employed in the coolant. For multiple long-term operating cycles, the saturation value of corrosion product activity increases in the first two cycles and becomes constant in subsequent ones, due to the high operational pH value for enriched boric acid (40 %) as a chemical shim...|$|E

Besides, it was also used in many fields such as food preservative, in newborn baby&# 8217;s nurseries and antiseptic. Many reports indicated that <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> poisoning occurred due to the misuse of household product and illegal use of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> in food product. In this study, the concern issue was the usage of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> {{that may lead to}} <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> poisoning. Approach: This review had shown some information for <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> such as its usage, the existent method for detection of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> in food. Besides, this review also discussed about the toxicology and pharmacokinetic of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> and the health impact of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> on human and animal.

40|$|Background: <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{commonly}} cited treatment for recurrent and resistant yeast vaginitis, but {{data about the}} extent and mechanism of its antifungal activity are lacking. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to use in vitro methods to understand the spectrum and mechan-ism of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> as a potential treatment for vaginal infection. Methods: Yeast and bacterial isolates were tested by agar dilution to determine the intrinsic antimicro-bial activity of <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> Established microbial physiology methods illuminated the mechanism of the action of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> against Candida albicans. Results: C. albicans strains (including fluconazole-resistant strains) were inhibited at concentrations attainable intravaginally; as were bacteria. Broth dilution MICs were between 1563 and 6250 mg/L and <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> proved fungistatic (also reflected by a decrease in CO 2 generation); prolonged culture at 50 000 mg/L was fungicidal.

This work is directed towards investigating the effects of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> content on biochar yield, composition, and property through a two-step pyrolysis of rice husk. The results showed that biochar yields, compositions, and properties {{were associated with the}} amounts of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> impregnated. Yield, C content, and calorific value of biochar were improved by adding 2. 0 wt % of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> into rice husk, and those values were 46. 4 wt %, 59. 3 wt %, and 22. 6 MJ/kg, respectively. However, the fixed-carbon content of biochar was around 55. 4 wt % and was barely affected by the changes in the amounts of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> absorbed. Therefore, the optimized <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> content of rice husk was 2. 0 wt % when biochar was applied to the fields of carbon storage and solid fuel. Meanwhile, the specific surface area of biochar continuously decreased with increasing <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> content of rice husk, indicating that the <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> had a negative influence on the pore structure of biochar.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{inorganic}} compound in pharmaceutical industry. We find its utilization as an antiseptic, in eye wash preparations, as an insecticidal, as a buffering agent etc. In this present work, a comparative study of the UV-Vis spectras of the <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> solution in different solvents have been done. A variety of solvents like water, ethanol, methanol, glacial acetic acid, hexane, Tetrahydrofuran and 0. 2 M HCl solution have been employed for spectral analysis. When water was taken as a solvent, aqueous <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> solution gave negative absorbance in complete range of UV-Vis analysis i. e. 1100 nm to 190 nm.

The boron in <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> reduces the {{probability}} of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons.

30|$|The main {{advantages}} of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> solution for controlling water pressure reactor are (Pastina et al. 1999; Hohne et al. 2008): (1) <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> features {{the property of}} dissolving in water. Since this property make <b>boric</b> <b>acid’s</b> effect on the reaction is uniform, and neutron absorption effect is well exerted without additional configuration space, a lot of control rods can be saved. Therefore, core arrangement and pressure vessel structure of the reactor {{on the top of}} the heap can be simplified. (2) <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> is chemically stable, and cannot react with the material of the loop easily, and its inertia is enhanced with the increase of temperature. <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> is neither being deposited itself, nor will be formed on the surface of the compound formed by the chemical composition of the reactor. (3) <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> can inhibit corrosion of reactor materials. Significant advantages have been shown by comparing enriched 10 B <b>acid</b> with <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> with <b>natural</b> abundance, since the increase of 10 B concentration in reactor’s coolant system and the decrease of whole amount of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> can increase the safety and controllability of the reactor and improved, water chemical environment of coolant, and so on. For all the above reasons, the cost is effectively reduced.|$|R

30|$|Water plays three {{important}} roles in the reaction process. Firstly, water {{is a kind of}} reactant, whose amount will affect whether the reaction is complete. Secondly, water, as dispersion medium, can make the formation of suspension with calcium chloride be dispersed in it. If water amount is in shortage, calcium chloride cannot be dispersed evenly. Lastly, water is a solvent for the production of <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> Once water amount is not enough, the product of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> will precipitate and mix with nonreacted calcium chloride, which might cause {{that it is hard to}} acquire pure <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> Water’s three roles testify that water amount should not be too less. However, there should not be too much water too. Otherwise, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> will be volatile with water in the concentration process of <b>boric</b> <b>acid,</b> reducing the yield of <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> At the same time, it will produce more liquid waste, which makes it more difficult to follow up.|$|R
30|$|Nonwoven cotton battings {{treated with}} <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> {{have been used}} for many years as fire {{barriers}} in soft furnishings products, especially mattresses ([Wakelyn et al. 2005]). These materials are the least expensive FR barrier materials available on the market, since they usually contain cotton fibers that are procured from textile mills as by-products or waste products. <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> catalyzes dehydration reactions of the oxygen-containing fibers and facilitates char formation ([Dombrowski 1996]). When exposed to an open flame, the <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> decomposes endothermically to release water and cool the flame.

40|$|Objectives: Aluminium {{phosphide}} (AlP) is a fumigant pesticide {{which protects}} stored grains from insects and rodents.

No efficient antidote has been found for AlP poisoning so far and most people who are poisoned do not survive. <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> is a Lewis acid with an empty p orbital which accepts electrons. This study aimed to investigate the neutralisation of PH 3 gas with <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> Methods: This study was carried out at the Baharlou Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, between December 2013 and February 2014. The volume of released gas, rate of gas evolution and changes in pH were measured during reactions of AlP tablets with water, acidified water, saturated <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> solution, acidified saturated <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> solution, activated charcoal and acidified activated charcoal.

Although <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> did not significantly reduce the volume of released gas, it significantly reduced the rate of gas evolution (P < 0. 01). A gaseous adduct was formed in the reaction between pure AlP and <b>boric</b> <b>acid.</b> Conclusion: These findings indicate that <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> may be an efficient and non-toxic antidote for PH 3 poisoning...|$|R

More recent studies have revealed that water or methanol solutions of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> {{can be used to}} prepare strongly bonded layers of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> on aluminum surfaces. It appears that <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> molecules have a strong tendency to bond chemically to the naturally oxidized surfaces of aluminum and its alloys and to make these surfaces very slippery.

The effects of humic acid (HA) and dissolved CO 2 on <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption on amorphous (am) -Al(OH) 3 were investigated as their influence on sorption is potentially important.

In this dissertation, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption on pure am-Al(OH) 3 and 5 % w/w HA coated am-Al(OH) 3 were investigated both as a function of pH (4. 5 – 11) and initial <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration (0 – 4. 5 mmol L- 1). Batch adsorption isotherm experiments were also conducted with samples exposed to atmospheric CO 2 and anaerobic (N 2) conditions {{to examine the effects of}} dissolved CO 2 on <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption. Both the pH envelope and the adsorption isotherm experiments showed that the HA coating on am-Al(OH) 3 and the presence of dissolved CO 2 decreased <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption. Raman spectroscopy and boron (B) K-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy were used to investigate the coordination of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorbed at mineral/water interfaces. The Raman spectroscopy was less successful than expected as there were difficulties in identifying B bands in the 5 % w/w HA coated am-Al(OH) 3 samples. The B K-edge XANES spectroscopy yielded better results. The XANES spectra of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption samples showed that both trigonal BO 3 and tetrahedral BO 4 coordinated complexes are present on the pure and HA coated mineral surfaces. At pH 7. 0 and 9. 2, the adsorption of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> on am-Al(OH) 3 is predominantly inner-sphere trigonal complexes; with minor amounts of inner-sphere tetrahedral complexes. Both macroscopic and spectroscopic experiments revealed that the combination of HA coating on am-Al(OH) 3 and dissolved CO 2 decreased <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption compared to adsorption on pure am-Al(OH) 3. The discoveries in this dissertation contribute significantly in understanding the effects of HA and dissolved CO 2 has on <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorption in the environment. Since B speciation and the stability of am-Al(OH) 3 mineral and HA changes with pH, the bioavailability of B is expected to change as well with pH. The adsorption on <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> on am-Al(OH) 3 and/or HA coated am-Al(OH) 3 is expected to decrease the amount of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> available to plants.

S. EPA) in 1993. 1 See the text box on Laboratory Testing. The borate salts include sodium tetraborate, disodium octaborate and sodium • metaborate. 1 Both sodium tetraborate and disodium octaborate occur in several hydration states. Sodium tetraborate decahydrate {{is also known as}} borax. 1 Uses: Uses for individual <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> and borate salt products vary widely. <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> and • its sodium borate salts are active ingredients in pesticides used against insects, spiders, mites, algae, molds, fungi, and weeds. 1 <b>Boric</b> <b>acid</b> and borate salt products are used on a variety of sites including sewage • systems, food and non-food crops, outdoor residential areas, and indoor sites such as homes, hospitals, and commercial buildings. 1, 2 Commercial formulations of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> and borate salts include liquids (solutions, • emulsifiable concentrates), granules, wettable powders, dusts, pellets, tablets, rods and baits in concentrations ranging from 1 % to nearly 100 %. 1 Signal words for products containing <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> may range from Caution to Danger. • The signal word reflects the combined toxicity of the active ingredient and other ingredients in the product.
