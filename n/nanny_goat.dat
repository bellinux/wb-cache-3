Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the reproductive response of adult and prepubertal goats subjected to repeated laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU). The study animals were divided into two groups, specifically, adult <b>nanny</b> <b>goats</b> (GA, n= 10) and prepubertal <b>nanny</b> <b>goats</b> (GP, n= 10), which were subjected to estrous synchronization and ovarian stimulation for LOPU. Both groups underwent six LOPU procedures at seven-day intervals and were subsequently subjected to controlled mating and pregnancy diagnosis to evaluate their future fertility. The study showed a reduction in the number of follicles visualized and in the amount and quality of the oocytes that were recovered and exposed to in vitro maturation. As indicated by the fertility test, however, no complications were found during the laparoscopic procedures that would impair the reproductive future of the animals. Therefore, a viable number of oocytes were obtained even with the decreased reproductive efficiency, proving that repeated LOPUs do not interfere with the reproductive of adult and prepubertal <b>nanny</b> <b>goats.</b> These results indicate a positive aspect of this procedure, allowing for increasing reproductive performance of this kind, when used for the production in vitro...|$|R

This method did have some effect of improving the infants' mortality rates, though the goats tended to die prematurely of mercury poisoning.|$|R

5000|$|In this {{commonly}} applied type of estimation, {{the number}} of animal units may be calculated as the ratio of daily forage dry matter mass consumption, in kg, divided by 12 kg (or daily forage dry matter weight consumption, in pounds, divided by 26 pounds), {{based on the assumption}} that daily forage dry matter intake by a 1000-pound cow (with or without unweaned calf) is 2.6 percent of body weight. For example, some animal unit calculations used in Texas assume that daily forage dry matter consumption by a 90-pound <b>nanny</b> Spanish <b>goat</b> is 4.5 percent of body weight. Thus the nanny:cow ratio of daily dry matter consumption is estimated at 4.05:26, or about 0.16. This yields the estimate that such a nanny is equivalent to about 0.16 animal units. [...] Rather than being calculated on a precise live mass basis, some estimates of this type have been generalized in tabulations (by species) according to age or sex classes, e.g. mature sheep, 0.2; lamb (weaned to yearling), 0.12; lamb (yearling), 0.15; ram, 0.25.|$|R
