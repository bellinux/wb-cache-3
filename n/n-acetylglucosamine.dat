25|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers; the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin, waxy, {{water-resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and the layer under it called the procuticle. This is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers, the outer is the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and sclerotized. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially the larval stages (e.g., caterpillars). Chemically, chitin is a long-chain polymer of a <b>N-acetylglucosamine,</b> a derivative of glucose. In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient and quite tough. In arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in a hardened proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, it is leathery, but when encrusted in calcium carbonate, it becomes much harder. The difference between the unmodified and modified forms can be seen by comparing the body wall of a caterpillar (unmodified) to a beetle (modified).|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of <b>N-acetylglucosamine</b> occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E

We used high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to study the possible occurrence of glycans on peptides generated from lactobacillary surface proteins by protease treatment. This approach yielded five glycopeptides in various glycoforms, all derived from the AST domain of Acm 2. All five glycopeptides contained the hydroxy-amino acids serine and threonine, suggesting that Acm 2 is O-glycosylated. By using lectin blotting with succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, and by comparing the wild-type strain with an Acm 2 -negative derivative (NZ 3557), we found that the attached N-acetylhexosamines are most likely <b>N-acetylglucosamines</b> (GlcNAc). NZ 3557 was further used as a genetic background to express an Acm 2 variant lacking its secretion signal, resulting in intracellular expression of Acm 2.

On average, glycosylation of skeletal calsequestrin {{consisted of two}} <b>N-acetylglucosamines</b> and one mannose (GlcNAc 2 Man 1), while cardiac calsequestrin had five additional mannoses (GlcNAc 2 Man 6). Skeletal calsequestrin was not phosphorylated, while the C-terminal tails of cardiac calsequestrin contained between zero to two phosphoryls, indicating that phosphorylation of cardiac calsequestrin may be heterogeneous in vivo. Static light scattering experiments showed that the Ca 2 +-dependent polymerization capabilities of native bovine skeletal calsequestrin are enhanced, relative to the non-glycosylated, recombinant isoform, which our crystallographic studies suggest {{may be due to}} glycosylation providing a dynamic “guiderail”-like scaffold for calsequestrin polymerization.

30|$|The {{attachment}} {{of sugar}} molecules to protein {{is one of}} the most well-known and vital forms of co- and post-translational modification as the addition can significantly change the structure, and subsequently the function of the protein. The addition of sugar residues can occur at certain amino acid side-chains, and these modifications can be N- and O-glycosylation type, phosphoglycation, C-mannosylation, and glypiation (Fitchette-Lainé et al. 1998; Spiro 2002). P. pastoris is known to N-glycosylate proteins via mannose oligosaccharide linked to asparagine via its two <b>N-acetylglucosamines</b> and these diverse roles of glycans can affect the conformational maturation, secretion, activity, and stability of glycoproteins (Laukens et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015). This modification can either be advantageous or not depending on the application field of the desired protein. Detailed studies on deglycosylation conducted on aspartic proteinase of Mucor pusillus have revealed that the elimination of N-linked carbohydrate groups from the protein affects the enzyme properties such as milk-clotting and proteolytic activities while leading to a decrease in the level of secretion and thermal stability in other fungi (Aikawa et al. 1990; Yamashita et al. 1994). Moreover, a high degree of glycosylation has been proposed to be the purpose for a well-stabilized structural conformation, which may confer a high level of thermal stability for the aspartic proteinase from Rhizomucor miehei (Celebi et al. 2016; Soltani et al. 2016), M. pusillus, Sporisorium reilianum and A. niger (Mandujano-González et al. 2016; Rickert and McBride-Warren 1977; Zhang et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlycosylation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} post-translational modifications, influencing both the chemical and the biological properties of proteins. Studying the glycosylation of the entire protein population of a sample can be challenging because variations in the concentrations of certain proteins can enhance or obscure changes in glycosylation. Furthermore, alterations in the glycosylation pattern of individual proteins, exhibiting larger variability in disease states, have been suggested as biomarkers for different types of cancer, as well as inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we present a rapid and efficient method for glycosylation analysis of individual proteins focusing on changes in the degree of fucosylation or other alterations to the core structure of the glycans, such as the presence of bisecting <b>N-acetylglucosamines</b> and a modified degree of branching. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads are used in combination with genetically engineered immunoaffinity binders, called VHH antibody fragments. A major advantage of the VHHs is that they are nonglycosylated; thus, enzymatic release of glycans from the targeted protein can be performed directly on the beads. After deglycosylation, the glycans are analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The developed method was evaluated concerning its specificity, and thereafter implemented for studying the glycosylation pattern of two different proteins, alpha- 1 -antitrypsin and transferrin, in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a protein array-type experiment that employs bead-based immunoaffinity purification in combination with mass spectrometry analysis for fast and efficient glycan analysis of individual proteins in biological fluid...|$|R

The major LCO of Rhizobium meliloti, the symbiont of Medicago plants contains four or five <b>N-acetylglucosamines,</b> O-acetylated and N-acylated with a C 16 : 2 fatty acid on the terminal nonreducing sugar and O-sulfated on the reducing sugar. In this paper, the ligand specificity of a high-affinity binding site (Nod factor binding site 2 or NFBS 2), enriched in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction of Medicago cell suspension cultures, is reported. By using chemically synthesized LCOs, the role of structural elements, important for symbiotic activities, as recognition motifs for NFBS 2 was determined. The results show that the substitutions on the nonreducing sugar of the LCOs (the O-acetate group, the fatty acid, and the hydroxyl group on the C 4 of the sugar) are determinants for high-affinity binding to NFBS 2. In contrast, the sulfate group, which is necessary for all biological activities on Medicago, is not discriminated by NFBS 2. However, the reducing sugar of the LCO seems to interact with NFBS 2, because ligand binding is affected by the reduction of the free anomeric carbon and depends on the number of N-acetyl glucosamine residues. These results suggest that the recognition of the LCOs by NFBS 2 is mediated by structural elements in both the lipid and oligosaccharidic moities, but not by the sulfate group...|$|R
2500|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{is composed}} of the plasma membrane and cell wall. As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall {{is to protect the}} cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and <b>N-acetylglucosamine</b> (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as Mycoplasma) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics. [...] For both these types of bacteria, particles of approximately 2nm can pass through the peptidoglycan. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast while if it's partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillin inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.|$|E

Members of these two subclasses, depending on the presence or absence of a C-terminal extension, can be secreted from specialized digestive glands found within the morphologically diverse traps that develop from carnivorous plant leaves. The degree of homology among carnivorous plant class I chitinases and the method by which these enzymes have been adapted for the carnivorous habit has yet to be elucidated. This study focuses on understanding the evolution of carnivory and chitinase genes in one of the major groups of plants that has evolved the carnivorous habit: the Caryophyllales.

TPP 1 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme (pro-TPP 1) that is proteolytically processed into the active enzyme after exposure to low pH in vitro or targeting to the lysosome in vivo.

For the generation of hypoglycosylated VLPs, the wild-type (WT) HBsAgS N 146 glycosylation site was converted to N 146 Q; for constructing hyperglycosylated VLPs, potential glycosylation sites were introduced in the HBsAgS external loop region at positions T 116 and G 130 in addition to the WT site. The introduced T 116 N and G 130 N sites were utilized as glycosylation anchors resulting in the formation of hyperglycosylated VLPs.

Antigenic fingerprints for the WT and hypo- and hyperglycosylated VLPs using a panel of 19 anti-HBsAgS monoclonal antibodies revealed that 15 antibodies retained their ability to bind to the different VLP glyco-analogues, suggesting that the additional N-glycans did not shield extensively for the HBsAgS-specific antigenicity.

The T 116 N VLPs induced earlier and longer-lasting antibody responses than did the hypoglycosylated and WT VLPs. The ability of nonnative VLPs to promote immune responses possibly due to differences in their glycosylation-related interaction with cells of the innate immune system illustrates pathways for the design of immunogens for superior preventive applications.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain further insight in family 19 chitinases by {{carrying}} out a kinetic and functional characterization of a bacterial family 19 chitinase from Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2). There are many family 19 chitinases, but it is still not quite clear what these enzymes do. More fundamental enzymology is needed to learn about the details of these enzymes. Calculating kinetic parameters like Km and kcat under various conditions and for various substrates can provide such details. In the present study, Chitinase G from S. coelicolor A 3 (2) was expressed in a pETM 11 vector and purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography. After method development to establish reliable quantitative analysis of reaction products, kinetic parameters were obtained from enzyme assays using natural soluble chitooligosaccharides as substrates. Km and kcat for (GlcNAc) 3, (GlcNAc) 4 and (GlcNAc) 5 were 4. 9 (± 0. 8) × 103 µM and 215 (± 21) s- 1, 5. 6 (± 0. 40) × 102 µM and 584 (± 14) s- 1 and 5. 3 (± 0. 84) × 102 µM and 451 (± 24) s- 1, respectively. The similar Km values of the tetramer and the pentamer indicate that the enzyme has only four substrate-binding subsites. In addition, enzyme assays were performed at pH 4 to 8 using (GlcNAc) 4 as substrate, which revealed minimal effect on the enzyme activity. Chitinase G activity towards other substrates than chitin was tested, including other polysaccharides, cell walls of some bacteria and a fungus, using size exclusion chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for product analysis. However, no novel activities were detected. High Km values obtained from enzyme assays indicate low affinity towards the substrates tested, even though high kcat values may indicate that the main substrate target is chitin, or at least a beta- 1, 4 glycosidic bond between two <b>N-acetylglucosamines,</b> after all. More research is needed to understand the biological roles of these enzymes. M-LU...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The insect {{cell line}} is a {{critical}} component {{in the production of}} recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression system and new cell lines hold the promise of increasing both quantity and quality of protein production. Results Seventy cell lines were established by single-cell cloning from a primary culture of cells derived from eggs of the black witch moth (Ascalapha odorata; Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). Among 8 rapidly growing lines, cell line 38 (Ao 38) was selected for further analysis, based on susceptibility to AcMNPV infection and production of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) from a baculovirus expression vector. In comparisons with low-passage High Five (BTI-Tn- 5 B 1 - 4) cells, infected Ao 38 cells produced β-galactosidase and SEAP at levels higher (153 % and 150 %, respectively) than those measured from High Five cells. Analysis of N-glycans of SEAP produced in Ao 38 cells revealed two N-glycosylation sites and glycosylation patterns similar to those reported for High Five and Sf 9 cells. Glycopeptide isoforms consisted of pauci- or oligomannose, with and without fucose on <b>N-acetylglucosamine(s)</b> linked to asparagine residues. Estimates of Ao 38 cell volume suggest that Ao 38 cells are approximately 2. 5 × larger than Sf 9 cells but only approximately 74 % of the size of High Five cells. Ao 38 cells were highly susceptible to AcMNPV infection, similar to infectivity of Sf 9 cells. Production of infectious AcMNPV budded virions from Ao 38 cells peaked at approximately 4. 5 × 10 7 IU/ml, exceeding that from High Five cells while lower than that from Sf 9 cells. Ao 38 cells grew rapidly in stationary culture with a population doubling time of 20. 2 hr, and Ao 38 cells were readily adapted to serum-free medium (Sf- 900 III) and to a suspension culture system. Analysis of Ao 38 and a parental Ascalapha odorata cell line indicated that these lines were free of the alphanodavirus that was recently identified as an adventitious agent in High Five cell lines. Conclusions Ao 38 cells represent a highly productive new insect cell line that will be useful for heterologous protein expression and other applications in biotechnology. </p...|$|R
