40|$|As a {{new medium}} for {{questionnaire}} delivery, {{the internet has}} the potential to revolutionise the survey process. Online (web-based) questionnaires provide several advantages over traditional survey methods in terms of cost, speed, appearance, flexibility, functionality, and usability [1, 2]. For instance, delivery is faster, responses are received more quickly, and data collection can be automated or accelerated [1 - 3]. Online-questionnaires can also provide many capabilities not found in traditional paper-based questionnaires: they can include pop-up instructions and error messages; they can incorporate links; and it is possible to encode difficult skip patterns making such patterns virtually invisible to respondents. Like many new technologies, however, online-questionnaires face criticism despite their advantages. Typically, such criticisms focus on the vulnerability of online-questionnaires to the four standard survey error types: namely, coverage, non-response, sampling, and measurement errors. Although, like all survey errors, coverage error (“the result of not allowing all members of the survey population to have an equal or nonzero chance of being sampled for participation in a survey” [2, pg. 9]) also affects traditional survey methods, it is currently exacerbated in online-questionnaires {{as a result of the}} digital divide. That said, many developed countries have reported substantial increases in computer and internet access and/or are targeting this as part of their immediate infrastructural development [4, 5]. Indicating that familiarity with information technologies is increasing, these trends suggest that coverage error will rapidly diminish to an acceptable level (for the developed world at least) in the near future, and in so doing, positively reinforce the advantages of online-questionnaire delivery. The second error type – the non-response error – occurs when individuals fail to respond to the invitation to participate in a survey or abandon a questionnaire before it is completed. Given today’s societal trend towards self-administration [2] the former is inevitable, irrespective of delivery mechanism. Conversely, non-response as a consequence of questionnaire abandonment can be relatively easily addressed. Unlike traditional questionnaires, the delivery mechanism for online-questionnaires makes estimation of questionnaire length and time required for completion difficult 1, thus increasing the likelihood of abandonment. By incorporating a range of features into the design of an online questionnaire, it is possible to facilitate such estimation – and indeed, to provide respondents with context sensitive assistance during the response process – and thereby reduce abandonment while eliciting feelings of accomplishment [6]. For online-questionnaires, sampling error (“the result of attempting to survey only some, and not all, of the units in the survey population” [2, pg. 9]) can arise when all but a small portion of the anticipated respondent set is alienated (and so fails to respond) as a result of, for example, disregard for varying connection speeds, bandwidth limitations, browser configurations, monitors, hardware, and user requirements during the questionnaire design process. Similarly, measurement errors (“the result of poor question wording or questions being presented in such a way that inaccurate or uninterpretable answers are obtained” [2, pg. 11]) will lead to respondents becoming confused and frustrated. Sampling, measurement, and <b>non-response</b> <b>errors</b> are likely to occur when an online-questionnaire is poorly designed. Individuals will answer questions incorrectly, abandon questionnaires, and may ultimately refuse to participate in future surveys; thus, the benefit of online questionnaire delivery will not be fully realized. To prevent errors of this kind 2, and their consequences, it is extremely important that practical, comprehensive guidelines exist for the design of online questionnaires. Many design guidelines exist for paper-based questionnaire design (e. g. [7 - 14]); the same is not true for the design of online questionnaires [2, 15, 16]. The research presented in this paper is a first attempt to address this discrepancy. Section 2 describes the derivation of a comprehensive set of guidelines for the design of online-questionnaires and briefly (given space restrictions) outlines the essence of the guidelines themselves. Although online-questionnaires reduce traditional delivery costs (e. g. paper, mail out, and data entry), set up costs can be high given the need to either adopt and acquire training in questionnaire development software or secure the services of a web developer. Neither approach, however, guarantees a good questionnaire (often because the person designing the questionnaire lacks relevant knowledge in questionnaire design). Drawing on existing software evaluation techniques [17, 18], we assessed the extent to which current questionnaire development applications support our guidelines; Section 3 describes the framework used for the evaluation, and Section 4 discusses our findings. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a discussion of further work...|$|E

Four different formats were used, varying the number of items on a screen (1, 4, 10, and 40 items).

40|$|In surveys {{covering}} {{human populations}} {{it is observed}} that information in most cases are not obtained at the first attempt even after some callbacks. Such problems come under the category of non-response. Surveys suffer with non-response in various ways. It depends on the nature of required information, either surveys is concerned with general or sensitive issues of a society. Hansen and Hurwitz (1946) have considered the problem of non-response while estimating the population mean by taking a subsample from the non-respondent group with the help of extra efforts and an estimator was suggested by combining the information available from the response and nonresponse groups. We also mention that in survey sampling auxiliary information is commonly used to improve the performance of an estimator of a quantity of interest. For estimating the population mean using auxiliary information in presence of non-response has been discussed by various authors.

40|$|Using {{multiple}} modes {{to collect}} data (such as face to face, telephone or the Web) is becoming a standard practice in survey agencies. While this should save costs and decrease <b>non-response</b> <b>error</b> (by including more diverse respondents) it may have detrimental effects on measurement quality. This can happen because different modes can have distinct measurement biases which, when combined with selection effects, can increase the total survey error of a mixed-mode survey relative to a single mode approach.

This finding was surprising as several of the instructors indicated that they needed more inservice for them to feel more confident to integrate more science into the agriculture curriculum.;Many instructors were interested in integrating more bioscience/biotechnology into their programs but many believed there were barriers preventing them to do so. The instructors believed that they needed appropriate additional instructional materials and inservice training. The educators also believed that integrating the sciences into their curriculum would require more time, facilities, and equipment...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the use of auxiliary and paradata for dealing with <b>non-response</b> and measurement <b>errors</b> in household surveys. Three over-arching purposes are distinguished: response enhancement, statistical adjustment, and bias exploration. Attention {{is given to the}} varying focus at the different phases of statistical production from collection, processing to analysis, and how to select and utilize the useful auxiliary and paradata. Administrative register data provide the richest source of relevant auxiliary information, in addition to data collected in previous surveys and censuses. Due to their importance in effective dealings with non-sampling errors, one should make every effort to increase their availability in the statistical system and, at the same time, to develop efficient statistical methods that capitalize on the combined data sources...|$|R
40|$|Linkage of {{household}} survey responses with administrative data is increasingly on the agenda. Unique individual identifiers have clear benefits for making linkages {{but are also}} subject to problems of survey item <b>non-response</b> and measurement <b>error.</b> Our experimental study that linked survey respon ses to UK government agency records on benefits and tax credits elucidates this trade-off. We compare five linkage criteria: one based on a respondent-supplied National Insurance Number (NINO) and the other four using different combinations of sex, name, address and date of birth. As many linkages were made using non-NINO-based matches as were made using matches on NINO and the former were also relatively accurate when assessed in terms of false-positive and false-negative linkage rates. The potential returns from hierarchical and pooled matching are also examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} unit <b>non-response</b> on survey <b>errors</b> are {{of great concern}} to researchers. However, direct {{assessment}} of non-response bias in survey estimates is rarely possible. Attempts are often made to adjust {{for the effects of}} non-response by weighting, but this usually relies on the use of frame data or external population data, which are at best modestly correlated with the survey variables. This paper reports the development of a method to collect limited survey data from non-respondents to personal interview surveys and a large-scale field test of the method on the British Crime Survey (BCS). The method is shown to be acceptable and low cost, to provide valid data, and to have no detrimental effect on the main survey. The use of the resultant data to estimate non-response bias is illustrated and some substantive conclusions are drawn for the BCS...|$|R
40|$|<b>Non-response</b> is an <b>error</b> {{common to}} most surveys. In this dissertation, the <b>error</b> of <b>non-response</b> is {{described}} in terms of its sources and its contribution to the Mean Square Error of survey estimates. Various response and completion rates are defined. Techniques are examined {{that can be used to}} identify the extent of nonresponse bias in surveys. Methods to identify auxiliary variables for use in nonresponse adjustment procedures are described. Strategies for dealing with nonresponse are classified into two types, namely preventive strategies and post hoc adjustments of data. Preventive strategies discussed include the use of call-backs and follow-ups and the selection of a probability sub-sample of non-respondents for intensive follow-ups. Post hoc adjustments discussed include population and sample weighting adjustments and raking ratio estimation to compensate for unit non-response as well as various imputation methods to compensate for item non-response.

40|$|Linkages of {{household}} survey responses with administrative data may {{be based on}} unique individual identifiers or on survey respondent characteristics. The benefits gained from using unique identifiers need to be assessed {{in the light of}} potential problems such as <b>non-response</b> and measurement <b>error.</b> We report on a study that linked survey responses to UK government agency records on benefits and tax credits in five different ways. One matched on a respondent- supplied National Insurance Number and the other four used different combinations of sex, name, address, and date of birth. As many linkages were made using matches on sex, date of birth, and post-code, or on sex, date of birth, first name and family name, as were made using matches on self-reported National Insurance Number, and the former were also relatively accurate when assessed in terms of false positive and false negative rates. The five independent matching exercises also shed light on the potential returns from hierarchical and pooled matching...|$|R
40|$|A central {{problem in}} applied {{empirical}} {{work is to}} separate out the patterns in the data that are due to poor production of the data, such as e. g. <b>non-response</b> and measurement <b>errors,</b> from the patterns attributable to the economic phenomena studied. This paper interprets this inference problem as being an agency problem {{in the market for}} observations and suggests ways in which using incentives may be useful to overcome it. The paper discusses how wage discrimination may be used for identification of economic parameters of interest taking into account the responses in survey supply by sample members to that discrimination. Random wage discrimination alters the supply behavior of sample members across the same types of populations in terms of outcomes and thereby allows for separating out poor supply from the population parameters of economic interest. Empirical evidence for a survey of US physicians suggests that survey supply even for this wealthy group is affected by the types of wage discrimination schemes discussed in a manner that makes the schemes useful for identification purposes. Using such schemes to correct mean estimates of physician earnings increases those earnings by about one third. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{development}} and expansion of direct, secure access to administrative micro-data should be a top priority for the NSF. Administrative data offer much larger sample sizes and have far fewer problems with attrition, <b>non-response,</b> and measurement <b>error</b> than traditional survey data sources. Administrative data are therefore critical for cutting-edge empirical research, and particularly for credible public policy evaluation. Although a number of agencies have successful programs {{to provide access to}} administrative data – most notably the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – the United States generally lags far behind other countries in making data available to researchers. We discuss the value of administrative data using examples from recent research in the United States and abroad. We then outline a plan to develop incentives for agencies to broaden data access for scientific research based on competition, transparency, and rewards for producing socially valuable scientific output. A Wealth of Administrative Data Governments create comprehensive micro-economic files to aid in the administration of their tax and benefit programs. The Social Security Administration (SSA), for example, records annual data on earnings and retirement and disability benefit payments for virtually the entire US population. Stat...|$|R
2500|$|Roderick Hindery {{reported}} {{that a number of}} Western Catholics have voiced significant disagreement with the Church's stance on contraception. In 1968, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops issued what many interpreted as a dissenting document, the Winnipeg Statement, in which the bishops recognized that a number of Canadian Catholics found it [...] "either extremely difficult or even impossible to make their own all elements of this doctrine" [...] (that of Humanae vitae). Additionally, in 1969, they reasserted the Catholic principle of primacy of conscience, a principle that they said should be properly interpreted. They insisted that [...] "a Catholic Christian is not free to form his conscience without consideration of the teaching of the magisterium, in the particular instance exercised by the Holy Father in an encyclical letter." [...] Catholics for a Free Choice claimed in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in their}} lives and that 72% of U.S. Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. According to a nationwide poll of 2,242 U.S. adults surveyed online in September 2005 by Harris Interactive (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to sampling <b>errors,</b> <b>non-response,</b> etc.), 90% of U.S. Catholics supported the use of birth control/contraceptives. A survey conducted in 2015 by the Pew Research Center among 5,122 U.S. adults (including 1,016 self-identified Catholics) stated 76% of U.S. Catholics thought that the Church should allow Catholics to use birth control.|$|R
