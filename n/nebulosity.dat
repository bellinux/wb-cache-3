5|$|Under ideal observing conditions, some hint of <b>nebulosity</b> {{may be seen}} {{around the}} cluster, and this shows up in long-exposure photographs. It is a {{reflection}} nebula, caused by dust reflecting the blue light of the hot, young stars.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} the dust {{responsible}} for the <b>nebulosity</b> is not uniformly distributed, but is concentrated mainly in two layers {{along the line of}} sight to the cluster.

5|$|The English {{astronomer}} John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars. Further discoveries paralleled {{the improvements}} in the size {{and quality of the}} telescope. More extensive star catalogues were produced by Lacaille. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of <b>nebulosity</b> and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found. The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.|$|E

40|$|Proceedings GSD 2008 conference, {{submitted}} to ANThis document is divided in two parts. The first part {{deals with the}} radial velocities (RV) distributions for B-type stars and <b>nebulosities</b> observed with the VLT-GIRAFFE in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds towards the open clusters NGC 2004 and NGC 330. Thanks to the resolution of GIRAFFE spectra, {{we found that the}} RV distribution for the <b>nebulosities</b> in the LMC is bi-modal. This bi-modality can be interpreted, in term of dynamics, by the expansion of the LMC 4 superbubble.

5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening. This {{has been estimated}} at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the <b>nebulosity.</b> The recent visual brightening {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection <b>nebulosity</b> around the brightest stars was thought at first to be {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could {{be responsible for}} this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the <b>nebulosity</b> in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of 3 years of deep {{observations}} of the Galactic center with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, we report the discovery {{of changes in the}} intensities and morphologies of two hard X-ray <b>nebulosities.</b> The <b>nebulosities</b> are dominated by fluorescent iron emission and are coincident with molecular clouds. The morphological changes are manifest on parsec scales, which requires that these iron features are scattered X-rays from a 2 or 3 year long outburst of a point source (either Sgr A* or an X-ray binary) with a luminosity of at least 10 ^ 37 ergs s^- 1. The variability precludes the hypotheses that these nebulae either are produced by keV electrons bombarding molecular clouds or are iron-rich ejecta from supernovae.

5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the <b>nebulosity</b> is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
5|$|The galactic anticenter {{is located}} about 3.5° {{to the east}} of Beta Aurigae. This marks the point on the {{celestial}} sphere opposite the location of the Galactic Center; hence, this region marks a less extensive and less luminous part of the dust band that forms the spiral arms of the Milky Way. Auriga has many open clusters and other objects because the Milky Way runs through it. The three brightest open clusters are M36, M37 and M38, all of which are visible in binoculars or a small telescope in suburban skies. A larger telescope resolves individual stars. Three other open clusters are NGC 2281, lying close to ψ7 Aurigae, NGC 1664, which is close to ε Aurigae, and IC 410 (surrounding NGC 1893), a cluster with <b>nebulosity</b> next to IC 405, the Flaming Star Nebula, found about midway between M38 and ιAurigae. AE Aurigae, a runaway star, is a bright variable star currently located within the Flaming Star Nebula.|$|E
5|$|NGC 772 is {{a spiral}} galaxy with an {{integrated}} magnitude of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 Arietis. It {{is a relatively}} bright galaxy and shows obvious <b>nebulosity</b> and ellipticity in an amateur telescope. It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its surface brightness, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a class SA(s)b galaxy, which means {{that it is an}} unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly. The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many star forming regions; this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies. NGC 772 has a small companion galaxy, NGC 770, that is about 113,000 light-years away from the larger galaxy. The two galaxies together are also classified as Arp 78 in the Arp peculiar galaxy catalog. NGC 772 has a diameter of 240,000 light-years and the system is 114 million light-years from Earth. Another spiral galaxy in Aries is NGC 673, a face-on class SAB(s)c galaxy. It is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms. It has no ring and a faint bulge and is 2.5 by 1.9 arcminutes.

5|$|T Aurigae (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova {{discovered}} at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by Thomas David Anderson. It became {{visible to the}} naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear <b>nebulosity</b> in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a slow nova, similar to DQ Herculis. Like DQ Herculis, WZ Sagittae, Nova Persei 1901 and Nova Aquilae 1918, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a partial eclipse period of 40 minutes.|$|E

40|$|H I {{absorption}} {{has been}} detected with the WSRT against both lobes {{of the radio}} galaxy Coma A. This radio galaxy could be expanding in a particularly gas rich environment, perhaps the result from interactions/mergers between the dominant giant galaxy (associated with the radio galaxy) and less massive galaxies in the same group. Powerful radio galaxies are frequently associated with kpc-sized emission line <b>nebulosities,</b> extending up to tens of kpc from the nucleus.

Dolidze 11 is an open cluster 400 million years old, farthest away of the three at 3700 light-years. More than 10 stars are visible in an amateur instrument in this cluster, of similar size to Dolidze 9 at 7 arcminutes in diameter, whose brightest star is of magnitude 7.5.

40|$|Deep {{mid-infrared}} (10 - 20 μm) {{images with}} sub-arcsec resolution {{were obtained for}} two Herbig Be stars, MWC 1080 and HD 259431, to probe their immediate environments. Our goal is to understand {{the origin of the}} diffuse <b>nebulosities</b> observed around these two very young objects. By analyzing our new mid-IR images and comparing them to published data at other wavelengths, we demonstrate that the well extended emission around MWC 1080 traces neither a disk nor an envelope, but rather the surfaces of a cavity created by the outflow from MWC 1080 A, the primary star of the MWC 1080 system. In the N-band images, the filamentary <b>nebulosities</b> trace the hourglass-shaped gas cavity wall out to ∼ 0. 15 pc. This scenario reconciles the properties of the MWC 1080 system revealed by a wide range of observations. Our finding confirms that the environment around MWC 1080, where a small cluster is forming, is strongly affected by the outflow from the central Herbig Be star. Similarities observed between the two subjects {{of this study suggest that}} the filamentary emission around HD 259431 may arise from a similar outflow cavity structure, too.

40|$|From {{photoelectric}} spectrophotometric data secured at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory we {{have attempted}} to derive electron densities and temperatures, ionic concentrations, and chemical abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, S, and Ar in <b>nebulosities</b> in the Magellanic Clouds. Although 10 distinct <b>nebulosities</b> were observed in the Small Cloud and 20 such objects in the Large Cloud, the most detailed observations were secured only for the brighter objects.

A comparison with the Orion nebula suggests He, N, Ne, O, and S may all be less abundant in the Megellanic Clouds, although adequate evaluations will require construction of detailed models. For example, if we postulate that the [NII], [OII], and [SII] radiations originate primarily in regions with electron temperatures near 8000 °K, while the [OIII], [NeIII], [ArIII], and H radiations are produced primarily in regions with Tε = 10, 000 ° K, the derived chemical abundances in the clouds are enhanced...|$|R
