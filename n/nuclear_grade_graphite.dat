Analysis of TEM images was used to quantify fringe length, tortuosity, and relative misorientation of planes, and indicated that neutron irradiation induced basal plane fragmentation and curvature.

The Baseline Graphite Characterization Program is endeavoring to minimize the conservative estimates of as-manufactured mechanical and physical properties by providing comprehensive data that captures the level of variation in measured values. In addition to providing a comprehensive comparison between these values in different <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades,</b> the program is also carefully tracking individual specimen source, position, and orientation information in order to provide comparisons and variations between different lots, different billets, and different positions from within a single billet. This report is a preliminary comparison between the two <b>grades</b> of <b>graphite</b> that were initially favored in the two main VHTR designs. NBG- 18, a medium-grain pitch coke graphite from SGL formed via vibration molding, was the favored structural material in the pebble-bed configuration, while PCEA, a smaller grain, petroleum coke, extruded graphite from GrafTech was favored for the prismatic configuration. An analysis of the comparison between these two grades will include not only the differences in fundamental and statistically-significant individual strength levels, but also the differences in variability in properties within each of the grades that will ultimately provide the basis for the prediction of in-service performance.

McJunkin Idaho National Laboratory Idaho Falls, ID, 83415 This paper {{discusses}} the nondestructive evaluation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> <b>graphite</b> {{performed at the}} Idaho National Laboratory. Graphite is a composite material highly dependent on the base material and manufacturing methods. As a result, material variations are expected within individual billets as well billet to billet and lot to lot. Several methods of evaluating the material have been explored. Particular technologies each provide a subset {{of information about the}} material. This paper focuses on techniques that are applicable to in-service inspection of nuclear energy plant components. Eddy current examination of the available surfaces provides information on potential near surface structural defects and although limited, ultrasonics can be utilized in conventional volumetric inspection. Material condition (e. g. micro-cracking and porosity induced by radiation and stress) can be derived from backscatter or acousto-ultrasound (AU) methods. Novel approaches utilizing phased array ultrasonics have been attempted to expand the abilities of AU techniques. By combining variable placement of apertures, angle and depth of focus, the techniques provide the potential to obtain parameters at various depths in the material. Initial results of the study and possible procedures for application of the techniques are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{double-ended}} guillotine break (DEGB) of {{the horizontal}} coaxial gas duct accident {{is a serious}} air ingress accident of the high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module (HTR-PM). Because the graphite is widely used as the structure material and the fuel element matrix of HTR-PM, the oxidation analyses of this severe air ingress accident have got enough attention in the safety analyses of the HTR-PM. The DEGB of the horizontal coaxial gas duct accident is calculated by using the TINTE code in this paper.

In compression, a linear relation is observed between the elastic strains in the graphite crystals and the applied strain. In tension, this relationship is non-linear.

Optical images of the specimens' tensile surface were analysed by digital image correlation to measure the full-field displacements: these were used to identify the fracture initiation sites, analyse crack geometry (surface length and opening displacements) and also to calculate the J-integral strain energy release rate associated with surface crack propagation. Surface cracks that did not propagate to failure were identified and subsequently examined by X-ray computed tomography combined with digital volume correlation: measurements were made of their three-dimensional displacement fields when subjected to an opening tensile stress using a modified (flat) Brazilian Disk test geometry. The crack opening behaviour is explained by an effect of stress state {{on the development of}} the crack tip fracture process zone, which is in agreement with the effect of stress state on the measured strain energy release rates of sub-critical crack propagation.

The graphites were provided in the form of fuel spheres and a reflector block. The techniques used in the analysis of the materials include fracturing, etching, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nano-indentation, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microstructures of the materials were characterized successfully. The fuel sphere material consisted of a high concentration of curved graphite flakes and grains in contact with turbostratic matrix graphite. The well graphitized flakes and grains were polycrystalline in nature. Delamination cracks were prevalent in the graphite crystallites. There {{was no significant difference in}} the microstructures of the center, interior and surface regions of the fuel sphere material. No evidence of amorphous carbon or resin residues was found. The reflector material consisted of a low concentration of graphite crystallites embedded within turbostratic matrix graphite. Delamination cracks were observed within the graphite crystallites, and many cavities were present in the material. TEM observation also revealed the presence of diamond crystallites. It was concluded that the fuel sphere graphite was most probably suitable for use as is, provided that the material also possessed other required properties for use in a HTTR.

Van Nuys worst <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> was assigned, as was predominant grade, and heterogeneous grading when present. Patients were grouped by heterogeneity of their nuclear grade: Group A: <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> 1 only, <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades</b> 1 and 2, or <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> 2 only (32 patients), Group B: <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades</b> 1, 2 and 3, or <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades</b> 2 and 3 (31 patients), Group 3 : <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> 3 only (17 patients). Nuclear fi ne structure was assessed by software which captured thirty-nine nuclear feature values describing nuclear morphometry, densitometry, and texture.

Results: Duplicate measurements were similar for 89. 7 % to 97. 4 % of assessed image features. The rate of correct classification of <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> with digital image analysis features was similar in the two fields, and pooled assessment across both fields.

40|$|Quantitative image {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} to renal cancers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether there is any correlation between the results of morphometric measurements and Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade,</b> pathologic stage and size of conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma. Morphometric nuclear parameters such as roundness factor, form ellipse, area, length, breadth and perimeter were evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin stained slides of 37 conventional renal cell carcinomas by using computer assisted {{image analysis}} system. The relationship between Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade,</b> pathologic stage, tumor size and morphometric results were determined by correlation analysis. Mean nuclear areas correlated with pathologic stages (r: 0. 413, p= 0. 05) and with Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> (r: 0. 588, p= 0. 01). Mean nuclear length correlated with pathologic stage (r: 0. 446, p= 0. 01) and with Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> (r: 0. 580, p= 0. 01). Mean nuclear breadth were correlated with pathologic stage (r: 0. 377, p= 0. 05) and with Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> (r: 0. 544, p= 0. 01) and with tumor size (r: 0. 366, p= 0. 05). Mean nuclear perimeter correlated with pathologic stage (r: 0. 449, p= 0. 01) and Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> (r: 0. 593, p= 0. 01). Mean nuclear roundness factor correlated with pathologic stage (r: 0. 418, p= 0. 05) and Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> (r: 0. 456, p= 0. 01). In this study, the relative concordance of morphometric results and pathologic stage and Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade,</b> exhibited the importance of nuclear morphometric analysis in the assessment of conventional renal cell carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (1) we {{presented}} {{a study of}} the oxidation characterist ics of spectroscopic <b>grade</b> <b>graphite</b> having a density of 1. 6. Below 800 ~ a chemical control led react ion mechanism was found. Above 800 ~ the react ion was l imited by either a chemical control led process or gas diffusion con-trol led process. The t rans i t ion between the two mechanisms depends on the pressure, sample size, {{and the nature of the}} reaction system. Pyrolyt ic carbon (2), hav ing a density of about 2. 1, is a more dense form of carbon than the spec-troscopic <b>grade</b> <b>graphites</b> and is h ighly anisotropic. Pyrolyt ic carbon is near ly impermeable to gases, and its oxidation rate is said to be less than that of spectroscopic <b>grade</b> <b>graphites</b> by a factor of 1 / 3 to 1 / 10 (2). Theoret ical ly the oxidation rates should depend on the porosity and permeabi l i ty if the in-ternal surfaces of the graphite part ic ipate in the reaction. This difference in oxidation rates should not exist in the gas diffusion control led region of oxidation.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} predict the failure strength response of IG- 100 <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> <b>graphite</b> exposed to multiaxial stresses. As part of this effort, a review of failure criteria accounting for the stochastic strength response is provided. The experimental work was performed in the early 1990 s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on hollow graphite tubes under the action of axial tensile loading and internal pressurization. As part of the investigation, finite-element analysis (FEA) was performed and compared with results of FEA from the original ORNL report. The new analysis generally compared well with the original analysis, although some discrepancies in the location of peak stresses was noted. The Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures Life prediction code (CARES/Life) was used with the FEA results to predict the quadrants I (tensile-tensile) and quadrant IV (compression-tension) strength response of the graphite tubes for the principle of independent action (PIA), the Weibull normal stress averaging (NSA), and the Batdorf multiaxial failure theories. The CARES/Life reliability analysis showed that all three failure theories gave similar results in quadrant I but that in quadrant IV, the PIA and Weibull normal stress-averaging theories were not conservative, whereas the Batdorf theory was able to correlate well with experimental results. The conclusion {{of the study was}} that the Batdorf theory should generally be used to predict the reliability response of graphite and brittle materials in multiaxial loading situations...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} scientific {{investigation is}} carried out into the effects of ion irradiation on graphite systems. The results obtained have been compared with analogous radiation induced affects seen in neutron irradiated material. Results indicate that ion irradiation causes structural damage of the graphite lattice, as expected, in a very similar way to neutron irradiation. Such damage is also largely recoverable through thermal annealing. However, certain differences are observed and {{it seems likely that}} these are due to differences {{in the nature of the}} damage caused, and the recovery of such damage, on the fundamental level. Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) equipment was used to irradiate samples of <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> <b>graphite</b> and highly-orientated pyrolyitc graphite (HOPG) with inert gas ions and external facilities were also used to irradiate with carbon ions at higher energies. After irradiation a variety of scientific techniques were used to analyse the damage caused as a result of the irradiation. Raman spectroscopy was used extensively to study the samples after irradiation and results indicated the presence of significant ion-induced damage through analysis of the Id/Ig ratio. The results were shown to be analogous to neutron induced damage and the amount of damage present was seen to be dependant on ion mass, ion energy and of course the total ion dose. A broad Raman feature was observed at 1500 cm' 1, after a critical ion dose and such a feature has been rarely observed in neutron irradiated material, this feature perhaps suggests a fundamental difference between the damage occurring and a difference in the type and extent of defects produced. Raman was also used to effectively monitor damage recovery processes occurring as a result of thermal annealing and such recovery was seen to be analogous to the recovery seen in neutron damages materials. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to detect any exothermic release, when heating the sample after irradiation, occurring as a result of a build-up of Wigner-like energy, a phenomenon commonly seen in neutron irradiated graphite. In one case of high energy He+ ion irradiation such an exotherm was observed at 226 °C, the expected temperature range for Wigner-like release, however this result was very difficult to reproduce thus suggesting a fragile balance of ion irradiation parameters resulting in the necessary defects required to observe any Wigner release. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed clearly that the atomic structure of <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> <b>graphite</b> material was markedly altered as a result of ion irradiation, leading to an amorphous-like structure. These results are in agreement with published TEM work on neutron irradiated material and again highlight a similarity between the two forms of radiation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also utilised and samples were analysed before and after irradiation. Contrary to XRD patterns of neutron irradiated graphite, there seemed to be little change in the XRD patterns after irradiation and the expected broadening and peak shift of the peak was not seen, suggesting a difference in the damage caused to the system. Further work is required here to understand why this is the case and again a deeper understanding of the underlying damage mechanisms would be beneficial...|$|E

The Prismatic Modular Reactor (PMR) {{is one of the}} major Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) concepts, which consists of hexagonal prismatic fuel blocks and reflector blocks made of <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> <b>graphite.</b> However, the shape of graphite blocks could be easily changed by neutron damage during the reactor operation and the shape change can make the gaps between the blocks inducing bypass flow. Two types of gap shape should be considered. The vertical gap and horizontal gap are called bypass gap and cross gap, respectively. The cross gap complicates flow field in reactor core by connecting coolant channel and bypass gap and it could lead to loss of effective coolant flow in fuel blocks. In this paper, cross flow experimental facility was constructed to investigate the cross flow phenomena in the core of the VHTR and the experiment was carried out under varying flow rates and gap sizes. The results of the experiments were compared with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis results. In order to apply the CFD code to the cross flow phenomena, the prediction capability of the CFD code was verified. Good agreement between experimental results and CFD predictions was observed and the characteristics of the cross flow was discussed in detail.

40|$|We {{recently}} reported that <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> in prostate cancer {{is subject to}} a strong confirmation bias induced by the tumor architecture. We now wondered whether a similar bias governs <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> in breast carcinoma. An unannounced test was performed at a pathology conference. Pathologists were asked to grade nuclei in a PowerPoint presentation. Circular high power fields of 27 invasive ductal carcinomas were shown, superimposed over low power background images of either tubule-rich or tubule-poor carcinomas. We found (a) that diagnostic reproducibility of <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades</b> was poor to moderate (weighed kappa values between 0. 07 and 0. 54, 27 cases, 44 graders), but (b) that <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades</b> were not affected by the tumor architecture. We speculate that the categorized grading in breast cancer, separating tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic figure counts in a combined three tier score, prevents the bias that architecture exerts on <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades</b> in less well-controlled situations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the reproducibility of the Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> system as well as its independent predictive value in a series of patients with conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: The authors selected 388 patients who had undergone surgical treatment for conventional RCC between 1986 and 2000. Pathology slides from the selected patients were reviewed by a single pathologist, who reassigned a Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> and assessed the presence of tumor necrosis. The pathologist was blinded to both the original pathologic diagnosis and follow-up data. The kappa statistic was used to evaluate concordance between original and reviewed <b>nuclear</b> <b>grades.</b> The log-rank test was used for univariate analyses, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The original Fuhrman <b>nuclear</b> <b>grade</b> was Grade 1 (G 1) in 111 patients (28. 6...|$|R

Aims: To evaluate different cytological <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> methods on fine needle aspirates of breast carcinomas and its correlation with histopathological <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> {{as well as with the}} immunocytochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and Methods: The smears from 30 cytologically proven cases of breast carcinoma were graded by - Nottingham&#x 2032;s modification of Scarff Bloom Richardson, Fisher&#x 2032;s modification of Black&#x 2032;s <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> and Robinson&#x 2032;s cytological grading methods. 18 cases were available for correlation with histology grading. Results: Robbinson&#x 2032;s cytological grading system was found to have the best correlation with histopathology grades (P < 0. 001) as well as ER (P = 0. 003) and PR (P = 0. 001) expression on smears. Conclusions: The Richardson&#x 2032;s cytology grading method is recommended for cytological <b>nuclear</b> <b>grading</b> along with ER / PR expression, without which the cytological diagnosis of breast carcinoma is incomplete...|$|R
