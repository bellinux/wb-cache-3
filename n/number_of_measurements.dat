60|$|There is, however, {{no doubt}} that the various races, when {{carefully}} compared and measured, differ much from each other,--as in the texture of the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body (2. A vast <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of Whites, Blacks, and Indians, are given in the 'Investigations in the Military and Anthropolog. Statistics of American Soldiers,' by B.A. Gould, 1869, pp. 298-358; 'On the capacity of the lungs,' p. 471. See also the numerous and valuable tables, by Dr. Weisbach, from the observations of Dr. Scherzer and Dr. Schwarz, in the 'Reise der Novara: Anthropolog. Theil,' 1867.), the capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even in the convolutions of the brain. (3. See, for instance, Mr. Marshall's account of the brain of a Bushwoman, in 'Philosophical Transactions,' 1864, p. 519.) But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of difference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual faculties. Every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the light-hearted, talkative negroes. There is a nearly similar contrast between the Malays and the Papuans (4. Wallace, 'The Malay Archipelago,' vol. ii. 1869, p. 178.), who live under the same physical conditions, and are separated from each other only by a narrow space of sea.|$|E
60|$|The great eagerness of {{the male}} has thus {{indirectly}} led to the much more frequent development of secondary sexual characters in the male than in the female. But the development of such characters will have been much aided, if the conclusion at which I arrived after studying domesticated animals, can be trusted, namely, that the male is more liable to vary than the female. I am aware {{how difficult it is}} to verify a conclusion of this kind. Some slight evidence, however, can be gained by comparing the two sexes in mankind, as man has been more carefully observed than any other animal. During the Novara Expedition[350] a vast <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of various parts of the body in different races were made, and the men were found in almost every case to present a greater range of variation than the women; but I shall have to recur to this subject in a future chapter. Mr. J. Wood,[351] who has carefully attended to the variation of the muscles in man, puts in italics the conclusion that “the greatest number of abnormalities in each subject is found in the males.” He had previously remarked that “altogether in 102 subjects the varieties of redundancy were found to be half as many again as in females, contrasting widely with the greater frequency of deficiency in females before described.” Professor Macalister like wise remarks[352] that variations in the muscles “are probably more common in males than females.” Certain muscles which are not normally present in mankind are also more frequently developed in the male than in the female sex, although exceptions to this rule are said to occur. Dr. Burt Wilder[353] has tabulated the cases of 152 individuals with supernumerary digits, of which 86 were males, and 39, or less than half, females; the remaining 27 being of unknown sex. It should not, however, be overlooked that women would more frequently endeavour to conceal a deformity of this kind than men. Whether the large proportional number of deaths {{of the male}} offspring of man and apparently of sheep, compared with the female offspring, before, during, and shortly after birth (see supplement), has any relation to a stronger tendency in the organs of the male to vary and thus to become abnormal in structure or function, I will not pretend to conjecture.|$|E

Von Nathusius, who has had very wide experience, is strongly of the same opinion. (22. 'Vortrage uber Viehzucht,' 1872, p. 63.)
