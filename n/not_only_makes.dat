5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
25|$|Ripened or aged raw pǔ'ěr has {{occasionally}} been mistakenly {{categorized as}} a subcategory of black tea {{due to the}} dark red color of its leaves and liquor. However, pǔ'ěr in both its ripened and aged forms has undergone secondary oxidization and fermentation caused both by organisms growing in the tea and free-radical oxidation, thus making it a unique type of tea. This divergence in production style <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> the flavor and texture of pu'er tea different but also results in a rather different chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} paper, the algorithm is presented more formally using a substitution style instead {{of side effects}} in the method above. In the latter form, the side effect invisibly takes care of all places where a type variable is used. Explicitly using substitutions <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> the algorithm hard to read, because the side effect occurs virtually everywhere, but also gives the false impression that the method might be costly. When implemented using purely functional means or {{for the purpose of}} proving the algorithm to be basically equivalent to the deduction system, full explicitness is of course needed and {{the original}} formulation a necessary refinement.|$|E

25|$|Bank vaults {{are built}} as custom orders. The vault {{is usually the}} first aspect of a new bank {{building}} to be designed and built. The manufacturing process begins with {{the design of the}} vault, {{and the rest of the}} bank is built around it. The vault manufacturer consults with the customer to determine factors such as the total vault size, desired shape, and location of the door. After the customer signs off on the design, the manufacturer configures the equipment to make the vault panels and door. The customer usually orders the vault to be delivered and installed. That is, the vault manufacturer <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> the vault parts, but brings the parts to the construction site and puts them together.|$|E
25|$|As Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) begins, Duke Leto Atreides {{finds himself}} in a {{dangerous}} position; the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has put him {{in control of the}} desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune, which is the only natural source of the all-important spice melange. The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant sandworms which protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap; failure to meet or exceed the production volume of their predecessors, the vicious House Harkonnen, will negatively affect the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits. Further, the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmering War of Assassins between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.|$|E

Later, as Moe is about to accept the deal— and share half of the money with Homer— Homer, unhinged by resentment, arrives at the tavern.

The small island nation's territorial position in the Persian Gulf <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> it a key contending regional power but also determines its geostrategic position as a buffer between the Arab World and Iran. Hence, the overlap in trolls and geostrategic implications aid in explaining international responses to the uprising in Bahrain.

What effect on identity formation is present if the adoptee knows they are adopted but has no information about their biological parents? Silverstein and Kaplan's research states that adoptees lacking medical, genetic, religious, and historical information are plagued by questions such as [...] "Who am I?" [...] "Why was I born?" [...] "What is my purpose?" [...] This lack of identity may lead adoptees, particularly in adolescent years, to seek out ways to belong in a more extreme fashion than many of their non-adopted peers. Adolescent adoptees are overrepresented among those who join sub-cultures, run away, become pregnant, or totally reject their families.|$|E

2500|$|Cost-effectiveness, however, is not Habitat for Humanity’s only concern, and {{additional}} benefits {{arise from the}} Habitat model that differentiate it from other low-cost housing. [...] For example, involving volunteers {{in the construction of}} houses <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> the homes more affordable, but it also builds community understanding, awareness and support for affordable housing and generates revenue for local Habitat organizations. [...] Focusing solely on cost effectiveness also does not address another important aspect—the education and training of the homebuyers. [...] Habitat’s homebuyers are also involved in the construction of their home and the homes of others in the program. Many Habitat organizations also provide training in budget management and other skills. [...] These requirements, known as “sweat equity,” teach low-income homebuyers valuable construction and other skills that help them to maintain their home over the long-term. [...] Another major aspect of Habitat’s program is Habitat’s revolving “Fund for Humanity.” [...] Habitat does not give homes away; rather, in addition to contributing sweat equity, Habitat homebuyers pay an affordable no-profit mortgage based on their ability to pay. [...] These mortgage payments are used to support building additional homes in partnership with low-income families, thus contributing to the sustainability of Habitat’s homebuilding program.|$|E
