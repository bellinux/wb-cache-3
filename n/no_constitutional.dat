5|$|In Faretta v. California (1975), the Court {{held that}} a {{criminal}} defendant {{has the right to}} knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se representation at trial. This right is not per se violated by the appointment of standby counsel. There is <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> right to self-representation on appeal.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued almost <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> {{criminal}} procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E

5|$|Voting in Singapore is compulsory. Any citizen above 21 {{years of}} age who is not disqualified by the factors in section 6 of the Parliamentary Elections Act is {{required}} to vote in person. There is <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> provision stipulating any qualifications for voters, and as the Act is an ordinary piece of legislation the disqualifying factors may be changed by a simple majority (more than 50%) of votes in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E

50|$|Australia has <b>no</b> strong <b>constitutional</b> {{prohibition}} on {{ex post facto}} laws, although narrowly retroactive laws might violate the constitutional separation of powers principle. Australian courts normally interpret statutes with a strong presumption {{that they do not}} apply retroactively.|$|R
5000|$|Rome had <b>no</b> single <b>constitutional</b> office, title or rank exactly {{equivalent}} to the English title [...] "Roman emperor". Romans of the Imperial era used several titles to denote their emperors, and all {{were associated with the}} pre-Imperial, Republican era.|$|R
5|$|The Convention met from February 3 – December 6, 1861, {{and elected}} John Janney its {{presiding}} officer. The majority at first voted {{to remain in}} the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. At first, the speeches were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists holding onto the patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful. On March 4, Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration day, Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. Willey from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech. He defended Virginia's institutions from Northern attacks against slavery, but “there is <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> right of secession...” He warned that secession would bring about war, taxes and the abolition of slavery in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of King George VI in 1952, the Duchess of Edinburgh {{inherited}} the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. Browning and his staff became redundant, as the Queen was now served by the large staff of the monarch. The domestic staff remained at Clarence House, where they continued to serve the Queen Mother. The remainder were reorganised as the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh, with Browning as treasurer, {{the head of the}} office, moving into a new and larger office at Buckingham Palace. Like the Duke they served, the office had <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> role, but followed his sporting, cultural and scientific interests. Browning became involved with the Cutty Sark Trust, set up to preserve the famous ship, and in the administration of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. In June 1953, Browning and Du Maurier attended the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
25|$|The seceding states seized {{numerous}} Federal properties {{within their}} boundaries, including buildings, arsenals, and fortifications. President James Buchanan protested but took no {{military action in}} response. Buchanan was concerned that an overt action could cause the remaining slave states to leave the Union, and while he acknowledged there was <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> authority for a state to secede, he could find <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> authority for him to act to prevent it.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} {{was created in}} 1907 by the Oklahoma Constitution.

25|$|The Sarkaria Commission {{held that}} presidents have unconstitutionally misused the {{provision}} of Article 356 many times for achieving political motives, by dismissing the state governments although there was <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> break down in the states. During 2005, President's rule was imposed in Bihar state, misusing Article 356 unconstitutionally to prevent the democratically elected state legislators to form a government after the state elections.|$|E
50|$|Florida {{statutes}} {{also provide}} {{the death penalty}} for capital drug trafficking and capital sexual battery, but {{the death penalty for}} the latter crime is <b>no</b> longer <b>constitutional</b> since the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy v. Louisiana. No one is on death row in the United States for drug trafficking.|$|R
50|$|Denmark has <b>no</b> {{specialised}} <b>constitutional</b> {{court and}} thus the question on the constitutionality of a law is to be contested before the ordinary courts.

50|$|In Denmark, all {{ordinary}} {{courts have}} original jurisdiction {{to hear all}} types of cases, including cases of a constitutional or administrative nature. As a result, there exists <b>no</b> special <b>constitutional</b> court, and therefore final jurisdiction is vested with the Danish Supreme Court (Højesteret) which was established 14 February 1661 by king Frederik III.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{defendant}} {{has the right}} to present mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase, the prosecution should be able to present aggravating evidence about the victim (Justice Stevens, in dissent, characterizes this argument as a non sequitur: {{the defendant}} has constitutional rights because he is on trial - the victim is not on trial and has <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> rights in the proceeding).|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the title}} of Deputy Prime Minister is used only occasionally, and confers <b>no</b> <b>constitutional</b> powers (in which it {{is similar to the}} pre-20th century usage of Prime Minister). The Deputy Prime Minister stands in when the Prime Minister is unavailable, most visibly at Prime minister's questions, and Prescott had {{attended}} various Heads of Government meetings on behalf of then Prime Minister Tony Blair.|$|E
25|$|The {{lieutenant}} governors {{are appointed}} by the Governor General of Canada {{on the advice of}} the prime minister.
