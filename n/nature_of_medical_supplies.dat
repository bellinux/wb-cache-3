40|$|We {{propose a}} {{stochastic}} optimization approach for the {{storage and distribution}} problem <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>supplies</b> {{to be used for}} disaster management under a wide variety of possible disaster types and magnitudes. In preparation for disasters, we develop a stochastic programming model to select the storage locations <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>supplies</b> and required inventory levels for each type <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>supply.</b> Our model captures the disaster specific information and possible effects of disasters through the use of disaster scenarios. Thus, we balance the preparedness and risk despite the uncertainties of disaster events. A benefit of this approach is that the subproblem can be used to suggest loading and routing of vehicles to transport <b>medical</b> <b>supplies</b> for disaster response, given the evaluation of up-to-date disaster field information. We present a case study of our stochastic optimization approach for disaster planning for earthquake scenarios in the Seattle area. Our modeling approach can aid interdisciplinary agencies to both prepare and respond to disasters by considering the risk in an efficient manner.
