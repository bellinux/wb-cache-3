40|$|Abstract—Association rules mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} topic in data mining. A new algorithm for mining association rules is proposed in this paper. In data mining, the process of counting any itemset`s support requires a great I/O and computing cost. An impacted bitmap technique to speed up the counting process is employed in this paper. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>saving</b> the intact bitmap usually has a big space requirement. In this algorithm, each bit vector is partitioned into some blocks, and hence every bit block is encoded as a shorter symbol. Therefore the original bitmap is impacted efficiently. And then the algorithm converts the origin transaction database to an Adjacent-Itemsets-lattice (which is a directed graph) in a preprocessing, where each itemset vertex has a label to represent its support. So we can change the complicated task of mining frequent itessets in the database to a simpler one of searching vertexes in this structure, which can speeds up greatly the mining process. At the end experimental and analytical results are presented...|$|E

This is despite little existing empirical {{evidence to prove}} their energy efficiency, especially in Canada. To overcome this limitation, the electricity and gas consumption quantities and costs of a sample of 10 conventional, 20 energy-retrofitted and three green Toronto schools following the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Rating (LEED) System for New Construction were analysed in this study. The analysis conducted over eight years for conventional and energy-retrofitted schools, and since their inception for green schools, showed surprisingly that energy-retrofitted and green schools spent 37 % more on electricity than conventional schools.

This may further stimulate the development of kit-type formulations of 68 Ga radiopharmaceuticals. In the case of 68 Ga-DOTATOC, the high labeling yield of[*]>[*] 95  % makes purification steps obsolete, and the formulation just diluted with saline followed by sterile filtration is ready for application. This would make 68 Ga-DOTATOC synthesis approaching the ease of 99 mTc-kit preparations. Moreover, those reaction protocols are easily to adopt on automated or semi-automated modules available for radiometal-based synthesis. The increased yield at shorter reaction periods and the avoiding of any additional purification step may cumulatively save 10  min or more until the 68 Ga-DOTATOC batch is ready for injection. This increases the real 68 Ga-DOTATOC activity available by about 10  % or more. Finally, there is another effect of rather economic value: an institution routinely performing 68 Ga-DOTATOC PET for neuroendocrine tumors may, depending on the frequency of batch synthesis, need e.g. 100  μg of DOTATOC each day. Within 100 working days, which maybe is the shelf-life of a 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator, this accumulates to 10  mg. <b>Nevertheless,</b> with <b>saving</b> the amount of DOTATOC, there comes a significant economic impact.|$|R

A deeper examination of the SAVE-data suggests that the PIH could still be compatible with fixed amount saving behaviour since (a) the transitory income component of fixed amount savers' tends to be relatively low and (b) one-off receipts of income likely to be transitory increase the probability of fi xed amount savers to alter their saving behaviour and save the residual.

40|$|Abstract. Opportunities for process {{integrated}} feedstock drying {{in connection}} with the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) from wet biomass via indirect gasification are investigated in this study. Drying is a very energy-intensive process step – corresponding to about 10 % of the dry fuel lower heating value for woody biomass. Process integrated drying offers opportunities for reducing the external energy supply necessary for drying, thereby improving the overall process efficiency. Simulation models for three drying technology options – air, steam and flue gas drying – have been developed using the flowsheeting software tool ASPEN Plus. The influence of basic operation parameters on the performance of the different drying configurations is investigated using sensitivity analysis. Based on a proposed SNG production process that is built as an extension of a fluidized bed boiler for a combined heat and power plant, the potential for heat integrated drying is assessed using pinch analysis in combination with the developed drying models.

A field measurement of an SWH for dormitory application was conducted by Lin et al. (2012). Results indicated that the thermal efficiency of the system was higher than 0.3 only when the daily solar radiation per square meter exceeds 7  MJ/m 2 (the Chinese National Standard 12558 -B 7277). Note that the maximum thermal efficiency was approximately 0.45 for the system. Since more than 98 % of SWHs have been installed in the residential sector, system design of larger-scale SWHs is a critical issue for most installers. Therefore, the expected energy savings over the lifespan of a system cannot be realized under the present purchase-based subsidy program.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{the share}} of {{renewable}} energy sources (RES) in the electricity generation mix has been expanding rapidly. However, limited predictability of the RES poses challenges for traditional scheduling and dispatching mechanisms based on unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch (ED). This paper presents an advanced UC-ED model to incorporate wind generators as RES-based units alongside conventional centralized generators. In the proposed UC-ED model, an imbalance cost is introduced reflecting the wind generation uncertainty along with the marginal generation cost. The proposed UC-ED model aims to utilize the flexibility of fleets of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to optimally compensate for the wind generation uncertainty. A case study with 15 conventional units and 3 wind farms along with a fixed-sized PEV fleet demonstrates that shifting of PEV fleets charging at times of high wind availability realizes generation cost <b>savings.</b> <b>Nevertheless,</b> the operational cost saving incurred by controlled charging appears to diminish when dispatched wind energy becomes considerably larger than the charging energy of PEV fleets. Further analysis of the results reveals that the effectiveness of PEV control strategy in terms of CO 2 emission reduction is strongly coupled with generation mix and the proposed control strategy is favored in cases where less pollutant-based plants like nuclear and hydro power are profoundly dominant...|$|R

FLD prediction is reported {{for a wide variety of}} metals [1] but literature about Zinc is nearly non existent. The studied Zinc sheets exhibit a highly anisotropic mechanical behaviour due to the hcp lattice structure and the inherited rolling texture. This anisotropic behaviour results in an anisotropic formability. The Zinc sheet FLD is influenced by the orientation of the rolling direction during the process. Experimental cross stamping of this material allows describing the studied material behaviour in a large range of mechanical solicitations from tensile to biaxial tension.

40|$|Background: During {{the latest}} decades, major changes have {{occurred}} within {{the sphere of}} the Swedish savings banks. New legislations demand increased capital adequacy regardless the type or size of the financial institutions that have to obey the new legislation. <b>Nevertheless,</b> European <b>savings</b> banks further developed {{the idea of the}} traditional savings bank and in some countries ousted the commercial banks. As the possibilities for development have differed among the countries and the Swedish savings banks have developed in different ways too. In order to face future changes in the local society, the traditional savings banks future is and needs to be discussed. Study: This study is based on one of the research proposals given by Olsson (2009); The local society’s influence on the performance of savings bank is discussed with Orusts Sparbank as main participant. Hence, a comparison is made with the modern savings bank Sparbanken Alingsås as well as the traditional savings bank on Tjörn is presented from the CEO, or former CEOs perspective. Connections to the traditional idea of the savings banks are discussed. Several changes are influencing the sphere of the savings banks. Therefore, the chosen savings banks and their beliefs about the nearest future are discussed. Method: Qualitative approach is chosen and implemented through the service management system. To determine possible financial influences from the local society among the chosen savings banks, the rectangular model is used. Conclusion: Through the conference `Days of growth´ and interviews with CEOs, it is revealed that the savings banks today address the traditional ideas of the savings banks but in different ways. Moreover do the savings bank strives to find new options to develop in directions that strengthen the knowledge of how the idea of the traditional savings banks should be interpreted.

A discrete event simulation model was constructed to represent the flow of patients with stroke in Spain. ResultsIf 10 % of patients with stroke from 2000 to 2015 would receive thrombolytic treatment, the prevalence of dependent patients in 2015 would decrease from 149, 953 to 145, 922.

This study evaluates the integration of electric vehicles in the Italian energy scenario, assessing the impact on power generation capacity, energy consumption, CO 2 emissions on a medium-long term perspective (up to 2030 – 2050), {{with the support of the}} EnergyPLAN software tool. The national energy system has been accurately characterized using currently available data and its operation has been simulated with varying degrees of electric vehicle penetration through an integrated analysis method. The energy scenarios developed take into account realistic growth trends for variable renewable energy sources. The results obtained assess the potential impact of electric vehicles in cutting transport carbon emissions and highlight potential sensible primary energy <b>savings.</b> <b>Nevertheless,</b> the analysis also reveals that an increase in electric vehicle penetration does not necessarily correlate directly to a growth in generation from renewable energy sources, because electric vehicle recharging strategies, and in particular the time of day when most {{vehicles are}} recharged, influence which power plants are mostly used to cover the additional electric energy needs...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} are commonly considered the primary determinant of consumers’ choices about energy use for heating. Besides, current regulations {{on the matter}} focus on the physical characteristics of the buildings, relying on a strict relationship between efficiency and <b>savings.</b> <b>Nevertheless,</b> the literature shows that energy demand determinants are difficult to be estimated with the accuracy required for predictive purposes, while the energy savings stemming from efficiency gains are partly outweighed by the consumers’ behavior. We deal with these issues by analyzing spatial series data of natural gas consumptions for space heating and hot water production in the residential sector. The regression analysis takes four fields of covariates into account: climate, building characteristics, market aspects, and technological development. The estimation process {{is based on the}} following cornerstones: a spatially lagged dependent variable {{to deal with the problem}} of spatial autocorrelation, linear and logarithmic functional forms, and a two-stage interpolation strategy that is meant to provide unbiased estimates of both the dispersion matrix and the t-statistics by combining Ordinary Least Squares and Weighted Least Squares. The models turn out to be well specified, and their explanatory power is high, so the results are suitable for demand forecasting. Although the spatial autoregressive term does not appear among the significant regressors, we show that space does matter in shaping the natural gas consumption in different regions. Our analysis proves that heating gas demand is characterized by a positive elasticity to income. We use these results to provide estimates of the rebound effect. Nevertheless, the additional consumption directly attributable to an income effect is of moderate magnitude when the gas price does not vary...|$|R
