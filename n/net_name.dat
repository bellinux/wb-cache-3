50|$|The netlist is then resorted, by <b>net</b> <b>name,</b> so {{that all}} the pins of each net are together. The next program reorders the pins in each net to shorten the wires.

When high currents are needed, wire sizes can be halved (or standard digital wires sizes can be used for higher currents) by routing the nets as circles, rather than sequences. Some high-speed signals need the driver on one end and a resistor on the other to absorb reflections.|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of asynchronous circuits is inherently complex for two different aspects. Firstly, the required cumbersome theoretical analysis introduces restrictive correctness conditions that complicate the synthesis process.
