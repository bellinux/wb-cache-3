5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters.

5|$|As {{with many}} people of Scots descent who sought {{adventure}} and success at that time, Tod joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He left England for India in 1799 {{and in doing so}} followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although Tod senior had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Company but had instead owned an indigo plantation at Mirzapur. The young Tod journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon patronage. He was appointed lieutenant in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting {{as a member of the}} escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and Resident to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of captain and was commanding the escort.|$|E

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E

While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved.

25|$|The {{road from}} Parowan {{northeast}} through Paragonah and southwest through Summit {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1910, and in the 1920s it became part of SR-1 and US-91. In 1968, with the construction of I-15 in the area imminent, SR-1 was moved to the proposed bypass, and the old route of SR-1 became State Route 38 (I-15 near Summit to Center Street in Parowan), SR-143 (Center Street to near 500 North in Parowan, and then continuing to I-15), and State Route 76 (near 500 North in Parowan to I-15 near Paragonah). However, the state legislature did not concur with the latter, and the old road through Paragonah was maintained only until I-15 was completed. Construction of I-15 was finished by 1975, and included a second Parowan interchange that had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1968 plans. SR-143 was rerouted to turn south on SR-38 (old SR-1) in Parowan and west on 200 South to the new interchange, and the remainder of SR-38 was removed from the state highway system. (The 1968 extension of SR-143 was redesignated SR-274.) The road from Parowan through Paragonah to I-15 was restored to the state highway system in 1978 as SR-271.|$|E

500|$|The warm {{reception}} {{accorded to}} Messiah in Dublin was not repeated in London when Handel introduced {{the work at}} the Covent Garden theatre on 23 March 1743. Avoglio and Cibber were again the chief soloists; {{they were joined by}} the tenor John Beard, a veteran of Handel's operas, the bass Thomas Rheinhold and two other sopranos, Kitty Clive and Miss Edwards. [...] The first performance was overshadowed by views expressed in the press that the work's subject matter was too exalted to be performed in a theatre, particularly by secular singer-actresses such as Cibber and Clive. In an attempt to deflect such sensibilities, in London Handel had avoided the name Messiah and presented the work as the [...] "New Sacred Oratorio". As was his custom, Handel rearranged the music to suit his singers. He wrote a new setting of [...] "And lo, the angel of the Lord" [...] for Clive, never used subsequently. He added a tenor song for Beard: [...] "Their sound is gone out", which had appeared in Jennens's original libretto but had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dublin performances.|$|E

Three days after the spill more than 650 workers and 17 boats were cleaning the shoreline, gathering up an oily water mixture from the ocean, and hauling away more than [...] of oil-contaminated soil, sand and vegetation from the coastal bluff. A month after the spill, efforts continued to clean the [...] portion of shoreline that was most heavily damaged. The sandstone cliff face along with large boulders that were splashed by the oil {{coming out of the}} culvert were difficult to clean.

Before dawn on 12 January, Task Group 38.5 launched aircraft to search for Japanese ships in the Cam Ranh Bay area. The crews of these aircraft radioed back the location of Japanese ships, and conducted an intensive search for the two Ise-class battleships and any other capital ships.

500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. You can work in training, you can stay behind, you have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side and that tells you everything you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011.

Women's hockey had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> programme when Nagano, Japan had won the right to host the Olympics, and the decision required approval by the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee (NAOOC). The NAOOC was initially hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament and because they felt their team, which had failed to qualify for that year's World Championships, could not be competitive. According to Glynis Peters, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association's (CAHA) head of female hockey, [...] "the Japanese would have to finance an entirely new sports operation to bring their team up to Olympic standards in six years, which they were also really reluctant to do." [...] In November 1992, the NWOOC and IOC Coordination Committee reached an agreement to include a women's ice hockey tournament in the programme. Part of the agreement was that the tournament would be limited to six teams, and no additional facilities would be built. The CAHA also agreed to help build and train the Japanese team so that it could be more competitive. The IOC had agreed that if the NAOOC had not approved the event, it would be held at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The format of the first tournament was similar to the men's: preliminary round-robin games followed by a medal round playoff.|$|E
