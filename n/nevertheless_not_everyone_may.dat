40|$|Although {{the risk}} of diphyllobothriasis is {{generally}} low in Canada, fish tapeworm infections seem to have become more frequent in recent years.

30|$|Character {{strengths}} {{are defined}} by Brdar and Kashdan (2010) as “pre-existing qualities that arise naturally, feel authentic, are intrinsically motivating to use and energizing.” (p. 151). Strengths of character are different to abilities and talents (such as intelligence, sporting prowess, music ability, or artistic ability). <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>may</b> be high on talent, but everyone has character. It is important to stress that a character strength is different to a talent (Seligman 2002). A young musician may {{have a very good}} ear and the ability to mimic others (talent), but lack the character strengths such as curiosity, love of learning, and persistence to develop skills in sight reading. Research has shown that the character strengths model has been a successful learning tool in other academic disciplines such as Arts, Language (Seligman et al. 2005), English Literature (Barbieri et al. 2013), and Personal Development curriculum (Madden et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|A: When visiting Prague {{one would}} not miss to cross the Charles Bridge. This Czech jewel older than 700 years connects “the Old Town“ and “the Lesser Town“. It is {{approximately}} 516 meters long and 9. 5 meters wide. The bridge is formed by sixteen arcs and three towers situated {{on both sides of}} the bridge. Thirty baroque statues and sculptural groups are placed along the entire length of the bridge. However, not only these stony gentlemen create such charming character of the bridge. Apart from painters and artists, selling their paintings and products, there are five “artistic pitches“ for buskers on the bridge. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> is allowed to perform. The buskers have to be chosen first by a special jury. The bridge is administrated by “The Charles Bridge Artists Association“ which selects the performers. This poster aims to examine these audition processes in more detail. It also discusses some possible advantages and disadvantages which busking brings to this place, supported by testimonies of buskers themselves. They are also introduced more closely as representatives of the art which has always had its special place in the territory of this important site of Czech cultural heritage...|$|R
5000|$|Many of the South Korean {{children}} adopted internationally, {{grew up in}} white, upper or middle-class homes. In {{the beginning}} adoptive families were often told by agencies and social workers to assimilate their children and make {{them as much as}} possible a part of the new culture, thinking that this would override concerns about ethnic identity and origin. Many Korean adoptees grew up not knowing about other children like themselves. This has changed in recent years with social services now encouraging parents and using home studies to encourage prospective adoptive parents to learn about the cultural influences of the country. With such works as [...] "Beyond Culture Camp" [...] which encourage the teaching of culture, there has been a large shift. Though, these materials <b>may</b> be given, <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>may</b> take advantage of them. Also, adoption agencies started to allow the adoption of South Koreans by people of color in the late 1990s to early 2000, and not just white people, including Korean-Americans. Such an example of this is the rapper GOWE, who is a Korean adopted into a Chinese family.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of Kandinsky's later works such 'On white' {{can be seen}} in Rothe's graphic series, though each individual work carries an after taste of morbidity and violent sex, some being more explicit than others. Hence, <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>may</b> feel drawn to the aesthetic expression of his graphics or understand the meaning and thought that lye underneath each of them. Nonetheless, although his graphics instigate a feeling of unease, as if he is in fact touching underneath our skins, showcasing or posing abstract connotations of our reproductive organs, he enables dialogue, revealing that topics such as sex and death are still taboo. The shapes and figures that one can find in his graphic art might allow one to feel that Utz Rothe does indeed carry a fascination with the sciences and our anatomic system, as one of his critiques has suggested. More importantly, in any form of art one should let oneself be intrigued, inspired, and allow oneself to immerse within an artists work. Rothe might just be the kind of artist who knows how to expose your inner reflection in a mirror allowing yourself to be acquainted with that something about yourself that you might not have wished to know.|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{failure mode}} of concrete members reinforced with fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars is flexural, due to either concrete crushing or FRP rupture. Many design tools {{have been developed}} for the flexural design of FRP-reinforced concrete. These tools are sufficiently accurate, but an iterative procedure is required when dealing with flexural failure due to FRP rupture. In addition, {{despite the fact that the}} design concepts involved are similar to those used for conventional steel-reinforced concrete, the changes in the design philosophy and the linear behaviour up to rupture of the FRP bars lead to the sectional properties having a different influence on the design, which <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>may</b> be familiar with. Therefore, this study proposes a general methodology for evaluating the design flexural capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete sections. This methodology is based on the design provisions of Eurocode 2 and comprises non-dimensional, closed-form equations, derived independently of the concrete and FRP characteristics. The proposed methodology can be used to derive universal dimensionless design charts as well as tables. The accuracy of the proposed design tools has been verified by comparing the predictions with the experimental results of 98 beams, which are available in the published literatureThe authors acknowledge the support provided by the Spanish government (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion), project BIA 2010 - 20234 -C 03 - 0...|$|R
40|$|Copying {{permitted}} {{for use of}} PLoP 98 This pattern language digs step by {{step into}} {{the design of a}} user interface architecture. I do not mean the layout of a user interface. This is a matter of ergonomics and bears enough potential to form a complete set of pattern languages on its own. If you are interested in these issues, refer to books such as [Tog 92], [Coo 95], or [Col 95]. Instead, this paper is about the software that drives the user interface. The figure below shows the overall landscape of the pattern language. It starts with the most fundamental pattern, the User Interface Layer. Two patterns describe the architecture of this layer: Separate Transformation explains how to deal with complex interactions while Widget Model helps to structure presentation. Though both patterns seem to describe different philosophies, they are often combined to form the basic architecture of the User Interface Layer. Still you need to deal with more issues. At first you have to provide Context Support between different interactions of the user. Depending on the requirements and architecture of your system you can apply several patterns for this. For the sake of brevity this document contains only thumbnails of them. Another area of interest concerns Domain Layer Access, which again lays the foundation of several other patterns. While some of them are well-known design patterns, others are special to user interfaces. This set of patterns forms the coarse landscape of most architectures around.

40|$|Objective: {{to measure}} a {{health-related}} {{quality of life}} in a way that reflects salient features of health as perceived by a representative sample of the adult population of the UK. Choosing a descriptive system: with data from a survey of 600 people in the West Midlands, we appraised 6 existing ways of measuring health-related quality of life and chose EuroQol. Choosing a valuation method: Phase I: two direct methods (Time Trade-Off [TTO]) and Magnitude Estimation [ME]) and two indirect ones (Pairwise Comparison and Category Rating [CR]) were studied. A survey of almost 300 subjects in the City of York led us to discard ME in favour of TTO. Choosing a valuation method: Phase II: {{in the early stages of}} Phase II we tested TTO against SG on a within-subject basis. Our findings were that there was little to choose between them, but TTO had more complex data and more consistent valuations at individual level. The main survey: 1993 pilots: the first pilot indicated that respondents could not handle more than 15 states. The second was a “full dress rehearsal” for the main survey. The main survey: design and execution: each interview consisted of: self-reported health; ranking of states; VAS rating of states; TTO rating of states; personal data. The main fieldwork was conducted in late 1993. The main survey: results: 3395 interviews were achieved, a response rate of 64 %, The data on self-reported health showed that problems generally increase with age, and within every age group, by social class too. With the VAS, median scores were all positive (i. e. every date was rated as better than being dead by a majority of respondents). Higher median scores were given by the lower social classes and by the less educated, meaning that they do not think that poorer health states are as bad as the others do. With the TTO far more states were rated worse than being dead. There were some differences between men and women, and also according to marital status and employment status, but the most marked effect was age. AT retest all 3 methods proved very reliable at both group and individual levels. The main survey: modelling the “tariff”: to interpolate values for the remaining 200 EuroQol states from the 45 on which we had direct valuations, the preferred model (known as “Dolan-N 3 ”) predicts the value of a health state from its components by attaching a (negative) value to each separate deviation from good health. Our basic tariff, for use when a weighting system is required for use in an economic evaluation, is the one of mean values based on the individual TTO scores. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>may</b> wish to use this basic tariff, though we recommend for comparative purposes that even if another one of preferred, the basic one is used too. The next phase: the main future activity of the MVH Group is going to be the implementation of the benefit measures we have already generated. This is our next challenge.

40|$|Stories matter. That simple {{statement}} {{is at the}} heart of the now decades-old struggle between the 2 ̆ 2 Old 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 New 2 ̆ 2 Western histories. The stories people hear about their pasts contribute to the construction of both personal and collective identities. In other words, what we believe about who we are is, to a significant extent, determined by the stories we are told about where we came from. The dominant story of the past two centuries in American history has been the tale of the frontier-for most Americans, the 2 ̆ 2 winning 2 ̆ 2 of the West. It has become the creation myth of the United States. In Something in the Soil, Patricia Nelson Limerick continues her crusade, begun in The Legacy of Conquest (1987), to change this national mythology. Something in the Soil is a collection of essays, most of which (eleven of sixteen, by my count) have previously appeared elsewhere. Like all such collections, the book struggles to hold its various topics in one thematic grip. Limerick has divided the work into five parts with such titles as 2 ̆ 2 Forgetting and Remembering 2 ̆ 2 (part 1), 2 ̆ 2 Beleaguered Great White Men 2 ̆ 2 (part 2), and 2 ̆ 2 The Historian As Dreamer: Preaching to (and by) the Half-Converted 2 ̆ 2 (part 4). Each contains three or four separate essays loosely linked by brief prefatory remarks. The five sections together are preceded by an introduction in which Limerick explains her goal for the collection-to 2 ̆ 2 provide a more-grounded and down-to-earth version of the history of the American West. 2 ̆ 2 But, in all honesty, she wants to do much more than this. The overwhelming tone of the book is one of bemused frustration. Limerick doesn 2 ̆ 7 t just want to offer a more realistic version of history; she wants to construct a new mythology, a new master narrative of the American West. And the fact that she has not, despite more than a decade of trying, managed to disabuse Americans of the old mythology of the frontier, in which the good guys and bad guys were well-defined and open to limited interpretation, haunts her, it seems. There is a Quixotic feel to this collection; the reader emerges from the final full-length essay, the well-known 2 ̆ 2 Dancing With Professors, 2 ̆ 2 wondering if Limerick hasn 2 ̆ 7 t spent enough time tilting at her Turnerian windmills, enough time growing more frustrated as her large and varied audiences repeatedly exhibit their unwillingness to give up the old stories. Each and every essay in this collection is great reading. As anyone who has ever read her knows, Limerick tells fascinating stories. She is, as the dust cover blurb claims, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 irreverent, enlightening, and always witty. 2 ̆ 2 Without a doubt, she has done more than anyone else in the field of American Western history to change the way the tales are told, the mythologies constructed. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>may</b> be listening, but Limerick should find some solace in having inspired a new generation of scholars to continue the quest, to keep challenging those old stories that have mattered so much to so many for so long...|$|R
