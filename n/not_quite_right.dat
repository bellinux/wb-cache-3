5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the real}} Seymour Skinner, Keeler remarked, [...] "It {{would have been}} easy to make him a really horrible, nasty, dislikeable guy, but we didn't do that. We made him just <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> not quite Skinner, and a little bit off." [...] Bill Oakley said the idea behind the {{character}} was that he [...] "just lacked pizzazz". The producers selected Martin Sheen to voice the character because they admired his performance in Apocalypse Now and felt his voice would be appropriate for a Vietnam veteran.|$|E
500|$|Heavy tanks {{have high}} attack and defense with {{moderate}} speed and low range. Missile tanks have moderate attack and defense with moderate range and low speed. [...] G.E.V.s ("ground effect vehicles"—roughly, heavily armored hovercraft) have very high speed (moving twice per turn), low attack, low range, and moderate defense. [...] Howitzers have very high attack and range but are easily destroyed (once an attacker {{has managed to}} get close enough), immobile, and expensive. However, according to the game's designer, this balanced mix of units was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> in the first edition; the second edition sped up heavy tanks, slowed down G.E.V.s, and changed the defender's purchasing from [...] "attack factors" [...] to [...] "armor units" [...] (everything is considered equivalent, except howitzers, which are worth two of anything else).|$|E

6000|$|... "It does <b>not</b> look <b>quite</b> the <b>right</b> color," [...] said Aunt Keziah, as {{she took}} the cup in her hand. [...] "You must have dropped some soot into it." [...] Then, as she raised it to her lips, [...] "It does <b>not</b> smell <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b> But, woe's me! how can I expect anybody but myself to make this {{precious}} drink as it should be?" ...|$|R
500|$|The shot of Dr. Secare {{resurfacing}} out of {{the water}} was created by the visual effects unit. Actor Simon Webb was raised up on a crane under the water, which had been levered so that he could [...] "actually" [...] be raised {{out of the}} bay. According to Goodwin, the timing was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> but that failed shot [...] "worked" [...] on a different level and proved to be a [...] "fascinating shot". The scene had to be re-shot later, however. When filming the episode the production crew did not know that Webb had a phobia towards water. The first test shot of Scully removing the alien fetus doll from liquid nitrogen went right, but under the hot studio lights the model started falling apart, leading the following take to flash the lighting in another direction.|$|E
500|$|Writer Michael Michaelian {{originally}} {{pitched a}} story idea based on andropause, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "male menopause". He wrote a treatment and first draft script involving reverse aging. D. C. Fontana later explained that the terrorist MacGuffin (an ambiguous but central plot point) was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b> Fontana was brought in to overhaul the ending, and explained that a [...] "lot of what I put in at the end was also in Michael's story and drafts, but approached with a different emphasis". One significant alteration she made was to change the plot from involving actual terrorists to a trap that the crew must defuse. The original ending also had the two opposing parties on the planet sit down for peace talks with Jameson surviving the effects of the de-aging drugs. He would have been reduced in age to fourteen and could no longer remember his wife.|$|E
500|$|The script {{comments}} cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at {{one point}} a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only [...] "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> for [...] "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't [...] "look like him at all", and Lennon saying to himself that [...] "she looks more like him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: [...] "Uh, no, I'm a mocker", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a [...] "clean old man" [...] sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a [...] "dirty old man".|$|E

60|$|Henry {{had some}} secret {{feeling that he}} had <b>not</b> done <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> in the transaction, {{though he did not}} know exactly how he had done wrong. He did not make any reply to Rollo's charge, but stood back, looking {{somewhat}} confused.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty! I don't {{call her}} pretty," [...] said Miss Layard; [...] "she has fine eyes, that is all, {{and they do}} <b>not</b> look <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b> What an {{extraordinary}} garment she had on, too; it might {{have come out of}} Noah's Ark." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> about this show's approach to homosexuality... It {{has everything to}} do with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device to give him the moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo". Some reviewers were also skeptical about the future of the show. [...] One such review said, [...] "If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little [...] — that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's a doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the detail}} is <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> but Gough's {{physical}} {{description of the}} minister {{seems to be the}} only one extant. Later they ventured further north and stayed [...] at West Felton with Samuel Hildersham and his wife Mary. He was a Puritan writer, the son of Arthur Hildersham, and had been a leading figure in the second classis: they had the use of his substantial library for several months.|$|E
2500|$|Coherent {{demodulation}} of [...] {{to recover}} [...] {{is the same}} as AM: multiply by [...] and lowpass to remove the [...] "double-frequency" [...] components around frequency [...] [...] If the demodulating carrier is not in the correct phase (cosine phase here), then the demodulated signal will be some linear combination of [...] and , which is usually acceptable in voice communications (if the demodulation carrier frequency is <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> the phase will be drifting cyclically, which again is usually acceptable in voice communications if the frequency error is small enough, and amateur radio operators are sometimes tolerant of even larger frequency errors that cause unnatural-sounding pitch shifting effects).|$|E
6000|$|... [48] I say modern, because Titian's quiet way of {{blending}} colors, [...] {{which is}} the perfectly right one, is not understood now by any [...] artist. The best color we reach is got by stippling; but this is <b>not</b> [...] <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In the 10th grade, Morris {{attended}} The Putney School, {{a boarding}} school in Vermont. He began playing the cello, spending a summer in France studying music under the acclaimed Nadia Boulanger, who also taught Morris's future collaborator Philip Glass. Describing Morris as a teenager, Mark Singer wrote that he [...] "read with a passion the forty-odd Oz books, watched a lot of television, and {{on a regular basis}} went with a doting but <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> maiden aunt ('I guess you'd have to say that Aunt Roz was somewhat demented') to Saturday matinées, where he saw such films as This Island Earth and Creature from the Black Lagoon — horror movies that, viewed again 30 years later, still seem scary to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Presley {{performed}} the song {{on national television}} three times in 1956. The first was February 11 on Stage Show. He also performed it again on his third appearance on Stage Show on March 17, and again on the Milton Berle Show on April 3. On July 1, Steve Allen introduced Presley on The Steve Allen Show, and Presley, dressed in formal evening wear, said, [...] "I think that I have on something tonight that's <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> for evening wear." [...] Allen asked, [...] "What's that, Elvis?" [...] "Blue suede shoes" [...] was the answer, as he lifted his left foot to show the audience. Presley mentioned blue suede shoes a second time on this show: in a song during the [...] "Range Roundup" [...] comedy skit with Allen, Andy Griffith, and Imogene Coca, he delivered the line, [...] "I'm a-warnin' you galoots, don't step on my blue suede shoes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Callas's vocal registers, however, {{were not}} {{seamlessly}} joined; Walter Legge writes, [...] "Unfortunately, {{it was only}} in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill." [...] Rodolfo Celletti states, In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would {{go so far as to}} say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> as though the voice were not functioning properly.|$|E
60|$|This did <b>not</b> seem <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> to Dot, {{but she did}} {{not know}} how to reply; and to add to her confusion, the candy man {{suddenly}} held up his left hand, which he had placed behind him as he talked, and showed her that his thumb and two of the fingers were missing.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good to me," [...] she said confusedly; [...] "but I am afraid it might <b>not</b> be <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> in me to borrow money of a stranger, however little it may be. And, even if I did venture, how am I----?" [...] She looked at me shyly, and shrank from {{finishing}} the sentence.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} saw {{an umbrella}} behind the door, {{and they thought}} they would go both together, and they actually laid down their book, spread the umbrella, {{and went to the}} door.

5000|$|Nodding back {{to women}} of the early Web who broadcasted {{continuous}} media accounts of themselves, such as Jennifer Ringley and Ana Voog, younger artists like Soda extend their forebears’ concerns for performing their gendered bodies online in a prolonged performance towards a critique of mainstream media representations of women. ... Soda offers up relentless, linked-in imagery of herself that does <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> sit <b>right</b> - does not pass for normative or conventional.|$|R
50|$|Both {{parents of}} {{children}} with autism and adults on the autism spectrum continue to wait for long periods between when they first have concerns that something may <b>not</b> be <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> and when they eventually receive a final diagnosis. This period of waiting often leads to worry, doubt and frustration, and may mean key opportunities for intervention are missed. With more research they can help improve practitioner knowledge and reduce the average age of diagnosis.|$|R
