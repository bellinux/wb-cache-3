We investigated (a) {{the influence of the}} bike-run transition on <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> of running (i. e. does cycling have a direct effect on running?), (b) the effect of altered <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> on run-economy (RE, steady-state V 02), (c) the association between exercise-related-leg-pain (ERLP) and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> of running, (d) the role of fatigue in coordination changes, and (e) the effectiveness of taping as an intervention for impaired <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination.</b> 34 highly trained triathletes participated. Three-dimensional kinematics, muscle recruitment and RE were compared between a control-run (no prior exercise) and a 30 -min transition-run (preceded by 20 min of moderate-intensity cycling; i. e. run vs. cycle-run). Fatigue was evaluated using an established isometric protocol. <b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> was compared between transition-runs with and without augmented-low-Dye anti-pronation-taping applied. Short periods of cycling had no direct effect on running kinematics or muscle activity in most (− 70 %) highly trained triathletes. However, running muscle activity was influenced by cycling in a proportion (− 30 %) of highly trained triathletes (70. 1 ± 13. 7 % change in mean EMG amplitude). This influence was not related to altered kinematics or fatigue, but instead was a direct effect of cycling on motor commands for running. This altered muscle recruitment was associated with reduced RE (3. 7 ± 0. 9 % increase in V 02) and 2. 5 -times greater likelihood of a history of ERLP, but was improved by an established taping intervention (70. 5 ± 18. 6 % reversal of altered muscle recruitment) ...|$|E

The {{aim was to}} determine the efficacy of mastication training in Duchenne {{muscular dystrophy}} using chewing gum for 4 weeks. In all, 17 patients and 17 healthy age-matched males participated. The masticatory performance was assessed using a mixing ability test and measuring anterior bite force before, shortly after and 1 month after the training. In the patient group the masticatory performance improved and remained after 1 -month follow-up, no significant changes in anterior maximum bite force was observed after mastication training. In the healthy subject the bite force increased and remained at the 1 -month follow-up; no significant differences in masticatory performance were observed. Mastication training by using sugar-free chewing gum in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients improved their masticatory performance. Since bite force did not improve, the working mechanism of the improvement in chewing may relate to changes of the <b>neuromuscular</b> function and <b>coordination,</b> resulting in improvement of skills in performing mastication...|$|R
40|$|To predict neuromuscular disorders, we are {{interested}} in monitoring upper limb movements continuously using wearable sensors. Shoulder muscle coordination is complex and for those with <b>neuromuscular</b> disorders, this <b>coordination</b> often fails. As monitoring the entire kinematics of the shoulder complex is nearly impossible to do continuously, we propose to simply track the humerus and clavicle angles using wearable and portable sensors as a way to continuously monitor and/or predict neuromuscular disorders. For healthy subjects, we found that the relationship between the elevation angles of the humerus and the clavicle are correlated with second order polynomials. Furthermore, this relationship is consistent for a given individual and is repeatable. Although the fits obtained differ slightly from subject to subject, the general shape of the fit is consistent across different individuals. Knowing the relationship between the elevation angles of the humerus and the clavicle for healthy shoulder movement, we will be able continuously to identify abnormal shoulder movements while patients participate in everyday activities...|$|R

40|$|NoUnilateral lower-limb amputees {{lead with}} their intact limb when {{stepping}} up {{and with their}} prosthesis when stepping down; the gait initiation process for the different stepping directions has not previously been investigated. Ten unilateral amputees (5 transfemoral and 5 transtibial) and 8 able-bodied controls performed single steps up and single steps down {{to a new level}} (73 and 219 mm). Duration, a-p and m-l centre of mass and centre of pressure peak displacements and centre of mass peak velocity of the anticipatory postural adjustment and step execution phase were evaluated for each stepping direction by analysing data collected using a Vicon 3 D motion analysis system. There were significant differences (in the phase duration, peak a-p and m-l centre of pressure displacement and peak a-p and m-l centre of mass velocity at heel-off and at foot-contact) between both amputee sub-groups and controls (P< 0. 05), but not between amputee sub-groups. These group differences were mainly a result of amputees adopting a different gait initiation strategy for each stepping direction. Findings indicate the gait initiation process utilised by lower-limb amputees was dependent on the direction of stepping and more particularly by which limb the amputee led with; this suggests that the balance and postural control of gait initiation is not governed by a fixed motor program, and thus that becoming an amputee will require time and training to develop alternative <b>neuromuscular</b> control and <b>coordination</b> strategies.

40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{the manner in}} which self-selected movement frequencies are impacted upon by repeated engagement in an intralimb coordination task and by alterations in the inertial characteristics of the limb. Twelve healthy adult volunteers rhythmically flexed and extended their elbow and wrist joints at a comfortable self-established frequency in 1 of 2 modes of coordination (in-phase and antiphase), while grasping 1 of 3 weighted dowels (no-weight condition [0. 03 kg], light weight condition [0. 5 kg], heavy weight condition [1. 0 kg]). The movement frequencies adopted by subjects on the 3 rd of 3 weekly sessions, following more than 120 experimental trials, were appreciably higher than those obtained during an initial session. The addition of mass to the system had an inconsistent influence upon the preferred frequency of movement. When subjects 2 ̆ 7 limbs were loaded with what was deemed to be a light weight (0. 5 kg), the movement frequencies that were adopted were indistinguishable from those selected when there was no (0. 03 kg) loading of the limbs. Ln contrast, when subjects 2 ̆ 7 limbs were loaded with a relatively heavy weight (1 kg), the resulting self-selected movement frequencies were reliably lower than when there was no loading of the limbs. The adopted frequency of movement was also influenced in a reliable fashion by the mode of coordination in which the movements were prepared.

A comprehensive search of electronic databases and reference lists using keywords relating to neuromuscular control and LE was undertaken. Studies that investigated electromyography (EMG) measures of forearm muscles in individuals with symptoms of LE were included if the study involved comparison with pain-free controls. The Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument {{was used to assess}} study quality. Data extracted from each study were used to calculate the standardised mean difference and 95  % confidence intervals to investigate differences between groups. The search revealed a total of 1920 studies, of which seven were included from 44 that underwent detailed review. Due to differences in outcome measures and tasks assessed, meta-analysis was not possible. The seven included studies used 60 different EMG outcomes, of which 16 (27  %) revealed significant differences between groups. Two were properties of motor unit potentials during wrist extension. Four were measures of increased time between recruitment of wrist extensor muscles and onset of grip force. Seven were measures of amplitude of EMG during tennis strokes. Three were measures of motor cortex organisation. Features of neuromuscular control differ between individuals with LE and pain-free controls.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} a) {{the influence}} of the bike-run transition on <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> of running (i. e. does cycling have a direct effect on running?), b) the effect of altered <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> on run economy (RE - steady-state V 02), c) the association between a history of exercise-related leg pain (ERLP) and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination,</b> and d) the role of fatigue in coordination changes. METHOD: 27 highly trained triathletes participated. 3 -D pelvic and lower limb kinematics and leg muscle recruitment were compared between a control-run (no prior exercise) and a 30 min transition-run (preceded by only 20 min of cycling; i. e. run vs. cycle-run). RESULTS: Kinematics were not different between control and transition-runs. Muscle recruitment was different in 5 of 17 triathletes without injury history; altered muscle recruitment during the transition-run was more similar to recruitment used during cycling. Altered muscle recruitment was associated with a 3. 7 (CI 0. 9 %) increase in VO 2. Muscle recruitment was altered in 7 of 10 triathletes with a history of ERLP. Altered muscle recruitment was not associated with indicators of fatigue from myoelectric and force data. CONCLUSION: Short periods of cycling have no direct effect on running kinematics or muscle activity in most highly trained triathletes. However, running muscle activity is influenced by cycling in a proportion of highly trained triathletes. This influence is not related to altered kinematics or fatigue, but instead appears to be a direct effect of cycling on motor commands for running.

40|$|Swanik, CharlesFunctional joint {{instability}} {{following an}} {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) sprain {{can lead to a}} secondary ipsilateral or contralateral ACL rupture and untimely knee osteoarthritis, despite surgical repair. Previous research has examined neuromuscular control (NMC) interventions to address functional joint stability; however, clinical outcomes have varied. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest an ACL injury not only damages static restraints and peripheral mechanoreceptors, but also alters neural networks in the brain (neuroplasticity). These neural adaptations are responsible for perceiving and integrating sensory input, as well as executing the appropriate motor responses necessary for dynamic restraint. Additionally, ACL patients who have higher fear of re-injury/movement seem to have diminished knee function compared to those with relatively less fear perception. Emotion regulatory neural circuits in the brain demand greater cognitive processing to manage increased attentional resources, which suggests that greater fear interrupts executive functions related to <b>neuromuscular</b> control. This <b>coordination</b> is necessary for maintaining functional joint stability by optimizing muscle stiffness surrounding the knee. However, minimal data exists on how the brain perceives sensory information emanating from the knee, how fear may disrupt NMC, or how enhanced executive-function skills can improve fear-regulation and muscle stiffening strategies following ACL rupture. The results of this study demonstrate that: 1) the brain increases cortical activation in response to joint loading following an ACL injury; 2) general and specific situation-related fearful stimuli result in greater alterations in heart rate and neural processing in the brain, as well as joint stiffness regulation strategies; 3) a cognitive-based online training intervention improves executive-function skills, neurophysiological emotional responses, and joint stiffness regulation strategies in ACL patients. These findings suggest that measure of electrocortical signals can detect instantaneous neuromechanical coupling between joint load and brain activity and that ACL injured patients have altered somatosensory networks following ACL injury. This altered neural circuits in ACL patients may be insufficient to regulate feed-forward and feedback dynamic restraint mechanisms, when unanticipated negative events occur during high velocity physical activity. However, we can enhance executive functioning skills and emotional regulation which may help with functional joint stability. These findings offer that we can better assess instantaneous neuromechanical coupling and test individualized brain plasticity among various patient population to determine neurocognitive intervention strategies that may enhance patient outcomes.

40|$|Although the hip {{musculature}} {{is found}} to be very important in connecting the core to the lower extremities and in transferring forces from and to the core, it is proposed to leave the hip musculature out of consideration when talking about the concept of core stability. A low level of co-contraction or the trunk muscles is important for core stability. It provides a level of stiffness, which gives sufficient stability against minor perturbations. Next to this stiffness, direction-specific muscle reflex responses are also important in providing core stability, particularly when encountering sudden perturbations. It appears that most trunk muscles, both the local and global stabilization system, must work coherently to achieve core stability. The contributions of the various trunk muscles depend on the task being performed. In the search for a precise balance between the amount of stability and mobility, the role of sensory-motor control is much more important than the role of strength or endurance of the trunk muscles. The CNS creates a stable foundation for movement of the extremities through co-contraction of particular muscles. Appropriate muscle recruitment and timing is extremely important in providing core stability. No clear evidence has been found for a positive relationship between core stability and physical performance and more research in this area is needed. On the other hand, with respect to the relationship between core stability and injury, several studies have found an association between a decreased stability and a higher risk of sustaining a low back or knee injury. Subjects with such injuries have been shown to demonstrate impaired postural control, delayed muscle reflex responses following sudden trunk unloading and abnormal trunk muscle recruitment patterns. In addition, various relationships have been demonstrated between core stability, balance performance and activation characteristics of the trunk muscles. Most importantly, a significant correlation was found between poor balance performance in a sitting balance task and delayed firing of the trunk muscles during sudden perturbation. It was suggested that both phenomena Lire caused by proprioceptive deficits. The importance of sensory-motor control has implications for the development of measurement and training protocols. It has been shown that challenging propriocepsis during training activities, for example, by making use Of unstable surfaces, leads to increased demands on trunk muscles, thereby improving core stability and balance. Various tests to directly or indirectly measure <b>neuromuscular</b> control and <b>coordination</b> have been developed and are discussed in the present article. Sitting balance performance and trunk Muscle response times may be good indicators of core stability. In light of this, {{it would be interesting to}} quantify core stability using a sitting balance task, for example by making use of accelerometry. Further research is required to develop training programmes and evaluation methods that are suitable for various target groups...|$|R

Methods: Anticonvulsant effect of Guaifenesin was assessed via Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) -induced convulsion. Male albino mice received Guaifenesin (100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg; n= 8 - 10) or 0. 25 % Tween (vehicle) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before the injection of PTZ (95 mg/kg). Diazepam (3 mg/kg; n= 8) was used as a reference drug. The latency time before the onset of myoclonic, clonic, and tonic-clonic convulsions, percentage of animals exhibiting convulsion, and percentage of mortality were recorded. In addition, the effect of Guaifenesin on <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> was assessed using the Rotarod. Results: Guaifenesin at all the studied doses significantly increased the latency to myoclonic and clonic convulsions in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Guaifenesin at the dose of 300 mg/kg increased the latency to tonic-clonic seizure. The ED 50 s of Guaifenesin for protection against PTZ-induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and death were 744. 88 (360 - 1540), 256 (178 - 363), and 328 (262 - 411) mg/kg, respectively.

We have studied here the effects of the polyphenols resveratrol and kaempferol added to the diet in a murine model undergoing long-term hypercaloric diet. Using 50 mice for each condition, we have monitored weight, survival, biochemical parameters such as blood glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and aspartate aminotransferase, <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> measured with the rotarod test and morphological aspect of stained sections of liver and heart histological samples. Our data show that mice fed since they are 3 -months-old with hypercaloric diet supplemented with any of these polyphenols reduced their weight by about 5 – 7 % with respect to the controls fed only with hypercaloric diet. We also observed that mice fed with any of the polyphenols had reduced levels of glucose, insulin and cholesterol, and better marks in the rotarod test, but only after 1 year of treatment, that is, during senescence.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{a higher incidence of}} sports related knee injuries among female athletes compared to their male counterparts regardless of exposure time and activity level. Different intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been proposed as risk factors in women. The hormonal variation during the menstrual cycle has been suggested as one of the intrinsic factors and an association between sport injuries in female athletes and the menstrual cycle has been reported. An increased injury rate has been observed during the premenstrual and menstrual phase, whereas one author reported a higher incidence during the ovulatory phase. It has been suggested that impaired neuromuscular function due to the specific hormonal influence of the menstrual cycle contributes to the association between sport injuries and different phases of the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, women with premenstrual symptoms (PMS) {{have been shown to be}} at greater risk of injury compared to women without PMS. The overall aim of this work was to explore if and how neuromuscular performance and balance vary across three well defined and hormonally confirmed phases of the menstrual cycle in moderately active women and to study if PMS can affect performance. Muscle strength and endurance, knee joint kinesthesia, <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> and postural control were measured in the early follicular phase (FP), the ovulatory phase (OP) and the mid luteal phase (LP) of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle phases were determined by analysis of sex hormone levels in serum and ovulation was detected by the luteinising hormone surge in urine. A prospective rating of PMS was used to divide the subjects into two groups, one with PMS and one without. No significant variations in muscle strength or muscle endurance during the menstrual cycle were detected. An impaired knee joint kinesthesia was detected in the LP and women with PMS showed an overall greater threshold for detection of passive movements than women without PMS. <b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> was significantly improved in the OP compared to the other phases. A significantly altered postural control was detected in the LP in the PMS group, but no differences were shown between phases in the non-PMS group. There was no significant difference in hormone levels between the PMS group and the non-PMS group and there were no correlations between hormone levels and the variables tested. The results of this thesis demonstrate a significant variation in knee joint kinesthesia, <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> and postural control during the menstrual cycle, while no differences in muscle strength or endurance were observed. Impaired neuromuscular performance and balance may contribute to the increased incidence of sports injuries in female athletes.

If this were the case, then increased levels of locomotor activity would be predicted to increase canalization and the magnitude of covariation between limbs. To investigate whether postnatal activity levels can {{have a significant effect on}} variance within or covariance among homologous limb elements, we compared four groups of male mice from a long-term selective breeding experiment: (1) mice from lines bred for increased voluntary activity on running wheels and allowed free access to a wheel for 8  weeks beginning at weaning (“active”), (2) selected mice that did not have wheel access (“sedentary”), (3) active mice from non-selected control lines, and (4) sedentary control mice. Mice from selected lines that had wheel access ran significantly more than control-line mice. However, when controlled for activity, linetype, and body mass, results indicate few significant differences in means, variance, or covariation structure, and no significant differences in integration between limbs, suggesting that postnatal activity levels do not significantly affect canalization or integration of limb lengths. A possible explanation for this result is that whereas baseline levels of postnatal activity may help to maintain patterns of variance and integration, increased levels of activity do not further increase these measures. Investigations into disrupted epigenetic processes (e. g., via models in which <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> is impaired) are required to further test hypotheses about how canalization or integration of limb variation is affected by epigenetic factors...|$|E
30|$|Only {{articles}} {{investigating the}} effect of PSE on exercise performance were selected. Authors must have provided enough information to derive {{means and standard deviations}} for performance tests. Studies must have used PSE as the only substance in the intervention, and they were excluded if the substance was not specifically being investigated for its ergogenic effect [17]. Also excluded were studies investigating the effects of PSE on strength and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> because data were incomparable with included articles [10, 18]. Studies that investigated other substances were included if participants were not administered both substances simultaneously [7, 12, 19]. All studies were randomised placebo-controlled trials and were conducted in a double blind crossover fashion. All participants (males and females) were deemed to be healthy. Each protocol of the 16 studies included in this meta-analysis required the participants to abstain from use of stimulants before the trials and some studies had a pre-planned meal.|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} causes muscle weakness, impairs {{bone formation}} and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination,</b> thus increases fracture risk. It {{is well known}} that pain and functional disability caused by fractures impairs quality of life (QOL). However, studies investigating the association between vitamin D deficiency and QOL are insufficient. This study investigates the effects of vitamin D level on QOL in osteoporotic patients. 286 patients (mean age 60. 51 ± 9. 1 years) with postmenapousal, senile or male osteoporosis were included in the study. Demographic data, physical activity level and back pain were recorded. Bone turnover markers, 25 (OH) vitaminD, PTH levels and bone mineral density (BMD) were evaluated. Spinal deformity index (SDI) was calculated by lateral thoracolomber X-rays. QOL was assessed using QOL Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO). 25 (OH) vitaminD levels below 12 ng/ml was accepted as vitamin D deficiency. 25 (OH) vitaminD level of the patients was 23. 19 ± 13. 1 ng/ml and 34 were (11. 8...|$|E
40|$|There {{appear to}} be two general {{physiological}} reasons why exercise will be beneficial to space travelers who will experience a weightless and isolated environment for many months or a few years: (1) to alleviate or prevent tissue atrophy (principally bone and muscle), to maintain cardiovascular function, and to prevent deleterious changes in extracellular and cellular fluid volumes and plasma constituents, especially electrolytes; and (2) to maintain whole organism functional physical and physiological status with special reference to <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> (physical skill) and physical fitness (muscle strength and power, flexibility, and aerobic endurance). The latter reason also relates well {{to the ability of}} the crew members to resist both general and local fatigue and thus ensure consistent physical performance. Various forms of exercise, performed regularly, could help alleviate boredom and assist the travelers in coping with stress, anxiety, and depression. The type, frequency, duration and intensity of exercise and ways of ensuring that crew members engage in it are discussed...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{attributes}} that dance teachers work diligently to develop in their students. One of the most impressive and sought-after skills is a high “extension”. This, of course, refers to the height of the gesture leg, either to the front or side, and is practiced both at barre and in center with adagio music and dével-oppé exercises. A standard ballet class will have at least one exercise at barre (thus a repetition to the right and another to the left) and one other exercise in center (again, with a repetition to the right and left side) to train the extension that defines the développé. It {{is beyond the scope of}} a dance class to expect to de-velop the necessary components of strength, flexibility, and <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> required of the performing artist. To this end, many teachers and researchers recom-mend outside conditioning. Conditioning outside of the dance class has shown good results for back strengthening and arabesque height in a 10 -week training program docu...|$|E
40|$|The sports {{medicine}} professional {{is concerned with}} the well being of the athlete and generally assumes the responsibility for overseeing the total health care for the athlete. Participation in sports places the athlete in a situation in which injury is likely to occur. Fortunately, most injuries are not serious and lend themselves to rapid rehabilitation, but the {{sports medicine}} professional must be capable of dealing with any type of trauma or catastrophic injury. A. Physical Conditioning Physical conditioning is a key principle of injury prevention. Appropriate conditioning programmes decrease the risk of injury, decrease the severity of an injury should it occur, and can help prevent re-injury. Maximising the chance for safe athletic performance requires adequate muscular strength and balance, power, endurance, <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination,</b> joint flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, and good body composition for sport. Improving specific components of fitness and conditioning reduces the risk of injuries. For example, strengthening the muscles of a joint helps reduce injuries t...|$|E
40|$|Swallowing is {{a complex}} process {{consisting}} in transporting food from mouth to the stomach; it involves voluntary and reflex activity of more than 30 nerves and muscles, requiring complex <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> and brainstem and cortical centers for controle. Dysphagia {{is defined as a}} alteration in the swallowing process, which cause difficulty in transporting saliva and aliments from the mouth trough the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. It is a frequent symptom, affecting especially old people, people with neurological diseases, cancers of head and neck or severe reflux. Dysphagia can result {{from a wide variety of}} functional or structural deficits of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx or esophagus, which could e caused by neurological conditions. Dysphagia carries serious health risks: malnutrition, dehydration, increase risk of infections. Effective dysphagia management requires an interdisciplinary approach; the goal of rehabilitation is to identify and treat abnormalities of swallowing while maintaining safe and efficient nutrition.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Neuropathic pain is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} resulting from neuronal damage. Pregabalin, the (S) -isomer of 3 -isobutyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), {{is widely used}} to treat neuropathic pain, despite the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) -related side effects such as dizziness and somnolence. Here we describe the pharmacology of novel GABA derivatives containing silicon−carbon bonds, silagaba compounds. Silagaba 131, 132, and 161 showed pregabalin-like analgesic activities in animal models of neuropathic pain, but in contrast to pregabalin they did not impair <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> in rotarod tests. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that brain exposure to silagaba compounds was lower than that to pregabalin. Surprisingly, despite their potent analgesic action in vivo, silagaba compounds showed only weak binding to α 2 -δ protein. These compounds {{may be useful to}} study mechanisms of neuropathic pain. Our results also indicate that silagaba 132 and 161 are candidates for orally effective treatment of neuropathic pain without CNS-related side effects...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} effect of a home-based {{respiratory}} muscle endurance training in patients with mild to moderate generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) on Besinger score, lung function and respiratory muscle endurance. Ten patients performed respiratory muscle endurance training in form of normocapnic hyperpnea training at 50 - 60 % of their maximal voluntary ventilation over 4 - 6 weeks. MG score, lung function and respiratory endurance were assessed before and after training period. The training significantly increased respiratory endurance from 8. 4 +/- 0. 9 min to 17. 1 +/- 1. 3 min (p< 0. 001) and total ventilatory volume from 555 +/- 87 L to 1081 +/- 127 L (p= 0. 004). About 25 % of this gain was lost after 3 - 5 months of detraining. The remaining 75 % gain might result from improved <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>coordination</b> rather than muscular training. MG score and lung function, however, did not change. Patients assessed the training effects on physical fitness and respiration as positive. In conclusion, respiratory muscle endurance training can be useful for MG patients as it is enhancing respiratory muscle endurance...|$|E
