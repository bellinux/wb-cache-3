When WASP increased its power in the early 70s to 5 kW and because of the close proximity of WKEG, WASP had to adopt a directional antenna pattern during daytime hours and 1 kW <b>non-direction</b> pattern during [...] "Critical Hours" [...] (2 hrs morning and 2 hours evening)to protect their adjacent competitor.|$|E
40|$|When {{presented}} with a water or an air gap barrier, animals often engage in peering, or side-tosided head movements, before leaping across the barrier. This strategy is used instead of depth recovery using stereopsis, and likely gives a much better estimate of distance. In this article we present a neurocomputational model of peering, hosted on a small robot, that explains the essential characteristics of peering reported in the literature. The model builds on recent evidence for <b>non-direction</b> selective movement detectors in insects. Through non-linear transformation of the retinal image, the model produces a ‘leap ’ command without intermediate reconstruction of the external space of the animal. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} feedforward and recurrent connectivity to the direction selective responses of cells in layer IVB of {{primary visual cortex}} is currently the subject of debate in the neuroscience community. Recently biophysically detailed simulations have shown realistic direction selective responses can be achieved via recurrent cortical interactions between cells with <b>non-direction</b> selective feedforward input (Suarez, Koch & Douglas, 1995; Maex & Orban, 1996). Unfortunately the complexity of these models, while desirable for detailed comparison with biology, are difficult to analyze mathematically. In this paper a relatively simple cortical dynamical model is {{used to analyze the}} emergence of direction selective responses via recurrent interactions. Comparison between a model based on our analysis and physiological data is presented. The approach also allows analysis of the recurrently propagated signal, revealing the predictive nature of the implementation. Introduction [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of trunk movements, trunk muscle activation, intra-abdominal {{pressure}} and displacement of centres of pressure and mass was undertaken {{to determine whether}} trunk orientation is a controlled variable prior to and during rapid bilateral movement of the upper limbs. Standing subjects performed rapid bilateral symmetrical upper limb movements in three directions (flexion, abduction and extension). The results indicated a small (0. 4 - 3. 3 degrees) but consistent initial angular displacement between the segments of the trunk in a direction opposite to that produced by the reactive moments resulting from limb movement. Phasic activation of superficial trunk muscles was consistent with this pattern of preparatory motion and with the direction of motion of the centre of mass. In contrast, activation of the deep abdominal muscles was independent of the direction of limb motion, suggesting a <b>non-direction</b> specific contribution to spinal stability. The results support the opinion that feedforward postural responses result in trunk movements, and that orientation of the trunk and centre of mass are both controlled variables in relation to rapid limb movements...|$|E
40|$|In "Therapeutic Meaning of Non-directive Play Therapy I,II," {{the three}} core {{characteristics}} of this therapy, which were <b>non-direction,</b> empathizing, and acceptance were discussed. In this paper, "Therapeutic Meaning of Non-directive Play therapy III," other fundamental aspects, such as "limitation" and "the role of toys" are discussed from interpersonal theory perspective. Some may {{be concerned that}} "non-direction" and "limitation" are mutually exclusive; however, "limitation" is in fact essential for Non-directive Play Therapy to be effective. There are roughly two types of limitations: the limitation {{of space and time}}, and the limitation of relationship. Limitation of space and time isolates clients and therapists from the outside world and therefore facilitates them to be open and bond with each other. It also bridges therapeutic space and the real world. The limitation of relationship allows the therapy to continue maintaining a healthy relationship and foster a comfortable environment for chiildren, which in turn allows them to play freely. Toys are obviously important for children's development and learning. However, they also serve an important function as a medium to both represent a child's inner world and to connect the child and therapist...|$|E

40|$|Visual latencies and {{temporal}} dynamics of area 18 and PMLS direc-tion-selective complex cells were defined with a reverse correlation method. The method {{allowed us to}} analyze {{the time course of}} responses to motion steps, without confounding temporal integration effects. Several measures of response latency and direction tuning dynamics were quantified: optimal latency (OL), latency of first and last significant responses (FSR, LSR), the increase and decrease of direction sensitivity in time, and the change of direction tuning in time. FSR, OL and LSR values for PMLS and area 18 largely over-lapped. The small differences in mean latencies (3 – 4 ms for FSR and OL and 11. 9 ms for the LSR) were not statistically significant. All cells in area 18 {{and the vast majority of}} cells in PMLS showed no system-atic changes in preferred direction (monophasic neurons). In PMLS 5 out of 41 cells showed a reversal of preferred direction after ∼ 56 ms relative to their OL (biphasic neurons). Monophasic cells showed no systematic changes in direction tuning width during the interval from FSR to LSR. In both areas, development of direction sensitivity was significantly faster than return to the <b>non-direction</b> sensitive state, but no significant difference was found between the two areas. We conclude that, for the monophasic type of direction-selective complex cells, the dynamics of primary motion processing are highly comparable for area 18 and PMLS. This suggests that motion infor-mation is predominantly processed in parallel, presumably based on input from the fast conducting thalamocortical Y-pathway...|$|E
40|$|The Subjective {{elements}} of music became a philosophical football which was kicked about by amateurs and professionals alike {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century. Much time and mental energy was spent in fruitless attempts to evaluate the affectiveness of music. Was music 'a language of emotion'. How a subjective experience can be expressed, or embodied in an objective art form is still debated. Fortunately, the affectiveness of music in the class-room is relatively uncomplicated, seldom arousing real emotion, but those of a tertiary order. Theorists have readily invented numerous scientific tests to evaluate children's responses to music. Historically, music education can be traced to the ecclesiastical schools of the Middle Ages, but for centuries it remained in a peripheral area, dependent upon the personal interest of the Headmaster, though often recognised as having ethical and recreational value. Educational thought in England slowly accepted its rightful place in education, but the support of religious, philanthropic, and social reformers was necessary before sight-singing was introduced in the National schools in 1870, but not as an integral part of the curriculum. The nationwide success of simple sight-singing won official approval but did nothing to formulate a systematic method of tuition. This was eventually achieved by Curwen, whose Tonic Sol-fa became the accepted medium for teaching music in schools, giving them, and thousands of uneducated adults, 'an experience from within'. Other countries have successfully implemented the music methods of Kodaly, Orff, Ward and Suzuki in their schools; these have largely been ignored in Britain. In official reports, the criticisms of music in our schools, particularly in secondary schools, are devastating. The quantified success of objective thought, reason, clear objectives and continued application is conveniently forgotten in order that the English tradition of <b>non-direction</b> in music education may be preserved...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes that}} South Africa, as multi-lingual country, has unique {{potential}} {{and that this}} potential {{is not to be}} found in some or other essence {{of what it means to}} be African, but in the daily struggles, frustrations and possibilities of life in a fragmented and divided multi-lingual society. In this fragmented and ‘impossible’ society there are moments (maybe rare moments) of true understanding, communication, reconciliation and forgiveness and these moments I call ‘Advents of a Rainbow Nation’. Although these Advents can be understood (made reasonable) via the transversal reasoning of Welsch and Schrag, this article would like to propose an alternative: to wonder-off in a different <b>non-direction</b> namely into the u-topic and u-chronic clearing of non-philosophy. Reason cannot receive the Advent as gift (given without givenness) and thus transforms the Advent into a philosophical event of thought. In the process of seeking to understand these Advents as events, the Advents are transformed by a Decision or cut of transversal reasoning, and so the Advents themselves are lost. Therefore, what is sought in this article is not an understanding (reason) of this Advent, but rather a wandering in and a wondering at the grace and faith of this Advent. This grace and faith is the greatest epistemological asset South Africa, as multi-lingual country, can offer a plural global world as it opens a space for non-philosophical thinking: thus thinking science, religion, art, literature together in a vision-in-One with theology safe-guarding this vision-in-One unifacially facing the future. The question is, can South Africans embrace the multiplicity of the Advent of the Rainbow Nation? Can the Church with her Christ narrative sojourn with South Africa towards a rainbow nation and thereby facilitate a noological space for multiple connective intellection, or is she an obstacle towards developing this potential...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of directional tuned neurons {{in the primary}} motor cortex has advanced motor research in several domains. For instance, {{in the area of}} brain machine interface (BMI), researchers have exploited the robust characteristic of tuned motor neurons to allow monkeys to learn control of various machines. In the first chapter of this work we examine whether this phenomena can be observed using the less invasive method of recording electrocorticographic signals (ECoG) from the surface of a human's brain. Our findings reveal that individual ECoG channels contain complex movement information about the neuronal population. While some ECoG channels are tuned to hand movement direction (direction specific channels), others are associated to movement but do not contain information regarding movement direction (<b>non-direction</b> specific channels). More specifically, directionality can vary temporally and by frequency within one channel. In addition, a handful of channels contain no significant information regarding movement at all. These findings strongly suggest that directional and non-directional regions of cortex can be identified with ECoG and provide solutions to decoding movement at the signal resolution provided by ECoG. In the second chapter we examine the influence of movement context on movement reconstruction accuracy. We recorded neuronal signals recorded from electro-corticography (ECoG) during performance of cued- and self-initiated movements. ECoG signals were used to train a reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct continuous hand movement. We found that both cued- and self-initiated movements could be reconstructed with similar accuracy from the ECoG data. However, while an algorithm trained on the cued task could reconstruct performance on a subsequent cued trial, it failed to reconstruct self-initiated arm movement. The same task-specificity was observed when the algorithm was trained with self-initiated movement data and tested on the cued task. Thus, the correlation of ECoG activity to kinematic parameters of arm movement is context-dependent, an important constraint to consider in future development of BMI systems. The third chapter delves into a fundamental organizational principle of the primate motor system - cortical control of contralateral limb movements. However, motor areas also appear {{to play a role in}} the control of ipsilateral limb movements. Several studies in monkeys have shown that individual neurons in primary motor cortex (M 1) may represent, on average, the direction of movements of the ipsilateral arm. Given the increasing body of evidence demonstrating that neural ensembles can reliably represent information with a high temporal resolution, here we characterize the distributed neural representation of ipsilateral upper limb kinematics in both monkey and man. In two macaque monkeys trained to perform center-out reaching movements, we found that the ensemble spiking activity in M 1 could continuously represent ipsilateral limb position. We also recorded cortical field potentials from three human subjects and also consistently found evidence of a neural representation for ipsilateral movement parameters. Together, our results demonstrate the presence of a high-fidelity neural representation for ipsilateral movement and illustrates that it can be successfully incorporated into a brain-machine interface...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{the level}} of {{participation}} in secondary education, prompted by the realisation that a workforce with a significant level of education and training is needed for {{the demands of a}} future dependent on technology, provides the context for this research project. The responses of governments in Europe and Australia are explored to explain these expectations and questions are raised about the means for increasing the retention rate of young people in education and training. The issue of disengagement becomes the focus of this discussion and the use of technology as a means to re-engage young people for whom school provides little attraction is introduced, providing the purpose of the remainder of the research project. Disengagement is examined by looking at both the factors contributing to students failing to complete secondary school and the characteristics by which it can be described. Truancy, suspension rates, discipline incidents and poor achievement levels provide an indication of issues of access, achievement, application and aspiration (Davies et al., 2013) {{that need to be addressed}} for the successful motivation of students at school. The research focuses on three questions, asking how technology can engage and support students to complete learning activities, what affordances are offered by technology to achieve this and what underlying principles and models can be extracted that can be used by teachers in schools to overcome the demotivation of those students at risk of failing to complete secondary school. From the review of the literature on programs utilising alternative learning models and the incorporation of diverse types of digital technology, a range of possible approaches were identified that provided the basis for an introductory model. This model was tested, evaluated and revised throughout a number of iterations with the design-based research approach used as the framework for the research. While significant research was evident on the effectiveness in schools of technology use for improving learning outcomes, motivation and student attitudes, these had predominantly been drawn from students who were relatively engaged and successfully involved in these schools. Research with disengaged students was recognised as difficult (Tinson, 2009) and a methodology was applied that enabled the researcher to gain the trust and acceptance of participants in order to challenge their learning, evoke legitimate and honest responses from the students and observe the results of using technology in a natural classroom setting. Three iterations of the model were introduced to students nominated by schools to be at risk of not completing secondary school. A qualitative method of interviews, observations and notes was used to collect data that was evaluated to identify trends arising in consecutive iterations. Initially an authentic learning task based on problem solving and real world significance was used. After implementation and review as part of the design-based research approach a progressive refinement of the model produced a range of activities using features identified in a number of technology approaches such as interactivity, multimodality and digital games. Emerging from the use of these features in the design of learning materials was an interactional style for the teacher based more on facilitation and <b>non-direction</b> intervention. Drawing more from principles within experiential education, non-direct intervention provided the vehicle for the affordances available within the technology, to be made accessible to the students. The principles identified behind the design of digital learning activities and the use of non-direct intervention by the teacher are the outcome of this research and provide the framework for a model for teachers and schools to utilise as a way to remove the demotivation of students and increase their engagement in learning activities...|$|E
