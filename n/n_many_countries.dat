40|$|I <b>n</b> <b>many</b> <b>countries,</b> {{automated}} {{peritoneal dialysis}} (APD) has grown dramatically {{in recent years}} and, at present, {{can be said to}} be the fastest growing mo dality of dialysis in the world. Thus, in 1997, it was estimated that about 28 000 PD patients, representing more than one quarter of the total worldwide, were being maintained on APD (Baxter Corporation. Personal communication). In the U. S., the percentage of PD patients on APD has risen from 12 % in 1992 to 32 % in 1996 (1) and, in Canada, from 9 % in 1993 to 28 % in 1997 (Baxter Corporation. Personal communication). It is generally thought that this growth reflects a number of factors. One is the technological improvement in cyclers, which has made them more compact, attractive, and portable. Another is the increased emphasis on adequacy of PD (2) associated with the notion that greater clearances can be achieved on this modality than on traditional CAPD. A third is the perception that APD may have "lifestyle" advantages for many patients or for their relatives and caregivers. All of these factors raise the question of what the future roles for CAPD and APD will be. Should all PD patients be treated with APD or does CAPD have an ongoing role to play? Is APD an inherently superior modality? In this review, the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two modalities will be dis cussed under a number ofheadings, including lifestyle, clinical outcomes, and cost. LIFESTYLE ISSUES The obvious lifestyle advantage for APD as compared to standard CAPD is that it requires two rather than four procedures daily. This factor has long bee...|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2009, a {{pandemic}} {{associated with a}} new type of influenza A virus (H 1 <b>N</b> 1) affected <b>many</b> <b>countries</b> worldwide. After five years of silence, in 2015 we encountered another outbreak of H 1 N 1 influenza A. Objectives: The present study aimed to study the epidemiological and clinical features of this disease in the cold and dry climate of Qazvin province, Iran in the last epidemic, during 2009. Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which the demographic characteristics and clinical manifestations of confirmed cases of influenza A virus (H 1 N 1) in the province of Qazvin were investigated. The definite diagnosis of cases was performed using real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on oropharyngeal washing specimens from adults and throat swabs from children and severely ill patients. Results: During the time course between July to December 2009, 76 confirmed cases of influenza A (H 1 N 1) were discovered in the province of Qazvin. The mean age of patients was 25. 67 ± 16. 9 years. The most affected people were students and housewives. Coughing was found to be the most common clinical symptom (96. 1...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the advent}} of a new {{influenza}} A H 1 <b>N</b> 1 strain, <b>many</b> <b>countries</b> have begun mass immunisation programmes. Awareness of the background rates of possible adverse events will be a crucial part of assessment of possible vaccine safety concerns and will help to separate legitimate safety concerns from events that are temporally associated with but not caused by vaccination. We identified background rates of selected medical events for several countries. Rates of disease events varied by age, sex, method of ascertainment, and geography. Highly visible health conditions, such as Guillain-Barr 9 syndrome, spontaneous abortion, or even death, will occur in coincident temporal association with novel influenza vaccination. On the basis of the reviewed data, if a cohort of 10 million individuals was vaccinated in the UK, 2175 cases of Guillain-Barr 9 syndrome and 5775 cases of sudden death would be expected to occur within 6 weeks of vaccination as coincident background cases. In female vaccinees in the USA, 8673 cases of optic neuritis per 10 million population would be expected within 6 weeks of vaccination. 397 per 1 million vaccinated pregnant women would be predicted to have a spontaneous abortion within 1 day of vaccination...|$|R
40|$|I <b>n</b> recent years, <b>many</b> <b>countries</b> {{have sought}} to expand theirexports. Many governments have tried to reduce biases againstexports and to {{neutralize}} incentives between export and im-port-competing activities. 1 Their policies have sometimes included "active " instruments of export promotion, such as export credit and export insurance programs. Export credit programs provide credit for export activities before or after shipment; export credit insur-ance programs insure export credit against commercial or political risks. 2 This article examines from an overall economic perspective reasons for these programs and briefly reviews their use in three industrial and seven developing countries. It focuses on the subsidy elements of the programs and their effects on exports and resource allocation. Domestic Distortions Rationales The theory of domestic distortions provides much of the rationale ~^!/~? 7 for export promotion in general, and particularly for export credit Creuir programs (Bhagwati and Ramaswami 1963; Bhagwati 1971; John-son 1966, 1971). It demonstrates that where protection creates a bias against exports and where policymakers are unwilling to elimi-nate the bias, an equivalent subsidy to export activities can restore neutrality, encourage trade along lines of comparative advantage, and improve economic welfare. These antiexport biases arise whe...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of the Nosema ceranae and Nosema apis among apiaries using both spore counts and multiplex PCR and the replacement of N. apis by N. ceranae in some regions of Turkey. Methods: A hundred honey bee samples were collected from 99 apiaries in 11 different locations in 2011 - 2012 in Turkey. Nosema infection degree from collected samples was determined using light microscope and molecular detection of Nosema spp. (N. ceranae and N. apis) was performed using specific primers by multiplex PCR. Results : N. ceranae was only found spores in sampling areas using molecular diagnosis. N. apis was not detected in whole sampling areas using both techniques. There are no Nosema spores detected in Konya one location using two techniques. The nu­cleotide sequences from amplification products of the Nosema infested honeybee samples were (98 %) identical with the sequence of <b>N.</b> ceranae for <b>many</b> <b>countries</b> deposited in the GenBank database in this study. Conclusion: The present study illustrated that N. ceranae is the only spores for sampled areas in 2011 - 2012. The study could also indicate that N. ceranae has been replaced instead of N. apis in Turkey. In addition, the prevalence of N. ceranae and two microsporodia spores effects on honey bee colonies in Turkey were needed to determine with intensive sampling, periodically...|$|R
