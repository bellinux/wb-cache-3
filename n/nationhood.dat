5|$|The American {{historian}} Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota <b>Nationhood</b> (2010), a revisionist {{examination of}} the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn in light of past successes of the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself, rather than simply a mishap by Custer.|$|E
5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German <b>Nationhood</b> (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|The war had a {{profound}} effect on Australian society in other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and <b>nationhood</b> that exist today have their origins in the war. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were {{brought before the}} Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation of seats in the People's Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic Party lost two seats, one to the National Mandate Party and Prosperous Peace Party each. The Pioneers' Party gained one seat from the United Democratic <b>Nationhood</b> Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star Party.|$|E
5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for the Palestinian sense of <b>nationhood</b> in that it brought together disparate groups against a common enemy. Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} {{following}} PedroII's majority in 1840, however, that the Academy became a powerhouse, {{part of the}} Emperor's greater scheme of fomenting a national culture and consequently uniting all Brazilians in a common sense of <b>nationhood.</b> PedroII would sponsor the Brazilian culture through several public institutions funded by the government (not restricted to the Academy of Fine Arts), such as Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera. That sponsorship would pave the way {{not only for the}} careers of artists, but also for those engaged in other fields, including historians such as Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen and musicians such as the operatic composer Antônio Carlos Gomes.|$|E
5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's subjects were classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was disappointed with the response of British critics to the exhibition, and their focus on a theme of <b>nationhood</b> paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{makes clear}} {{at the outset}} that he was not running for a third term, and then thanking his fellow {{citizens}} for the opportunity to serve as their president. He then writes about the preservation of the Union, the core of American <b>nationhood,</b> and which, along with the Constitution binds all Americans together and provides for the popular well being. Concerned about the obstacles and potential hazards that lay ahead for the nation, Washington urges the nation's people to cherish and safeguard their hard-won system of republican government despite their many differences.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and <b>nationhood</b> that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian National Vimy Memorial {{site has}} {{considerable}} sociocultural significance for Canada. The idea that Canada's {{national identity and}} <b>nationhood</b> were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that {{the construction of the}} Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period. Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the enormous impact of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation's determination to remember Canada's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|An earlier fleet {{had been}} the first to reach India by circumnavigating Africa. That {{expedition}} had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499. For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was {{under the control of the}} Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire. Portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal's fight for <b>nationhood</b> against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical Prester John—a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold, and India's spice trade.|$|E
5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and {{had no sense of}} loyalty or <b>nationhood.</b> He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E

25|$|Although {{successful}} economically, Austro-Hungarian policy - {{which focused}} on advocating the ideal of a pluralist and multi-confessional Bosnian nation (largely favored by the Muslims) - failed to curb the rising tides of nationalism. The concept of Croat and Serb <b>nationhood</b> had already spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholics and Orthodox communities from neighboring Croatia and Serbia in the mid 19th century, and was too well-entrenched {{to allow for the}} widespread acceptance of a parallel idea of Bosnian <b>nationhood.</b> By {{the latter half of the}} 1910s, nationalism was an integral factor of Bosnian politics, with national political parties corresponding to the three groups dominating elections.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{suspicion}} {{from some}} {{sections of the}} colonial community (especially in smaller colonies) {{about the value of}} <b>nationhood,</b> improvements in inter-colonial transport and communication, including the linking of Perth to the south eastern cities by telegraph in 1877, helped break down inter-colonial rivalries.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of a Labor majority in 1972 {{marked the end of}} a period where Australians saw themselves principally as part of the Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Empire), with the Whitlam government implementing a number of reforms that strengthened Australia's independent <b>nationhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{the plural}} {{is not one}} that is formed by adding s, an s is added for the possessive, after the apostrophe: children’s hats, women’s hairdresser, some people’s eyes (but compare some peoples’ recent {{emergence}} into <b>nationhood,</b> where peoples is meant as the plural of the singular people). These principles are universally accepted.|$|E
25|$|Nagarakretagama {{composed}} by Prapanca in 1365 {{is a vital}} source of premier historical account of Majapahit historiography.

25|$|The largest {{ethnic group}} is the Javanese, who {{comprise}} 40.2% of the population. They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of the Java island and also significant numbers in most provinces of Indonesia. The Sundanese, Batak and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups. A sense of Indonesian <b>nationhood</b> exists alongside strong regional identities.|$|E
25|$|India's {{concept of}} <b>nationhood</b> is based not merely on {{territorial}} extent of its sovereignty. Nationalistic sentiments and expression encompass that India's ancient history, as {{the birthplace of}} the Indus Valley Civilization and Vedic Civilization, as well as four major world religions – Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Indian nationalists see India stretching along these lines across the Indian Subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of what is}} now the Netherlands and Belgium was {{eventually}} united by the Duke of Burgundy in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the Holy Roman Empire. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to <b>nationhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 2007, Abdullah Badawi shouted 'Merdeka!' {{during the}} midnight {{celebrations}} of Malaysia's 50 years of <b>nationhood.</b> The celebrations {{were held at}} Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur, where thousands of people had congregated. This was a symbolic gesture which emulated the actions of Malaya's first prime minister, the late Tunku Abdul Rahman, when the latter declared independence from the British in 1957.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1960s, the Australian Government {{realised}} that Papua New Guinea {{would become}} independent sooner than previously anticipated and, under the Principalship of political scientist and author Charles Rowley, later Foundation Professor of Politics at the University of Papua New Guinea, ASOPA moved into an intensive {{period of training}} young Australians to accelerate the pace of development. Papua New Guinea eventually achieved <b>nationhood</b> on 16 September 1975.|$|E
25|$|Australia fought at Britain's {{side from}} the outset of World War One and World War Two and came under attack from the Empire of Japan during the latter conflict.

25|$|On June 17, 2013, Pierluisi {{said during}} a {{testimony}} before the U.N.

Pierluisi said that the current territorial status has lost its democratic legitimacy {{and that the only}} paths forward are statehood or <b>nationhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|The major {{military}} event involved sending 40,000 ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand) soldiers in 1915 {{to seize the}} Gallipoli peninsula near Constantinople to open an Allied route to Russia and weaken the Ottoman Empire. The campaign was a total failure militarily and 8,100 Australians died. However the memory was all-important, for it transformed the Australian mind and became an iconic element of the Australian identity and the founding moment of <b>nationhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polish {{culture in}} the interwar period {{witnessed}} the rebirth of Polish sovereignty. The <b>nationhood</b> along with its cultural heritage was no longer suppressed by the three foreign partitioners. The cultural development saw the retreat of the 19th century elite cultures of nobility as well as the traditional folk culture, and the rise of a new mass culture integrating Polish society closer to the new intelligentsia educated in the practice of democracy.|$|E

Finally on 22 December 2006, Wiranto declared the formation of the People's Conscience Party (Hanura) and was elected as its first Chairman.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the term}} Coast Salish, and its {{association}} with an attribute of <b>nationhood,</b> has increasingly become resisted, as that notion of a ‘national’ grouping is not a traditional part of the culture of Salish communities in this area, and as the term derives more from anthropology than community self-description. The phenomenon replacing this terminology is increasingly to indicate the specific tribe in question, or otherwise to use terms not given by non-Indigenous entities.|$|E
25|$|Loss of the Mekong River {{town was}} too great {{an affront to}} Lao <b>nationhood</b> to be borne.

25|$|Observing the Roman Catholic Church {{activities}} in Yugoslavia {{for more than}} fifty years, Novak concluded that this Church replaced the idea of service to God with service to the Roman curia, i.e., {{to the government of}} the Roman Pontiff in the role of its world leader. As a result of this idea, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Roman Catholic Church identified Catholicism with Croatian <b>nationhood,</b> which Novak argues turned most of its priesthood into ardent Ustashe supporters.|$|E
25|$|Rizal was a {{contemporary}} of Gandhi, Tagore and Sun Yat Sen who also advocated liberty through peaceful means {{rather than by}} violent revolution. Coinciding {{with the appearance of}} those other leaders, Rizal from an early age had been enunciating in poems, tracts and plays, ideas all his own of modern <b>nationhood</b> as a practical possibility in Asia. In the Noli he stated that if European civilization had nothing better to offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed.|$|E
