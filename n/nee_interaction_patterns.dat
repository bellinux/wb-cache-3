40|$|Extended {{abstract}} of {{this work}} published in ITCS 2016 We present a unified framework for studying secure multi-party computation (MPC) with arbitrarily restricted <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns.</b> Our study generalizes both standard MPC and recent models for MPC with specific restricted <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> (such as a chain or a star), which were studied by Halevi et al. (Crypto 2011), Goldwasser et al. (Eurocrypt 2014), and Beimel et al. (Crypto 2014). Since restricted <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> cannot always yield full security for MPC, we start by formalizing the notion of “best possible security ” for any <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern.</b> We then obtain the following results: • Completeness theorem. We prove that the star <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> is complete for the problem of MPC with general <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns.</b> • Positive results. We present both information-theoretic and computationally secure protocols for computing arbitrary functions with general <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns.</b> We also present more efficient protocols for computing symmetric functions and for computin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In modern life, {{interactions}} between human beings frequently occur in meetings, where topics are discussed. Semantic knowledge of meetings can be revealed by discovering <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> from these meetings. An existing method mines <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> from meetings using tree structures. However, such a tree-based method may not cap-ture {{all kinds of}} triggering relations between interactions, {{and it may not}} distinguish a participant of a certain rank from another participant of a different rank in a meeting. Hence, the tree-based method {{may not be able to}} find all <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> such as those about correlated interaction. In this paper, we propose to mine <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> from meetings using an alternative data structure—namely, a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Specifically, a DAG captures both temporal and triggering relations between interactions in meetings. Moreover, to distinguish one participant of a certain rank from another, we assign weights to nodes in the DAG. As such, a meeting can be modeled as a weighted DAG, from which weighted frequent <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> can be discovered. Ex-perimental results showed the effectiveness of our proposed DAG-based method for mining <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> from meetings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Requirements are {{commonly}} vague and ambiguous. In this paper, we describe an automated Inconsistency Checker called Marama AI for checking for high- level inconsistency between textual requirements, abstract interactions and Essential Use Cases. We use concepts of phrase extraction and essential <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> {{to carry out}} these checks. We provide further support for checking of requirements quality attributes such as completeness and correctness using visual differencing. Keywords-higher level inconsistency, essential <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern,</b> visual differencing essential <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> is a sequence of expected essential interactions between user and system [8]. We have developed a library of such <b>patterns</b> to support <b>interaction</b> extraction from natural language [8] and analysis of interaction sequences. Figure 1 shows how the higher level inconsistency checking is performed in MaramaAI when the requirements engineer adds a new essential requirement (abstract interaction). If a new abstract interaction is added, the tool will automatically update the textual requirement based on the correct <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> because the new added abstract interaction is inconsistent with the textual requirement and the <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> library.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the structure of <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> between adolescents and their mothers. The Dynamic Systems approach is used to study the development of variability of <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> and the difference between adolescents with and without antisocial behavior in this development. Next, the relation with relational quality, namely conflict and support, was investigated. Method The changes between behavioral states of 63 dyads of 13 -year-old adolescents and their mothers from the Netherlands were anually observed for 5 years during a conflict interaction task. Participants filled out individual questionnaires on externalizing behavioral problems (TRF), and the perceived support and conflict from their mother (NRI). Results Findings indicate that there is a significant decline in variability in <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> starting from early adolescence. No significant difference was found in the development of variability of interaction between adolescents with and without antisocial behavior. The expected correlation between conflict and support, and variability of <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> has not been found. Conclusion The current results indicate that there is a heightened variability of <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> at early adolescence. There appears to be no difference in the development in <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> between adolescents with or without antisocial behavior. The development of variability in <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> does not relate to with support nor conflict. Possible explanations for the noncorrespondence between the hypotheses and {{the results of this study}} and limitations are discussed. Future research should be aimed at younger ages and the relationship between friendshipvariables or temperament and the development of variability in adolescence...|$|R

40|$|The study {{determined}} {{the effects of}} cooperative, competitive and individualistic classroom <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> {{on the performance of}} secondary school students in Physics. It also examined the moderating effect of gender on dependent measure. The study adopted the pretest, posttest, control group quasi experimental design. The sample consisted of 214 senior secondary school I students (104 males and 110 females) from four intact classes randomly selected in two local government areas of Ogun State using the cluster sampling technique. The classes were randomly assigned to one control group and three experimental groups. The experimental groups were Cooperative <b>Interaction</b> <b>Pattern</b> (COIP), Competitive <b>Interaction</b> <b>Pattern</b> (CMIP), and Individualistic <b>Interaction</b> <b>Pattern</b> (IDIP) while the Conventional Method of Teaching (CVMT) served as the control group. The instrument titled “Physics Achievement Test (PAT) ” was used to collect data for the study. Data collected were analysed using t-test and F-statistics. The results showed that the academic performance of secondary school students in Physics was significantly influenced by each of the classroom <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> of Cooperative (t= 23. 04, p 0. 05); Competitive (t= - 0. 278, p> 0. 05), and Individualistic (t= 0. 523, p> 0. 05). The results further showed that there was significant effect of COIP (t= 6. 77, p 0. 05) and CVMT (t= 1. 23, p> 0. 05) on the retention ability of the students.

40|$|Our work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} analyzing and understanding dynamic video scenes. A two-level motion pattern mining approach is proposed. At the first level, single-agent motion patterns are modeled as distributions over pixel-based features. At the second level, <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> are modeled as distributions over single-agent motion patterns. Both patterns are shared among video clips. Compared to other works, the advantage of our method is that <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> are detected and assigned to every video frame. This enables a finer semantic interpretation and more precise anomaly detection. Specifically, every video frame is labeled by a certain <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> and moving pixels in each frame which {{do not belong to}} any singleagent pattern or cannot exist in the corresponding <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> are detected as anomalies. We have tested our approach on a challenging traffic surveillance sequence containing both pedestrian and vehicular motions and obtained promising results.

The main contribution of this work is an Interaction Model to specify the new semantics to deal with the Model-Driven RIA development.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> in interpersonal conflict within organizations. Starting point is the interpersonal theory (IPT; Kiesler, 1983; Leary, 1957) that distinghuishes two dimensions to describe interpersonal (conflict) behavior, namely dominance-submissiveness and friendliness-hostility. Furthermore, with respect to <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns,</b> which exist when two people influence each other’s consecutive behaviors, IPT poses that dominance pulls submissiveness and vice versa (complementary <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern),</b> whereas friendliness leads to friendliness and hostility to hostility (symmetrical <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern).</b> Former research revealed insufficient evidence for complementary dominance-submissiveness, but amply sufficient evidence for symmetrical friendliness-hostility. Moreover, conflict behavior in organizations has never before been described and predicted with IPT. Therefore, the first goal of this dissertation was to test hypotheses about <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> in interpersonal conflict within organizations. The second goal of this dissertation was to examine whether the micro phenomenon of conflict interaction {{is influenced by the}} macro phenomenon of organizational structure. Organizations can roughly be divided into bureaucratic systems, characterized by low decision participation and by relatively simple, standardized work, versus organic systems, characterized by high decision participation and by relatively complex work that is coordinated by means of mutual adjustment. Former research revealed communication differences between bureaucratic, non-participative systems and organic, participative systems. In organic systems, the communication climate is more open than in bureaucratic systems. Therefore, conflict handling is expected to be more open, assertive, and confrontative than in bureaucratic systems. However, ther are only a few studies of differences between bureaucratic and organic systems with respect to <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> in interpersonal conflict. Another organization variable that probably influences conflict interaction is status difference. In accordance with findings from former research, it might be expected that high-status persons will show more dominant and more hostile conflict behavior than low-status persons. However, no specific predictions can be derived from former research about the influence of status difference upon <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> in interpersonal conflict. The third goal of this dissertation was to gain insight into determinants of effective conflict management. On the basis of earlier research it can be stated that more dominant and more hostile conflict behavior is less effective. Once again, no direct indications can be derived from former research about the effectiveness of <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> in interpersonal conflict. ...|$|R

We provide precise {{high-level}} {{models for}} eight fundamental service <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns,</b> together with schemes for their composition into complex service-based business process interconnections and interaction flows, supporting software-engineered business process management in multi-party collaborative environments. The mathematical {{nature of our}} models provides a basis for a rigorous execution-platform-independent analysis, in particular for benchmarking web services functionality. The models can also serve as accurate standard specifications, subject to further design leading by stepwise refinement to implementations. We begin by defining succinct rigorous models to mathematically capture the behavioral meaning of four basic bilateral business process <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> (Sect. 1), together with their refinements to four basic multilateral <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> (Sect. 2). We then illustrate with characteristic examples how by appropriate combinations and refinements of these eight fundamental patterns one can define arbitrarily complex <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> of distributed service-based business processes that go beyond simple request-response sequences and may involve a dynamically evolving number of participants.
