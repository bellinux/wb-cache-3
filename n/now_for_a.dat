25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E
500|$|Carson {{returned}} to Liverpool {{at the end}} of the season and in June 2007, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez confirmed that he would be part of the first-team squad for the 2007–08 season, saying [...] "He must fight with Pepe Reina <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> starting place." [...] Carson remained second choice to Reina, however, and faced further competition following the signing of Charles Itandje in August 2007; as a result, Carson was loaned out again, this time to Aston Villa at a cost to Villa of £2million. Benitez said of the deal, [...] "We do not want to sell him, we are very happy with Scott. But he needs to play to keep up his England place." [...] Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill preferred Carson to Thomas Sørensen and Stuart Taylor, and Carson played in all but three of Villa's 38 league matches, missing the two matches against Liverpool as he was ineligible to play, and kept 11 clean sheets during the 2007–08 season. He received the first red card of his career when he fouled Carlos Tevez in Villa's 4–1 Premier League defeat to Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|Some {{development}} of the navigation occurred. In 1744, the undertakers bought some land at Airmyn, and developed warehousing and wharfage there, as a more convenient point than Rawcliffe, where the water was shallower. In the 1760s, £13,000 was spent on improvements and maintenance, with several weirs being rebuilt to improve the depth of water. There was a long-running dispute with Arthur Ingram, who owned Knottingley mill, which started in 1731, and was not finally resolved until 1776, when the company bought both of Ingram's mills. Despite this, the general profitability of the navigation led the undertakers to be complacent about its development. They asked John Smeaton to suggest improvements in 1771, but the subsequent attempt to authorise such improvements was disputed in Parliament {{on the basis that}} the present navigation was totally inadequate. The recently finished Calder and Hebble Navigation proposed to build a canal from Wakefield to the Dutch River, which would bypass the Calder completely, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal supported a Leeds to Selby canal, which would bypass the Aire. During 1772, they asked Smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower Aire, but his assistant, William Jessop actually carried out the work. He proposed a [...] canal from Haddlesey lock to the Ouse at Newland. With Parliament not reaching a decision, they re-worked their plan, which was <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] canal from Haddlesey to Selby, with a new cut from Ferrybridge to Beal, and improvements above Castleford. In 1774 the Leeds to Selby bill was rejected by Parliament, but the Aire and Calder bill was passed, with a few amendments.|$|E

2500|$|This {{counterexample}} {{has been}} modified subsequently by Ploščica and Tůma to a direct semilattice construction. For a (∨,0)-semilattice, the larger semilattice R(S) is the (∨,0)-semilattice freely generated by new elements t(a,b,c), for a, b, c in S such that c ≤ a ∨ b, {{subjected to the}} only relations c=t(a,b,c) ∨ t(b,a,c) and t(a,b,c) ≤ a. Iterating this construction gives the free distributive extension [...] of S. <b>Now,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> set Ω, let L(Ω) be the (∨,0)-semilattice defined by generators 1 and ai,x, for i<2 and x in Ω, and relations a0,x ∨ a1,x=1, for any x in Ω.

Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: [...] "That's what we need today.

2500|$|Sanders {{voted against}} the resolutions authorizing {{the use of force}} against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and opposed the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. Sanders voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, Sanders stated: [...] "The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> serious investigation of how we got into the war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first hinted at during E3 2009 by EA’s CEO, John Riccitiello. Riccitiello stated that Criterion Games, {{developers}} of EA's own Burnout series, {{was working on}} a [...] "revolutionary" [...] addition to the Need for Speed franchise, stating: [...] "We don't have a plan right <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> separate major launch on Burnout, because the team doing it is working on a revolutionary take on Need for Speed." [...] The title was confirmed to be in development by EA's chief operating officer, John Pleasants, at a Stock meeting in June 2009, where he stated: [...] "We've taken the Burnout team and combined it with our Need for Speed franchise. So we now have that in our favor because that Burnout team {{is probably one of the}} more online-centric and notably high-quality game developers that we have out at Criterion." [...] Shift producer, Jesse Abney, expressed his delight to work with Criterion Games, stating that it would be a [...] "great team to work with on that stuff," [...] referencing the development of Need for Speed. [...] It was reported that the game was scheduled for release in Q4 2010. EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, [...] "a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio," [...] in a post-financial report conference call. The title was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010, with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer. According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.|$|E
