Many advances have recently been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which plants take up and accumulate micronutrients such as iron, zinc, copper and manganese. Some of these mechanisms however, also facilitate the accumulation of <b>non-essential</b> toxic <b>elements</b> such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As). In humans, Cd and As intake has been associated with multiple disorders including kidney failure, diabetes, cancer and mental health issues. Recent studies have shown that some transporters can discriminate between essential metals and <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements.</b> Furthermore, sequestration of <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> in roots has been described in several plant species as a key process limiting the translocation of <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> to aboveground edible tissues, including seeds. Increasing the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients (biofortification) in grains while lowering the accumulation of <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> will likely require the concerted action of several transporters.

40|$|Cistus ladanifer L. {{is one of}} the {{spontaneous}} species from Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) considered promising for phytostabilisation of mining areas. Although the plant-soil relationships of some potentially hazardous elements (e. g. As, Pb, Cu and Zn) are known, for other elements also potentially hazardous and non-essential this information is scarce. However, in soils with multielemental contamination and for landscape rehabilitation processes, these elements should also be considered. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer in the phytostabilisation of the soils, developed on different contaminated substrata (e. g. mine wastes, schists and greywackes or their mixtures) and containing <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb and Sr), from three Portuguese IPB mining areas (Caveira, Lousal and Sao Domingos). The uptake, accumulation and translocation of these <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> and their influence on the concentrations of beneficial elements (Co, Na and Se) and major nutrients were studied. Multielemental contaminated soils from the three mining areas had high total concentrations of some <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> (Ba and Sb for the three mines and Se for Caveira and Sao Domingo s). Soil available fraction of the studied elements were usually small (1) of the studied <b>elements</b> (even the <b>non-essentials),</b> but small accumulation in the shoots (mg/kg-Ag, Bi, Sb and Se: < 1. 6; Ba, Cd, Co and Sr: 0. 05 - 37. 8; Al and Na: 49 - 2503), independently of the mine area. Elemental concentrations in the shoots were below the limit values indicated for phytotoxicity and toxicity for domestic animals intake. Although the statistical negative influence of Ag, Sb and Sr on the concentrations of the beneficial elements (Na) and nutrients (Ca and Fe) in roots or shoots had been obtained, no visual symptoms was observed in the plants. Cistus ladanifer plants from the studied populations can be considered non-accumulators and excluders of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Sr and Sb (soil-plant transfer coefficient << 1) and beneficial elements. Although plants from Sao Domingos and, in some cases, from Caveira can be accumulators of Cd, the concentrations of Cd in the shoots were small (< 0. 2 mg/kg) and did not represent any environmental risk. Due to its adaptability, tolerance and standard plant behaviours in the three mining areas, C. ladanifer will be a good choice for phytostabilisation of soils contaminated with <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B.

Methods: The samples were acid digested, then analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma system (ICP-Optical Emission Spectrophotometer). Results: Levels of metals {{were found in the}} decreasing order: Cd>Co>Ni>Pb>B >Cr>Zn>Mg>Mn>Cu>Fe>Al. The soil held more levels of metals than plant parts, but within the permissible limits of concentration. Bark and root accumulated higher levels of trace elements in a magnitude of 10 - 80 folds than other plant parts. The overall bioaccumulation factor in the sampling sites of Vellar, Pichavaram and Cuddalore was 2. 88, 1. 42 0. 47 respectively. Essential elements accumulate high in mature mangroves forest while <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> accumulate high in the industrially polluted mangroves. Conclusions: The ratio between essential and <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements</b> was found higher in young mangrove forest than that in mature mangrove forest and polluted mangrove areas.

Potassium silicate is the main source of soluble potassium and silicon. In general, plants require silica to resist against biotic and abiotic stress (Ma 2004).

After sequencing, 55 known miRNAs and 129 novel miRNAs were obtained, and 104 target genes for the miRNAs were identified by degradome sequencing.

Increased mortality rates of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) in waters off a major urbanised centre triggered investigations into the threats to these species, including their contaminant exposure.

Subsequent blood biomonitoring of three additional coastal populations, which forage in areas dominated by agricultural, urban and military activities, showed clear habitat-specific differences in blood metal profiles relative to the those observed in the offshore population. Coastal turtles were most often found to have elevated concentrations of Co, Mo, Mn, Mg, Na, As, Sb, and Pb relative to the corresponding RIs. In particular, blood from turtles from the agricultural site had Co concentrations ranging from 160 to 840 μg/L (4 – 25 times above RI), which are within the order expected to elicit acute effects in many vertebrates. Additional clinical blood biochemistry and haematology results indicate signs of a systemic disease and the prevalence of an active inflammatory response in a high proportion (44 %) of turtles from the agricultural site.

40|$|Soilless {{cultivation}} systems {{represent an}} alternative to traditional agriculture, as they offer the possibility to reduce water use and to design nutrient formulations of the hydroponic solutions {{in order to maximize}} yield and quality of the products. Reduction in accumulation of undesired compounds, like e. g. nitrate, and enhanced nutritional value for human consumption, like e. g. Se-rich compounds, could be reasonably achieved. These aspects, together with the extension of the shelf life, would increase the market value of ready-to-cut vegetables. This review discusses how recent advances in understanding the role of plant nutrients and their interactions and the management of nutrient solution composition, including the addition of <b>non-essential</b> <b>elements,</b> micronutrients' biofortification, biostimulants, together with the control of some crucial environmental conditions, like temperature, can help accomplishing this task...|$|R
