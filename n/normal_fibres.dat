40|$|Study {{objective}} - The aim of {{the study}} was to investigate the electrophysiological effects of acetylcholine in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction. Design - Infarction in canine hearts was produced by coronary occlusion. Ischaemic tissue was removed and surviving Purkinje fibres were compared for effects of increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (1 - 100 μM) with control Purkinje fibres from normal hearts and normal Purkinje fibres treated with barium. Subjects - Experimental animals were mongrel dogs of either sex, weight 10 - 15 kg, n = 14 (control), 9 (infarction group), 11 (Ba treated group). Measurements and main results - Acetylcholine caused concentration dependent shortening of action potential duration in normal Purkinje fibres and in fibres surviving infarction, but had no effect when potassium conductance was decreases with Ba. Acetylcholine induced a small hyperpolarisation in normal Purkinje fibres and in fibres surviving infarction perfused with a 4 mM potassium solution without affecting action potential amplitude or dV/dt(max). Reduction in K concentration to 1 and 2 mM caused a greater depolarisation of diastolic potential in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> than in fibres surviving infarction or Ba treated fibres. Acetylcholine produced hyperpolarisation under these conditions in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> only. Acetylcholine decreased automaticity in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> only at high concentration (100 μM). A lesser effect was seen in Ba treated fibres and in fibres surviving infarction. Conclusions - Since Ba treated Purkinje fibres had similar action potential characteristics to those seen in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction and responded in the same way to the modifications of K concentration, a decrease in K conductance might be the underlying mechanism for some of the electrophysiological changes in fibres surviving infarction. The results also suggest that after 24 h ischaemia, surviving Purkinje fibres have a different sensitivity to acetylcholine from <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{muscles of}} the mdx mouse lack {{dystrophin}} offering the possibility to study the role of intracellular Ca 2 + ions in fibre degeneration. Flexor digitorum brevis muscles of 3 -month-old mdx and normal mice were dissociated with collagenase; fibres were maintained in culture for 6 days (d 0 to d 5) and their survival was assessed. Cytosolic [Ca 2 +], passive Mn 2 + influx (indicative of Ca 2 + influx) and activity of mechanosensitive/voltage-independent Ca 2 + channels were studied over the same period. Survival of <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> declined steadily from d 0 to d 3, but an acceleration of fibre death occurred in mdx fibres from d 1 to d 2. This could be greatly reduced but not abolished by lowering external [Ca 2 +] 10 -fold. In the d 0 -d 5 period, both mdx and <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> showed transient increases of Mn 2 + influx and activity of the Ca 2 + channels; these peaked at d 1 and disappeared by d 3 –d 4. Increases were always significantly larger in mdx fibres. Altogether, over the 6 days, 130 paired measurements of [Ca 2 +]i and Mn 2 + influx were made on 68 fibres from mdx and 62 fibres from normal mice. In 90 % of the fibres, [Ca 2 +]i remained within the 25 – 85 nm limits while Mn 2 + influx varied more than 10 -fold. The median for Mn 2 + influx was 45 % greater in fibres from mdx mice than in fibres from control C 57 mice. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between [Ca 2 +]i medians in fibres from normal and mdx mice. Addition of 25 – 75 nm of a Ca 2 + ionophore (4 -bromo-A 23187) to the medium did not affect the level of cytosolic [Ca 2 +] in both types of fibres, while markedly increasing the rate of Mn 2 + influx, as expected. Thus, Ca 2 + homeostasis was equally robust in mdx and <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> The remaining 10 % of the fibres showed, at d 1, high levels of Mn 2 + influx and/or elevated [Ca 2 +]i above 100 nm. This did not affect survival of <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> but was probably responsible of the increased death rate in mdx fibres...|$|E
40|$|Myelinated nerve fibres with {{a reduced}} safety factor for {{conduction}} due to demyelination are easily blocked by trains of impulses. To find out why, in vivo recordings from rat ventral root fibres demyelinated with diphtheria toxin have been supplemented with in vivo and in vitro recordings from <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> Despite a small rise in extracellular potassium activity, <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> were invariably hyperpolarized by intermittent trains of impulses. This hyperpolarization {{resulted in an}} increase in threshold and also in an enhancement of the depolarizing after-potential and the superexcitable period. Replacement of NaCl in the extracellular solution by LiCl completely blocked both the membrane hyperpolarization and the threshold increase which were normally observed during intermittent trains of impulses. At demyelinated nodes which were blocked by trains of impulses (10 - 50 Hz), conduction block was preceded by a rise in threshold current and {{in an increase in}} internodal conduction time, but by no detectable reduction in the outward current generated by the preceding node. It was found possible to prevent the threshold from changing during a train by automatic adjustment of a d. c. polarizing current. This 'threshold clamp' prevented the conduction failure and virtually abolished the changes in internodal conduction time. The threshold changes were attributed to hyperpolarization, as in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres,</b> since (a) the polarizing current required to prevent them was always a depolarizing current, and (b) they were accompanied by an increase in superexcitability. The post-tetanic depression that can follow continuous trains of impulses was attributed to the combination of increased threshold and enhanced superexcitable period due to hyperpolarization. It is concluded that the susceptibility of these demyelinated fibres to impulse trains is not due to a membrane depolarization induced by extracellular potassium accumulation but to a membrane hyperpolarization as a consequence of electrogenic sodium pumping. ...|$|E

The role of potassium and sodium-calcium exchange currents on action potential duration was therefore investigated in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction and in <b>normal</b> Purkinje <b>fibres.</b> Barium {{was used to}} reduce potassium conductance and replacement of sodium chloride by lithium chloride was used to reduce the sodium-calcium exchange current. Barium (1 x 10 - 5 to 3 x 10 - 5 M) produced a concentration dependent lenghthening of action potential duration in <b>normal</b> Purkinje <b>fibres</b> but these concentrations had no effect in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction. The resting membrane potential, activation voltage, amplitude and V̇(max) were decreased in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction and in barium treated <b>fibres</b> v <b>normal</b> Purkinje <b>fibres.</b> These results show that action potential characteristics of barium treated <b>normal</b> Purkinje <b>fibres</b> closely resemble those seen in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction. A similar reduction of action potential duration was seen in <b>normal</b> Purkinje <b>fibres,</b> fibres surviving infarction and barium treated fibres when the sodium 'window' current was decreased by lignocaine. Without any effect on the V̇(max), the replacement of sodium chloride by lithium chloride resulted in a similar effect on the action potential duration in <b>normal</b> Purkinje <b>fibres</b> and fibres surviving infarction.

40|$|Voltage clamp {{currents}} {{were recorded}} during iontophoretic application of steady doses of acetylcholine (ACh), carbachol or suberyldicholine to hyperpersensitive extrasynaptic regions of chronically denervated frog muscle fibers. Autocorrelation functions of drug induced current fluctuations were calculated and estimates of conductance gamma and average open time tau of the extrasynaptic ion channels were derived. 2. The average open time of an extrajunctional channel induced by acetylcholine is tauACh = 11 +/− 1 − 6 msec (+/− S. E.) at − 80 mV and 8 degrees C. Carbachol and suberyldicholine open channels of tauCarb = 3 − 9 +/− 0 − 4 msec and tauSubCh = 19 +/− 2 − 5 msec (+/− S. E.) duration {{under the same}} conditions. The average open time of the extrasynaptic channel produced by each drug is {{three to five times}} longer than the value found for junctional channels in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> 3. The average open time of the extrajunctional channel is dependent on temperature and membrane potential. Lowering the temperature or increasing the membrane potential increases the average open time of the channels induced by any one of the drugs. 4. The conductance of a single extrajunctional channel opened by the action of acetylcholine is estimated to be gammaextra = 15 +/− 1 − 8 pmho (+/− S. E.). This is somewhat lower than the value of gammaep = 23 +/− 2 pmho (+/− S. E.) found for the conductance of a single open channel in the junctional membrane of <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> The extrasynaptic channels opened by the action of carbachol and suberyldicholine have similar conductances to those produced by ACh. 5. The autocorrelation function of drug−induced current fluctuations, recorded at the former end−plate region of chronically denervated fibres often shows both a fast and a slow time constant. They correspond in value to the time constant of the autocorrelation function obtained from end−plate currents in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> and from extrasynaptic currents in denervated fibres respectively. This could indicate that two populations of channels exist at the former end−plate region of denervated muscle fibre...|$|E
40|$|The myoplasmic free [Ca 2 +] {{transient}} elicited by {{an action}} potential (Δ[Ca 2 +]) was compared in fast-twitch fibres of mdx (dystrophin null) and normal mice. Methods were used that maximized {{the likelihood that}} any detected differences apply in vivo. Small bundles of fibres were manually dissected from extensor digitorum longus muscles of 7 - to 14 -week-old mice. One fibre within a bundle was microinjected with furaptra, a low-affinity rapidly responding fluorescent calcium indicator. A fibre was accepted for study if it gave a stable, all-or-nothing fluorescence response to an external shock. In 18 <b>normal</b> <b>fibres,</b> the peak amplitude and the full-duration at half-maximum (FDHM) of Δ[Ca 2 +] were 18. 4 ± 0. 5 μm and 4. 9 ± 0. 2 ms, respectively (mean ±s. e. m.; 16 °C). In 13 mdx fibres, the corresponding values were 14. 5 ± 0. 6 μm and 4. 7 ± 0. 2 ms. The difference in amplitude is statistically highly significant (P= 0. 0001; two-tailed t test), whereas the difference in FDHM is not (P= 0. 3). A multi-compartment computer model was used to estimate the amplitude and time course of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release flux underlying Δ[Ca 2 +]. Estimates were made based on several differing assumptions: (i) that the resting myoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]R) and the total concentration of parvalbumin ([ParvT]) are the same in mdx and <b>normal</b> <b>fibres,</b> (ii) that [Ca 2 +]R is larger in mdx fibres, (iii) that [ParvT] is smaller in mdx fibres, and (iv) that [Ca 2 +]R is larger and [ParvT] is smaller in mdx fibres. According to the simulations, the 21 % smaller amplitude of Δ[Ca 2 +] in mdx fibres {{in combination with the}} unchanged FDHM of Δ[Ca 2 +] is consistent with mdx fibres having a ∼ 25 % smaller flux amplitude, a 6 – 23 % larger FDHM of the flux, and a 9 – 20 % smaller total amount of released Ca 2 + than <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> The changes in flux are probably due to a change in the gating of the SR Ca 2 +-release channels and/or in their single channel flux.

We observed minimal differences in the T-system structure and the T-system electrical propagation was not different between normal and mdx mice. Whereas the maximum Ca 2 + release elicited by voltage pulses was reduced by ∼ 67 % in mdx fibres, in agreement with previous results obtained using AP stimulation, the voltage dependence of SR Ca 2 + release was identical to that seen in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> Taken together, our data suggest that the intrinsic ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca 2 + may be altered in the mdx mouse...|$|E

40|$|The {{simplest}} {{model for}} explaining conduction defects in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases {{assumes that the}} only abnormality present is loss of myelin. The consequences of such an assumption have been investigated by numerical solution of a well-known set of differential equations describing conduction in a model demyelinated axon. In agreement with clinical findings, we show that this model predicts that the temperature at which conduction block occurs is a steep function {{of the extent of}} demyelination, so that small temperature increases may block large numbers of conducting fibres. Decreasing calcium concentration (or increasing pH) is calculated markedly to improve the conduction velocity of conducting demyelinated fibres and will, in addition, restore conduction in blocked fibres. The effects of other pharmacological agents have also been computed. The presence of a demyelinating lesion in a nerve fibre is shown greatly to impair the ability of the fibre to conduct repetitive impulses, conduction failing at much lower frequencies than in <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> These calculations provide some insight into the nature of conduction defects in demyelinated nerve, demonstrate that many clinical features of MS are the expected consequence of loss of myelin and do not require the presence of other defects for their explanation, and provide a useful approach to the search for a symptomatic therapy...|$|E

40|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{an optical}} fibre over 1000 - 1150 C is studied by inscribing an optical fibre Bragg grating that can withstand temperatures up to 1200 C and monitoring fibre elongation under load through the Bragg wavelength shift. This optical interrogation offers high {{accuracy and reliability}} compared with direct measurements of elongation, particularly at lower temperatures, thus avoiding significant experimental error. An excellent Arrhenius fit is obtained from which an activation energy for viscous flow of Ea = 450 kJ mol - 1 is extracted; addition of an additional temperature-dependent pre-exponential does not change this value. The log plot of viscosity is found overall {{to be consistent with}} that reported in the literature for silica measurements on rods and beams, but substantially higher than past work reported for optical fibres. The annealing and strain temperatures for an optical fibre were derived as 1114 C and 1010 C. However, it is shown that, because regenerated gratings already involve a post-annealing process at higher temperature, the structures are equilibrated and much more relaxed compared with <b>normal</b> <b>fibres,</b> making viscosity measurements meaningful. This work highlights the need to stabilize components for operation in harsh environments before their application, despite some mechanical compromise.

According to our observations, {{the process was}} divided into four main stages: (a) During the first 3 days prominent degenerative events took place in skeletal muscle fibres, capillaries, arteries, veins and intramuscular nerves. An inflammatory infiltrate was abundant after the first day and removal of necrotic material was well advanced by the third day. (b) Muscle regeneration was evident by the fourth day. From 4 to 6 days there were two populations of regenerating muscle fibres, one of apparently <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> located in areas where capillary vessels were abundant, and another population of groups of regenerative fibres showing signs of degeneration. This second type of fibre was predominant {{in areas where the}} number of capillaries was greatly reduced. (c) One and 2 weeks after envenomation areas of small regenerative fibres of normal morphology and areas of degenerating regenerative fibres were observed. The latter were abundant in regions of dense fibrotic tissue and scarce capillaries. (d) Finally, at 4 and 8 weeks after envenomation there were both areas of fibrosis and areas where regenerating muscle fibres predominated. However, the diameter of these fibres was abnormally small, an indication that they may have been atrophic fibres. It is suggested that muscle regeneration is partially impaired after myonecrosis induced by Bothrops asper venom, probably due to the damage induced by this venom on muscle microvasculature and nerves.

The increased sensitivity of the ischemic myocardium to anti-arrhythmic drugs resulting in greater reductions of V̇(max) and conduction may contribute to a greater potency of anti-arrhythmic drugs in the suppression of arrhythmias associated with ischemia. Conversely, while slowing of conduction can abolish re-entry arrhythmias by producing a bidirectional block, further slowing of conduction by anti-arrhythmic drugs can favour the development of new re-entry pathways and may contribute to their pro-arrhythmic effects. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Duchenne muscular dystrophy, {{primarily}} {{caused by}} a deficiency in the membrane cytoskeletal protein dystrophin, is the most frequent neuromuscular disorder in humans and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. This review outlines pathophysiological mechanisms of abnormal calcium handling by the sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria that may contribute to muscle fibre destruction. Dystrophindeficient skeletal muscle membranes succumb to exercise-induced membrane ruptures more frequently than those of <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> These transient micro-ruptures allow for the insertion of calcium leak channels into the sarcolemma during the natural processes of cell membrane resealing. Ion leak channels give rise to localized calcium elevations, contributing to a cycle of enhanced protease activity and leak channel activation. Within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, loss of the calsequestrin-like proteins may contribute to decreased luminal calcium buffering. This might indirectly amplify elevated free cytosolic calcium concentrations. Mitochondria proximal to ryanodine receptor calcium release channel complexes, although thought to buffer channel leakiness, may give rise {{to an increase in}} proapoptotic signals, ultimately giving rise to muscle cell death. Here, we summarise the potential effects of abnormal calcium homeostasis on fibre degeneration in dystrophic skeletal muscle.

Animals with GF exhibited the highest pHu (BF: 5. 83 vs 5. 76, P< 0. 05), percentages (BF: 5. 3 vs 3. 6 %, P< 0. 10) and cross-sectional area (LL: 1643 vs 1243 m 2, P< 0. 01) of R fibres. Increasing numbers of GF in BF muscle also led to an increase in percentage of R fibres (P< 0. 05), aldolase activity (P< 0. 01), and pHu (P< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} in adult dogs {{in order to}} study our reported observation of <b>normal</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> in the intermediate and distal segments of nerves completely separated from the proximal stump {{for more than six}} months. The results obtained confirmed once more our previous observation: there are <b>normal</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> and nerve bundles repopulating the pattern fascicles of the completely separated intermediate and distal segments of the ulnar nerve, although all other nerves of the operated limb, including the proximal stump of the ulnar, show a typical Wallerian degeneration. It seems, therefore, that these <b>fibres</b> of <b>normal</b> appearance must have arisen from a source other than the proximal ulnar nerve stump, neighbour nerves or "Nervi-vasorum". More concrete data about these findings are naturally necessary and our experiments are going on. Even so, as stated before, the practical results obtained up to now in more than one hundred and fifty patients allows us to go on recommending strongly, based on our observations, that proper nerve suture or neurolisys of long-time severed nerves by accident are worth while even after delays of many years...|$|R

40|$|Ganglionic and aganglionic {{full-thickness}} samples, at 4 {{levels of}} the colon of 26 infants with Hirschsprung's disease, were studied by immunohistochemistry. In the distal part of the aganglionic bowel, we observe a decrease of substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide, an absence of methionine-enkephalin {{and an increase in}} neuropeptide Y nerve fibres. When detected, substance P and vasointestinal peptide are mainly present in abnormal bundle nerve fibres. In the middle part of the aganglionic bowel, a slight {{increase in the number of}} <b>normal</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> containing substance P, methionine-enkephalin and vasoactive intestinal peptide is observed. Some vasoactive intestinal peptide abnormal bundle nerve fibres are detected. They are less numerous than in the distal part. In the proximal ganglionic bowel, the number of vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and methionine-enkephalin <b>normal</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> is increased compared to the middle aganglionic segment but is slightly lower than in the normal colon. Again vasoactive intestinal peptide abnormal bundle nerve fibres are present at that level and are also detected in more proximal ganglionic bowel up to the hepatic flexure of the colon. Thus, abnormal distribution of neuropeptides is also found in more proximal ganglionic bowel and not only in the aganglionic segment of bowel usually specific of Hirschsprung's disease. © 1989.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exercise}} on skeletal muscle are mediated by a coupling between muscle electrical activity and gene expression. Several activity correlates, such as intracellular Ca 2 +, hypoxia and metabolites like {{free fatty acids}} (FFAs), might initiate signalling pathways regulating fibre-type-specific genes. FFAs can be sensed by lipid-dependent transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. We found that the mRNA for the predominant muscle isoform, PPARδ, was three-fold higher in the slow/oxidative soleus compared to the fast/glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. In histological sections of the soleus, the most oxidative fibres display {{the highest levels of}} PPARδ protein. When the soleus muscle was stimulated electrically by a pattern mimicking fast/glycolytic IIb motor units, the mRNA level of PPARδ was reduced to less than half within 24 h. In the EDL, a three-fold increase was observed after slow type I-like electrical stimulation. When a constitutively active form of PPARδ was overexpressed for 14 days in normally active adult fibres after somatic gene transfer, the number of I/IIa hybrids in the EDL more than tripled, IIa fibres increased from 14 % to 25 %, and IIb fibres decreased from 55 % to 45 %. The level of succinate dehydrogenase activity increased and size decreased, also when compared to <b>normal</b> <b>fibres</b> of the same type. Thus PPARδ can change myosin heavy chain, oxidative enzymes and size locally in muscle cells in the absence of general exercise. Previous studies on PPARδ in muscle have been performed in transgenic animals where the transgene has been present during muscle development. Our data suggest that PPARδ can mediate activity effects acutely in pre-existing adult fibres, and thus is an important link in excitation–transcription coupling...|$|E
40|$|Progressive X-linked muscular {{dystrophy}} represents {{the most commonly}} inherited neuromuscular disorder in humans. Although the primary abnormality lies {{with the loss of}} dystrophin and reduction of its associated glycoprotein complex, secondary alterations in metabolic pathways, cellular signalling and ion homeostasis regulation cause fibre degeneration leading to severe muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle deteriorates to the extent that sufferers are wheelchair bound by early adulthood and severe diaphragm degeneration can lead to respiratory failure. Therapy in this area has lengthened life-span but at a more advanced stage of the disease, most Duchenne {{muscular dystrophy}} patients suffer cardiomyopathic complications. The {{purpose of this study was}} to carry out proteomic profiling on differentially affected dystrophic tissues. Differences in protein concentration levels of the severely affected cardiac muscle and the naturally protected extraocular muscle were used to explore pathogenesis of the disease. A mass spectrometry-based approach combined with the highly sensitive difference in-gel electrophoresis technique was used to reveal changes and identify novel biomarkers in the dystrophic tissues. Following the pathogenesis of the disease the naturally protected tissue displayed only moderate changes in protein concentration expression. With a replacement of dystrophin with its homologue utrophin, restoration of β-dystroglycan was observed along with an increased concentration in heat shock proteins. While the severely affected cardiac muscle exhibited drastic decreases in the expression levels of many proteins involved in energy metabolism including adenylate kinase and many ATP synthase isoforms. Reduced concentrations were also observed in numerous contractile proteins and intermediate filament proteins. With the loss of these structural elements, a drastic increase in stress proteins was observed within dystrophic myofibrils compared to <b>normal</b> <b>fibres.</b> This thesis has successfully identified novel biomarkers that may be used to determine suitability of new treatments or therapies of muscular dystrophy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Neurological {{features}} {{are common in}} mitochondrial diseases because tissues depending upon oxidative phosphorylation {{bear the brunt of}} the pathogenesis. The 3243 A>G mutation in the MTTL 1 gene in mitochondrial DNA is regarded as the most frequent mitchondrial point mutation and classically presents with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Myopathy and peripheral neuropathy have been documented in patients with mitochondrial diseases, but not properly characterised in patients with the 3243 A>G mutation. We have previously determined the prevalence of patients with this mutation in a defined population in northern Finland. The clinical spectrum and molecular aspects of myopathy and peripheral neuropathy are analysed here in a population-based cohort of patients with 3243 A>G. Fifty patients were examined neurologically in order to define the frequency of myopathy and its histological, ultrastructural and clinical features. The frequency and phenotypic variability of peripheral neuropathy were determined in 32 patients and muscle computed tomography findings recorded in 24 patients. Finally, variations in mutation heteroplasmy were analysed in 10 patients using single muscle fibre PCR analysis. The frequency of peripheral neuropathy was 22 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 9 – 40 %) and that of clinical myopathy 50 % (95 % CI, 36 – 64 %). Moderate limb weakness was the most common myopathic feature, but mild weakness and external ophthalmoplegia were also present. CT scans revealed myopathic changes in 54 % of the patients (95 % CI, 33 – 76 %), most frequently in the pelvic muscles. The incidence of myopathy was highest in the fifth decade of life, and higher age and male gender increased the risk of neuropathy. Muscle histology was abnormal in 72 % of the cases examined (95 % CI, 55 – 86 %). The presence of intramitochondrial crystals and COX-negative fibres and variations in {{the size and shape of}} mitochondria were more common in the muscle of myopathic patients. Single muscle fibre analysis pointed to a correlation between the mutation load in ragged red fibres and in adjacent histologically <b>normal</b> <b>fibres,</b> and the proportion of 3243 A>G in histologically normal muscle fibres showed a pattern compatible with random genetic drift. The results indicate that myopathy and peripheral neuropathy are common in patients with the 3243 A>G and that myopathy is highly variable in presentation. Segregation of 3243 A>G in individual muscle fibres showed a complex process with random and non-random elements...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of direct electrical stimulation of denervated muscle {{was used to}} study the role of muscle activity per se in controlling the passive electrical properties of muscle fibres. 2. Specific membrane resistance and capacitance of the denervated and the denervated-stimulated muscle fibres were measured by a sinewave technique at frequencies between 5 and 240 Hz. The parameter values were constant at low frequencies up to a variable transition frequency and declined rapidly at higher frequencies. 3. Following denervation the low-frequency value of specific membrane resistance increased (2291 omega cm 2 for 19 -day denervated fibres vs. 766 omega cm 2 for innervated fibres), the specific membrane capacitance declined (2 - 7 muF/cm 2 vs. 3 - 6 muF/cm 2) and the transition frequency shifted towards lower frequencies. The specific internal resistance was higher in denervated fibres (301 omega cm for 19 -day denervated fibres vs. 240 omega cm in innervated fibres) apart from a transient decline after 5 days of denervation (164 omega cm). 4. Direct electrical stimulation for 2 weeks beginning on the 5 th day after denervation restored all parameters listed above to their original values before denervation. 5. Stimulation arrested in most cases further atrophy {{from the time of}} stimulation but did not restore <b>normal</b> <b>fibre</b> size...|$|R

40|$|Rabbit tibialis {{anterior}} (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) {{muscles are}} used extensively {{in studies of}} stimulation-induced fibre type transformation, but the proportions and sizes of the 2 main fibre types, {{and the way in}} which they are distributed within the muscles, have never been described in any detail. In this study, transverse sections were processed by enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques and assessed morphometrically. The data were analysed by multivariate methods. In both TA and EDL muscles, the proportion of type 1 fibres varied significantly, and to a similar extent, within a cross-section, from lateral to medial and from superficial to deep parts. The fibre density, an indirect estimate of the mean muscle fibre area, also varied significantly, but not systematically, within a cross-section. For the EDL muscle, the proportion of type 1 fibres was consistently higher in the distal than in the proximal part of the muscle. The proportion of type 1 fibres was also significantly higher in the EDL than in the TA muscle for each of the 6 rabbits. There was no systematic variation between muscles from left and right limbs. The type proportions and fibre densities for both TA and EDL muscles differed significantly between individual rabbits, but not between sexes. The study provides a database that has hitherto been lacking on <b>normal</b> <b>fibre</b> type composition and its variation within and between these experimentally important muscles.
