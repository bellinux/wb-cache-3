25|$|The {{inscription}} {{was dedicated}} by Legio X Fretensis {{to the emperor}} Hadrian in the year 129/130 CE.

25|$|The essay {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} as one of Weber's criticisms of Karl Marx and his theories. While Marx's historical materialism held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen The Protestant Ethic as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around.|$|E

25|$|These other forms, {{particularly}} the last, are becoming less common {{as they are}} increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife {{is expected to take}} her husband's name but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around). Additionally, in Spain and some other countries it is becoming more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father.|$|E

25|$|Greenleaf's contemporaries {{and modern}} historians dispute Greenleaf's {{account of his}} {{marriage}} and divorce. Historian Allen Clark, who in the late 19th century interviewed contemporaries of Greenleaf's, dismissed the account of deception {{and said that the}} couple fell in love and, after a three-month romance, married. But Greenleaf's critics in the 1820s and 1830s said Greenleaf seduced the baroness to gain access to Dutch banking circles and capital for real estate investing. There is dispute about the divorce as well. Historians Joseph Smith and Julius Goebel claim the baroness divorced Greenleaf (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around).|$|E

25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris {{greater than that of}} saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.|$|E
25|$|The CALF was a DARPA {{program to}} develop a STOVL strike fighter (SSF) for the United States Marine Corps and {{replacement}} for the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The United States Air Force passed over the F-16 Agile Falcon in the late 1980s, essentially an enlarged F-16, and continued to mull other designs. In 1992, the Marine Corps and Air Force agreed to jointly develop the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, also known as Advanced Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (ASTOVL). CALF project was chosen after Paul Bevilaqua persuaded the Air Force that his team's concept (if stripped of its lift system) had potential as a complement to the F-22 Raptor. Thus, {{in a sense the}} F-35B begat the F-35A, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around.|$|E
25|$|In the 1780s, Wells and a {{few others}} had the idea that dew and frost {{occurred}} when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of water vapor in the air caused by just the right combination of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and heat conductivity of materials.|$|E

25|$|On Philadelphia's next drive, {{the referees}} made two suspect decisions. The {{first was a}} non-call on a very obvious {{facemask}} on Brian Westbrook {{that would have given}} the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Stalin's death in 1953, the Central Committee had become largely a {{symbolic}} organ that was responsible to the Politburo, and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around. The death of Stalin revitalised the Central Committee, and it became an important institution during the power struggle to succeed Stalin. Following Khrushchev's ascension to power, the Central Committee still played a leading role; it overturned the Politburo's decision to remove Khrushchev from office in 1957. In 1964, the Central Committee ousted Khrushchev from power, and elected Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary. The Central Committee was an important organ {{in the beginning of}} Brezhnev's rule, but lost effective power to the Politburo. From then on, until the ascension of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Central Committee played a minor role in the running of the party and state– the Politburo was the highest political organ in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|A {{rectifier}} used in high-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) power transmission systems and industrial processing between about 1909 to 1975 is a mercury-arc rectifier or mercury-arc valve. The device is enclosed in a bulbous glass vessel or large metal tub. One electrode, the cathode, is submerged {{in a pool}} of liquid mercury {{at the bottom of the}} vessel and one or more high purity graphite electrodes, called anodes, are suspended above the pool. There may be several auxiliary electrodes to aid in starting and maintaining the arc. When an electric arc is established between the cathode pool and suspended anodes, a stream of electrons flows from the cathode to the anodes through the ionized mercury, but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> (in principle, this is a higher-power counterpart to flame rectification, which uses the same one-way current transmission properties of the plasma naturally present in a flame).|$|E
50|$|Besides {{uncompressed}} formats and {{lossless compression}} formats that {{can usually be}} interconverted without any loss of detail, there are compressed formats such as JPEG, which lose detail on nearly every compress.

50|$|X-linked {{dominant}} traits do {{not necessarily}} affect males more than females (unlike X-linked recessive traits).

25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around. The second is that civilians must articulate a clear vision of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E
25|$|With every geometry, Felix Klein {{associated}} {{an underlying}} group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically {{represented as a}} hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved {{with respect to the}} Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is a priori meaningful in affine geometry; but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).|$|E
25|$|In a {{shocking}} twist however, the entire {{chain of events}} is revealed to have been engineered {{by none other than}} Argus Pytel himself: a top ranking intelligence officer and a Collaborationist, he engineered for both Resistance groups to embark on suicidal missions, confident of the Empire's chance to recover quickly from any damage via its control over the timeline. The rebel crew member aboard the Cobalt King was actually killed by Pytel and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around, a fact he took advantage of to trick his father's faction into action. The plan however took yet another unexpected turn when, surprising the attacker of the Domus and shooting him down with a barrage of missiles, he was horrified to discover he had just killed his own father. Meanwhile, approximately a thousand years later, Akyta was herself met with a defeat as the Ophan, upon critically malfunctioning, activated the Project's self-destruct system, detonating the facility and killing the Enkie slaves, effectively eradicating the entire Enkie race.|$|E

Similarly to ibid., we provide a characterization of these relations and show that one-sided>>-closed relations are one-sided admissible but <b>not</b> necessarily <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> round.
