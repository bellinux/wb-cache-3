25|$|The alphaviruses are small, spherical, enveloped viruses with a genome of {{a single}} {{positive}} sense strand RNA. The total genome length ranges between 11,000 and 12,000 nucleotides, and has a 5’ cap, and 3’ poly-A tail. The four <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> genes are encoded in the 5′ two-thirds of the genome, while the three structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA colinear with the 3′ one-third of the genome.|$|E
25|$|Cellular RNA cap {{structures}} are formed via {{the action of}} an RNA triphosphatase, with guanylyltransferase, N7-methyltransferase and 2′-O methyltransferase. The virus encodes these activities in its non-structural proteins. The NS3 protein encodes a RNA triphosphatase within its helicase domain. It uses the helicase ATP hydrolysis site to remove the γ-phosphate from the 5′ end of the RNA. The N-terminal domain of the <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> 5 (NS5) has both the N7-methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for forming mature RNA cap structures. RNA binding affinity is reduced {{by the presence of}} ATP or GTP and enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine. This protein also encodes a 2′-O methyltransferase.|$|E
2500|$|Many viruses {{have evolved}} {{mechanisms}} to resist interferon activity. [...] They circumvent the IFN response by blocking downstream signaling events that occur after the cytokine binds to its receptor, by preventing further IFN production, and by inhibiting {{the functions of}} proteins that are induced by IFN. [...] Viruses that inhibit IFN signaling include Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) and viruses of the herpesvirus family, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [...] (KSHV or HHV8). Viral proteins proven to affect IFN signaling include EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) from Epstein-Barr virus, the large T antigen of Polyomavirus, the E7 protein of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the B18R protein of vaccinia virus. [...] Reducing IFN-α activity may prevent signaling via [...] STAT1, STAT2, [...] or IRF9 [...] (as with JEV infection) or through the JAK-STAT pathway (as with DEN-2 infection). [...] Several poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologs—like the B18R protein of the vaccinia virus—that bind to and prevent IFN interacting with its cellular receptor, impeding communication between this cytokine and its target cells. [...] Some viruses can encode proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent the activity of RNA-dependent protein kinases; this is the mechanism reovirus adopts using its sigma 3 (σ3) protein, and vaccinia virus employs using the gene product of its E3L gene, p25. The ability of interferon to induce protein production from interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) can also be affected. [...] Production of protein kinase R, for example, can be disrupted in cells infected with JEV [...] Some viruses escape the anti-viral activities of interferons by gene (and thus protein) mutation. [...] The H5N1 influenza virus, also known as bird flu, has resistance to interferon and other anti-viral cytokines that is attributed to a single amino acid change in its <b>Non-Structural</b> <b>Protein</b> 1 (NS1), although the precise mechanism of how this confers immunity is unclear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background As part of {{a program}} to develop a Dengue virus vaccine which avoids the {{deleterious}} effects of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection mediated by antibodies to Dengue virus structural proteins, we have begun to investigate the possibility of designing Dengue vaccines based on <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins.</b> Results Dengue constructs which lack major structural proteins replicate intracellularly in tissue culture. These replicons are capable of prolonged expression of Dengue virus <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> for at least seven days in culture. Conclusions Dengue virus genomes lacking major structural proteins can, like other flaviviruses, replicate intracellularly and express virus <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> with minimal toxicity to host cells.

5000|$|During {{replication}} MVM utilizes three open reading frames (ORFs) {{and produces}} three distinct mRNA transcripts which {{are referred to}} as R1, R2 and R3. [...] R1, produced from ORF 3, is translated into <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> 1 (NS1). [...] mRNA transcript R2, produces <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> 2 (NS2) by splicing the 5-prime end of ORF3 with ORF2, which is found within the 3-prime end of ORF. [...] The resulting NS2 protein is thus composed of spliced 5-prime and 3-prime alternative ORF sections of NS1. [...] Finally, the R3 transcript produces capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, which requires transcription from the P38 promoter, in contrast to the P4 promoter used for transcripts R1 and R2.|$|E
50|$|NS2-3 {{protease}} is {{the enzyme}} responsible for proteolytic cleavage between the <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> NS2 and NS3. NS3 protease, {{on the other}} hand, {{is responsible for the}} cleavage of <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> downstream. Both of these proteases are directly involved in HCV genome replication. NS2-3 protease mechanism is essential for viral production, as shown by in-vitro chimpanzee studies where chimps which were inoculated with HCV with fully mutated NS2-3 protease activity didn’t develop HCV infection.|$|R

40|$|Three commercially {{available}} ELISAs {{for the detection}} of antibodies to the <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were evaluated, using sera from uninfected, vaccinated, infected, inoculated, first vaccinated and subsequently infected, and first vaccinated and subsequently inoculated cattle. We compared antibody kinetics to <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins,</b> sensitivity, and specificity. One of the ELISAs had a higher sensitivity and much lower specificity than the other two, therefore we established standardised cutoff values for the compared assays using receiver operated characteristic (ROC) curves. Using the standardised cutoff values, all three ELISAs produced comparable results with respect to sensitivity and specificity. Antibody development to <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> after infection and after vaccination/infection was not significantly different. Development of antibodies, however, both neutralising and directed to <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins,</b> was significantly delayed after intranasal inoculation as compared to intradermolingual infection. Based on results of sera obtained after vaccination and experimental infection all three assays can be used for testing sera collected between 4 weeks and 6 months after infection.

5000|$|The Cache Valley Virus genome {{is split}} into three parts. The three parts {{are called the}} small, medium, and large segments, {{based on the number}} of bases. The large segment encodes the L protein, which is the RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. The small segment utilizes an open reading frame with alternative initiation sites to encode two proteins. Depending on the initiation site, it can either code for the protein that makes up the nucleocapsid, N, or a <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein,</b> NSs. [...] The medium segment encodes 2 type 1 integral transmembrane glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, as well as a <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> Nsm. The Gc and Gn proteins start as one precursor protein and are then cleaved cotranslationally. They are modified by N-linked glycosylation.|$|E
50|$|NSP2, is a {{rotavirus}} nonstructural RNA-binding {{protein that}} accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions (viroplasms) and {{is required for}} genome replication.

5000|$|Early: Expressed {{early in}} virus infection, i.e. before genome replication. Expression of early genes {{continues}} {{during the late}} stage of infection. Encodes <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> (i.e. not present in virus particle).|$|R
50|$|The <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> are encoded at the 5’ end, formed {{during the}} first of two {{characteristic}} rounds of translation. These proteins are originally translated as a polyprotein, which consequently undergo self cleavage, forming four <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> responsible for gene expression and replication. The formation of a sub-genomic fragment, encoding the structural proteins and a negative sense fragment, a template for further synthesis of positive sense RNA are the characteristic second phase of translation. Assembly takes place at the cell surface, where the virus buds from the cell, acquiring the envelope. The replication cycle is very fast, taking around 4 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{proteins}} {{are those}} produced following {{entry into the}} host cell but prior to replication. [...] The expression of early genes, commonly encoding <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins,</b> initiates replication of the genome and expression of late genes.|$|R
5000|$|The RNA genome encodes {{at least}} four polypeptides: these are the <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> and the {{read-through}} product which are involved in virus replication (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp); the movement protein (MP) which {{is necessary for the}} virus to move between cells and the coat protein (CP). The read-through portion of the RdRp may be expressed as a separate protein in TMV. [...] The virus is able to replicate without the movement or coat proteins, but the other two are essential. The <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> has domains suggesting it is involved in RNA capping and the read-through product has a motif for an RNA polymerase. The movement proteins are made very early in the infection cycle and localized to the plasmodesmata, they are probably involved in host specificity as they are believed to interact with some host cell factors.|$|E
50|$|The genome of a positive-sense ssRNA virus usually {{contains}} {{relatively few}} genes, usually {{between three and}} ten, including an RdRP. Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes, up to 32 kilobases in length, and likely possess replication proofreading mechanisms {{in the form of}} a proofreading exoribonuclease, <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> 14, that is otherwise not found in RNA viruses.|$|E
50|$|A matricellular {{protein is}} a {{dynamically}} expressed <b>non-structural</b> <b>protein</b> that {{is present in}} the extracellular matrix (ECM).

5000|$|Epizootic hemorrhagic disease {{virus is}} a {{double-stranded}} RNA virus {{that belongs to}} the family Reoviridae and the genus Orbivirus, and is also closely related to Bluetongue virus (BTV).

[...] The <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> are encoded by gene segments 6, 8, and 10, and have been found to be highly conserved.

40|$|Enterovirus A 71 (EV-A 71) {{is one of}} {{the main}} causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Unlike other enteroviruses that cause HFMD, EV-A 71 is more {{frequently}} associated with severe neurological complications and fatality. Little is known about the immunogenicity of viral <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> in humans. Previous studies have mainly focused on characterization of epitopes of EV-A 71 structural proteins by using immunized animal antisera. In this study, we have characterized human antibody responses against the structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> of EV-A 71. Each viral protein was cloned and expressed in either bacterial or mammalian systems, and tested with antisera by western blot. Results revealed that all structural proteins (VP 1 - 4), and <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins</b> 2 A, 3 C and 3 D were targets of EV-A 71 IgM, whereas EV-A 71 IgG recognized all the structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>proteins.</b> Sixty three synthetic peptides predicted to be immunogenic in silico were synthesized and used for the characterization of EV-A 71 linear B-cell epitopes. In total, we identified 22 IgM and 4 IgG dominant epitopes. Synthetic peptide PEP 27, corresponding to residues 142 - 156 of VP 1, was identified as the EV-A 71 IgM-specific immunodominant epitope; and PEP 23 mapped at VP 1 41 - 55 was recognized as the EV-A 71 IgG cross-reactive immunodominant epitope. The structural protein VP 1 is the major immunodominant site targeted by anti-EV-A 71 IgM and IgG antibodies. These data provide new understanding of the immune response to EV-A 71 infection, which benefits the development of diagnostic tools, potential therapeutics and subunit vaccine candidates...|$|R
