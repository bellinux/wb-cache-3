5|$|Periyar {{hailed the}} Thirukkural as a {{valuable}} scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for modern society.|$|E

Friley, {{the president of}} Iowa State College, even though the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> could not at first be disclosed to him while security checks were being undertaken. Once these were completed, Friley brought in Harold V. Gaskill, the Dean of Science, as the Ames Project's administrator. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took control of the Manhattan Project in June 1942, and the Ames Project in late 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Man-Eating Myth {{was widely}} {{reviewed}} in academic journals and also attracted attention from mainstream press. Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Critics charged Arens with constructing straw man arguments and for exaggerating the methodological problems within anthropology. Although influential, in ensuing decades, increasing archaeological study of cannibalism led many to dismiss Arens' hypothesis.|$|E

50|$|Although Salt's {{work has}} {{developed}} through several distinct phases, it has generally focussed on images of cars, often shown wrecked or abandoned within a suburban or semi-rural American landscape, with the banality and dishevelment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject matter contrasting with the immaculate and meticulous <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work's</b> execution.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
5|$|Bondfield {{had helped}} Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This {{organisation}} {{was dedicated to}} the unionisation of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW's organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed. Bondfield's investigations into workers' pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid to men and to women, even for identical work. Through the NFWW she campaigned for a £1 a week starting minimum wage for women, whatever the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and for equal pay with men for equal work.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E

5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house had become a Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though {{the house had been}} heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> {{carried out}} by {{accountants}} and auditors requires {{a high level of}} ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E
5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein {{and worried about}} the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita {{proved to be a}} success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E

However unlike <b>the</b> traditional form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concerto grosso, <b>the</b> sheer weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orchestral forces remains ever present, reminding <b>the</b> listener <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overarching (romantic) symphonic structure.|$|R
5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E
