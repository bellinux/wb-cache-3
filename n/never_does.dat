5|$|A rarely appearing, all-white {{form was}} {{initially}} described A.phalloides f. alba by Max Britzelmayr, though its status has been unclear. It is often found growing amid normally colored death caps. It has been described, in 2004, {{as a distinct}} variety and includes what was termed A.verna var. tarda. The true Amanita verna fruits in spring and turns yellow with KOH solution, whereas A.phalloides <b>never</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is Thanksgiving and Lisa assembles a {{decorative}} centerpiece for the dinner table. Meanwhile, Homer leaves {{to pick up}} Grampa from the retirement home once Patty and Selma arrive, bearing food (Swedish meatballs), and to Marge's consternation they insinuate that they find Marge's turkeys are dry and inedible. Their mother Jaqueline Bouvier arrives in a taxi, suffering from laryngitis, and tells Marge she <b>never</b> <b>does</b> anything right.|$|E
5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost <b>never</b> <b>does</b> so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red <b>never</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{makers of}} the show insist that the answers are not given to the panelists beforehand.

500|$|Ibrăileanu {{additionally}} credited the Moldavian faction, Kogălniceanu included, {{with having}} helped introduce spoken Romanian into the literary language, {{at a time}} when both Ion Heliade Rădulescu and successors of the Transylvanian School made use of the dialect prevalent in Orthodox and Greek-Catholic religious culture. This was in connection with Kogălniceanu's advocacy of pragmatic Westernization: [...] "Civilization <b>never</b> <b>does</b> banish the national ideas and habits, but rather improves them {{for the benefit of the}} nation in particular and of humanity in general". He was adverse to fast cultural reforms, stressing that acclimatization was always required.|$|E
500|$|Mead {{noted that}} [...] "the book builds toward second chances for Miranda's mother—both vocationally and relationally." [...] As the novel progresses, Miranda gives second chances to Julia, {{a girl who}}m Miranda {{initially}} hates, and Alice, a girl who always needs {{to use the bathroom}} but <b>never</b> <b>does.</b> Miranda previously considered Julia [...] "a competitor for Annemarie's affection, and Alice as the weird kid who waited too long to go to the bathroom". By the end of the book, she finds Julia to be Annemarie's friend and discovers that Alice is an insecure girl.|$|E
500|$|Attanasio {{also based}} the {{characters}} in Homicide on the detectives featured in Simon's book. The difficulties Bayliss experienced with the case, {{as well as the}} extremely personal approach he took in attempting to solve it, were inspired by the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, who was the primary detective in the Wallace case. Most of the detectives featured in the Homicide book said they were happy with their on-screen counterparts, although Detective Harry Edgerton, the inspiration for Frank Pembleton, objected to a scene in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] in which the character drinks milk in a bar, something Edgerton said he <b>never</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from that}} setback, Offenbach {{flourished in the}} 1860s, with successes greatly outnumbering failures. In 1861 he led the company in a summer season in Vienna. Encountering packed houses and {{enthusiastic}} reviews, Offenbach found Vienna much to his liking. He even reverted, for a single evening, to his old role as a cello virtuoso at a command performance before Emperor Franz Joseph. That success {{was followed by a}} failure in Berlin. Offenbach, though born a Prussian citizen, observed, [...] "Prussia <b>never</b> <b>does</b> anything to make those of our nationality happy." [...] He and the company hastened back to Paris. Meanwhile, among his operettas that season were the full-length Le pont des soupirs and the one-act M. Choufleuri restera chez lui le....|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{analysed}} and scrutinised Gaga's {{musical and}} performance style, {{as she has}} experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is [...] "liberating" [...] herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood. Gaga has a coloratura contralto vocal range and strongly dislikes lip syncing. She has changed her vocal style regularly, similar to Madonna and Gwen Stefani, and considers Born This Way [...] "much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of." [...] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost <b>never</b> <b>does</b> she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry {{is to be found}} in nuance rather than lung power." ...|$|E
500|$|About Johann Urb's casting in Resident Evil: Retribution, the film's {{producer}} and director Paul W. S. Anderson said, [...] "You {{have no idea}} {{how difficult it is to}} find someone with Leon Kennedy's hair [...] has to be manly and has to have these long bangs," [...] adding that [...] "if you put photographs of them side-by-side, it's almost like he was manufactured by Capcom." [...] Anderson said that the decision to include Leon and other game characters in the film was [...] "fan-driven". Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched voice. I feel like he talks how I naturally talk, which is kind of slower." [...] Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: [...] "It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're waiting for it to happen, but it <b>never</b> <b>does.</b> Maybe in the next one, I'm hoping." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{an answer}} that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt {{individually}} that {{in the presence of}} such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> tombs look so ghastly white. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> bough creak so mysteriously, and <b>never</b> <b>did</b> the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.|$|R
500|$|The halftime show {{received}} critical acclaim. Said Marc Schneider of Billboard: [...] "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just {{living in}} it". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{that although the}} choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was [...] "defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along {{to one of her}} songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, <b>never</b> <b>does</b> anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E

2500|$|J. Hoberman {{defended the}} film, yet again, {{in his review}} for the {{theatrical}} cut. [...] "In its willful, self-involved eccentricity, Southland Tales is really something else. Kelly's movie may not be entirely coherent, but that's because there's so much it wants to say." [...] Manohla Dargis also gave the film a positive review in The New York Times, writing, [...] "He doesn't {{make it easy to}} love his new film, which turns and twists and at times threatens to disappear down the rabbit hole of his obsessions. Happily, it <b>never</b> <b>does,</b> which allows you to share in his unabashed joy in filmmaking as well as in his fury about the times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another key {{ingredient}} {{was his own}} presence as a master; [...] "A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy. … He <b>never</b> <b>does</b> anything to the disciple." [...] The initiation he offered was another such device: [...] "... if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion. … It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only if you become a disciple." [...] Ultimately though, as an explicitly [...] "self-parodying" [...] guru, Rajneesh even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching {{to be nothing more}} than a [...] "game" [...] or a joke. He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.|$|E
