40|$|A new {{waste heat}} and water {{recovery}} technology {{based on a}} <b>nanoporous</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> water vapor separation mechanism was developed, to extract the water vapor and its latent heat from low temperature high moisture content waste gas streams. For the water reclamation process, water vapor condenses inside the membrane pores and passes through to the permeate side which is {{in direct contact with}} a low-temperature water stream. Contaminants such as CO 2, O 2, NOx, and SO 2 are inhibited from passing through the membrane by its high selectivity. The recovered water is of high quality and mineral free, therefore can be used as supplemental makeup water for almost all industrial processes. The membrane based technology has been first developed and demonstrated for industrial boiler flue gas heat and water recovery. Now it is being developed for wider applications, from residential humidification, commercial laundry, biomass production to utility boilers. The increased application areas will greatly enhance waste heat and water recovery potentials worldwide, to save both energy and water, and benefit the global environment.

40|$|Oil/water (O/W) {{emulsion}} stabilized by surfactants is {{the part}} of oily wastewater that is most difficult to handle. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> ultrafiltration presently is an ideal process to treat O/W emulsions. However, {{little is known about the}} fouling mechanism of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> during O/W emulsion treatment. This paper investigated how stabilization surfactants of O/W emulsions influence the irreversible fouling of <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> during ultrafiltration. An unexpected phenomenon observed was that irreversible fouling was much less when the charge of the stabilization surfactant of O/W emulsions is opposite to the <b>membrane.</b> The less <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> fouling in this case was proposed to be due to a synergetic steric effect and demulsification effect which prevented the penetration of oil droplets into membrane pores and led to less pore blockage. This proposed mechanism was supported by cross section images of fouled and virgin <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> taken with scanning electron microscopy, regression results of classical fouling models, and analysis of organic components rejected by the membrane. Furthermore, this mechanism was also verified by the existence of a steric effect and demulsification effect.

40|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> {{have been}} widely and {{successfully}} used in the food and beverage processing industry. Despite their success, <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> are not commonly employed in drinking water treatment due to their high initial capital cost. Polymeric membranes, on the other hand, have gained widespread use in drinking water treatment {{in the last few}} decades due to their ability to meet stringent water quality regulations. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> have a number of advantages over polymeric membranes, which include high chemical and thermal stability, higher fluxes and longer operational life. Advances in membrane technology in recent years coupled with innovative design have made the life cycle cost of implementing <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> competitive with that of polymeric membranes. This has resulted in a number of drinking water treatment plant installing <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> as part of the treatment process, especially in Japan. The biggest challenge facing membrane filtration (polymeric or ceramic) is fouling. To control fouling, coagulation prior to <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> filtration is often implemented and {{has been shown to be}} effective in controlling both hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling. Direct biofiltration without pretreatment (BFWP) (coined by Huck et al., 2015) has been shown to be another effective “green” pretreatment to control fouling in polymeric membranes. High molecular weight natural organic matter (NOM) such as biopolymers have been found to be directly related to the hydraulically reversible fouling and to play a key role in hydraulically irreversible fouling of polymeric membranes and biofiltration is able to reduce the concentration of this NOM fraction. Given the effectiveness of BFWP in controlling fouling in polymeric membranes, there is an opportunity to investigate its applicability to <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes.</b> Therefore, the goals of this study were to investigate the efficacy of BFWP as a pretreatment to control fouling in <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> and characterize the fouling of the membranes over time. The effects of Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT) of the biofilters, membrane materials and pore sizes (Microfiltration (MF) vs. Ultrafiltration (UF)) on the fouling rates were also investigated in the study. For the study, a direct biofiltration pilot plant was set up at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Two dual-media biofilters – one with 8 minutes and the other with 16 minutes EBCT, were fed with roughing filter (RF) effluent, which in turn draws its influent from the raw water main line which feeds the WTP. The Mannheim WTP treats Grand River water which is impacted by agricultural and wastewater effluent upstream. The effluents from the biofilters were then used as influent to the <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> test units for the membrane fouling experiments. Fouling experiments were conducted using two parallel test units to compare the efficacy of different pretreatments (RF effluent and biofilter effluents) on MF and UF <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes.</b> The study found that direct biofiltration is able to substantially remove turbidity and biopolymers from the feed water, thereby reducing both reversible and irreversible fouling rates in both MF and UF <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes.</b> A higher EBCT biofilter also performed significantly better in terms of turbidity and biopolymer removal, corresponding to lower irreversible and reversible fouling in <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes.</b> MF <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> were also found to foul at a much lower rate compared to UF <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R

Polymeric membranes have been often reported to experience rapid and/or problematical fouling, restraining sustainable operation. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> can be effectively employed to treat impaired-quality source waters due to their inherent robustness in terms of physical and chemical stability. This research aimed to identify the effects of coagulation and/or ozonation on <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> filtration for seawater and wastewater (WW) effluent. Two different types of MF and UF <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> obtained by sintering (i. e., TAMI made of TiO 2 +ZrO 2) and anodic oxidation process (i. e., AAO made of Al 2 O 3) were employed for bench-scale tests. Precoagulation was shown {{to play an important role}} in both enhancing membrane filterability and natural organic matter (NOM) removal efficacy for treating a highorganic surface water. The most critical factors were found to be pH and coagulant dosage with the highest efficiency resulting under low pH and high coagulant dose. Due to the ozone-resistance nature of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes,</b> preozonation allowed the <b>ceramic</b> <b>membranes</b> to be operated at higher flux, especially leading to significant flux improvement when treating seawater in the presence of calcium and magnesium. 4 Dissolved ozone in contact with the TAMI <b>ceramic</b> <b>membrane</b> surface accelerated the formation of hydroxyl (˙OH) radicals in WW effluent treatment.
