50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to spherical roller bearings, but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical roller bearing, their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical roller bearing. This <b>non-locating</b> <b>bearing</b> can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E
