5|$|Magnus Armstrong (David Stalker) – A former {{military}} man, the kilt-wearing, muscular Scotsman {{is known to}} be a <b>nice</b> <b>man,</b> who, however, enjoys a fight. He is one of H.A.R.M.'s field commanders. He respects fellow countrymen above all else, and he spares Cate's life on more than one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Harry and Marv {{realize that}} Kevin is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears them {{discussing}} plans {{to break into}} his house that night. Kevin goes to church and watches a choir perform. He meets Old Man Marley, who sits with Kevin and they briefly speak; he learns that Marley is actually a <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> and that the rumors about him are false. He tells Kevin he is watching the choir because his granddaughter is singing, but he never gets to see her because he and his son are estranged and have not been on speaking terms for some time; Kevin suggests that he try to reconcile with his son.|$|E
25|$|His {{political}} opponent Roy Jenkins {{later wrote}} that Macleod seemed to prefer to focus his attacks on more moderate Labour figures who might dispute {{the ownership of}} the centre ground with him. He wrote that Macleod had “some quality of self-destructiveness in him”. He wrote {{that there was a}} “calculated coldness” about his partisan attacks. Jenkins wrote that Macleod had “a darting crossword-puzzle mind fortified by a phenomenal memory” adding that “I am not convinced that he was a particularly <b>nice</b> <b>man,</b> but he had insight and insolence”. Jenkins likens him to Benjamin Disraeli or to George Canning, who by attracting the admiration of a clique of younger men left a legend out of all proportion to their actual achievements.|$|E

500|$|Though Bernard {{describes}} Hogg as a {{woman of}} [...] "unfailing politeness", the biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday featuring the elderly pianist Arthur Rubinstein, he characterized her as a [...] "tiresome old woman". Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as [...] "a pompous old man". By contrast, Hogg said of Vladimir Horowitz, whom she met backstage at a 1975 concert in Houston, [...] "Such a <b>nice</b> <b>man.</b> Not at all like that Mr. Rubinstein." ...|$|E
500|$|After signing for Sheffield United, Evans {{moved to}} Millhouse Green, Penistone, {{in the nearby}} Barnsley area. After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a bad word to say about him, he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much of a <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably a very <b>nice</b> <b>man...</b> he may not have known exactly what he was getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just not getting the job done. He's too old. We need to send it to an earlier generation." ...|$|E

500|$|Marcus also {{involved}} himself in issues {{of civil rights}} and social justice. One unusual case involved three male students at W. W. Samuell High School who, in 1966, were stopped at the school's front door and ordered to cut their hair {{in order to be}} admitted to the school. The young men filed a lawsuit against the Dallas Independent School District, claiming the restriction interfered with their constitutional freedom of expression. Despite not knowing the boys involved, Marcus stepped forward to champion their case before the public, taking out a newspaper ad defending the choice as a simple fashion decision rather than rebellion against authority. Additionally, he offered legal support if needed, noting in a telegram to school board president Lee McShan, Jr., [...] "I don’t like long hair any more than the principal does, but I will fight for the rights of those students to wear hair any way they choose." [...] Though the case was lost and appealed {{all the way to the}} U.S. Supreme Court without success, decades letter the men still appreciated Marcus' support. Paul Jarvis, one of the plaintiffs, said of Marcus after his death in 2002: [...] "He was just a <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> and a great contributor to Dallas and to the arts. He wanted to do what was right." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday People, [...] "though {{critics said}} it was an affectionate tribute about a <b>nice</b> <b>man.</b> Van went on to urge fans not to buy it." [...] According to The Boston Globe, Van Morrison [...] "disdained the book". In an {{interview}} with The Boston Globe, Turner commented on this: [...] "He considers anything that reveals details of family background or anything like that an invasion of his privacy. He doesn't believe in biographies, and I do." [...] When the biography came out in hardcover, Van Morrison sent Turner 36 statements from the book that he called [...] "lies, gross exaggerations and innuendo". Van Morrison told Turner that none of the 40 individuals the author had interviewed for the biography were currently friends of his. The letter from Van Morrison to Turner concluded with: [...] "I am very sorry that you feel you are entitled to earn a living by peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally." [...] In his reply letter to Van Morrison, Turner wrote: [...] "You may not think you are 'difficult' or 'introvert' but other people do and have the right to express their opinions." [...] The Sunday Times reported that [...] "Allegedly, Van's management even considered buying up all 25,000 copies of the book to pulp them," [...] and this was also reported in The Independent. The Evening Times wrote that Van Morrison [...] "reportedly tried to buy all the copies of a biography by Steve Turner." [...] Representatives for Van Morrison did not confirm whether he attempted to purchase the 25,000 copies of the biography, and confirmed that [...] "representatives of the singer discussed various possibilities". Van Morrison's manager, Chris O'Donnell, said of the musician: [...] "He is not happy about books, period. He is an artist and stands up for himself – he doesn't want his private life raked over." ...|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very <b>nice</b> <b>man,</b> he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{working with}} Cameron on Titanic, Kate Winslet decided {{she would not}} work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". She said that Cameron was a <b>nice</b> <b>man,</b> but she found his temper {{difficult}} to deal with. In an editorial, the British newspaper The Independent said that Cameron [...] "is a nightmare to work with. Studios have come to fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, {{as well as his}} flaming temper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a <b>nice</b> <b>man.</b> It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a little bit, to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amarnath {{was noted}} for his personality, courage and determination. West Indian cricketing great Vivian Richards called him [...] "one of the <b>nicest</b> <b>men</b> to have ever played the game" [...] and former Australian Test opening batsman David Boon said [...] "Concede didn't {{seem to be}} in his vocabulary" [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she sighed, [...] "you <b>nice</b> <b>men,</b> {{it comes}} to you all. You amuse yourselves {{with us for a}} time, and then the real feeling comes, and where are we?

6000|$|Yet, as {{they went}} up-stairs Miss Proudfoot said to Nelly: [...] "Mr. Wrenn is quiet, but I do think in some ways he's one of the <b>nicest</b> <b>men</b> I've seen {{in the house for}} years. And he is so earnest. And I think he'll make a good pinochle player, besides Five Hundred." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tate {{returned}} to Doctor Who in 2008 to reprise {{the role of}} Donna Noble as the Doctor's companion throughout the fourth series, which was shown on BBC One starting on 5 April for a 13-week run. Producer Russell T Davies said, [...] "We are delighted that one of Britain's greatest talents has agreed to join us for the fourth series." [...] Tate added, [...] "I am delighted to be returning to Doctor Who. I had a blast last Christmas {{and look forward to}} travelling again through time and space with that <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> from Gallifrey." [...] At the TV Quick Awards 2008, Tate was voted best actress for her role in Doctor Who. She returned as Donna Noble in the two-part Doctor Who Christmas special [...] "The End of Time" [...] which was broadcast over Christmas 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because that is what he is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and able to talk about any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|E
2500|$|Rodney King {{was awarded}} $3.8million in damages from the City of Los Angeles for the attack. He {{invested}} {{most of this}} money in founding a hip-hop record label, [...] "Straight Alta-Pazz Records". The venture was unable to garner any success and soon folded. Since the arrest which culminated in his severe beating by the four police officers, King was arrested at least a further eleven times {{on a variety of}} charges, including domestic abuse and hit-and-run. King and his family moved from Los Angeles to Rialto, California, a suburb in San Bernardino County, in an attempt to escape the fame and notoriety and to begin a new life. King and his family later returned to Los Angeles, where they ran a family-owned construction company. King, until his death on June 17, 2012, rarely discussed the incident or its aftermath, preferring to remain out of the spotlight. King died of an accidental drowning, although alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and PCP found in his system were contributing factors, authorities said. [...] Renee Campbell, his most recent attorney, described King as [...] "... simply a very <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> caught in a very unfortunate situation." ...|$|E
