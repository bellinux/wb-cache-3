Mason found the producer's behaviour [...] "erratic", but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for [...] "tongue-in-cheek resentment". [...] Ezrin's share of the royalties was less {{than the rest of}} the band and he viewed Waters as a [...] "bully", especially when the bassist mocked him by having badges made that read <b>NOPE</b> (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share of the album's royalties.

500|$|Choudary {{has been}} largely criticised by most UK newspapers, some of whom {{describe}} him as an extremist, or radical cleric or preacher. In January 2010, Guardian contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote: [...] "Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration? No. Has he studied under leading Islamic scholars? <b>Nope.</b> Does he have any Islamic qualifications or credentials? None whatsoever. So what gives him the right to pontificate on Islam, British Muslims or 'the hellfire'? Or proclaim himself a 'sharia judge'?", and claimed that Choudary was [...] "as unrepresentative of British Muslim opinion, as he is of British anti-war opinion." ...|$|E

That was Batman", a reference to actor Christian Bale's voice as the superhero in the Batman films.|$|E
40|$|Unintended harm to {{patients}} in operating theatres is common. Correlations {{have been demonstrated}} between teamwork skills and error rates in theatres. This was a single-institution uncontrolled before-after study {{of the effects of}} "non-technical" skills training on attitudes, teamwork, technical performance and clinical outcome in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) operations. The setting was the theatre suite of a UK teaching hospital. Attitudes were measured using the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ). Teamwork was scored using the Oxford Non-Technical Skills (NOTECHS) method. Operative technical errors (OTEs), non-operative procedural errors (<b>NOPEs),</b> complications, operating time and length of hospital stay (LOS) were recorded. A 9 h classroom non-technical skills course based on aviation "Crew Resource Management" (CRM) was offered to all staff, followed by 3 months of twice-weekly coaching from CRM experts. Forty-eight procedures (26 LC and 22 CEA) were studied before intervention, and 55 (32 and 23) afterwards. Non-technical skills and attitudes improved after training (NOTECHS increase 37. 0 to 38. 7, t = - 2. 35, p = 0. 021, SAQ teamwork climate increase 64. 1 to 69. 2, t = - 2. 95, p = 0. 007). OTEs declined from 1. 73 to 0. 98 (u = 1071, p = 0. 009), and <b>NOPEs</b> from 8. 48 to 5. 16 per operation (t = 4. 383, p< 0. 001). These effects were stronger in the LC group than in CEA procedures. The operating time was unchanged, and a non-significant reduction in LOS was observed. Non-technical skills training improved technical performance in theatre, but the effects varied between teams. Considerable cultural resistance to adoption was encountered, particularly among medical staff. Debriefing and challenging authority seemed more difficult to introduce than other parts of the training. Further studies are needed to define the optimal training package, explain variable responses and confirm clinical benefit...|$|R
500|$|This {{was denied}} by Zicree, who said [...] "No other {{director}} worked on [...] at any stage, there's not {{a frame of}} it that was shot or edited by anyone else." [...] There was further difficulties in production as Zicree also hired a professional assistant director, but he walked off set during a night shoot early in the production and did not return. Cawley later said [...] "Marc is all about using this production to further his own career, a stark difference between his goal {{and all the others}} who were there doing it, did we aspire to be a pro-looking production? Yup. And we were and are proud of it. Did we take salaries and/or compensation? <b>Nope.</b> That was a tough episode to shoot for many reasons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcia Wallace {{spoke of}} Newhart's amiable nature on set: [...] "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I {{had a dog}} {{by the name of}} Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And {{whenever}} there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" [...] Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: [...] "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. <b>Nope,</b> never!" ...|$|E

And we talked about it, and he said, what about [...] "I'm not ready to make nice?" [...] From the outside, normal people really weren't aware of how bizarre and absurd it got. Dan was really good at cluing in to that, saying something that didn't back down, but still had a vulnerability to it. This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Natasha Kassulke of the Wisconsin State Journal stated [...] "The concert {{captured}} {{the scope of}} Jackson's talent from songwriter to singer, producer, actress, dancer and fashion diva." [...] Similarly, Gemma Tarlach of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel observed, [...] "A tiny dynamo of constant motion, Jackson strutted, slunk and grooved her way {{from one end of}} the stage to the other... Her voice, sometimes thin and girlish on her albums, sounded fuller and more powerful than ever. Michael's baby sister? <b>Nope,</b> the commander of her own rhythm nation, in complete control. The show was as much a feast visually as musically." [...] Kevin Johnson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch commended the tour as [...] "one of the flashiest on the concert scene." [...] Elizabeth Aird, who reviewed Jackson's concert at GM Place, wrote [...] "If there's a show sexier and more polished than Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope extravaganza, it's only on Broadway... Saturday night's show at GM Place was two hours of thrills pumped out by Jackson, her never-say-die dancers and her powerful band." [...] James Sullivan of the San Francisco Chronicle observed her concert at the new arena [...] "offered a career retrospective, punctuated by new material, periodic video diversions and fireworks." [...] "The show was a lot like an '80s flashback, though to its credit Jackson's eight-piece band—bass, guitar, drums and percussion, two keyboardists and two backup singers—added some inventive layering to her older hits." [...] Charles Passy of the Palm Beach Post reported Jackson's show at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre emphasized style over substance, commenting her [...] "two-hour set was about half hormones—and half pyrotechnics. Without much in the way of a voice, she has sold her persona throughout her career. And as that persona has evolved from girlish teenager to sexually sophisticated woman, her albums—and tours—have provided a road map." [...] Jet Magazine reported, [...] "With wit, sass, dance and a whole lot of sex appeal, Janet turns her song and dance fest into one of the major musical events of the year. In fact, it has become the must-see concert of the year." ...|$|E

Though I ain't sayin' but that Casleton was agreeable when he tumbled to Monty's meanin'. Which was nothin' more 'n to break Ambrose's heart. That coat dazzles Ambrose. You know how vain Ambrose is.

An' Monty stands there an' laughs. Says Monty, sarcastic as alkali water: 'Ed, we-all knowed you was a heap married man, but you're some locoed to give yourself away.' That settled Ed. He's some touchy about the way Beulah henpecks him. He lost his spirit. An' now he couldn't play marbles, let alone gol-lof. <b>Nope,</b> Monty was too smart.
