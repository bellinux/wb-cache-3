5000|$|Drainage tile {{sometimes}} decreases {{soil erosion}} and runoff of some nutrients, including phosphorus. Phosphorus {{is an important}} nutrient to control {{because it is the}} limiting nutrient in most aquatic ecosystems. Thus phosphorus is the main culprit in eutrophication of surface water; however, the other limiting <b>nutrient,</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> causes substantial damage to waters. For example, nitrogen has been implicated in the gulf hypoxia. Drainage tile sometimes increases water quality because the water flows into the ground then the tile, instead of running off the field into a ditch, carrying soil and nutrients with it. The soil has a chance to filter the water before it enters the streams and rivers. However, by bypassing surface improvements like conservation tillage or riparian buffers, tile drainage can also create problems with water quality [...] and outflow from tile drainage tends to be extremely high in nitrogen. Furthermore, some tile drainage sometime contains very high levels of other chemicals. Since surface forms of conservation agriculture are less effective in tile-drained systems, other practices such as controlled drainage or constructed wetlands may be more effective. In very flat areas, where the natural topography does not provide the gradient necessary for water flow, [...] "agricultural wells" [...] can be dug to provide tile lines sufficient outlet. In these cases, it is the groundwater that stands to be polluted by unfiltered tile output.|$|E

40|$|The fluram {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of amino acids was modified for use in sea and estuarine waters. No evidence for environmental coprecipitation of amino acids was found and any possible removal process from the Tamar estuary was most likely to be by some different mechanism. An HPLC method {{for the analysis}} of amino acids in natural waters suitable for shipboard use was developed. The method was used to determine the seasonal variation of amino nitrogen in coastal and estuarine waters in order to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton could use such compounds as a source of <b>nutrient</b> <b>nitrogen</b> when nitrate was absent. The levels found were generally an order of magnitude higher than those previously reported. This work has gone some way in accounting for some of the previously unidentified fraction of the total dissolved nitrogen in coastal waters. Similarities of amino acid spectra between coastal and estuarine waters were found and the dominant acids were serine, glycine tyrosine and ornithine. Tyrosine occurred very erratically. The patchy distribution, seasonal variation and levels of the dissolved free amino acids in coastal and estuarine waters may support the theory that phytoplankton use them as a source of <b>nutrient</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Whilst {{it was not possible to}} show that the hypothesis was true it was considered likely that at least some amino acids might sometimes be utilised as <b>nutrient</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, Devo...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the standard approaches (mass balance models) to calculate critical loads of <b>nutrient</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (N) {{as well as}} for sulphur (S) and N acidity for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

The model descriptions are in accordance with the methods for calculating critical loads under the LRTAP Convention. For both types of models, a discussion is presented on the required input data, data sources and standard model parameter values used in their application. For acidity, the chapter elaborates on the critical load function as there is no unique critical load of S and N acidity, and on the approach to assess critical load exceedances.

40|$|Batch {{cultures}} of Ralstonia eutropha in chemically defined media with acetic acid (HAc) {{as the sole}} carbon source were conducted to investigate acetate utilization, formation of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and growth of active biomass (ABM) under different carbon to nitrogen (CIN) weight ratios. The specific acetate utilization rate based on ABM approached 0. 16 g/g ABM h(- 1), which was not affected very much by the extracellular HAc concentration from 1 to 5 g/l, but was affected by the CIN weight ratio. A low C/N ratio or high nitrogen supply sped up the specific acetate utilization rate to produce more ABM and less PHB. A high HAc concentration (> 6 g/l), however, depressed acetate utilization {{as well as the}} ABM growth and PHB formation. A high cell mass concentration enhanced the tolerance of R, eutropha to the toxicity of HAc at pH 7 to 8. 5. The viscosity-average molecular size of PHB generally increased first and then declined in batch cultures.

40|$|Critical {{loads of}} acidity and <b>nutrient</b> <b>nitrogen</b> — simple {{measures}} of the sensitivity of ecosystems to deposition — {{have been widely used}} for setting emission reduction targets in Europe. In contrast to sulfur, the emissions of nitrogen compounds remain high in the future. This is also true for the exceedances of critical loads until 2010. Looking further into the future, climate change is likely to influence ecosystem sensitivity, and thus critical loads. It is shown that higher temperatures, changed precipitation patterns, and modified net primary production mainly increase critical loads, except in mountainous and arid regions. Using consistent scenarios of climate change and air pollution from a recently completed European study (AIR-CLIM), it is shown that the exceedances in 2100 of the critical loads are declining in comparison to 2010. However, exceedances of critical loads of <b>nutrient</b> <b>nitrogen</b> remain substantial, even under the most stringent scenario. This confirms the increasing role nitrogen plays in environmental problems in comparison to sulfur. Thus research should focus on the effects of nitrogen in the environment, especially under conditions of climate change, to support nitrogen-emission mitigating policies.
