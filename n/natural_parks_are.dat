50|$|The largest parks can be vast {{natural areas}} of {{hundreds}} of thousands of square kilometres (thousands of square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. Many <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g., rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger or a park warden. Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months.|$|E
5000|$|Agriculture is the province's main industry. But, {{according}} to Nan Governor Suwat Promsuwan, tourism is up markedly since 2013 and in 2016 contributes an estimated 30 {{percent to the}} provincial GDP. Satit Boonthong, president of the Nan Tourism Business Association, says the number of hotel rooms in Nan has doubled to 4,000 {{in the past two}} years. Average occupancy is nearly 100 percent during the high season (the cool season) and 50 percent the rest of the year. Room rates have more than doubled since 2009. Mr Satit says that most visitors to Nan are quality tourists who are willing to spend extra on upscale accommodations. The Tourism Department says arrivals to Nan rose by 19 percent to 1.76 million last year, of which Thais constituted 1.44 million. Tourism revenue rose by 14 percent to 4.43 billion baht. The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects tourist arrivals to Nan will rise by 10 percent to 1.94 million in 2016 as tourism revenue grows by 10 percent to 4.88 billion baht. Now Nan faces tourist congestion during the high season and on long weekends. In the cool season, the province's six <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> booked solid. Provincial authorities are promoting tourism in Pua and Na Noi Districts to relieve congestion in central Nan and distribute tourism income more evenly. [...] "Arrivals to Nan top out at a maximum of 2 million visitors per year," [...] says Mr Suwat. [...] "We want only quality tourists, not a big volume." ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{people are}} {{unfamiliar}} with geological knowledge, {{a fact that}} hinders the implementation of geoconservation measures. Additionally, like in many other countries, the strategies of Portuguese <b>Natural</b> <b>Parks</b> <b>are</b> mainly concerned with bioconservation. The information available at these parks for visitors and students is mostly limited to biological issues, further increasing the geological illiteracy of the general public. Hence, putting people in contact with geological subjects is becoming very important for both geologists and policy makers. A project is being developed in Portugal in order to characterise, catalogue and make public the geological heritage of two Natural Parks from the NE region. This project is providing several products {{with the purpose of}} increasing public awareness towards geological subjects. Among these outputs we emphasise interpretative panels, geological guides and booklets on specific geosites or trails, and web pages. Two more initiatives are being developed in the scope of this project: the training of staff from the two Natural Parks who, in the future, will be guiding field trips; and the organisation of summer field trips in the region, addressed to the general public.

40|$|The {{identification}} of areas worthy of protection and their subsequent institution as <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> instruments that society uses to preserve biodiversity that, by supporting Natural Capital Flow (NCF), represents a guarantee {{for the maintenance}} of human life quality. However, the implemented strategies for the conservation of biodiversity may differ from those adopted {{for the maintenance of}} natural capital; consequently, planning for natural capital might require a different strategy from that used in conservation policies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the 'conservation effect' of different conservation policies on the maintenance of NCF in three natural parks in Apulia Region (southern Italy). The assessment of natural capital flow variation has been carried out investigating the temporal dynamics of land-use/land-cover mosaics, and using Costanza et al. 's economic coefficients as surrogates of NCF. Results showed that not all environmental conservation management strategies have played an equal role in fostering NCF. This research highlights that the recognition of the natural value of a site according to the European Directives (e. g. NATURA 2000 network) is not sufficiently effective for the conservation of the NCF, while it is necessary to identify a management authority that can appropriately drive landscape transformations, and sets, if necessary, the appropriate limitations. In addition, the management of these areas as part of a network of natural parks seems to be more effective for the maintenance of NCF.

40|$|Abstract We {{implemented}} {{an integrated}} ecological assessment using a GIS-based {{decision support system}} model for Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River (UPDE) and Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DEWA) —national park units with the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Our assessment examined a variety of aquatic and terrestrial indicators of ecosystem components that reflect the parks ’ conservation purpose and reference condition. Our assessment compared these indicators to ecological thresholds to determine the con-dition of park watersheds. Selected indicators included chemical and physical measures of water quality, biologic indicators of water quality, and landscape condition mea-sures. For the chemical and physical measures of water quality, we used a water quality index and each of its nine components to assess the condition of water quality in each watershed. For biologic measures of water quality, we used the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera aquatic macr-oinvertebrate index and, secondarily, the Hilsenhoff aqua-tic macroinvertebrate index. Finally, for the landscape condition measures of our model, we used percent forest and percent impervious surface. Based on our overall assessment, UPDE and DEWA watersheds had an eco-logical assessment score of 0. 433 on a- 1 to 1 fuzzy logic scale. This score indicates that, in general, the natural resource condition within watersheds at these parks is healthy or ecologically unimpaired; however, we had only partial data for many of our indicators. Our model is iter-ative and new data may be incorporated as they become available. These <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> located within a rapidly urbanizing landscape—we recommend that natural resource managers remain vigilant to surrounding land uses that may adversely affect natural resources within the parks...|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{suitable}} habitat is probably {{the result of the}} integration of different patches satisfying the different requirements of individuals (Orians & Wittenberger 1991). The multi-scale approach to the study of habitat selection is based on the conceptual framework suggested by Johnson (1980), whose basic assumption is that animals are capable of making decisions regarding resources at consecutively smaller scales. Consequently, general habitat selection can be regarded as a hierarchical process regarding, for example, a fitting patch for breeding at a small scale and suitable areas for foraging at a broader scale (Martínez et al. 2003 a). The multi-scale approach may be specially useful to identify key factors involved in habitat preference of owls because they have large home ranges usually comprising different patches for breeding and foraging (Mikkola 1983). In Alicante (eastern Spain), traditional arid planta-tions and large patches of scrubland and forests outside <b>Natural</b> <b>Parks</b> <b>are</b> threatened by urbanization plans despite their importance to raptor and owl populations. The main developments proposed are motorways, large housing developments, golf courses and large vegetable greenhouses. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is mandatory prior to habitat alteration in Spain, but specialists face the problem that the choice of scale around nests determines the assessment of sensitive habitat features (Martínez et al. 2003 b). Studies addressing this problem for large predators have singled out the importance of Mediterranean scrubland at different spatial scales (Rico et al. 2001, Martínez et al. 2003 a). However, studies dealing with the habitat preferences for medium or small-sized listed predators inhabiting the agri-forest patchwork in Mediterranean Spain are lacking.

30|$|As {{shown in}} the {{relevant}} literature, urban parks and green spaces also {{have a significant impact}} on property prices. Earlier studies by Correll et al. [44], Crompton [45] and Lutzenhiser and Netusil [46] all concluded that the closer properties were to parks and green spaces, the higher the positive amenity effect is. In a more recent study of the City of Cincinnati, OH, parks system, vom Hofe et al. [47] found a strong negative relationship between property values and distance to the nearest park and positive relationship between park size and property values. Interesting is also their finding that parks with build-out recreational facilities, such as play grounds, basketball courts, or swimming pools, do negatively impact home values. Lin et al. [48] found heavily frequented parks to have little or even negative impacts on value. As such, more natural and less frequented parks have a greater positive impact on property values [49, 50, 51]. Espey and Owusu-Edusei [52] also see well-kept parks as the ones with the highest positive influence on property values. Lutzenhiser and Netusil [46] and Shultz and King [53] found that, when assessing their positive impacts, <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> preferred over smaller specialty parks with more intense recreational uses. Interestingly, some studies combined the effects on property values from trails and green spaces. Asabere and Huffman [54] for this reason compare the impacts of trails, greenbelts, and trails with greenbelts in San Antonio, TX. The authors find stronger impacts from greenbelts than from trails, but estimated the highest impact on values for trails buffered with green spaces. In addition, Netusil et al. [36] concluded that the size of greenways, which include bike trails and a proportion of the tree canopy in the facilities, yields a positive effect on prices of the single-family homes in Portland, OR.|$|E
40|$|Parks {{are places}} for recreation, and that {{suggests}} play, leisure, sport. Many parks are of exactly that kind, and fortunately so; {{we need our}} city parks for softball games, our state parks for a family reunion. Recreation re-creates, rejuvenates people when they are worn from work. But outdoor, <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> much more, and more fortunately so. These grander parks in the greater outdoors provide dimensions of depth belied by their vacational and recreational settings. Parks are places so protected that we can simultane-ously get "away from it all, " away from the workaday week, from the labors of town, factory, farm, and "back to it all, " encountering the park-protected reserves of elemental nature. This is recreation, if you like, but this recreation is set within creation. Some of the recreation is relaxation, unwinding from daily labors; deeper down the re-creation is restoration of perspective {{on the nature of}} life, reen-counter with the creation. Parks recreation preserves human life by re-creat-ing it. We figure out who we are and where we are. The last part of that ques-tion must be answered in culture, for human life is "by nature " cultural. But the first part, the fundamental ground, is answered in nature. "By nature, " too, we are embodied creatures, residents on landscapes, earthlings, placed in a more inclusive, more comprehensive community of life and life support. In that sense, parks protect a full {{answer to the question of}} human identity. Parks are philosophical places; let's play with that idea. "Know thyself. " Socrates insisted: "An unexamined life is not worth living " (Plato, Apology: 38). On that score he was quite right. Socrates also said, "You see, I am fond of learning.

40|$|This article {{takes the}} view that <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> <b>are</b> as much an {{opportunity}} to pause for reflection on the ideological foundations {{of the way we}} live our culture, as they are an invitation to cast doubt on neoliberal conservationist policies dressed up as ecologicallyminded ones. Protected areas make for difficult analysis. They entail processes that are associated to territorialization and de-territirialization, to homogenization and crossbreeding, to tertiarization, regulation and re-urbanization, and so on, within {{what has come to be}} known as globalization. This way of exercising power leads to the regulation of nature through a variety of ways of mercantilization. This article looks at the complex expression of natural parks. To do so, we have approached the multiple dimensions of the “natural”, focusing particularly on the political dimension. We have paid special attention to the mechanisms of configuration and legitimization of natural spaces, such as in the first framework of analysis, and we approach the ethnography produced in our country with the aim of looking at the processes with which they are identified nowadays. Finally, we consider the challenges facing natural areas and the role of anthropology as a discipline in this field. Desde nuestra perspectiva, los parques naturales presentan, tanto una oportunidad para reflexionar sobre los cimientos ideológicos de nuestra práctica cultural, como una invitación para poner en entredicho las políticas conservacionistas “neoliberales” presentadas y revestidas como ecológicas.
