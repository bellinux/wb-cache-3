25|$|The {{reason for}} Antipas' {{involvement}} has been debated. Theodor Mommsen {{argued that the}} normal legal procedure of the early Roman empire was for defendants to be tried by the authorities of their home provinces. A. N. Sherwin-White re-examined the relevant legal texts and concluded that trials were generally based on {{the location of the}} alleged crimes, but that there was a possibility of referral to a province of origin in special cases. If Pilate was not required to send Jesus to Antipas, he may have been making a show of courtesy to the tetrarch and trying to avoid the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Jewish authorities himself. When Jesus was sent back, Pilate could still have represented Antipas' failure to convict as support for his own view (according to Luke) that Jesus was not guilty of a capital offence, thus allowing him to avoid responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's elation at his {{transfer}} soon {{descended into}} disillusion as {{he failed to}} find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of Operation Husky (9 July–17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of Sicily. Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier. After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in Windsor, Waugh began parachute training at Tatton Park, Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a fibula. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for Chagford, Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was [...] (1945), {{the first of his}} explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer Douglas Lane Patey commented that it was [...] "the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation".|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} months of 1759 Pownall {{wrote a letter}} to William Pitt {{requesting}} leave to return to England because [...] "I might be of some service" [...] there. [...] Biographer John Schutz speculates that the underlying reason for Pownall's request were related to frustration with his exclusion from the major military actions of the later war years, and possibly his desire to acquire a more significant post, such as a governor-generalship of conquered New France. [...] Historian Bernard Bailyn is of the opinion that Pownall's divisive dislike and distrust of Shirley supporters like Thomas Hutchinson and ensuing local political infighting contributed to the request, as did his difficult relationships with the military commanders. [...] Whatever the reason, the Board of Trade engaged in a reshuffling of colonial positions after King George II died, and Pownall was given the governorship of South Carolina, and permission to first take leave in England. [...] His departure from Boston was delayed by militia recruiting issues and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the aftermath of a major fire in the city, and he did not leave until June 1760.|$|E

500|$|For the 1986 {{legislative}} elections the FN {{took advantage}} of a new proportional representation system that had been imposed by Mitterrand in order to moderate a foreseeable defeat for his PS. In the election, the FN won 9.8% of the vote and 35 seats in the National Assembly. Many of its seats could be filled by {{a new wave of}} respectable political operatives, notables, who had joined the party after its 1984 success. The RPR won a majority with smaller centre-right parties, and thus avoided the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the FN. Although it was unable to exercise any real political influence, the party could project an image of political legitimacy. Several of its legislative proposals were extremely controversial and had a socially reactionary and xenophobic character, among them attempts to restore the death penalty, expel foreigners who [...] "proportionally committed more crimes than the French", restrict naturalisation, introduce a [...] "national preference", impose taxes on the hiring of foreigners by French companies, and privatise Agence France-Presse. The party's time in the National Assembly effectively came to an end when Jacques Chirac reinstated the two-round system of majority voting for the next election. In the regional elections held on the same day, it won 137 seats, and gained representation in 21 of the 22 French regional councils. The RPR depended on FN support to win presidencies in some regional councils, and the FN won vice-presidential posts in four regions.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{background}} of these divisions Saladin had become vizier of Egypt in 1169, and had taken Damascus in 1174 and Aleppo in 1183.

It was rumoured amongst the Franks that Raymond III of Tripoli had made a deal with Saladin under which Saladin would make him King of Jerusalem in return for peace.

2500|$|Nawaphon was an ISOC {{operation}} {{organized in}} 1974. It {{was composed of}} mainly low-level government functionaries and clerks, petite bourgeoisie, rural village and communal headmen, {{as well as a}} number of monks. [...] The name [...] "Nawaphon" [...] means [...] "nine strengths", a reference to either the Chakri Ninth Reign (King Bhumibol) or the nine points of Nawaphon's program to preserve Thai nationalism. The aim of Nawaphon was to protect the king from threats like communism. A key figure of the movement was the monk, Kittivudho Bhikkhu, who became its leader in 1975. In a June 1976 interview he was asked if killing leftists or communists would produce demerits or negative karma, he said that such killing would not be demeriting because, [...] "...whoever destroys the nation, the religion or the monarchy, such bestial types are not complete persons. Thus, we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devil; this is the duty of all Thai". In 1967, he established Jittiphawan College. It was inaugurated by King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who returned regularly even after Kittivudho began to make incendiary speeches about the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> student protesters and communists. This suggests a close relationship between the Nawaphon movement and the royal family. Employing the slogan that [...] "killing communists is not demeritorious", Kittivudho encouraged the killings of alleged communists from 1973 to 1976 and injected militant Buddhism into the Thai body politic, eventually inciting his followers to commit violence at Thammasat University on 6 October. Earlier, Nawaphon was responsible for the killing of more than 20 prominent farmer activists in 1975. The murders were an attempt to negate the farmers' new-found political agency and, by so doing, return them to their pre-October 1973 state of relative repression. The assassinations of farmer activists were part of the state campaign to suppress any potential threat to the king's rule, sanctioned and encouraged by the king as an integral part of his anti-communist purge.|$|E
