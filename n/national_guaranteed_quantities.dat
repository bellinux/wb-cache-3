40|$|The EU {{system of}} support for olive oil is based on {{production}} aid of € 1, 322. 5 per tonne, with private storage being used {{as an instrument of}} market management. Production is limited through <b>national</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>quantities</b> totalling 1. 78 million tonnes. There is a growing emphasis on quality production. The budget for the olive oil sector in 2001 was € 2, 524 million, with € 1, 030 going to Spain, € 848 million going to Italy, € 587 million going to Greece, € 54 million going to Portugal and € 5 million going to France. Some 4 % of the utilisable agricultural area of the EU is under olives, involving some 2. 5 million producers, roughly a third of EU farmers. It also provides winter employment and considerable off farm employment in the processing industry. The EU dominates world olive production, with output having risen steadily in the 1990 s. Demand for olive oil is growing at 6 % per annum {{in the light of the}} product's positive health image, and EU exports have doubled in the last ten years.

40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of unginned cotton within <b>national</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>quantities.</b> Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton). This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets. The EU support regime is centred on a production aid per tonne of [...] ...|$|E

It would also carry less risk for needing injection of additional public money to service its payment of deposit guarantees in the event of severe crisis, as failing risks would be spread more widely across all member states while its private sector funds would be raised over a much larger pool of financial institutions.
