50|$|<b>Nimorazole</b> (INN) is a {{nitroimidazole}} anti-infective. It is {{also being}} investigated {{for the treatment of}} head and neck cancer.|$|E
50|$|From the {{chemistry}} perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics {{can be classified}} according {{to the location of}} the nitro functional group. 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, <b>nimorazole,</b> dimetridazole, 6-Amino PA824, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products.|$|E

40|$|The hypoxic cell {{radiosensitizing}} {{properties of}} <b>nimorazole</b> {{have been investigated}} in a C 3 H mammary carcinoma transplanted to the feet of C 3 D 2 F 1. The results have been compared with those obtained with misonidazole (MISO) in the same animal tumour system. For single-dose irradiation in air, <b>nimorazole</b> gives an enhancement ratio (ER) of approximately 1. 4, independent of the dose of drug administered over the range 0. 1 - 1. 0 mg/g. MISO yields a similar ER at the 0. 1 mg/g level but, unlike <b>nimorazole,</b> shows a steep dose-response curve with an ER of 2. 2 when given in a concentration of 1. 0 mg/g. No such dose-response relationship is seen with <b>nimorazole</b> {{despite the fact that}} tumour and plasma concentrations of the 2 drugs have an identical dose relationship. With irradiation given in 5 daily fractions, <b>nimorazole</b> and MISO at a dose of 0. 3 mg/g per fraction both show an ER of approximately 1. 3. The high drug doses used in single-fraction radiation experiments in animals bear little relation to those applicable to clinical practice since these would result in unacceptable toxicity. The results of the present studies are therefore of interest as <b>nimorazole</b> is potentially less toxic than MISO in humans but demonstrates similar radiosensitizing properties at clinically relevant dose levels...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{predictive}} value of hypoxia imaging by (18) F-FAZA PET in identifying tumors that {{may benefit from}} radiotherapy combined with <b>nimorazole,</b> a hypoxic radiosensitizer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats of two tumor models (Rhabdomyosarcoma and 9 L-glioma) {{were divided into two}} treated groups: radiotherapy (RT) alone or RT plus <b>nimorazole.</b> (18) F-FAZA PET images were obtained to evaluate tumor hypoxia before the treatment. Treatment outcome was assessed through the tumor growth time assay, defined as the time required for tumor to grow to 1. 5 times its size before irradiation. RESULTS: For rhabdomyosarcomas, the benefit of adding <b>nimorazole</b> to RT was not significant when considering all tumors. When stratifying into more and less hypoxic tumors according to the median (18) F-FAZA T/B ratio, we found that the combined treatment significantly improved the response of the "more hypoxic" subgroup, while {{there was no significant difference}} in the tumor growth time between the two treatment modalities for the "less hypoxic" subgroup. For 9 L-gliomas, a clear benefit was demonstrated for the group receiving RT+nimorazole. However, the individual responses within the RT+nimorazole group were highly variable and independent of the (18) F-FAZA uptake. CONCLUSIONS: (18) F-FAZA PET may be useful to guide hypoxia-directed RT using <b>nimorazole</b> as radiosensitizer. It identified a subgroup of more hypoxic tumors (displaying T/B ratio> 2. 72) that would benefit from this combined treatment.

40|$|Summary The {{pharmacokinetics}} of the hypoxic radio-sensitizer <b>nimorazole</b> {{were studied}} in 19 individuals after single oral doses of between 0. 5 - 3. 5 g. HPLC measurements showed, after a rapid absorption, a linear relationship between peak plasma concentration and given dose. Mean elimination half life was 3. 1 h. A tendency to a dose-dependent {{variation in the}} apparent volume of distribution, total body clearance and elimination half life suggest non-linear pharmacokinetics of <b>nimorazole.</b> Tumour concentrations measured in 5 patients gave tumour/plasma ratios between 0. 8 - 1. 3. No toxicity was observed. The results indicate that <b>nimorazole</b> may have potential as a clinically useful hypoxic radiosensitizer. Recent studies in experimental tumours in vivo suggest that <b>nimorazole</b> (1 -(N-p-ethyl-morpholine) - 5 -nitro-imidazole) may possess hypoxic cell radiosensitizing properties {{similar to that of}} misonidazole (MISO) when given in moderate doses (Overgaard et al., 1982 b). At tumour concentrations of 50 g g- 1 both drugs were found to yield enhancement ratios of 1. 4 in a C 3 H mammary carcinoma (Overgaard et al., 1982 b). Clinical studies of plasma and tumour concentrations indicate that an equivalent dose level in humans would require- 1. 5 - 2. 0 gm- 2 MISO on the likely assumption that a tumour-plasma ratio of about unity can be achieved (Ash & Schmidt, 1980; Dische, 1982; Rich et al., 1981). Such a dose cannot be given daily in conjunction with conventional radiation fractionation schedules due to excessive doselimiting toxicity, primarily expressed as peripheral neuropathy (Dische et al., 1978; Kogelnik 1980; Phillips et al., 1981). Thus, accumulated doses> 1 1 - 12 gm- 2 MISO over a 4 -week period carry a high risk of unacceptable side effects (Dische et al., 1978...|$|E

In a serial dilution test using cysteine monohydrochloride–peptone–liver infusion–maltose medium, T. vaginalis IR- 78 was only resistant under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions it was as susceptible as the normal reference strain. The minimal lethal concentrations of metronidazole, tinidazole, and <b>nimorazole</b> for IR- 78 were 100, 50, and 50 μg/ml aerobically and 0. 4, 0. 4, and 0. 2 μg/ml anaérobically, respectively. The efficacy of metronidazole, tinidazole, and <b>nimorazole</b> was assessed in vivo by oral administration to mice simultaneously infected with IR- 78 both subcutaneously and intraperitoneally. The CD 50 (dose needed to cure 50 % of infections) of each compound was significantly higher for the subcutaneous than for the intraperitoneal infection. In contrast, there was little difference in CD 50 for these infections in mice inoculated with a susceptible trichomonas strain. The CD 50 's for all three compounds against intraperitoneal and subcutaneous infections with IR- 78 were 2 to > 70 times higher than for susceptible strain E. Both forms of infection with IR- 78 could always be cured with therapeutically acceptable doses of tinidazole and nimorazole; subcutaneous infections could not be cured with tolerated doses of metronidazole...|$|E

40|$|Awareness {{increases}} that the tumor biology influences treatment outcome and prognosis in cancer. Tumor hypoxia {{is thought to}} decrease sensitivity to radiotherapy and some forms of chemotherapy. Presence of hypoxia may be assessed by investigating expression of endogenous markers of hypoxia (EMH) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). In this systematic review we investigated the effect of EMH expression on local control and survival according to treatment modality in head and neck cancer (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSCC]). A search was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Studies were eligible for inclusion that described EMH expression in relation to outcome in HNSCC patients. Quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Hazard ratios for locoregional control and survival were extracted. Forty studies of adequate quality were included. HIF- 1 a, HIF- 2 a, CA-IX, GLUT- 1, and OPN were identified as the best described EMHs. With exception of HIF- 2 a, all EMHs {{were significantly related to}} adverse outcome in multiple studies, especially in studies where patients underwent single-modality treatment. Positive expression was often correlated with adverse clinical characteristics, including disease stage and differentiation grade. In summary, EMH expression was common in HNSCC patients and negatively influenced their prognosis. Future studies should investigate the effect of hypoxia-modified treatment schedules in patients with high In summary, EMH expression. These may include ARCON, treatment with <b>nimorazole,</b> or novel targeted therapies directed at hypoxic tissue. Also, the feasibility of surgical removal of the hypoxic tumor volume prior to radiotherapy should be investigated...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypoxia {{develops}} in tumors {{because of a}} less ordered, often chaotic, and leaky vascular supply compared with that in normal tissues. In preclinical models, hypoxia {{has been shown to}} be associated with treatment resistance and increased malignant potential. In the clinic, several reports show the presence and extent of tumor hypoxia as a negative prognostic indicator. This article reviews the biology and importance of hypoxia in head and neck cancer. METHODS: A review of literature was carried out and combined with our own experience on hypoxia measurements using exogenous and endogenous markers. RESULTS: Hypoxia can increase resistance to radiation and cytotoxic drugs and lead to malignant progression, affecting all treatment modalities, including surgery. Hypoxia measurements using electrodes, exogenous bioreductive markers, or endogenous markers show the presence of hypoxia in most head and neck cancers, and correlations with outcome, although limited, consistently indicate hypoxia as an important negative factor. Each hypoxia measurement method has disadvantages, and no "gold standard" yet exists. Distinctions among chronic, acute, and intermediate hypoxia need to be made, because their biology and relevance to treatment resistance differ. Reliable methods for measuring these different forms in the clinic are still lacking. Several methods to overcome hypoxia have been tested clinically, with radiosensitizers (<b>nimorazole),</b> hypoxic cytotoxins (tirapazamine), and carbogen showing some success. New treatments such as hypoxia-mediated gene therapy await proper clinical testing. CONCLUSIONS: The hypoxia problem in head and neck cancer needs to be addressed if improvements in current treatments are to be made. Increased knowledge of the molecular biology of intermediate, severe, and intermittent hypoxia is needed to assess their relevance and indicate strategies for overcoming their negative influenc...|$|E
40|$|The 40 -year {{history of}} hypoxic cell {{sensitisation}} {{can be traced}} from hyperbaric oxygen to the present clinical studies with carbogen, nicotinamide and accelerated radiotherapy. A meta-analysis by Overgaard (1995) included 10703 cases entered into 83 randomised controlled trials and showed an overall improvement in local tumour control of 4. 6 % (P = 0. 00001) and in survival of 2. 8 % (P = 0. 005). Hyperbaric oxygen gave a 6. 6 % (P = 0. 003) improvement in local control and hypoxic cell sensitisers 3. 9 % (P = 0. 04). Despite this, the only hypoxic cell-sensitising method in routine clinical use is the giving of <b>nimorazole</b> in supraglottic and pharyngeal carcinomas. Acute, as well as chronic hypoxia has been recognised and nicotinamide, the amide derivative of B 3 is believed to prevent the former. Thus ARCON (accelerated radiotherapy, carbogen and nicotinamide) has been introduced in the clinic {{in an effort to}} overcome tumour proliferation, chronic and acute hypoxia, respectively. The success of future randomised controlled trials would be improved greatly if methods were available to measure the concentration of hypoxic cells in tumours before treatment and thus select those where benefit may be gained. The use of ARCON recognises that tumour cell proliferation is an important cause of failure in addition to hypoxia. However, intrinsic radiosensitivity may also need {{to be taken into account}} in the future. Clinical trials aim to improve the therapeutic ratio and thus the study of morbidity is as important as local tumour control. International collaboration is essential if randomised controlled trials are to be carried out within reasonable periods of time...|$|E

A series of neutral 2 -nitroimidazoles similar in electron affinity but varying in octanol/water partition coefficient (PC) over 4 orders of magnitude (0. 016 - greater than 200, Misonidazole = 0. 43) were examined at a fixed dose of 2. 5 mmol/kg. A parabolic (quadratic) dependence of activity on log PC was observed. Analogues more hydrophilic than misonidazole (MISO) were inactive as were those with very high PCs (greater than 20).

The two latter agents were both considerably more active than MISO at low doses (0. 1 [...] 0. 9 mmol/kg). These studies indicate that the structural features of electron-affinic agents responsible for the enhancement of KHT tumour response to CCNU, are quite different from those affecting radiosensitization, lipophilicity being particularly important.

40|$|A {{systematic}} review of radiation therapy trials in several turnout types {{was performed by}} The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42 : 357 - 365). This synthesis {{of the literature on}} radiation therapy for head and neck cancer is based on data from 39 randomized trials and I meta-analysis. In total. 40 scientific articles are included, involving 20893 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 79174 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: General, non-nasopharynx Substantial evidence indicates that the tumour effect of radiotherapy can be increased by the concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly cisplatin and 5 -fluorouracil. There is moderate evidence of a survival benefit of radiation combined with concomitant chemotherapy compared to radiation alone. However, the results are equivocal. There is substantial evidence in published studies for an increased frequency of severe acute side effects as a result of concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There are very few studies that allow any estimates of the risk for serious late side effects. There is a weak indication of an increased risk for serious fibrosis. Comment: The general quality of studies and the lack of information on serious side effects indicate a need for large, well-designed clinical studies with a reasonable follow-up. Larynx preservation studies There is strong evidence that larynx preservation is possible in 50 % of the patients surviving for 5 years with hypopharyngeal cancers when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy. There is a non-significant trend for the overall survival being lower in non-surgically treated patients than in those treated with primary surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Nasopharynx There is moderate evidence that patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas of the endemic type benefit from therapy with a combination of chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy. However, the results from the reported studies are equivocal. There is some indication that the acute side effects of radiation are more severe in the concomitant setting than in the neoadjuvant. Comment: There are no data on serious late toxicity. Dose, fractionation schedules There is some evidence that certain schedules of altered fractionation improve tumour control without increasing severe late side effects. There is some evidence that nervous tissues are more susceptible to damage by altered fractionation. Solid data shows that altered fractionation increases acute side effects. There is moderate evidence that accelerated hyperfractionation may reduce the frequency of serious late side effects while retaining a similar tumour effect as conventional radiotherapy. Hypoxic cell sensitizers Most reported trials reject the usefulness of nitroimidazole derivatives for sensitization of hypoxic tumour cells. There is some evidence that patients with tumours in the pharynx and larynx may benefit from sensitization by <b>nimorazole.</b> Prophylactic treatment of side effects There is weak evidence that local antibiotics have a clinically significant effect in preventing acute radiotherapy side effects. There is insufficient evidence that radioprotective agents offer clinically significant protection of parotid glands (one study in two publications). There is insufficient evidence that radioprotective agents do not spare turnout tissue. Since the previous report no randomized studies comparing the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy have been performed. Both methods are well established and have independently proved to be effective in the treatment of certain head and neck cancers. No conclusion can be drawn regarding their relative effectiveness. Since the previous report no data to guide the use of intraoperative radiotherapy have been identified...|$|E
