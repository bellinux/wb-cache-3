5000|$|Starting May 30, 2004, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Trademark Electronic Business Center's TDR (Text Document Retrieval) online record {{showed a}} USPTO [...] "Office Action" [...] on {{application}} #78319880, summarily refusing registration {{on grounds that}} the proposed mark [...] "merely describes the subject matter {{and nature of the}} applicant's goods and/or services", and also because publishing a journal is not per se a [...] "service" [...] within the meaning of the term in trademark law (SSC having not provided descriptive evidence or arguments to counter that presumption). The notice gave SSC six months to cure these deficiencies. On Dec. 27, 2004, USPTO's follow-up <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Abandonment</b> ruled that [...] "The trademark application below was abandoned because a response to the Office Action mailed on 05-30-2004 was not received within the 6-month response period", adding that any request for reinstatement would have to be received within two additional months. On Jan. 6, 2005, USPTO noted return of its <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Abandonment</b> by the post office: [...] "Not deliverable as addressed. Unable to forward." ...|$|E

40|$|This study uses a {{methodology}} for analyzing the interdependence effects <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and renovation for profit-maximizing landlords. After using a Prisoners’ Dilemma game <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> {{to establish the}} existence of the interdependence phenomenon between internal rates of return, a Stackelberg framework is employed to model the interdependence effects <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and renovation. The Stackelberg model appropriately defines the timing payoffs of the landlords’ operational decisions. This model shows that as long as one landlord does not abandon, the optimal decision for the other landlord is to renovate their property. ...|$|R
40|$|After {{putting forward}} a general {{explanation}} of the legal concept <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> criminal attempt and its requirement of voluntariness, this paper points out certain critical points of the theory <b>of</b> <b>abandonment.</b> Furthermore, the paper presents (without aiming at building a systematic and comprehensive theory) some topoi that cannot be overlooked when solving difficult cases <b>of</b> <b>abandonment.</b> In conclusion, the referred topoi are systematized {{in the form of}} four rules that are deducted from two criminal-political principles of Colombian criminal law, i. e., the principle of legality and the use of threats as a dissuasive method by the law and the offense-based carácter of criminal law...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} abandonment {{as measured by the}} Feelings <b>of</b> <b>Abandonment</b> Scale (FOAS), and use of illicit drugs. It was hypothesized that individuals who used illicit drugs would score higher on the (FOAS) than non-users. This study also evaluated whether there were differences in levels <b>of</b> feelings <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> among opiate users compared to non-opiate users, and college students versus those receiving treatment for substance abuse. The two groups were administered the FOAS, and t-tests and multivariate t-tests were conducted to evaluate whether differences existed between these two groups. Significant differences in FOAS scores were noted among opiate users compared to non-opiate users, and the college versus treatment groups. The study failed to find a significant relationship between feelings <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and presence <b>of</b> a substance use disorder. Other findings and implications for further research are discussed. Identification <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> as a counseling issue and recommendations for treatment are suggested. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} a perspective of interest of study {{about the meaning}} <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> to the very elderly, nursing care clients. The methodology used is the literature review and open literature, {{in which it was}} inferred that the meaning <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> for the very elderly clients of nursing care, is underdeveloped in the nursing literature, and no unification of language in relation to its meaning. The abandonment as a phenomenon resulting from health experiences is associated with a dimension of subjective distress, not always resulting in a form of physical neglect. In this sense it is argued that the development of a methodological work analysis of the concept <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> to the very elderly, will help to clarify it and help developing the knowledge of the discipline...|$|R
