5|$|In Mexico, {{officials}} closed 18 ports on the Gulf of Mexico to small- {{and medium-sized}} craft {{in preparation for}} the storm. In <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico,</b> more than 500 shelters were opened as thousands of residents were advised to evacuate from low-lying areas. The Mexican Army, Red Cross, and firefighters were put on standby to deal with emergency calls during the storm. On August22, a state of emergency was declared for Tamaulipas. The following day, at least 120 firefighters were dispatched to Monterrey, Nuevo León, to swiftly respond to emergencies. The Mexican government emphasized the safety of residents in the city, which was anticipated to bear the brunt of the hurricane. Around 7,000 fishermen evacuated coastal regions near the Texas border. In Matamoros an additional 31 shelters were opened. Schools throughout <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico</b> were closed for several days.|$|E

5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E

The main campus is now in Española; the El Rito campus still operates. While the college was temporarily renamed to <b>Northern</b> New <b>Mexico</b> University on January 27, 2015, this name change was short-lived {{due to the fact that}} the board of regents did not obtain approval to do so from the New Mexico Legislature.|$|R

Just weeks after a major flood in the area, officials evacuated hundreds of citizens in Las Presas in <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico</b> area near a dam. All public schools in the area were closed, as well.|$|E
5|$|The cane cholla (or {{walking stick}} cholla, tree cholla, chainlink cactus, etc.) (Cylindropuntia imbricata) is a cactus {{found in the}} Southwestern United States and <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico,</b> {{including}} some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting yellowish fruits.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became discernible, and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico</b> a day later.|$|E
5|$|As Delia {{neared the}} Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong {{tropical}} storm with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well {{in excess of}} hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest pressure was recorded at 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). However, Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September4. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September5. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September6 before dissipating early the next day over <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus fossils {{have been}} {{described}} from 10 US states, including Texas, Montana, and many along the East Coast. Fossils have also been found in <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico.</b> It lived {{on both sides of}} the Western Interior Seaway, and was an opportunistic apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America. Deinosuchus reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species. Deinosuchus was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaurs. It may have also fed upon sea turtles, fish, and other aquatic and terrestrial prey.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ismael was a weak, but deadly Pacific {{hurricane}} {{that killed}} {{over one hundred}} people in <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico</b> in September of the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. It developed from a persistent area of deep convection on September 12, and steadily strengthened as it moved to the north-northwest. Ismael attained hurricane status on September 14 while located 210miles (340km) {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It continued to the north, and after passing a short distance east of Baja California it made landfall on Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Ismael rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. The remnants entered the United States and extended eastward into the Mid-Atlantic States.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Naomi was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Mexico's Pacific coast during the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. After rapidly intensifying before its landfall in Sinaloa, Naomi caused rainfall throughout <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico</b> and the U.S. state of Texas {{in association with}} a frontal system, with the highest measurement occurring in Corpus Christi. Four people perished in Mexico due to Naomi's effects with ten more missing, all in Sinaloa. The only reported injury in Texas due to the remnants was a factory worker who was injured when {{the roof of the}} plant they were working in collapsed due to rainfall.|$|E
5|$|It {{continued}} to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This {{is believed to}} be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lekson {{developed}} a theory called the Chaco Meridian, {{which is based}} on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon, and Paquime at Casas Grandes in <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico.</b> He believes the sites were intentionally located on the same approximate line of longitude (107°57'25"), and this indicates a ceremonial connection between them. The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin.|$|E
5|$|The Maya civilization {{developed}} {{within the}} Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers {{a region that}} spreads from <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico</b> southwards into Central America. Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide. The Mesoamerican area {{gave rise to a}} series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems. The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|The mallard {{is widely}} {{distributed}} across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; in North America its range extends from southern and central Alaska to Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, across Eurasia, from Iceland and southern Greenland {{and parts of}} Morocco (North Africa) in the west, Scandinavia and Britain to the north, and to Siberia, Japan, and South Korea, in the east, south-eastern and south-western Australia and New Zealand in the Southern hemisphere. It is strongly migratory in the northern parts of its breeding range, and winters farther south. For example, in North America, it winters south to the southern United States and <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico,</b> but also regularly strays into Central America and the Caribbean between September and May.|$|E

5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba {{for an extended period}} of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{landfall}} in <b>northern</b> <b>Mexico,</b> {{just south}} of the Texas border, shortly after the warnings were extended. Around the time the storm made landfall, a pressure of 1002 mbar (hPa) was recorded in Brownsville, Texas. The storm dissipated later that day over southwestern Texas. No known damage was caused {{as a result of this}} storm and storm-force winds were only recorded over a small area on the Texas coastline. The storm produced minor rainfall over south Texas with Brownsville recording 0.56 in (14.2 mm) and Corpus Christi recording 0.95 in (24.1 in). Winds up to 43 mph (69 km/h) were reported in Brownsville around 1 am CST (0800 UTC) on September 7.|$|E
