500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E

6000|$|This is what I {{have called}} {{guessing}} the hidden eccentricities of life. This is knowing that a man's heart {{is to the}} left and not in the middle. This is knowing not only that the earth is round, but knowing exactly where it is flat. Christian doctrine detected the oddities of life. It not only discovered the law, but it foresaw the exceptions. Those underrate Christianity who say that it discovered mercy; any one might discover mercy. In fact every one did. But to discover a plan for being merciful and also severe-- THAT was to anticipate a strange need of human nature. For <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgiven for a big sin {{as if it were a}} little one. Any one might say that we should be neither quite miserable nor quite happy. But to find out how far one MAY be quite miserable without making it impossible to be quite happy--that was a discovery in psychology. Any one might say, [...] "Neither swagger nor grovel"; and it would have been a limit. But to say, [...] "Here you can swagger and there you can grovel"--that was an emancipation.|$|E
60|$|The use {{of light}} tackle by experts for big game fish {{of the sea}} {{has come to be}} an {{established}} practice in American angling. A few years ago, when sport with light tackle was exceptional, it required courage to flaunt its use in the faces of fishermen of experience and established reputation. Long Key, now the most noted fishing resort on the Atlantic coast, was not many years back a place for hand-lines and huge rods and tackle, and boat-loads of fish for one man. It has become a resort for gentlemen anglers, and its sportsmen's club claims such experts and fine exponents of angling as Heilner, Lester, Cassiard, Crowninshield, Conill, the Schutts, and others, who can safely be trusted to advance the standard. Fishermen are like sheep--they follow the boldest leaders. And <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> despised by the elect. Long Key, with its isolation, yet easy accession, its beauty and charm, its loneliness and quiet, its big game fish, will become the Mecca of high-class light tackle anglers, who will in time answer for the ethics and sportsmanship of the Atlantic seaboard.|$|E

While playing as Devin and Baird, the gamer will be firing an assault rifle. As Smash, the gamer will use a shotgun and as Eddie, a sniper rifle.|$|E
50|$|In PDP, {{grandmother}} {{cells are}} {{a thing to}} ridicule. Finkel called them infamous grandmother cells, and Connor said <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accused of believing in grandmother cells. 50 years of studies involving PDP and grandmother cells have not really found any grandmother cells, but rather that the brain codes information with a form of distributed coding. Localist models ignore the neuroscience data taken to support distributed coding schemes, specifically single cell electrophysiological recording studies. Localist models are instead often supported by neuropsychological data. Biologically, the PDP model is superior and can be supported using the many different methods and studies. This includes studies of PDP in the brain, as discussed by Bowers.|$|E

5000|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the weakest}} link of any group.

Individuals who perform inferior work compared to someone else show improvement relative to those deprived of this comparison. Moreover, this gain is even more marked when they are part of a group working on a conjunctive task. A recent meta-analysis of related studies has confirmed the presence of the Köhler effect, and has noted that it seems to be stronger in women than men ...|$|E
