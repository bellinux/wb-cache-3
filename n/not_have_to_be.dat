5|$|Reginald Yzendoorn, {{author of}} History of the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiian Islands, later wrote that Kaʻauwai was {{a judge and}} Calvinist deacon who related the burning of the Roman Catholic chapel of Wailuku in 1843 to his {{mother-in-law}} Marie Leahi, an early Catholic female catechumen. In the early Hawaiian Protestant mission, deacons did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> licensed to preach.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant that it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> painted {{to protect it from}} the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|The prey does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{attracted}} {{towards the}} predator for the predator to benefit: it {{is sufficient for}} the predator simply {{not to be identified}} as a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reproduced with each replacement.|$|E

5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, it does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} embrittlement, the entire target chamber was {{designed}} to be easily rolled out of the center of the building on rails to the maintenance building where it could be rebuilt. The chamber was expected to last four years, and be replaced in one month. The optical system is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines themselves do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realigned after chamber replacement.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E

Senior Producer of EVE Online Andie Nordgren (CCP Seagull) stated that the move <b>was</b> <b>to</b> necessary for future developments <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more flexible release cycle, rather than the deadline imposed on the previous system, allowing smaller patches and changes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deployed more rapidly and large projects <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rushed due <b>to</b> the expansion deadline.|$|R
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore {{are more likely to}} be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distilled out.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport {{is in the process of}} reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

50|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, the letters (represented in italics) become fewer and fewer.

In other words, the psychological clarification that is taking place {{at the level of}} content is reflected stylistically in the movement from a predominantly epistolary mode towards a more linearly organized narrative.|$|R
5|$|In 1978, Lawrence {{purchased}} the Commodore PET 2001 {{and no longer}} needed the university's computer. He rewrote DND as Telengard within eight kilobytes of memory. Due {{to a lack of}} space, he designed the dungeon to be procedurally generated based on the player-character's position so the maps would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stored in memory. Lack of memory was Lawrence's primary design obstacle. Nevertheless, the final version almost completely used 32 kilobytes of memory. It was easily ported to the Apple II+ and TRS-80 platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The later Atari 800 port required a more complicated handling of string variables. The three ports were finished before Avalon Hill saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games. The IBM PC port required a rewrite into the C programming language; the source code for this version was later lost. The Heath/Zenith CP/M version requires MBASIC. The game's most popular port was for the Commodore 64.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
