5000|$|Lever or {{combination}} noseband: this noseband has a half-moon {{piece of}} metal that goes {{on each side of}} the horse's face. On the [...] "top" [...] end of the curve (near the horse's cheek bone), a piece of leather is attached that runs under the jaw and attaches to the other side of the face. At the peak of the curve is a piece of leather that runs over the top of <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> a <b>position</b> slightly lower from where a regular cavesson would cross. At the [...] "bottom" [...] of the curve, a third piece of leather goes under the chin groove of the horse. This noseband is similar in design to the figure-eight, and works similarly by preventing the horse from crossing his jaws (which is especially helped by the metal on either side of the face). Unlike the figure-eight, it does not stabilize the bit and it tends to push the cheeks in against the horse's molars which can be painful.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{exception}} of landing, plus a few exotic maneuvers, stalling an aircraft is typically avoided in most maneuvers, both because the plane is no longer flying normally, making the control surfaces sloppy and sluggish to react, and also because the aircraft is balanced {{on the edge of}} losing control. If the pilot can maintain a level attitude (<b>nose</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> relation to the horizon) and keep the wings level, the plane should theoretically float downward at its terminal velocity, which is partially determined by the shape of the plane {{in the direction of the}} relative wind. However, the slightest bit of variation in any of a number of factors, such as control surface inputs or air turbulence, will generally result in the aircraft beginning a rotation around both the yaw and roll axes, referred to as [...] "incipient spin." [...] The rotation may be self-induced, called autorotation, or, in maneuvers like the falling leaf, the rotation is pilot-induced by using the rudder.|$|R

40|$|The correct {{estimation}} of the head pose {{is a problem of}} the great importance for many applications. For instance, it is an enabling technology in automotive for driver attention monitoring. In this paper, we tackle the pose estimation problem through a deep learning network working in regression manner. Traditional methods usually rely on visual facial features, such as facial landmarks or <b>nose</b> tip <b>position.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, we exploit a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform head pose estimation directly from depth data. We exploit a Siamese architecture and we propose a novel loss function to improve the learning of the regression network layer. The system has been tested on two public datasets, Biwi Kinect Head Pose and ICT- 3 DHP database. The reported results demonstrate the improvement in accuracy with respect to current state-of-the-art approaches and the real time capabilities of the overall framework.

40|$|The main {{issues in}} nasal surgery are to {{stabilize}} the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> the good <b>position</b> after surgery and preserve the cartilages and bones in the favorable situation and {{reduce the risk of}} deviation recurrence. Also it is necessary to avoid the synechia formation, nasal valve narrowing, hematoma and bleeding. Due to the above mentioned problems and in order to solve and minimize them nasal packing, nasal splint and nasal mold have been advised. Patients for whom the nasal packing used may faced to some problems like naso-pulmonary reflex, intractable pain, sleep disorder, post operation infection and very dangerous complication like toxic shock syndrome. We have two groups of patients and three surgeons (one of the surgeons used post operative nasal packing in his patients and the two others surgeons did not). Complications and morbidities were compared in these two groups. Comparing the two groups showed that the rate of complication and morbidities between these two groups were same and the differences were not valuable, except the pain and discomfort post operatively and {{at the time of its}} removal. Nasal packing has several risks for the patients while its effects are not studied. Septoplasty can be safely performed without postoperative nasal packing. Nasal packing had no main findings that compensated its usage. Septal suture is one of the procedures that can be used as alternative method to nasal packing. Therefore the nasal packing after septoplasty should be reserved for the patients with increased risk of bleeding...|$|R
