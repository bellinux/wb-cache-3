5|$|The first {{combat in}} {{daylight}} began just after 08:00. A He 111 from Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 51 (Long-range Reconnaissance Group 51), based near Paris, was intercepted and {{shot down over}} the Channel by Hurricanes from No. 87 Squadron RAF. A Heinkel He 59 air-sea rescue aircraft was dispatched, but found <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heinkel or its five crew.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the site}} of the fort is located at the {{intersection}} of Key Boulevard and North Ode Street in Arlington, Virginia (1530 N. Key Blvd., on {{the site of}} the Atrium). <b>No</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort remains, though a small historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bought at}} the auction (it is {{believed}} by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, Lew was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, Lew was moved by rail to Swansea and loaded onto the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then vanished from history and despite several attempts, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive, or evidence of its fate, {{has so far been}} found.|$|E

50|$|When Tora Bora was {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} U.S., British and Afghan troops, <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supposed fortress were found despite painstaking searches in the surrounding areas. Tora Bora {{turned out to be}} a system of small natural caves housing at most, 200 fighters. While arms and ammunition stores were found, there were <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advanced facilities claimed to exist.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hospital <b>of</b> St Nicholas or the 13th-century {{bridge at}} present.|$|R
5|$|The first {{sanctuary}} to be {{built in}} the area dates to the 14th century when Sonam Gyeltshen, a Nyingmapa lama of the Kathogpa branch came from Tibet. The paintings he brought can still be faintly discerned on a rock above the principal building although there is <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original one. The Taktsang Ugyen Tsemo complex, which was rebuilt after a fire in 1958 is said to date back to 1408. Taktsang remained under the authority of the Kathogpa lamas for centuries until the mid 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The service {{modifications}} lowered operating expenses, but {{the coefficient}} of use went down dramatically: 0.33 for the first ten months of 1908. The decision to axe the line was made on 1 November 1908. Two strategic errors had been made: wanting a service independent of the CTR's network, and putting its terminus out of town. The railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 September 1911, the rails were lifted, the public highway restored; <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tramway remains.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the oval-shaped {{eye socket}} of Tanystropheus, the eye socket of Dinocephalosaurus {{appears to be}} peach-shaped, with a narrow {{anterior}} end. On {{the top of the}} skull, the parietal is broad and flattened, bearing <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midline crest found in Tanystropheus. The jugal only has two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present in most other reptiles. Also missing are the retroarticular process of the posterior (rear) lower jaw (another point of distinction from Tanystropheus), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the site}} is an {{industrial}} property, with <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium remaining except for a plaque.|$|R

50|$|Barczewo Castle (Zamek w Barczewie) was {{a castle}} in Barczewo, Olsztyn County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland. <b>No</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle remain.|$|R
5|$|With no {{above ground}} remains, the exact {{location}} of the abbey had been lost, and so in the 1840s, the editor of the Leicester Chronicle, James Thompson, tried, and failed, to attempt to locate the abbey church. In the 1850s the Leicester Architectural and Archaeological Society would also carry out excavations, but also failed to locate the abbey. Prior to the 9th Earl of Dysart's donation of the abbey precinct, another attempt was undertaken, but again, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abbey was found.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} {{surrender}} of the Confederate States of America in 1865, Fort Jackson was abandoned. The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and, {{due to its}} proximity to the Long Bridge, the earthworks were flattened {{in order to provide}} easier access to Long Bridge. In the early 20th century, the fort's site was used for the footings and approaches to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington. Today, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort remains, though the site of the fort is contained within Arlington County's Long Bridge Park, and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park.|$|E
5|$|Fort Bayard was an {{earthwork}} fort {{constructed in}} 1861 northwest of Tenleytown in the District of Columbia {{as part of}} the defenses of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. It never faced major opposition during the conflict and was decommissioned following the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Named after Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who was killed at the Battle of Fredericksburg, the site of the fort is in Boundary Park, located at the intersection of River Road and Western Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. <b>No</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort remains, though a marker commemorating its existence has been constructed by the Park Service.|$|E
50|$|Almost <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{old town}} survived. The only two notable pre-1917 {{buildings}} are a poorhouse and a mechanical workshop.|$|R
50|$|The oldest layer {{built of}} bricks and stone {{probably}} {{corresponds to the}} fortress besieged by Alexander. However, <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian occupation have been found yet.|$|R

5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed {{on the edges of}} towns. The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used not just for the war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cemetery remained.|$|E
5|$|Runyon {{was built}} {{immediately}} after the entry of Union forces into Virginia on May 24, 1861, on the land of James Roach, a Washington building contractor. Fort Runyon was the largest fort in the ring of defenses that protected Washington during the Civil War and was named after Brigadier General Theodore Runyon, commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia during the First Battle of Bull Run. Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling {{following the end of}} the Civil War in 1865. Today, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort remains on the site, which is now exit 9 on Interstate 395, though a historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|The first LRP patrol began {{during the}} Italian {{invasion}} of Egypt. 'W' Patrol commanded by Captain Mitford {{set out on}} 15 September 1940 {{to carry out a}} reconnaissance of Kufra and Uweinat. Finding <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italians, they turned south and attacked fuel dumps, aircraft and an Italian convoy carrying supplies to Kufra. 'T' Patrol, commanded by Captain Clayton, reconnoitred the main route between Kufra and Uweinat, then drove south to meet up with 'W' Patrol; both units returned to base, having captured two Italian trucks and official mail. The Italian response to these raids was to reduce their front line forces and increase the number of troops garrisoning the area from 2,900 men in September to 5,500 by November 1940.|$|E
50|$|Roxy Square now {{occupies}} <b>the</b> former site <b>of</b> Luna Park. While many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{buildings that}} rimmed <b>the</b> park remain, <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> once-popular tourist attraction exist.|$|R

2500|$|The {{probable}} cause was reported as [...] "As <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft or its occupants {{has been found}} to date <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disappearance has not been determined." ...|$|R
5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lists for Mark and John.|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monitor {{was found}} until {{the corpse of}} a sailor in a dinghy and a few {{lifebuoys}} washed ashore on the Finnish island of Kremare. Extensive searches of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship. In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded Rear Admiral P. S. Burachek, commander of the detachment, for letting Rusalka go to sea in bad weather as well as Lushkov for losing contact with the monitor. The commission concluded that the ship's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power. Either would have caused Rusalka to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy. Whatever the cause, Rusalka obviously broached and sank {{with the loss of}} all 177 members of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Plans for Armidas {{performance}} were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo {{died at the}} end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio {{was still}} asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. <b>No</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy patron of the arts at whose Venetian palace Il combattimento had been performed in 1624.|$|E
50|$|Today {{there are}} <b>no</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle left. Its site, which {{is open to}} the public, is a viewing rock and may be ascended from Wichsenstein on 207 steps.|$|R
50|$|The Sliema {{batteries}} {{still existed}} in 1811, {{but like the}} other French blockade fortifications, they were dismantled, possibly sometime after 1814. <b>No</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batteries can be seen today.|$|R
50|$|<b>No</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station remain. The station site is now {{comprised}} in <b>the</b> {{car park}} <b>of</b> Pfizer Global Research and Development on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A256 Ramsgate Road.|$|R
5|$|Covert coordinated efforts {{between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese Armed Forces had started in 1967, {{and soon after}} Cauldron ended, the RLI was {{involved}} in a joint operation in Mozambique. A group of 17 Lusaka-based nationalists infiltrated Mozambique's north-western Tete Province, between Rhodesia and Malawi, in April 1968. Their presence was reported to Portuguese authorities on 20 May by local tribesmen from Catumbula, a small village just north of the Mazoe River, which in that area ran along the border with Rhodesia. A Portuguese patrol contacted and scattered the guerrillas the next day. The nationalist fighters, split into two groups, then moved towards Rhodesia, one team heading south-west and the other south. Acting on information given by the Portuguese, the Rhodesians started Operation Flotilla, based at the border town of Nyamapanda, on 23 May. 1 Commando, RLI was sent out on patrol the same day under Major Peter Rich. However, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurgents was reported by Rich's men, apart from the tracks of six men on the northern (Mozambican) side of the Mazoe River. The cadres had not actually left Mozambique; a counter-insurgency effort by the Portuguese military and police resulted in most of them being captured or killed. Six who did eventually cross into Rhodesia in early June were captured by the BSAP.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
