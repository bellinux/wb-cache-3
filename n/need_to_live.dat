Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.|$|E
5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a constituency in order to vote there.|$|E

25|$|The evening bat is a {{relatively}} short-lived, especially compared to other bats in its geographic range. It has a maximum age of 6 years, though few individuals live past 4 years. Its short lifespan for a bat {{could be explained by}} its considerably higher reproductive output. Bats that only have one pup per year would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> much longer to have the same fitness as a shorter-lived species with two or three pups per year.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, the Montgomery County Council {{adopted a}} {{proposed}} charter amendment {{to create a}} new elected position of County Executive. Elected to a four-year term, the County Executive could veto legislation passed by the County Council, although five members of the County Council could vote to overrule the veto. All Council Members would continue to be at-large, but they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in seven different residence districts. Republicans favored a referendum on the proposed charter amendment, while Democrats favored it in principle but urged the specific amendment's defeat because the duties of the County Executive were not specific enough. In the referendum held in September 1966, the referendum was defeated, with 57 percent of voters opposed.|$|E
25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to what they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony {{is not just about}} the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E

25|$|In February 1967, the Montgomery County Council {{formed a}} {{commission}} to draft a charter amendment to elect a county executive. The commission's plan was to separate the legislative and executive functions of government. The county council {{would continue to be}} the legislative branch of county government, and an elected full-time County Executive who could veto legislation passed by the Council; it would take five votes by the Council to override a veto. The County Executive would hire a chief administrative officer to supervise the daily operations of the government. All Council Members would be elected at-large by all county residents, but five of the seven would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in each of five different residential districts of substantially equal population. In November 1968, the charter amendment was approved, with 53 percent of votes in favor.|$|E
500|$|The poems, many {{of which}} had a theme of youth, were {{inspired}} {{in part by the}} works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The largest inspiration on Poe, however, came from the work of Lord Byron; the character of the title poem [...] "Tamerlane" [...] has a daughter named [...] "Ada", named after Byron's own daughter Ada Lovelace. Poe admired Byron both for his poetry and for his rebellious personality. John Allan blamed Poe's interest in Byron for his licentiousness. Some biographers suggest that Poe's wandering to Boston and joining the Army represent a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> like an outcast inspired by Byron.|$|E

[...] "It's important {{that we have an}} experienced person to fight for jobs for Southwest Ohio. We need to bring economic growth to our area," [...] McEwen said.
