50|$|During {{the last}} few years of {{production}} the I-36 interiors were largely finished in teak, with a teak and holly cabin sole (floor). Earlier models also used the teak and holly floor, with a mix of white fiberglass and teak accents on the bulkheads (walls) in the living areas. Ventilation below deck is provided by two overhead hatches and six opening cabin ports. There are also four, larger, <b>non-opening</b> <b>side</b> windows.|$|R
5000|$|Popular minor options: (shared with PD-4102) Choice {{of either}} GM/Guide [...] "arrow" [...] directional/brake lamps (std) or GE colored glass sealed beam lamps (std on early PD-4104); driver's GMC-branded spotlight; choice of long transit-style rear view side mirrors (std) or front end mounded round ("lollypop") style mirrors; options for partial <b>non-opening</b> <b>side</b> windows when air {{conditioning}} ordered. optional front window bug screens on all models. (Greyhound usually ordered the standard lamp and mirror items, while Trailways {{opted for the}} optional mirrors and sealed beams, {{as well as the}} front window bug screens. Trailways also opted for the driver's side spotlight on most orders, as they did on the PD-4104.) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{porthole}} {{on a ship}} {{may also}} be called a sidescuttle or <b>side</b> <b>scuttle</b> (<b>side</b> hole), as officially termed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. This term {{is used in the}} U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. [...] It is also used in related rules and regulations for the construction of ships. The use of the word [...] "sidescuttle" [...] instead of [...] "porthole" [...] is meant to be broad, including any covered or uncovered hole {{in the side of the}} vessel.|$|R
25|$|The {{windows were}} {{intended}} to offset the significant blind spots created by the very wide C-pillars that were characteristic of American cars produced at this time. Even narrow opera windows helped rear visibility. In an age of decreasing dimensions and increasingly common use of <b>non-opening</b> rear <b>side</b> windows on 2-door models, the small opera windows helped rear passengers to be somewhat less claustrophobic.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will put}} Abel Hunt one <b>side</b> of the <b>scuttle,</b> and Horry Sims the other. Whoever is on guard must {{sit by the}} side of the Tory lad, and if so be he gives any token of crying out, then shall the gag go in and remain there." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes; and I {{tried the}} {{stranger}} men out last evening. It {{was after a}} council with Margaret. She was sure, and I agreed with her, that the men for'ard are not blindly yielding to our bringing them in to be prisoners in Valparaiso. As we tried to forecast it, their plan is to desert the Elsinore in the boats {{as soon as we}} fetch up with the land. Also, considering some of the bitter lunatic spirits for'ard, there would be a large chance of their drilling the Elsinore's steel <b>sides</b> and <b>scuttling</b> her ere they took to the boats. For scuttling a ship is surely as ancient a practice as mutiny on the high seas.|$|R
5000|$|... "The coupé {{two-seater}} is {{of airline}} type {{and there is}} a bench type of seat with adjustment to the back and good luggage space behind. A sliding roof, safety glass windows, a windscreen which can be wound out, a rear blind, ventilators in the <b>side</b> of the <b>scuttle,</b> large headlamps with stone guards, a spare wheel, door locks, a sports spring steering wheel, flush fitting traffic indicators, a roof light and an inside reflecting mirror are included." ...|$|R
2500|$|During early October, Australia escorted a {{group of}} troop {{transports}} returning from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom. On 29 October, Australia recovered nine of the thirteen crew from a Short Sunderland flying boat which crashed off Greenock, Scotland during a gale; the other four were carried away by the heavy seas during the rescue. The cruiser underwent a refit in Liverpool during November and December. During a German air raid {{on the night of}} 20 December, a [...] torpedo was dropped on the dry-dock Australia was berthed in, but this landed alongside the ship and did not explode. The ship was damaged during an air raid the following night: the blast from a [...] bomb landing near the port <b>side</b> cracked several <b>scuttles</b> and damaged the catapult.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford Prefect was {{introduced}} in October 1938 and built by the Ford plant in Dagenham, Essex. The original Ford Prefect was a slight reworking of the previous year's 7Y, the first Ford car designed outside of Detroit, Michigan. It was designed specifically for the British market. It had a [...] side-valve engine with thermocirculation radiator (no pump) {{and the ability to}} be started by a crank handle, should the battery not have sufficient power to turn the starter motor, running from the six-Volt charging system. The windscreen wipers were powered by the vacuum ported from the engine intake manifold — as the car laboured uphill the wipers would slow to a standstill due to the intake manifold vacuum dropping to near nil, only to start working again as the top was reached and the intake vacuum increased. The windscreen opened forward pivoting on hinges on the top edge; two flaps either <b>side</b> of the <b>scuttle</b> also let air into the car. The car has a durable four-cylinder motor.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimately, {{the planes}} from Composite Squadron 42, flying from Bogue, inflicted enough {{damage on the}} submarine, later {{identified}} as , to force the German crew to abandon ship. While Bogue's airmen watched, U-1229s crew went over the <b>side.</b> The submarine, <b>scuttling</b> charges apparently set, exploded and settled into the Atlantic. Later, at 16:10, the destroyer escorts arrived on the scene; Wilhoite picked up one body of a German sailor, who was summarily buried at sea. Janssen picked up U-1229s survivors. Wilhoite, {{along with the other}} units of TG 22.3, later received the Presidential Unit Citation for the group's submarine-hunting activities. Wilhoite had {{been a part of the}} powerful and sustained offensive during a period of heavy U-boat activity threatening the uninterrupted flow of supplies to the European theater that, since the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, had assumed great importance. As the citation text concluded: [...] "The gallantry and superb teamwork of the officers and men who fought the embarked planes and who manned Bogue and her escort vessels were largely instrumental in forcing the complete withdrawal of enemy submarines from supply routes essential to the maintenance of our established military supremacy." [...] But, for ships like Wilhoite, there was little time to rest on her laurels. Germany was not beaten yet; there would still be more U-boats to fight. Proceeding to Argentia after TG 22.3's kill of U-1229, Wilhoite and her consorts again went after enemy submarines reported in that area. Attacks made over a three-day period, 8, 9, and 10 September, were all unsuccessful. Wilhoite then patrolled off the Grand Banks before she sailed for the New York Navy Yard at the end of September for voyage repairs. Upon completion of her yard period on 7 October, Wilhoite trained off Montauk Point, Long Island, in ASW tactics before she got underway for Norfolk on 14 October with the remainder of CortDiv 51. Joining Bogue at Norfolk and becoming TG 33.3, the ships headed south to Bermuda, arriving there on 23 October. Wilhoite and her consorts subsequently trained in ASW tactics out of Great Sound, Bermuda, into November. Wilhoite returned to New York with TG 33.3 before the unit put to sea for a [...] "barrier patrol" [...] between Brown's Bank and the Nova Scotia entrance to the Gulf of Maine in early December. Detached from Bogue's screen at 12:35 on 7 December, Wilhoite assisted [...] in developing a sonar contact until 11 December, when Wilhoite headed for Norfolk. Wilhoite rejoined Bogue's screen and departed Norfolk on the day after Christmas 1944, bound for Bermuda. The destroyer escort patrolled with TG 22.3 out of Port Royal Bay before she returned to New York for repairs on 16 January 1945. Wilhoite resumed operations with that illustrious aircraft carrier on 20 January, planeguarding for her as she conducted carrier qualifications (carquals) off Quonset Point, Rhode Island. Detached from that duty on the 21st, Wilhoite sailed for Casco Bay, Maine, where she exercised in ASW and gunnery for a week. She again screened and plane-guarded for Bogue off Quonset Point into early February, while the carrier once more ran carquals for her embarked air group. The destroyer escort then spent a period of availability at the New York Navy Yard from 8 to 19 February before she engaged in training operations into late March, out of Casco Bay and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Wilhoite departed Casco Bay on 28 March and, on the. following day, rendezvoused with TG 22.14—the unit assigned the task of hunting a reported southbound U-boat placed by intelligence information at [...] At 11:39 on 31 March, Janssen's part of Task Unit (TU) 22.3.1—made a sound contact. Wilhoite picked it up soon thereafter and attacked at 1146, her [...] "hedgehog" [...] hurling a pattern of projectiles six minutes later. She left two deep explosions soon thereafter but could ascertain no evidence of having scored any hits.|$|R
