6000|$|I am {{not sure}} that these cases are really exceptions. The law of [...] Composition of Causes, I think, is really fulfilled, and the [...] {{appearance}} to the contrary is produced by attending to the remote [...] instead of the immediate effect of the causes. In the cases [...] mentioned, the immediate effect of the causes in action is a [...] collocation, and the duplication of the cause does double the [...] quantity of collocation. Two men could raise the gun to the required [...] angle twice as quickly as one, though one is enough. Two sparks put [...] two sets of particles of the gunpowder into the state of intestine [...] motion which makes them explode, though one is sufficient. It is the [...] collocation itself that does not, by being doubled, always double [...] the effect; because in many cases a certain collocation, once [...] obtained, is all that is required for the production of the whole [...] amount of effect which can be produced at all at the given time and [...] place. Doubling the collocation with difference of time and place, [...] as by pointing two guns, or exploding a second barrel after the [...] first, does double the effect. This remark applies still more to Mr. [...] Bain’s third example, that of a double dose of medicine; for a [...] double dose of an aperient does purge more violently, and a double [...] dose of laudanum does produce longer and sounder sleep. But a double [...] purging, or a double amount of <b>narcotism,</b> may have remote effects [...] different in kind from the effect of the smaller amount, reducing [...] the case to that of heteropathic laws, discussed in the text.|$|E
60|$|Credulity, as {{a mental}} and moral phenomenon, {{manifests itself in}} widely {{different}} ways, according as it chances to be the daughter of fancy or terror. The one lies warm about the heart as Folk-lore, fills moonlit dells with dancing fairies, sets out a meal for the Brownie, hears the tinkle of airy bridle-bells as Tamlane rides away with the Queen of Dreams, changes Pluto and Proserpine into Oberon and Titania, and makes friends with unseen powers as Good Folk; {{the other is a}} bird of night, whose shadow sends a chill among the roots of the hair: it sucks with the vampire, gorges with the ghoule, is choked by the night-hag, pines away under the witch's charm, and commits uncleanness with the embodied Principle of Evil, giving up the fair realm of innocent belief to a murky throng from the slums and stews of the debauched brain. Both have vanished from among educated men, and such superstition as comes to the surface now-a-days is the harmless Jacobitism of sentiment, pleasing itself with the fiction all the more because there is no exacting reality behind it to impose a duty or demand a sacrifice. And as Jacobitism survived the Stuarts, so this has outlived the dynasty to which it professes an after-dinner allegiance. It nails a horseshoe over the door, but keeps a rattle by its bedside to summon a more substantial watchman; it hangs a crape on the beehives to get a taste of ideal sweetness, but obeys the teaching of the latest bee-book for material and marketable honey. This is the aesthetic variety of the malady, or rather, perhaps, it is only the old complaint robbed of all its pain, and lapped in waking dreams by the <b>narcotism</b> of an age of science. To the world at large it is not undelightful to see the poetical instincts of friends and neighbors finding some other vent than that of verse. But there has been a superstition of very different fibre, of more intense and practical validity, the deformed child of faith, peopling the midnight of the mind with fearful shapes and phrenetic suggestions, a monstrous brood of its own begetting, and making even good men ferocious in imagined self-defence.|$|E

The data on number the consumers of drugs registered in narcological establishments testify to a high level of prevalence of a <b>narcotism</b> in Russia. Prevalence of drunkenness in Russia remains still high and makes 1, 6 % of an aggregate number of the population. Thus in a number of regions this parameter was stabilized at a level of 3 - 5 % of an aggregate number of the population. Some decrease in primary desease by drunkenness and alcoholic psychoses was outlined. However this parameter still remains at a high level, exceeding a level of 1991 in 3, 8 times...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design the {{interactive}} diagnosis system for preventing and managing of habitual substance disorders in adolescents. Research process includes the requirement analysis, making of questionnaires, actual survey, and its analysis. Especially, this paper is about knowledge-based system to diagnose the factors of the habitual substance disorder. Our system is to diagnose and manage habitual substance disorder, especially addictions to drinking, smoking and drug. It collects answers for the questionnaires about adolescent’s environment, and analyzes the factor for adolescents to fall into temptation. Our system suggests the customized solution to conquer that for each adolescent. Moreover, our system also saves the history to manage the status of each teenager constantly and to make the survey and analysis information. With our system, young boys and girls can know their seriousness of alcoholism, nicotinism, and <b>narcotism.</b> And they can get all possible helps through our system. Key words...|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy-associated {{death is}} defined as the death of a woman from any cause during {{pregnancy}} or in the year after delivery. This review concentrates on cardiac conditions that may result in pregnancy-associated death including, but not limited to, acute myocardial infarction, endocarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and prolonged QT syndrome. Lethal vascular conditions may also occur involving arterial dissection and thromboembolism, on occasion exacerbated by hypercoagulability, and altered hormonal and physiologic states. The autopsy evaluation of these patients includes a careful assessment of the medical history particularly for prior pregnancy-related conditions, fetal loss, and episodes of unexplained collapse. A family history of sudden death at an early age may be significant. At autopsy, evaluation for underlying syndromes such as Marfan, or evidence of intravenous <b>narcotism</b> should be undertaken. Autopsy examination involves careful dissection of the heart and vessels with consideration of conduction tract studies and possible genetic evaluation for prolonged QT syndrome.

40|$|Deaths in the United States {{classified}} as unintentional poisoning by drugs and medicaments fell from 14. 7 per million population in 1975 to 8. 8 in 1978, a 40 per cent decrease. Seventy-three per cent of this drop attributable {{to a reduction}} in deaths coded to opiates and intravenous <b>narcotism.</b> These two categories accounted for 38 per cent of all unintentional drug deaths in 1975 but only 15 per cent in 1978. There was no simultaneous increase in other drug-related deaths, including suicides, to account for the reduction in deaths coded to opiates. The highest mortality rates and the greatest variation in mortality during 1970 - 78 occurred in 20 - 29 year old non-White males. Racial and sex differences in opiate poisoning mortality, notable early in the decade, were greatly reduced by 1978 due to a relatively larger decline in mortality of males and non-Whites. Time trends in mortality from opiate poisoning appear to coincide with variations in the amount of heroin smuggled into the country...|$|E
40|$|Mitragyna speciosa (Rubiaece) is a {{tropical}} plant indigenous to Thailand and Malaysia. The leaves of this plant, known as “Kratom” in Thailand and “Biak-Biak” in Malaysia, were traditionally {{used by many}} laborers as a stimulant like coca or {{as a substitute for}} opium. But the use of this plant is now illegal in these countries because of its <b>narcotism.</b> The unique properties of this medicinal plant have attracted many researchers over the last fifty years. An alkaloidal extract was prepared from the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa with chloroform. After extraction, the major alkaloid was isolated by using chromatographic technique such as column chromatography. Purification process was carried out by using Preparative Thin Layer Chromatography. The structure of pure alkaloid was elucidated by using various spectroscopic methods including NMR, GCMS, FTIR and UV. From the research, the structure of major alkaloid cannot be seen. This is because a lot of impurities in the samples preparation even though the purification technique had been used. As a conclusion, an alkaloid was successfully isolated. Base on the comparison of proton NMR result and that of in the Literature Review found that they are not the same alkaloid. However, the structure of the alkaloid cannot be elucidated due to the presence of other contaminants in an alkaloid sample...|$|E

It includes the water-spirit secretion pressed out from the feed-curative plants of Caucasus as well as mountain honey, pollen of the Georgian beer flower and the red wine made from the vine of unique bread. The balm is registrated in the Republics of Ukraine and Byelorussia as a radioprotective Means for preventive inspection and medical treatment of radial injuri. The results was of the balm research on antinarcotic and antialcoholic action is represented in the Article, which was held in the medical centre of radiology in Obninsky city of Russian Federation. In experiments on adult mice and rats it is shown, that radioprotective balm “Graal” (the nonalcoholic concentrate) is effective means for preventive maintenance and treatment of various forms of medicinal dependence (alkoholism, a <b>narcotism).</b> In various tests of conditioned reflexive training, it has been shown, that BG considerably reduces amnestic and narcotic action of ethanol. Natural BG (spirit-including) caused considerably smaller changes in behaviour of animals, rather than equivalent volume of the pure spirit contained in balm. Regular introduction BG by an animal improved the general physical condition of animals and raised their serviceability without effects of an exhaustion, characteristics for other neurostimulators...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Chinese green tea {{is one of}} the daily consumption beverages in the world and is considered a promising cancer chemopreventive agent. In the present study, we investigate the role of lung cancer prevention by green tea and its mechanism. Methods Three groups of female SD rats were kept with the same feed. Rats in group A were administrated with 1 % green tea drinking, while in group B and group C with water only. Animals in group A and group B were given 3, 4 -benzopyrene-corn oil mixture pulmonary injection fortnightly for 4 times, while in group C corn oil only. Rats were sacrificed 1 year after the first injection under <b>narcotism.</b> Lung tumors and lung tissues were performed H＆E staining for cancer identification. Each case of lung cancer was examined for expression of p 53 and Bcl- 2 with in situ hybridization analysis and immunohistochemistry staining. Results No cancer was found in rats in group C. However, in group B, 15 out of 20 rats were found generating lung cancer, and in group A, 6 out of 20 rats inducing lung cancer were recorded. The rate of lung carcinogenesis in rats was decreased from 75 % to 30 % by 1 % chinese green tea oral administration (χ 2 = 8. 12, P 0. 05). However, significantly lower level of Bcl- 2 expression was found in lung cancer tissues of group A than that of group B (P< 0. 05). Conclusion The results indicate that chinese green tea inhibits lung carcinogenesis. Chinese green tea can slightly upregulate expression of p 53, but significantly downregulate expression of Bcl- 2 in lung cancer, and this {{may be related to the}} mechanism of lung cancer prevention...|$|E
