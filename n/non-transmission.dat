50|$|High voltage is {{used for}} {{electric}} power transmission to reduce the energy lost in {{the resistance of the}} wires. For a given quantity of power transmitted, doubling the voltage will deliver the same power at only half the current. Since the power lost as heat in the wires is proportional to the wires' resistance as a share of the total resistance, and doubling voltage allows for the quadrupling of <b>non-transmission</b> resistance without losing power, doubling the voltage reduces the line losses per unit of electrical power delivered by approximately a factor of 4. While power lost in transmission can also be reduced by increasing the conductor size, larger conductors are heavier and more expensive.|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} based on {{hypothesis}} that whether continuous entomological surveillance of Ae. aegypti and simultaneous appropriate interventions in key containers during <b>non-transmission</b> (December-May) months would have any impact on breeding of Aedes and dengue cases during the following transmission months (June-November). The impact of the surveillance and intervention measures undertaken during <b>non-transmission</b> months were assessed by entomological indicators namely container index (CI), house index (HI), pupal index (PI) and breteau index (BI). A total of 28 localities of West Zone of Delhi with persistent dengue endemicity were selected for the study. Out of these localities, 20 were included in study group while other 8 localities were in control group. IEC and various Aedes breeding control activities were carried out in study group in both <b>non-transmission</b> and transmission season whereas control group {{did not have any}} such interventions during <b>non-transmission</b> months as per guidelines of MCD. These activities were undertaken by a team of investigators from NIMR and SDMC, Delhi. In control group, investigators from NIMR carried out surveillance activity to monitor the breeding of Aedes mosquito in localities. Comparison of baseline data revealed that all indices in control and study group of localities were comparable and statistically non-significant (p> 0. 05). In both study and control groups, indices were calculated after pooling data on seasonal basis, i. e., transmission and <b>non-transmission</b> months for both years. The test of significance conducted on all the four indices, i. e., HI, PI, CI, and BI, revealed a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the study group and control group during transmission and <b>non-transmission</b> months except in HI. Due to consistent intervention measures undertaken in <b>non-transmission</b> months in study group, reduction in CI, HI, BI and PI was observed 63 %, 62 %, 64 % and 99 % respectively during transmission months as compared to control group where increase of 59 %, 102 %, 73 % and 71 % respectively. As a result of reduction in larval indices, no dengue case (except one NS 1) was observed in study group, whereas 38 dengue cases were observed in control group. Through this pilot study, it is concluded that proper intervention in <b>non-transmission</b> season reduces vector density and subsequently dengue cases in transmission season...|$|E

40|$|To reach EU’s {{climate and}} energy target an {{integrated}} electricity market {{is considered to}} be required (Klessmann, et al., 2011; Boie, et al., 2014; Becker, et al., 2013). As a result the European Commission decided to form a set of rules, named the Network Codes, to create a single European market (ENTSO-E, 2013 b). The Network Codes will affect Distribution- and Transmission System Operators, grid users and production units as well as all the other actors on the electricity market (Eurelectric, n. d. a). Concerns regarding what the Network Codes’ actual consequences are have been expressed within the line of business (Swedish Energy, 2013 a). Therefore the purpose of this master’s thesis was to determine and furthermore illustrate the consequences the Network Codes will have, in current version, for a Swedish <b>non-transmission</b> system connected electricity company and determine what actions need to be taken. The purpose has been addressed by conducting interviews, document studies and by utilizing a change management model, the Intervention Strategy Model, introduced by Paton & McCalman (2000). The structured approach that {{is the nature of the}} model was used when determining the consequences the Network Codes enforce and what actions a <b>non-transmission</b> system connected electricity company has to take to cope with them. To further facilitate the determination of these actions this study was conducted on a <b>non-transmission</b> system connected electricity company, in this thesis named Electricity Company A. The investigation of the concerns expressed within the line of business illustrated that the concerns were diverse but a majority of them might be incorporated into either of the following groups, simulation models, demand side aggregator and information handling. Out of these groups information handling was by far the area of greatest concern with issues primarily connected to the Distribution System Operator. Consequently this thesis focused on the Distribution System Operator’s perspective. The analysis of the area of greatest concern, presented in two flow charts, clearly showed the increased amount of communication enforced by the Network Codes. This increased information handling results in numerous possible organisational consequences for the Distribution System Operator, for example might new systems be required and some existing systems be used with or without adaption. Furthermore, the extra workload could possibly be handled by the existing personnel, in some cases after complementary education, but it might also require new personnel. Finally the Network Codes open up for the possibility for the Distribution System Operator to define certain details which may be conducted individually or in cooperation with other Distribution System Operators. Which of these possible consequences that will affect a specific company is, however, dependent on its preconditions. The study on Electricity Company A reveals that the numerous actions required to handle the new communication were not as significant as the line of business might have feared. For Electricity Company A, primarily a new system is needed to handle the real-time values and some of the existing systems need to be updated. Additionally the combined extra work load might require extra personnel for Electricity Company A even though the individual work assignments are fairly small. The actions required should be fairly similar for companies of approximately equal size but might be more extensive for smaller <b>non-transmission</b> system connected electricity companies. All companies need, however, to conduct an individual analysis to determine which specific actions are required for them. The conclusions of this thesis aspired, and partly succeeded, to be generalizable on a European level. One example of this is the usage of the Intervention Strategy Model which proved applicable for determining which specific actions are required for all European electricity companies. Furthermore the concerns presented and the possible consequences of the increased information handling found, are generalizable but not complete for all European electricity companies. This thesis focused on one part of the complex Network Codes’ consequences and consequently further research is needed to fully understand the consequences for the electricity business in total...|$|E

40|$|Global {{environmental}} changes are causing Lyme disease {{to emerge in}} Europe. The life cycle of Ixodes ricinus, the tick vector of Lyme disease, involves an ontogenetic niche shift, from the larval and nymphal stages utilizing {{a wide range of}} hosts, picking up the pathogens causing Lyme disease from small vertebrates, to the adult stage depending on larger (<b>non-transmission)</b> hosts, typically deer. Because of this complexity the role of different host species for emergence of Lyme disease remains controversial. Here, by analysing long-term data on incidence in humans over a broad geographical scale in Norway, we show that both high spatial and temporal deer population density increase Lyme disease incidence. However, the trajectories of deer population sizes play an overall limited role for the recent emergence of the disease. Our study suggests that managing deer populations will have some effect on disease incidence, but that Lyme disease may nevertheless increase as multiple drivers are involved...|$|E

Such a prioritybased algorithm, although satisfying real-time constraints, yields low disk utilization due to the excessive disk-seek time.

WRR-SCAN guarantees {{to meet the deadline}} of a real-time task by reserving disk bandwidth according to its real-time constraints. WRR-SCAN services scheduled tasks in scan order to minimize the disk-seek time. In addition, WRR-SCAN delivers better response time for aperiodic tasks which are served in best-effort manner by priority-based algorithms. We conducted a set of extensive experiments to compare WRR-SCAN and SCAN-EDF, a priority-based algorithm studied extensively in literature. The experimental results show that WRR-SCAN reduces <b>non-transmission</b> overhead significantly and produces a guaranteed minimum data rate for aperiodic tasks while keeping the deadlines of real-time tasks.

40|$|Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks (VDTNs) {{are a new}} {{approach}} for vehicular communications where vehicles cooperate with each other, acting as the communication infrastructure, to provide low-cost asynchronous opportunistic communications. These communication technologies assume variable delays and bandwidth constraints characterized by a <b>non-transmission</b> control protocol/internet protocol architecture but interacting with it {{at the edge of}} the network. VDTNs are based on the principle of asynchronous communications, bundle-oriented communication from the DTN architecture, employing a store-carry-and-forward routing paradigm. In this sense, VDTNs should use the tight network resources optimizing each opportunistic contact among nodes. Given the limited contact times among nodes, fragmentation appears as a possible solution to improve the overall network performance, increasing the bundle delivery probability. This article proposes the use of several fragmentation approaches (proactive, source, reactive, and toilet paper) for VDTNs. They are discussed and evaluated through a laboratory testbed.

Notably, only 40 % of primarily infected women transmit CMV to the fetus. CMV-specific T-cell response has a role in CMV disease but individual immune heterogeneity precludes reliable correlation between measurable T-cells response and intrauterine transmission. To establish a correlation between maternal T-cells response and fetal CMV transmission using an individual normalized immune response. We analyzed IFN-γ secretion upon whole blood stimulation from primary CMV-infected pregnant women, with either CMV-peptides or PHA-mitogen. We established a new normalization method of individual IFN-γ response to CMV by defining the ratio between specific-CMV response and non-specific mitogen response (defined as IFN-γ relative response, RR), aiming to overcome high person-to-person immune variability. We found a unique subpopulation of women with low IFN-γ RR strongly correlated with absence of transmission. IFN-γ RR lower than 1. 8 % (threshold determined by ROC analysis) reduces the pre-test probability of transmission from 40 % to 8 %, revealing an unexpected link between low IFN-γ RR and <b>non-transmission.</b> In pregnant women with primary CMV infection, low IFN-γ RR is associated with low risk of transmission...|$|E

Methods: The study was a school-based intervention conducted in three middle schools and two high schools in Wuhan, China, which included 702 boys and 766 girls, with ages from 11 to 18 years old. The intervention was a one-class education program about HIV/AIDS for participants.

Spatial Empirical Bayesian smoothing was deployed to identify clusters of malaria at the sub-district level from 2004 to 2008. RESULTS: Trend of the overall districts {{and most of the}} endemic districts have decreased except Pemagatshel, which has an increase in the trend.

40|$|In asexual organisms, {{the clone}} {{constitutes}} a level above the individual. Most dandelions (Taraxacum officinale s. l.) reproduce asexually through apomixis, asexual reproduction through seeds. A clone {{can be seen}} as a superorganism that is born, that growths, degenerates and eventually dies. Apomixis in dandelions is controlled by a few dominant genes, the so called apomixis-genes. This implies that there should be three hierarchical levels in a field of dandelions: 1. the individual plant, 2. the clone and 3. the apomixis gene. Using co-dominant genetic markers that are linked to a dominant apomixis gene, we provide evidence that this hierarchical structure indeed exists in apomictic dandelion populations. The apomixis gene view implies that whereas individual clones may go extinct due to deleterious mutation accumulation or the lack of adaptive potential, apomixis genes can prevail much longer periods of evolutionary time in a succession of clones. We provide evidence that an apomixis-gene in Taraxacum is not transmitted to diploid offspring, which could explain the absence of apomixis in diploid dandelions. Haploid <b>non-transmission</b> may be caused by a mutation load that is linked to the apomixis genes as a consequence of the deep asexual reproduction history of these genes residing in many clones in the pas...|$|E

First we discuss the Slovenian immigration, then we take into account various sociolinguistic issues, and the main part of the article is devoted to the analysis of interviews. One of the effects of immigration is the lack of opportunities for the use of Slovene. French, as the language of the environment, prevails in the working environment and also helps create social ties. Family language policies of <b>non-transmission</b> of mother tongues may arise as a result of mixed marriages – if parents do not speak the same language, the Slovene language loses the battle with French, which becomes the language of communication. We noticed that in some cases this prevails, but the Slovenian parents in Paris are extremely persistent and, in most cases, Slovene is transferred. However, it should be acknowledged that the level is not always the highest, since the younger generations are not in regular contact with Slovenia. All in all, it is certainly encouraging to know the important role of Slovene in the Parisian community of the Slovenes and that the Slovenian culture is being transferred to next generations...|$|E

The five SNPs showed strong pairwise LD, and the AluIns was highly correlated with proximal SNPs rs 1042839 (Δ 2 = 0. 877, D 9 = 1. 00, P < 0. 0001) and rs 500760 (Δ 2 = 0. 438, D 9 = 0. 942, P < 0. 0001).

Malarial antibody-based surveillance is increasingly recognised as a valuable complement to classic methods {{for the detection of}} infection foci especially at low transmission levels. The study presents serological evidence for transmission heterogeneity among school children in The Gambia measured during the dry, <b>non-transmission</b> season. Methods: Healthy primary school children were randomly selected from 30 schools across the country and screened for malaria infection (microscopy) and antimalarial antibodies (MSP 119). Antibody distribution was modelled using 2 -component finite mixture model with cut-off for positivity from pooled sera set at 2 -standard deviation from the mean of the first component. Factors associated with a positive serological status were identified in a univariate model and then combined in a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, simultaneously adjusting for variations between individuals and school.

Such haplotype-based association studies, however, often face two difficulties; one is the large number of haplotype configurations in the chromosome region under study, and the other is the ambiguity in haplotype phase when only genotype data are observed. The latter complexity may be handled based on an EM algorithm with family data incorporated, whereas the former can be more problematic, especially when haplotypes of rare frequencies are involved. Here based on family data we propose to cluster long haplotypes of linked SNPs in a biological sense, so that the number of haplotypes can be reduced and the power of statistical tests of association can be increased. Results: In this paper we employ family genotype data and combine a clustering scheme with a likelihood ratio statistic to test the association between quantitative phenotypes and haplotype variants. Haplotypes are first grouped based on their evolutionary closeness to establish a set containing core haplotypes. Then, we construct for each family the transmission and <b>non-transmission</b> phase in terms of these core haplotypes, taking into account simultaneously the phase ambiguity as weights. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) is next conducted with these weighted and clustered haplotypes to test for association with disease. This combination of evolution-guide...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Power {{efficiency}} is a capital {{issue in the}} study of mobile wireless nodes owing to constraints on their battery size and weight. In practice, especially for low-power nodes, it is often the case that the power consumed for <b>non-transmission</b> processes is not always negligible. In this paper, we consider the channels with a special form of overhead: a processing energy cost whenever a non-zero signal is transmitted. We show that under certain conditions, achieving the capacity of such channels requires intermittent, or ‘bursty’, transmissions. Thus, an optimal sleeping schedule can be specified for wireless nodes to achieve the optimal power efficiency. We show that in the low SNR regime, there is a simple relation between the optimal burstiness and the overhead cost: one should use a fraction of the available degrees of freedom at an SNR level of √ 2 ɛ, where ɛ is the normalized overhead energy cost. We extend this result to use bursty Gaussian transmissions in multiple parallel channels with different noise levels. Our result can be intuitively interpreted as a “glue pouring ” process, generalizing the wellknown water pouring solution. We then use this approach to compute the achievable rate region of the multiple access channel with overhead cost.

40|$|The {{progesterone}} receptor (PR) is {{a candidate}} gene {{for the development of}} endometriosis, a complex disease with strong hormonal features, common in women of reproductive age. We typed the 306 base pair Alu insertion (AluIns) polymorphism in intron G of PR in 101 individuals, estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the PR locus in 980 Australian triads (endometriosis case and two parents) and used transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) for association with endometriosis. The five SNPs showed strong pairwise LD, and the AluIns was highly correlated with proximal SNPs rs 1042839 ({Delta} 2 = 0. 877, D 9 = 1. 00, P < 0. 0001) and rs 500760 ({Delta} 2 = 0. 438, D 9 = 0. 942, P < 0. 0001). TDT showed weak evidence of allelic association between endometriosis and rs 500760 (P = 0. 027) but not in the expected direction. We identified a common susceptibility haplotype GGGCA across the five SNPs (P = 0. 0167) in the whole sample, but likelihood ratio testing of haplotype transmission and <b>non-transmission</b> of the AluIns and flanking SNPs showed no significant pattern. Further, analysis of our results pooled with those from two previous studies suggested that neither the T 2 allele of the AluIns nor the T 1 /T 2 genotype was associated with endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|Small cell {{networks}} {{have recently been}} proposed as an important evolution path for the next-generation cellular networks. However, {{with more and more}} irregularly deployed base stations (BSs), it is becoming increasingly difficult to quantify the achievable network throughput or energy efficiency. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for downlink performance evaluation of small cell networks, based on a random spatial network model, where BSs and users are modeled as two independent spatial Poisson point processes. A new simple expression of the outage probability is derived, which is analytically tractable and is especially useful with multiantenna transmissions. This new result is then applied to evaluate the network throughput and energy efficiency. It is analytically shown that deploying more BSs can always increase the network throughput, but the throughput will scale with the BS density first linearly, then logarithmically, and finally converge to a constant. On the other hand, increasing the number of BS antennas can decrease the outage probability exponentially, thus can always increase the network throughput. However, increasing the BS density or the number of transmit antennas will first increase and then decrease the energy efficiency if the <b>non-transmission</b> power or the circuit power consumption is less than certain thresholds, and the optimal BS density and the optimal number of BS antennas can be found. Otherwise, the energy efficiency will always decrease. Simulation results shall demonstrate that our conclusions based on the random network model are general and also hold in a regular grid-based model...|$|E
40|$|This study {{conducted}} in 1999 / 2000 {{was designed to}} evaluate the efficacy of praziquantel against Schistosoma japonicum in an area with repeated chemotherapy (Area A) compared with a newly identified endemic focus (Area B) in Hunan Province, China. The population size was 2015 and 2180 in Areas A and B, respectively, of which 1129 and 1298 subjects received stool examination. A total of 230 subjects were identified by the Kato-Katz technique (4 smears per person) as being infected with S. japonicum, 124 in Area A (prevalence 11 %) and 106 in Area B (prevalence 8. 2 %). They were treated with a single oral dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) in the <b>non-transmission</b> season. A follow-up stool examination was made 50 days after treatment. Among the 220 cases followed, 22 were found stool-egg-positive, with an overall cure rate of 90 %, and 99 % reduction of infection intensity (eggs per gram stool). No {{significant difference was found}} in cure rates between the 2 areas (89. 7 % vs 90. 3 %). The efficacy of the drug in the area with repeated chemotherapy was not significantly different from that in the newly identified endemic focus. This study, therefore, suggests that the efficacy of praziquantel against S. japonicum has not changed in the Dongting Lake region after more than 14 years of mass chemotherapy, and {{there is no evidence of}} tolerance or resistance of S. japonicum against praziquantel...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{independent}} system operators (ISOs) {{and others}} have published reports on the costs of transmission congestion. The magnitude of congestion costs cited in these reports {{has contributed to the}} national discussion on the current state of U. S. electricity transmission system and whether it provides an adequate platform for competition in wholesale electricity markets. This report reviews reports of congestion costs and begins to assess their implications for the current national discussion on the importance of the U. S. electricity transmission system for enabling competitive wholesale electricity markets. As a guiding principle, we posit that a more robust electricity system could reduce congestion costs; and thereby, (1) facilitate more vibrant and fair competition in wholesale electricity markets, and (2) enable consumers to seek out the lowest prices for electricity. Yet, examining the details suggests that, sometimes, there will be trade-offs between these goals. Therefore, it is essential to understand who pays, how much, and how do they benefit in evaluating options (both transmission and <b>non-transmission</b> alternatives) to address transmission congestion. To describe the differences among published estimates of congestion costs, we develop and motivate three ways by which transmission congestion costs are calculated in restructured markets. The assessment demonstrates that published transmission congestion costs are not directly comparable because they have been developed to serve different purposes. More importantly, critical information needed to make them more comparable, for example in order to evaluate the impacts of options to relieve congestion, is sometimes not available...|$|E
