5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the iron cage {{was thought to}} resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|Between Moab and Castle Valley, the Colorado River, and indirectly, SR-128, {{form the}} {{southern}} boundary of Arches National Park. Arches National Park is so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of over 2000 natural arches inside park boundaries. While the highway does offer views of several {{features in the}} park, there is no park access along the highway. Popular attractions along this portion include Negro Bill Canyon, with hiking trails to Morning Glory Arch, campgrounds and boat docks at a curve in the river called Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|Many of the North American {{species are}} in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> they emerge in late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These {{periodical}} cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{were then}} punished for {{supporting}} the British invasion, and the fortress city of Intramuros, initially populated by 1200 Spanish families and garrisoned by 400 Spanish troops, kept its cannons pointed at Binondo, the world's oldest Chinatown. The Mexican population was concentrated at the south part of Manila, and also at Cavite, where ships from Spain's American colonies docked, and at Ermita, an area so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of a Mexican hermit that lived there.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna del Maule lake is not {{the only}} lake in the field. The other lakes are Laguna Cari Launa on the Chilean side in the northeastern sector of the field, and Laguna Fea in the south and Laguna Negra lake both on the Argentine side. The Laguna Sin Salida (so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it lacks a river running out of it) is in the northeastern sector of the {{volcanic}} field and it formed within a glacial cirque.|$|E

5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout. A small bronze-coloured shark {{reaching}} a length of , it has a slender body and a long, pointed snout. Its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated rear tips. The hardnose shark is widely distributed in the western Indo-Pacific, from Kenya to southern China and northern Australia. It inhabits warm, shallow waters close to shore.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{designed}} to run along the lake shore, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded {{and in need of}} serious repairs.|$|E
5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E

5000|$|Shadows, {{like the}} other members of Avenged Sevenfold, uses a stage name. In an interview, Shadows says that he chose [...] "M. Shadows" [...] as his stage <b>name</b> <b>because</b> he thought of himself as [...] "the darker {{character}} in the group,". The M is in place of his first name, Matthew, which {{he did not want to}} be in his stage <b>name</b> <b>because</b> of the way it sounded. He also added that he and the band took stage <b>names</b> <b>because</b> many other successful musicians that they were influenced by had them (e.g. Slash of Guns N' Roses, Munky of Korn and the members of Slipknot).|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
50|$|Boettgerillidae Van Goethem, 1972 {{is not an}} {{available}} <b>name,</b> <b>because</b> it has no diagnosis.|$|R

5|$|In Negaunee, the routing uses {{a street}} named County Road east {{from the city}} line. County Road passes Jackson Park, {{location}} of the first iron ore discovery in the area. The iron mined from the region supplied half of the nation's supply between 1850 and 1900. South of downtown Negaunee, Bus. M-28 turns north along the west fork of Silver Street. The street runs north under an overpass that carries Rail Street, so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it was once a rail line into downtown Negaunee. The trunkline turns east on Jackson Street, running next to the Negaunee City Hall, which was built in 1914–15 {{at a time when}} the city's population was increasing and iron production was peaking. The building still houses the city's offices, police station and library.|$|E
5|$|In New York Bond meets up {{with his}} {{counterpart}} in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b was <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it was {{the first}} planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of its star, Kepler-4. The star was, in turn, named for the Kepler Mission, a NASA satellite whose purpose is to discover Earth-like planets in a section of the sky between constellations Cygnus and Lyra using the transit method. Using this method, Kepler notes small and steady decreases in a star's brightness that are measured as a planet crosses in front of it. Initially, Kepler-4b was detected as a transit event by the Kepler telescope and considered a Kepler Object of Interest with the designation KOI 7.01.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open {{into the shape of}} a star. The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
5|$|NY83 {{begins a}} more erratic routing, passing between West Mud Lake and Black Pond as {{it enters the}} town of Arkwright. For a short {{distance}} it is concurrent with CR85, and takes on the name Black Corner Street, so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> it is located within the hamlet of Black Corners. Although this portion of NY83 is cosigned with CR85, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. An intersection with CR79 is not far off, as it passes {{just north of the}} town of Arkwright. NY83 proceeds west-northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at NY60 in the community of Laona, located just west of the Arkwright town line in Pomfret.|$|E
