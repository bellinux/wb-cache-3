5000|$|To {{compete with}} the aspirin {{products}} sold by his company's competitors and having heard of work being done on the chemical by researchers, McNeil started in 1951 pursuing the development of what he named [...] "acetaminophen", a chemical that had been discovered decades earlier but was little tested {{at the time as}} a pain reliever. The chemical's name <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> was the source for the generic name [...] "acetaminophen" [...] (<b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol)</b> coined by McNeil, {{as well as of the}} brand name [...] "Tylenol" [...] (<b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol),</b> which was coined by a colleague. McNeil recognized that high production costs would mean that the product would have to sell at a higher price than the commonly available aspirin, but that it would have the benefit of not causing stomach irritation. Tylenol was initially approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1955 for sale on a prescription basis, and became available for sale to consumers over the counter in 1960. Elixir Tylenol, a liquid medicine advertised [...] "for little hotheads" [...] went on sale as the first product bearing the Tylenol brand name. McNeil was named chairman of McNeil in 1956 and he remained as chairman of the company after it was purchased in 1960 by Johnson & Johnson for $30 million in stock and was operated as a subsidiary of that firm.|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} process of novel multichannel microfluidic devices with integrated electrodes for amperometric detection is described. Soft-lithography, lift-off and O(2) plasma surface activation sealing techniques were employed for rapid prototyping of cost effective PDMS/glass microchips. The {{capabilities of the}} proposed microdevices were demonstrated by the electrooxidation of hydroquinone and <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP) on a Au working electrode at + 800 mV and + 700 mV, respectively, against a Au pseudo reference electrode, and of thiocyanate on a Cu working electrode at + 700 mV against a Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated) reference electrode. Linear response over the range up to 1. 0 mmol L(- 1) for APAP and up to 4. 0 mmol L(- 1) for hydroquinone and thiocyanate were verified through calibration curves with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 97 (minimum of five data points). The sensitivities for hydroquinone, thiocyanate, and APAP were 28, 19, and 78 mu A mol(- 1) L, respectively. Under the experimental conditions used, the estimated limits of detection were 0. 21, 0. 95, and 0. 12 mmol L(- 1) for hydroquinone, thiocyanate and APAP, respectively.

40|$|In {{heterogeneous}} catalysis {{the identification}} of the active site and crucially its location to prevent unwanted sintering and deactivation during the transformation of the precursor to active catalyst require the integration of dynamic in situ imaging at the atomic level and reactivity studies. We report nanostructural and physico-chemical studies towards an efficient low temperature heterogeneous catalytic process for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (paracetamol or acetaminophen) on tungstated zirconia nanocatalysts of only a few nanometres in size. We directly visualised, in real-time, the dynamic precursor transformation to the active catalyst, which is of great significance in heterogeneous catalysis, using double aberration-corrected in situ electron microscopy at the atomic level under controlled conditions. We quantified the observations with catalytic activity studies for the NSAIDS. The observations using negative defocus imaging in AC-TEM combined with HAADF-STEM have provided the direct evidence for the presence of surface WOx species with dimensions of ≤ 0. 35 nm, nanoclusters and nanoparticles of WOx from up to 0. 6 to 1 nm, located at grain boundaries {{on the surface of the}} zirconia nanoparticles. The observations illustrate that the nanoparticles (NPs) are disordered (distorted) tungsten trioxide. The correlation between the nanostructure and activity of catalysts with different W loadings indicate that surface WOx species, nanoclusters and distorted WO 3 nanoparticles create Brønsted acid sites highly active for the low temperature <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> reaction, with distorted WO 3 NPs contributing to the activity.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP) in plasma that differ in principle from the diazotization procedure of Brodie and Axelrod (1) are described. One method based on the differential absorption peak of APAP at 266 m, which corresponds to the isosbestic point of common drugs such as acetyl-salicylic and salicylic acids, is simple and most specific for APAP. The other method employs a free-radical dye diphenylpicrylhydrazyl which extracts a hydrogen atom from the APAP molecule and is progressively decolorized. The dye method is the least complex and most sensitive. All three methods exhibited satisfactory replication, recovery of added APAP, and comparable plasma levels of the drug. IN 1948, Brodie and Axelrod (1) described a practical method for the determinatioll of <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP) in biologic fluids. The APAP was extracted with ether and hydrolyzed with acid to form p-aminophenol, which was diazotized and coupled to alphanaphthol to produce a red-violet color. This method has been applied in our labora-tory {{for many years to}} {{the determination of}} APAP levels in the plasma after the ingestion of various combinations of analgesic drugs. Tile multiple steps in the procedure and the need for freshly prepared rca-geiits and freshly sublimed alphanaphthol have restricted our studies on APAP blood levels on panels of subjects at several time intervals after the ingestion of a drug. We therefore attempted to develop more simple, less time-consuming procedures. One approach to the problem involved the application of differential absorbance curves (2). in that study, it was suggested that any drug whose differential absorption curve exhibited a peak at a wavelength that corresponded to the isosbestic point of a second drug could be quantitatively estimated in a mixture of the two drugs.

In this work, we established a method and a protocol for performing a toxicogenomic analysis of HepG 2 /C 3 A cultivated in a microfluidic biochip. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have shown the induction of the NRF 2 pathway and the related drug metabolism pathways when the HepG 2 /C 3 A cells were cultivated in the biochip. The induction of those pathways in the biochip enhanced the metabolism of the <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> drug (acetaminophen-APAP) when compared to Petri cultures. Thus, we observed 50 % growth inhibition of cell proliferation at 1 mM in the biochip, which appeared similar to human plasmatic toxic concentrations reported at 2 mM. The metabolic signature of APAP toxicity in the biochip showed similar biomarkers as those reported in vivo, such as the calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism and reorganization of the cytoskeleton, at the transcriptome and proteome levels (which {{was not the case}} in Petri dishes). These results demonstrate a specific molecular signature for acetaminophen at transcriptomic and proteomic levels closed to situations found in vivo.

The seventh group was treated with combination of both ameliorative compounds (silymarin and N.  sativa extract) with APAP and all animals were treated {{for a period of}} 30 days. ResultsExposure to APAP at the treated dose to mice led to an alteration of liver functions, increased the alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, decreased total protein level as well as increasing the superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde while decreased catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reduced activities.

40|$|Acetaminophen (APAP, <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol,</b> or paracetamol) {{overdosing}} is a prevalent {{cause of}} acute liver injury. While clinical disease is initiated by overt parenchymal hepatocyte necrosis {{in response to}} the analgetic, course of intoxication is substantially influenced by associated activation of innate immunity. This process is supposed to be set in motion by release of danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying hepatocytes and is accompanied by an inflammatory cytokine response. Murine models of APAP-induced liver injury emphasize the complex role that DAMPs and cytokines play in promoting either hepatic pathogenesis or resolution and recovery from intoxication. Whereas the function of key inflammatory cytokines is controversially discussed, a subclass of specific cytokines capable of efficiently activating the hepatocyte signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) - 3 pathway stands out as being consistently protective in murine models of APAP intoxication. Those include foremost interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 11, IL- 13, and IL- 22. Above all, activation of STAT 3 under the influence of these cytokines has the capability to drive hepatocyte compensatory proliferation, a key principle of the regenerating liver. Herein, the role of these specific cytokines during experimental APAP-induced liver injury is highlighted and discussed in a broader perspective. In hard-to-treat or at-risk patients standard therapy may fail and APAP intoxication can proceed towards a fatal condition.

In this work, we established a method and a protocol for performing a toxicogenomic analysis of HepG 2 /C 3 A cultivated in a microfluidic biochip. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have shown the induction of the NRF 2 pathway and the related drug metabolism pathways when the HepG 2 /C 3 A cells were cultivated in the biochip. The induction of those pathways in the biochip enhanced the metabolism of the <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> drug (acetaminophen-APAP) when compared to Petri cultures. Thus, we observed 50 % growth inhibition of cell proliferation at 1 mM in the biochip, which appeared similar to human plasmatic toxic concentrations reported at 2 mM. The metabolic signature of APAP toxicity in the biochip showed similar biomarkers as those reported in vivo, such as the calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism and reorganization of the cytoskeleton, at the transcriptome and proteome levels (which {{was not the case}} in Petri dishes). These results demonstrate a specific molecular signature for acetaminophen at transcriptomic and proteomic levels closed to situations found in vivo. Interestingly, a common component of the signature of the APAP molecule was identified in Petri and biochip cultures via the perturbations of the DNA replication and cell cycle. These findings provide an important insight into the use of microfluidic biochips as new tools in biomarker research in pharmaceutical drug studies and predictiv...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the ameliorative role of silymarin or/and Nigella sativa (N. sativa) water extract against <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP) -induced renal function deterioration in male mice at the biochemical levels. Methods: The mice {{were divided into}} seven groups (10 /group). The first group was served as control. The second group was treated with dose of APAP. The third and fourth groups were treated with silymarin alone and N. sativa water extract alone, respectively. The fifth and sixth groups were treated with combination of APAP with silymarin and APAP with N. sativa water extract, respectively. The seventh group was treated {{with a combination of}} both ameliorative compounds (silymarin and N. sativa water extract) with APAP and all animals were treated for a period of 30 days. Results: Exposure to APAP at the treated dose for mice led to an alteration of kidney function parameters, increase in the level of serum urea and creatinine. Also, paracetamol administration induced oxidative stress in kidney homogenates by increasing malondialdhyde level and decreasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and this stress was ameliorated by administration of either silymarin or N. sativa water extract. Conclusions: Administration of silymarin or/and N. sativa water extract to APAP-treated mice alleviate the toxicity of APAP, and this appeared clearly by biochemical improvement of kidney function parameters and antioxidant parameters. But, the alleviation is more pronounced with the both antioxidants. Thus, the pronounce effect of silymarin and N. sativa water extract is most effective in reducing the toxicity induced by APAP and improving the kidney function parameters and antioxidant status of kidney of male mice...|$|E

Methods: The mice {{were divided into}} seven groups (10 /group). The first group was served as control. While, the second group was treated with dose of APAP. The third and fourth groups were treated with silymarin alone and N.  sativa extract alone respectively.

The seventh group was treated with combination of both ameliorative compounds (silymarin and N.  sativa extract) with APAP and all animals were treated {{for a period of}} 30 days. Results: Exposure to APAP at the treated dose to mice led to an alteration of liver functions, increased the alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, decreased total protein level as well as increasing the superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde while decreased catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reduced activities. The levels of APAP on the biochemical parameters of mice were dose-dependent. Administration of silymarin or/and N.  sativa extract to APAP-treated mice attenuates the toxicity of this compound, objectified by biochemical, histological and ultrastructural improvement of liver.

40|$|The {{leading cause}} of drug-induced liver injury in the {{developed}} world is overdose with <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP). A comparative metabonomic approach was applied to the study of both xenobiotic and endogenous metabolic profiles reflective of in-vivo exposure to APAP (300 mg/kg) and its structural isomer N-acetyl-m-aminophenol (AMAP; 300 mg/kg) in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, which was anchored with histopathology. Liver and urine samples were collected at 1, 3 and 6 hours post-treatment and analyzed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (liver only). Histopathology revealed the presence of centrilobular necrosis from 3 hours post-APAP treatment, while an AMAP-mediated necrotic end-point was not observed within the time-scale of this study, yet two of five treated mice showed minimal centrilobular eosinophilia. The 1 H-NMR spectroscopic xenobiotic metabolic profile of APAP-treated animals comprised of mercapturate (urine and liver) and glutathionyl (liver) conjugates detected at 1 hour post-treatment. This finding corroborated the hepatic endogenous metabolic profile which showed depletion of glutathione from 1 hour onwards. In contrast, AMAP glutathionyl conjugates were not detected, nor was AMAP-induced depletion of hepatic glutathione observed. APAP administration induced significant endogenous hepatic metabolic perturbations, primarily linked to oxidative and energetic stress, and perturbation of amino acid metabolism. Early depletion of glutathione was followed by depletion of additional sulphur containing metabolites, while altered levels of mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolites indicated a disruption of energy homeostasis. In contrast, AMAP administration caused minimal, transient, distinct metabolic perturbations and by 6 hours the metabolic profiles of AMAP-treated mice were indistinguishable from those of controls...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{described}} for the rapid quantitative analysis of N-acetyl-p-amino-phenol (APAP) in urine. APAP and its conjugates {{present in the}} urine following the ingestion of acetophenetidin, APAP or acetanilid, are hydrolyzed with acid to p. aminophenol. This compound is coupled with phenol {{in the presence of}} hypobromite to form an indophenol dye whose concentration is determined spectrophotometrically. Application of this method to a study of 3 human subjects treated with acetopheneti-din is described. HE 1) ESPIIEAD USE of analgesic drugs, such as acetophenetnhn and <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP), which give rise to conjugated APAP in the urine, has stimulated an interest for a simple and rapid method which could be routinely used in clinical laboratories for the detection and quantitation of these drugs and their metabolites. The need for such a test has been pointed out by recent reports indicating that the abuse of certain of ti 1 ese analgesic drugs may Iea(l to Iheph-ropathies (1, 2). The method previously described by Brodie and Axel-rod (3, 4) for the determination of conjugated APAP involves acid hydrolysis followed by extraction of tile resulting p-aminophenol into ethyl ether and then its extraction from the organic solvent into dilute acid. The p-aminophenol was then reacted with phenol in the presence of sodium hypobromite to form an indophenol dye whose concentration was determined in a spectrophotometer. The method presented here for the determination of APAP in urine is simple enough for routine use in the clinical laboratory. The extrac-tion of APAP or p-aminophenol into organic solvent described by Brodie and Axelrod has been eliminated. APAP and its conjugate...|$|E

There are a number of factors which potentially impact on the risk of an individual developing hepatotoxicity following an acute paracetamol overdose. These include the dose of paracetamol ingested, time to presentation, decreased liver glutathione, and induction of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isoenzymes responsible for the metabolism of paracetamol to its toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). In this paper, we review the currently published literature to determine whether induction of relevant CYP isoenzymes is a risk factor for hepatotoxicity in patients with acute paracetamol overdose. Animal and human in vitro studies have shown that the CYP isoenzyme responsible for the majority of human biotransformation of paracetamol to NAPQI is CYP 2 E 1 at both therapeutic and toxic doses of paracetamol. Current UK treatment guidelines suggest that patients who use a number of drugs therapeutically should be treated as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; after paracetamol overdose. However, based on our review of the available literature, it appears that the only drugs for which there is evidence of the potential for an increased risk of hepatotoxicity associated with paracetamol overdose are phenobarbital, primidone, isoniazid, and perhaps St John&# 39;s wort. There is no evidence that other drugs often quoted as increasing risk, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampicin, rifabutin, efavirenz, or nevirapine, should be considered risk factors for hepatotoxicity in patients presenting with acute paracetamol overdose.

40|$|<b>N-Acetyl-p-Aminophenol</b> (APAP), {{also known}} as acetaminophen, is the most {{commonly}} used over-the counter analgesic and antipyretic medication. However, its overdose leads to both liver and kidney damage. APAP-induced toxicity is considered as one of the primary causes of acute liver failure; numerous scientific reports have focused majorly on APAP hepatotoxicity. Alternatively, not many works approach APAP nephrotoxicity focusing on both its mechanisms of action and therapeutic exploration. Moringa oleifera (MO) is pervasive in nature, is reported to possess a surplus amount of nutrients, and is enriched with several bioactive candidates including trace elements that act as curatives for various clinical conditions. In this study, we evaluated the nephro-protective potential of MO leaf extract against APAP nephrotoxicity in male Balb/c mice. A single-dose acute oral toxicity design was implemented in this study. Group 2, 3, 4 and 5 received a toxic dose of APAP (400 mg/kg of bw, i. p) and after an hour, these groups were administered with saline (10 mL/kg), silymarin—positive control (100 mg/kg of bw, i. p), MO leaf extract (100 mg/kg of bw, i. p), and MO leaf extract (200 mg/kg bw, i. p) respectively. Group 1 was administered saline (10 mL/kg) during both the sessions. APAP-treated mice exhibited a significant elevation of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium and chloride levels. A remarkable depletion of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT and GSH-Px with elevated MDA levels has been observed in APAP treated kidney tissues. They also exhibited a significant rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6) and decreased anti-inflammatory (IL- 10) cytokine level in the kidney tissues. Disorganized glomerulus and dilated tubules with inflammatory cell infiltration were clearly observed in the histology of APAP treated mice kidneys. All these pathological changes were reversed in a dose-dependent manner after MO leaf extract treatment. Therefore, MO leaf extract has demonstrated some therapeutic effectiveness against APAP-induced nephrotoxicity through enhancement of the endogenous antioxidant system and a modulatory effect on specific inflammatory cytokines in kidney tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of asthma is increasing, and the cause(s) of this increase are unknown. The etiology of asthma {{is complex and}} includes both genetic, developmental, and environmental components. Epidemiological evidence suggests that acetaminophen (APAP, <b>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol)</b> {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of asthma. The goal of this thesis was to test the plausibility of the “acetaminophen hypothesis” in asthma, which states that therapeutic use of acetaminophen is linked to the increase in asthma prevalence through pro-oxidant effects of the drug. The airways of the respiratory system represent the largest surface area of the body exposed to the atmosphere. Several physiological adaptations of the respiratory tract aid in maintaining homeostasis under variable atmospheric conditions. These include oxidant responses, sensory irritation-reflex responses, and inflammatory responses. Respiratory tract responses can be activated by environmental exposures and disease states. In some situations they can be compromised. For example, asthmatic airways mount exaggerated immune responses to normally innocuous atmospheric variables, and may have altered oxidant responses. The measurement of respiratory responses can provide direct data on airway status. Described herein are studies examining the effects of acetaminophen on acute airway oxidant responses, acute sensory irritation-reflex responses, and longer-term inflammatory responses in a murine model of allergic airway disease (asthma). The first study assessed murine acute respiratory oxidant responses after APAP treatment alone, or in combination with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Near-therapeutic doses of APAP induced airway oxidant responses similarly to ETS. Notably, APAP potentiated both ETS induced oxidant responses and ETS induced sensory irritant-reflex irritant responses. In a second study, the effects of acetaminophen on airway inflammatory responses to house dust mite extract (HDM) were examined. Unexpectedly, the effects of HDM exposure were substantially diminished by APAP. These studies suggest that APAP has acute pro-oxidant effects in the airways at near-therapeutic doses, and thus may have detrimental effects in individuals predisposed to oxidant injury, or exposed to oxidant air pollutants such as ETS. Despite documenting pro-oxidant effects of APAP in the airways, these studies call into question the overall biological plausibility of the “APAP hypothesis” in asthma...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} feasibility of producing a controlled or sustained release drug delivery system by entrapping a solid drug material in an insoluble matrix formed by the interaction of two water-soluble polymeric materials. ^ Ethylene maleic acid (EMA) was interacted with either polyethylenimine (PEI) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to form a water insoluble polymeric matrix. <b>N-Acetyl-p-aminophenol</b> (APAP) {{was chosen as the}} investigational drug because of its limited water solubility and its relatively short duration of analgesic and antipyretic action as compared to that of aspirin. The granule and tablet systems prepared by the polymeric interactions were evaluated in vitro using dissolution techniques. ^ Granules prepared from the combination of EMA and PEI with the inclusion of APAP were generally insoluble but swelled considerably thus allowing the drug to be released prematurely from the polymer matrix. Attempts to control the swelling by the use of aldehyde-type crosslinking agents and intense heat proved unsuccessful. ^ Interacted polymeric granules of EMA and PVP were prepared and a procedure developed for their optimum preparation. The resultant material was water-insoluble and exhibited a minimum of swelling. An infrared analysis was conducted to substantiate the existence of an interacted system. ^ The dissolution of APAP from the EMA/PVP system revealed only a small delay in the drug dissolution as compared to the EMA/PEI system. Attempts to create a more hydrophobic granule by the incorporation of various amounts of stearic acid met with little success. ^ The addition of ethyl cellulose into the EMA/PVP system was readily accomplished and the dispersal of the cellulosic was achieved {{through the use of a}} vacuum desiccator and methylene chloride vapor. Treatment of various granule formulations with organic vapor for different exposure times yielded dissolution patterns for APAP with a significant prolongation of drug availability. ^ Tablets of the EMA/PVP/ethyl cellulose/APAP system were prepared on a hydraulic Carver press using seven different disintegrating agents at concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 per cent of the total tablet weight. These agents included Starch U. S. P., spray-dried lactose, spray-dried acacia, Avicel PH, Nadex 360, Globe 7042, and STA-Rx 1500. The latter three agents are partially water-soluble starches....
