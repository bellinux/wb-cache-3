Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 52). Experiments were conducted from April through July of hics. l 998 to assess the cultivation of Halodule beaudettei (den Hartog) den Hartog (shoal-grass) in experimental nursery ponds. The effects of pond flow-regime, water turbidity, culture media, and fertilizer on survival and growth of shoal-grass transplant units (TPUS) cultured in six-inch diameter plastic pots were examined. Additionally, the suitability of a natural bayou near Snake Island Cove in West Bay was evaluated as a nursery site using TPUS cultured in six-inch diameter plastic pots and anchored in the bay bottom using staples. No difference in the response of shoal-grass to flow-regime or pond turbidity was detected after 43 d, but turbidity had affected growth after 88 d. Smothering by macroalgae may have affected some TPUS. TPUS cultured in reduced marine-sediments responded favorably, with a more than nine-fold increase in the mean number of stems over 90 d. TPUS cultured in dry-sand and shell-fragments responded poorly after 90 d, producing a less than two-fold increase in mean number of stems. ('Pus in pots placed in the natural bayou near Snake Island Cove in West Bay survived poorly, and transplants stapled in the bioturbation.

The deformities include the absence of an upper jaw, a folded operculum with gills exposed, a cleft branchiostegal membrane, scoliosis, etc. The results were compared with production of wild stock. Hatchery-bred and wild milkfish fry were grown separately in <b>nursery</b> <b>ponds</b> (500 m 2 /pond) at 10 individuals/m 2. After a month, the juveniles (average weight hatchery-bred 6. 0 g; wild 9. 5 g) were transferred to seven rearing ponds of 1000 m 2 each (stocking density 3000 /ha). Three ponds were stocked with selected, nondeformed hatchery-bred fish (unmixed stock), three ponds with a combination of deformed and nondeformed hatchery-bred fish (1 : 2 ratio; mixed stock), and one pond with wild fish. The final weight, specific growth rate and survival of the nondeformed fish (mixed and unmixed stock) after four months of culture were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those of the deformed fish. Production, however, did not significantly differ between the unmixed nondeformed (433 kg/ha) and the mixed deformed and nondeformed (377 kg/ha) fish. Survival of the deformed stock (56 %) was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than that of the nondeformed stock (86 - 88 %). Approximately 92 % of the deformed stock and 17 - 20 % of the nondeformed were below 150 g. Severe deformities such as the absence of an upper jaw and exposure of all or most of the gills hindered fish growth, while widening of the operculum or branchiostegal membrane, scoliosis, or absence of the anal fin had less effect on growth.

Mean values of temperature, Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll-a, total alkalinity, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and phosphate phosphorous were 30. 58 °C, 51. 83 cm, 5. 7 mg - 1, 6. 88, 5. 27 mg - 1, 26 mgl - 1, 1. 12 mgl - 1, 0. 02 mgl - 1 and 0. 78 mgl - 1 respectively over the experimental period. All the measured physico-chemical characteristics varied little among the ponds and no distinguishable trends were discernible in either or between conditions...|$|R
