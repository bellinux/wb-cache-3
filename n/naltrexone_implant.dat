40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to profile and compare blood {{naltrexone}} and 6 -β-naltrexol levels with time following treatment with two sustained-release naltrexone preparations produced by GoMedical Industries, Australia at a community heroin treatment clinic in Perth, Western Australia. A sample of 10 patients who each received a 1. 7 g <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> were compared to 24 patients who each received a 3. 4 g <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> as treatment for heroin dependence. Blood naltrexone levels following treatment with the 1. 7 g <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> remained above 2 and 1 ng/ml for approximately 90 and 136 days, respectively. Use of the 3. 4 g <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> extended the period of coverage to approximately 297 (1 ng/ml) or 188 (2 ng/ml) days. Blood 6 -βnaltrexol levels remained above 10 ng/ml for approximately 18 and 83 days, respectively, following use of the 1. 7 g and 3. 4 g naltrexone implants. The current study data indicate that blood naltrexone and 6 -β-naltrexol levels following treatment with either the 1. 7 g or 3. 4 g <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> are greater than those reported in other published data on other sustained-release naltrexone preparations.

40|$|A novel {{example of}} {{healthcare}} service provision translation into a research framework {{within a community}} based drug and alcohol treatment facility. Retrospective patient clinical file examination was used. Curves modelled to routinely collected blood samples were used to ascertain {{the time it took}} blood levels to fall below therapeutic levels following <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> treatment. Linkage of patient information to the Western Australian Data Linkage System (DLS) at the Department of Health enabled follow-up of overdose presentations in patients after treatment. Patient case studies were used to delineate treatment of special cases (eg drug impaired physicians). Results of modelled data showed that naltrexone implants are capable of maintaining low blood naltrexone levels within the ascribed therapeutic range. Coverage can be extended by use of sequential implants. Case studies supported this, in that following sequential implant treatment blood naltrexone was maintained at levels required for antagonism of opioid based drugs for significant periods of time. Longer term follow-up of a cohort of treated patients through the DLS showed that there was a {{reduction in the number of}} opioid overdose deaths during the period of implant coverage. Routinely collected patient data from a treatment clinic together with mathematical modelling has been used to identify a major advantage of a pharmacotherapy (<b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant),</b> ie maintenance of low therapeutic blood naltrexone levels for extended periods. This suggests that successive implantation can be opportunistic with any subsequent clinical contact during the initial implant coverage period taken advantage of to perform a subsequent implant without fear of unduly elevating blood naltrexone levels.

Biodegradation resulted in less demarcated tablets followed by clumping into a single mass-like structure. This mass subsequently dispersed by approximately 1201 days post implant with no implant material visualized by ultrasound. The biodegradation was also assessed by visual clinical examination and palpation of the implant site as well as patient self-report. These measures were generally well correlated with ultrasound results. Clinical assessment of the biodegradation process concluded that the implant changed from ‘firm’ to ‘less firm’ and from ‘initial square edge’ to ‘rounded edge’ tablets.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} general population, {{physicians}} {{are at increased risk}} for abuse of prescription opioids. This use can interfere with work function and has potential negative implications for patient safety. The case example in this brief communication describes an opioid-dependent anaesthetist who, following 10 years of opioid abuse/dependency and a number of unsuccessful treatments, including oral naltrexone, and relapses, received a number of sequential <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implants</b> as part of his management. The case involved a close collaboration between the treating doctor, employer and the General Medical Council (GMC), with ongoing monitoring and follow-up, a GMC requirement of return to medical employment. This case study is used to illustrate that by sequential implant treatment blood levels of naltrexone can be maintained at levels required for antagonism of opioid-based drugs for significant periods of time. The GMC, employer and treating physician were able to monitor blood naltrexone levels, with the treating physician able to palpate the implant and thereby confirm that the previously opioid-dependent physician had remained on treatment.

Here, we used clinically relevant dosing {{to examine the effects}} of maternally administered sustained-release naltrexone on the rat brain by examining offspring at birth and in adulthood. Maternal treatment (naltrexone or placebo implant) started before conception and ceased during gestation, birth or weaning. Morphometry was assessed in offspring at birth and adulthood. Adult offspring were evaluated for differences in locomotor behaviour (basal and morphine-induced, 10 mg/kg, s. c.) and opioid neurochemistry, propensity to self-administer morphine and cue-induced drug-seeking after abstinence. Blood analysis confirmed offspring exposure to naltrexone during gestation, birth and weaning. Naltrexone exposure increased litter size and reduced offspring birth-weight but did not alter brain morphometry. Compared to placebo, basal motor activity of naltrexone-exposed adult offspring was lower, yet they showed enhanced development of psychomotor sensitization to morphine. Developmental naltrexone exposure was associated with resistance to morphine-induced down-regulation of striatal preproenkephalin mRNA expression in adulthood.

This study examined the occurrence of spontaneous tumours in rats treated with a sustained release naltrexone preparation. Materials and methods: 27 male and 27 female rats were randomized into three equal treatment groups (A, B and C).

Nevertheless, while <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implants</b> are becoming more accessible, a large majority of centers still use oral naltrexone and adherence to treatment remains a major obstacle to AAA's efficiency.

Major questions relate to their absolute and relative efficacy and safety. Opportunely, six recent clinical trial data from several continents have uniformly provided dramatic evidence of the potent, dose-related and highly significant efficacy of NI, with minimal or manageable accompanying toxicity and safety concerns. The opiate-free lifestyle is attained significantly more often with NI adjusted O. R. = 6. 00 (95 % C. I. 3. 86 – 9. 50), P < 10 - 10. Other drug use and drug craving are also rapidly reduced. The optimum manner in which to commence NI remains to be established. Of particular relevance is the relative safety of NI compared to the chronic opiate agonists (COA) usually employed, as the long-term toxicity of COA is only just being elucidated. Large population-based studies have found elevated rates of cardiovascular disease, six cancers, liver and respiratory disease, and all-cause mortality in COA. Whilst opiates {{have been shown to}} trigger numerous molecular pathways, the most interesting is the demonstration that the opiate morphinan's nucleus binds to the endotoxin groove of the TLR 4 -MD 2 heterodimer. This has the effect of triggering a low grade endotoxaemic-like state, which over time may account for these protean clinical findings, an effect which is reversed by opiate antagonists.

Aims: To assess if naltrexone via implant treatment was associated with any change in (i) risk, (ii) rate, and (iii) duration for hospital morbidity related to several categories of mental disorders among treated heroin users. Method: A cohort of 359 heroin users treated with sustained release naltrexone via implants in Western Australia was retrospectively followed up for mental health related outcomes via a health record linkage system over an average period of 1. 78 years post-treatment. Results: Individual patient 2 ̆ 7 s risk for hospital mental diagnoses was not altered after <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant.</b> On a population cohort level, hospital admission rates related to all mental health problems, except mood disorders, declined significantly post-treatment; however, length of hospital stay did not improve.

More evidence from Australia that the overdose death risk is less than with oral forms of the drug. Summary: At an Australian addiction treatment clinic the death rate of opiate-dependent patients treated with the heroin substitute buprenorphine between 2000 and 2007 was compared with those treated with implants of naltrexone which block the effects of heroin and allied drugs for up to several months. During this time 2518 patients were prescribed buprenorphine free of charge (though there were pharmacy charges) and 255 were implanted, mostly at their own expense. Records were matched with those of deaths recorded by the registrar of the relevant Australian state. Main findings: Four naltrexone and 43 buprenorphine patients were known to have died. There were no deaths while a <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> was active but four among patients at times when the implant {{would no longer have}} been effective, resulting in an overall death rate of 3 deaths per 1000 years the patients had been tracked. For buprenorphine, the corresponding figure was 5. 35, largely due to 40 deaths during times when the patients were not being prescribed the drug.

The injectable depot form of naltrexone (Vivitrol&reg;) ensures consistent opioid receptor blockade for one month between administrations, removing concerns about medication compliance. The clinical implications of these developments have attracted increasing attention from clinicians and policymakers in the US and around the world, especially given that human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other infectious diseases are recognized as companions to opioid addiction, commanding more efforts to reduce opioid addiction.

(2 – 4) The currently accepted management of the pregnant heroin user involves methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Importantly, no serious foetal toxicity has been associated with methadone. (5, 6) Naltrexone, a long-acting opiate antagonist that can be administered to persons who have detoxified completely from heroin (7) and which is effective in completely blocking the effects of heroin, (8) has also been used in a depot preparation in the management of the heroin dependent pregnant women. In this form of maintenance, naltrexone is delivered by a surgically inserted sustained release preparation. Recently, a number of case studies have described positive obstetric and neonatal outcomes associated with the management of pregnant women with implant naltrexone; (9) however, no data on blood naltrexone concentration with time has been provided to date. The present case study provides profiles of blood concentrations of naltrexone and 6 -beta naltrexol following <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> over pregnancy. It uses data from blood samples collected over pregnancy by the treating clinic (Australian Medical Research Procedures Foundation (AMPRF), Perth, Western Australia) as part of routine clinical management to investigate the length of time naltrexone blood levels are sustained above 2 ng/mL following implant. Bloods were analysed for naltrexone by the Forensic Science Laboratory, Chemistry Centre (WA) by liquid chromatography and mass spectrophotometry using an adaptation of the method described by Bugge et al. (10) These methods are able to quantify naltrexone and its active metabolite 6 -beta-naltrexol in human blood with a limit of detection of 0. 5 ng/mL for both compounds...|$|E
40|$|Opioid {{dependence}} is {{a complex}} and persistent disorder with a high mortality rate and severe impact on health and social situation. It is associated with much harm, including the transmission of blood-borne bacterial and viral infections, self-harm, traumatic injury and drug overdose. All of these harms carry a risk of death, and accordingly, mortality rates in opioid-dependent people are many times higher {{than those in the}} general population of the same age and sex. One of the more commonly used strategies for reducing the risks of opioid dependence is the provision of maintenance treatment. In Australia, available maintenance treatments include methadone, buprenorphine, oral naltrexone, and the unregistered sustained-release formulation of naltrexone, naltrexone implants. This thesis reports on a range of data collections and study designs to investigate the levels, predictors and causes of mortality in opioid-dependent persons entering methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance treatment in Australia. The studies used data linkage to examine mortality rates and causes of death in a longitudinal cohort of the early entrants to the NSW methadone program, examined the predictors of mortality (particularly the impact of methadone and buprenorphine treatment) using survival analysis in a longitudinal cohort study, compared national mortality rates between methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance treatments in a cross-sectional analytic study, and used a small case series of coronial cases to examine whether death from opioid overdose was possible in a recipient of a <b>naltrexone</b> <b>implant.</b> This thesis demonstrates that mortality rates as a whole and from particular causes of death are many times higher in Australian opioid-dependent subjects than the general population, exposure to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment significantly reduced mortality in a sample of opioid-dependent subjects, naltrexone treatment appears to have higher mortality than both methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments, and fatal opioid overdose while in receipt of sustained-release naltrexone treatment is possible. These results support longer retention in and repeated access to methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments in order to reduce mortality in opioid-dependent people, and greater regulation of the access to and more rigorous monitoring of the mortality associated with oral and sustained-release naltrexone maintenance treatments...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{heroin use}} during {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} significant risks to both mother and neonate, including decreased neonatal birth weight and increased neonatal mortality [1]. To date, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been the treatment of choice for the pregnant heroin user [1 and 2]. <b>Naltrexone</b> <b>implant</b> treatment (NIT) has also undergone a trial as a management strategy with pregnant heroin users [3]. This brief communication reports obstetric and neonatal outcomes of 17 pregnant women who were managed with NIT (16 who conceived while on implant treatment) compared with 90 women who were managed with MMT. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes {{for the two groups}} were compared with each other and separately to national norms in Australia. Mean (±S. D.) gestation age associated with NIT [38. 6 weeks (± 1. 55) ] was not significantly different from that observed with MMT [38 weeks (± 2. 1) ]. There were, however, significantly more deliveries of 3 ̆c 37 weeks of gestation amongst MMT compared with national data. In 3 ̆econtrast, the proportion of deliveries 3 ̆c 37 weeks of gestation for NIT-managed women did not differ significantly from national data 3 ̆e(Table 1). The mean (±S. D.) birth weight for infants whose mothers were managed by MMT (2888 ± 533 g) and NIT (3037 ± 428 g) were not significantly different. There were, however, significantly more neonates born of low birth weight in the MMT group compared with national data. In contrast, the proportion of neonates born of low birth weight amongst NIT-managed women did not differ significantly from the national mean (Table 1). The mean (±S. D.) APGAR score at 1 min for NIT-managed patients (9 ± 0) was significantly better than that of their MMT counterparts (7. 9 ± 1. 54). Five-minute APGAR scores for the NIT (9. 17 ± 0. 39) and MMT (8. 97 ± 0. 8) groups were not significantly different. The variance in infant APGAR score at both 1 and 5 min amongst MMT-managed women was also statically greater when compared with infants whose mothers were treated with NIT. This reflects consistently better postnatal adjustment for neonates born to NIT women. Exposure to low dose naltrexone delivered via implant treatment throughout much of the pregnancy was not associated with apparent negative outcomes for either mother or neonate. This result is similar to those previously reported for pregnant heroin-dependent women managed by oral and NIT [3 and 4]. The authors conclude that NIT may offer an alternative and more beneficial method of management than MMT for the pregnant heroin-dependent patient who finds it difficult to shift away from dependent heroin use patterns...|$|E
