5|$|In 1995, the {{decommissioned}} battleships {{were removed}} from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) after it was determined by ranking US Navy officials that there was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> battleship in the modern navy. In response to the striking of the battleships from the Naval Vessel Register a movement began to reinstate the battleships, on the grounds that these vessels had superior firepower over the then-existing 5-inch guns found on the , , and s, and s. Citing concern over the lack of available gunfire to support amphibious operations, Congress demanded that the United States Navy reinstate two battleships to the naval vessel register and maintain them with the mothball fleet, until the Navy could certify it had gunfire support within the current fleet that would meet or exceed the battleship's capability.|$|E

Her prizes {{included}} a large raclette cheese and a CHF50 voucher {{for a local}} florist. She had to decline the latter, as she had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vase of flowers—she lives in a tent when touring the circuit, cooking over a gas stove and travelling to events by bicycle.|$|E
25|$|His {{care in the}} {{institution}} of a pagan hierarchy in opposition {{to that of the}} Christians was due to his wish to create a society in which every aspect {{of the life of the}} citizens was to be connected, through layers of intermediate levels, to the consolidated figure of the Emperor— the final provider for all the needs of his people. Within this project, there was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parallel institution, such as the Christian hierarchy or Christian charity.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{reminds me}} of South Clark Street," [...] remarked Brady, who had once served on the traffic squad in Chicago; and as no one asked him why, he volunteered that it was [...] "because it's <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Irishman." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{production}} was organized as a polar expedition. The ferry MS Sognefjord was bought, rebuilt with living quarters and a cutting-room and renamed Orion. After production, the vessel was sold. The reason for using Orion {{was that there}} was only one hotel on the archipelago and <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film crew. Although this decision required supplies for three months to be brought along, it allowed the team to film at various remote locations on the islands and allowed travel while the film crew were sleeping. Up to 60 people lived on board. The vessel SS Listein was bought and used as the protagonist's ship, Sandy Hook. Filming was undertaken both along the Finnmark coast and in Svalbard. The planning concluded one and a half years before production began.|$|E
25|$|Another {{contributory}} {{factor was}} the lack of attention paid to Adolf Galland's basic rules of combat. In the tactical battle, he argued that the fighter must fight on the offensive, even when on defensive missions. There was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> defensive posture. An example of this dictum being ignored was the instance of having Bf 109 groups escort vulnerable and heavily armed Focke-Wulf Fw 190s which had replaced the vulnerable Zerstörer twin-engined fighters, which reduced the power of interception formations. Combat cohesiveness was frequently disregarded, and the integrity of the formations became compromised and ignored (owing to a lack of experienced leaders). Fixed tactical scheme contributed to failures as well. Rigid tactics were allowed to take root, and technique suffered. Using surprise, cunning and manoeuvrability had to be combined with aggressiveness and improvisation depending on the situation. This sort of tactical advantage was lost over time.|$|E
500|$|Malcolm Little {{excelled in}} junior high school but dropped out after a white teacher told him that {{practicing}} law, his aspiration at the time, was [...] "no realistic goal for a [...] nigger".

2500|$|Hiller married Blanche Hays, of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. [...] The {{wilds of}} the jungle were <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> civilized woman; his {{exploring}} days were over. [...] Hiller managed a sugar plantation in Cuba for “a wealthy friend” (Harrison’s father was a sugar manufacturer, and Harrison entered his father’s business in 1902) from 1902 to about 1907 {{in order to make}} money to bankroll his return to Philadelphia and the establishment of a medical practice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exorcism}} begins, and Sister Jude is dismissively told {{to leave}} the room, for [...] "it is <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman", much to her displeasure. Father Malachi is flung against a wall and Jed begins screaming in Latin. The possessed boy reveals personal details about each of the participants' lives and flings objects around the room. Jed secretly taunts Sister Jude, revealing that she was previously a promiscuous, drunken bar singer {{by the name of}} Judy who hit a young girl (Chelsey Valentine) while driving one night, and never reported the crime. We also learn that she slept with 53 men and secretly thinks about Monsignor Howard when masturbating. The chaos of the exorcism causes the power to fail and Lana and Grace make their escape. Grace refuses to leave without Kit, and they both run to find their own way out. Lana screams for the guards, sabotaging all of their chances at escaping.|$|E
2500|$|By issuing Laudato si' (LS), Francis lifted {{environmentalism}} to {{the high}} level of teaching of a papal encyclical, even as other Popes wrote encyclicals to argue for the common good in the moral crises of their day. But as with other issues Francis does not shy away from introducing to the Church a controversial stand, in this case focusing on the human causes of global warming. He addresses Chapter One to all peoples, on our common home, citing [...] "the results of the best scientific research available today" [...] (LS 15). While returning to arguments for this larger audience in chapters three through five, in chapters two and six he addresses largely believers, pointing out that [...] "the Bible has <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tyrannical anthropocentrism unconcerned for other creatures" [...] (LS 68). He speaks of [...] "the rhythms inscribed in nature" [...] through sabbatical years and the jubilee year which give rest to the land (LS 71). Among his references are: [...] "The earth is the Lord’s" [...] (Ps 24:1); to God belongs [...] "the earth with all that is within it" [...] (Dt 10:14); humans are to [...] "till and keep the garden of the world" [...] (cf. Gen 2:15).|$|E
60|$|Tears of joy {{streamed}} {{down his}} cheeks. He {{would have liked}} to help to revenge the wrongs of his tribe, but his master needed him; and moreover, there was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> untrained man in the ranks of the Soudanese regiments. They were doing their work better than he could. Still, it was the one bitter drop in his intense joy, that he {{had not been able to}} aid in the conflict.|$|R
60|$|It's <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> honest grafter {{with a small}} capital. There's too big a {{protective}} tariff on bunco. Even when Giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop. And the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress.|$|R

50|$|On hearing Napoleon had returned, d'Auvergne went to Brussels, {{he marched}} {{to war with}} a small {{regiment}} formed in the colours of Bouillon, where nine days before the Battle of Waterloo, d'Auvergne discovered that the Treaty of Paris which had left the Congress of Vienna to rewrite the map of Europe, had decided to form a buffer state, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along the border of France. This meant there was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> independent principality and the Duchy {{would be part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|R

Drumm advised Charlie to emigrate from Ireland, which was <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambitious young man. However, Charlie instead {{took a job as}} Drumm's clerk. He imagined the job would be only temporary, but he ended up working for Drumm for 14 years. Like his Da, Charlie kept an unprestigious, low-paying job far longer than he ever intended to.|$|R
