5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E

Jim nods as he quietly says yes and Karen walks out the room, visibly upset. Meanwhile, corporate sends Andy to anger management where he plans {{to get out of}} the 10-week program in five weeks through his usual charms: name repetition and personality imitation.|$|E
5|$|The plebeians {{had finally}} {{achieved}} political equality with the patricians. However, {{the plight of}} the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in {{the plight of the}} average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been. The plebeians rebelled by leaving Rome and refusing to return until they had more rights. The patricians then <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> much they needed the plebeians and accepted their terms. The plebeians then returned to Rome and continued their work.|$|E

The selection committee decided to take a weekend to rest and visit DeKalb on a Monday. The city had a weekend to prepare. What happened next could be described as deceit, skulduggery, or pulling the wool over.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{businessman}} Carl G. Fisher first envisioned {{building the}} speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in France and seeing that Europe held {{the upper hand}} in automobile design and craftsmanship. Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing was just getting started on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, {{ancestors}} of today's Oromo {{people in a}} region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were {{believed to have been}} the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant, though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.|$|E

25|$|Ethno-religious, socio-economic, and {{cultural}} fault lines ran throughout American society, but were becoming increasingly sectional, pitting Yankee Protestants with {{a stake in}} the emerging industrial capitalism and American nationalism increasingly against those tied to Southern slave holding interests. For example, acclaimed historian Don E. Fehrenbacher, in his Prelude to Greatness, Lincoln in the 1850s, <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> Illinois was a microcosm of the national political scene, pointing out voting patterns that bore striking correlations to regional patterns of settlement. Those areas settled from the South were staunchly Democratic, while those by New Englanders were staunchly Republican. In addition, a belt of border counties were known for their political moderation, and traditionally held the balance of power. Intertwined with religious, ethnic, regional, and class identities, the issues of free labor and free soil were thus easy to play on.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} written in a similar style to the Warriors series. Holly Koelling from Booklist notes that [...] "Despite the change in species, much will be {{familiar}} to readers. Alternating narratives tell the tales of three young bear cubs, who will be brought together in future installments". Nancy Gilson from the Columbus Dispatch praised how easily the separate stories are handled and <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> many chapters end on a cliffhanger.|$|E
500|$|Zinfandel {{was long}} {{considered}} [...] "America's vine and wine", but when University of California, Davis (UCD) professor Austin Goheen visited Italy in 1967, he <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> wine made from Primitivo {{reminded him of}} Zinfandel. Others also made the connection about that time. Primitivo was brought to California in 1968, and ampelographers declared it identical to Zinfandel in 1972. The first wine made from these California vines in 1975 also seemed identical to Zinfandel. In 1975, PhD student Wade Wolfe showed that the two varieties had identical isozyme fingerprints.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, Grant was an {{appointed}} {{director of}} MGM. In 1980, {{he sat on}} the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company. He played {{an active role in the}} promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973, and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s. When Allan Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> tired Grant looked, and his [...] "slightly melancholic air". Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California), and Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987).|$|E
500|$|One of Texas A's newer traditions is Maroon Out, {{which began}} in 1998. [...] The {{football}} team had ended their 1997 season with a lopsided defeat to Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game. [...] Amy Berger, Class of '99 Treasurer, and Kyle Valentine, Class of 2000 Junior President, <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> united the Nebraska fans seemed, all dressed in red. [...] She proposed to Class Councils the idea to [...] "Maroon Out" [...] Kyle Field for the October 10, 1998 rematch against Nebraska by selling a low-cost, high-quality maroon t-shirt. This resulted {{in the sale of}} 31,000 Maroon Out shirts, leading to a temporary national shortage of maroon colored t-shirts.|$|E
500|$|... "El Chico del Apartamento 512" [...] is a Spanish-language cumbia with {{influences}} of Colombian and South American music. Vela {{said in a}} 2002 interview that the track was [...] "the least Tejano music song" [...] because of its musically diverse sounds. Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called the song [...] "brassy" [...] and <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> the lyrics are constructed in story-song form. The [...] "512" [...] in the song's title is a reference to Corpus Christi, Texas' former area code. The recording is written in the key of C major and is played in a moderate groove of 102 beats per minute. [...] It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the french horn, violin and piano.|$|E

500|$|The {{next day}} Reitell {{invited him to}} her apartment, but he declined. They went sight-seeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed {{for the rest of}} the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> sick Thomas looked and {{suggested}} an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was [...] "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".|$|E
500|$|While {{speaking}} at {{schools across the}} United States, Haarsma <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> some school librarians were having trouble finding funds to purchase The Softwire books after a demand had been created by Haarsma's visit. Many of the librarians were struggling to fill their shelves with books. [...] In June 2007, Haarsma and a friend, actor Nathan Fillion, approached a group of Fillion's fans {{with the idea for}} a project that would work to purchase books for underfunded schools, as well as nonprofit institutions which gave books directly to children. The [...] group took to the idea and focused their energies into getting the project off the ground. [...] The Kids Need to Read project went public in August 2007.|$|E
500|$|As her {{popularity}} as {{a singer}} grew, the demands of Selena's performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father took her out of school {{when she was in}} the eighth grade. Her teacher Marilyn Greer disapproved of Selena's musical career. She threatened to report Quintanilla, Jr. to the Texas Board of Education, believing the conditions to which Selena was exposed were inappropriate for a girl her age. Quintanilla, Jr. told Greer to [...] "mind her business". Other teachers expressed their concerns when they <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> tired Selena appeared when she arrived at school. At seventeen, Selena earned a high school diploma from the American School of Correspondence in Chicago, and was also accepted at Louisiana State University. She enrolled at Pacific Western University, taking up business administration as her major subject.|$|E

500|$|The actual {{development}} of the game took overall five years to complete and spanned three platforms: the Nintendo GameCube, the Microsoft Xbox and the Xbox 360. Tilston remarked that, {{throughout the course of}} development, the team <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> the video game industry had evolved as computing and graphics power increased, and how earlier games like GoldenEye 007 and Donkey Kong Country where their development costs were minimal could easily be profitable with a few programmers. Tilston also revealed that the team behind Perfect Dark Zero was composed of roughly 25 people for most of the project, which was [...] "ridiculously" [...] small compared to Xbox 360 generation standards where there are 100 or 200 people working on a team. Despite this, Perfect Dark Zero, from a development cost, made four times its money back.|$|E
500|$|Edge {{compared}} {{the game to}} a more pleasurable version of [...] final scene. The magazine also {{compared the}} feeling of prioritization as a swarm of enemies appear to the feeling of clutter when stacking Tetris blocks haphazardly. Edge also called the red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death [...] "brash and lo-fi and unexpectedly poignant", for which they noted Rogers's interest in noise rock and credited the effect as [...] "a beguiling personal signature". Alternatively, Paste Joe Bernardi thought the sound did not accomplish what it intended. Joseph Leray of TouchArcade <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> the guitar sound in Gears of War was reaffirming but the opposite in Ziggurat. Edge noted that nuances such as gravity's influence on the arc of uncharged shots make Ziggurat more of a basketball or golf-like sport skill than a [...] "2D Halo". Edge awarded the game a 9 of 10, adding that it [...] "prized immediacy" [...] {{in a manner that}} matched the iOS platform.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Rolling Stone <b>noticed</b> <b>how</b> Madonna's fans also make an {{appearance}} in the [...] "simple" [...] video. Brennan Carly from Billboard wrote that Madonna seemed [...] "down-to-earth and affable" [...] in the video. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse called the video as La Dolce Vita [...] "through Instagram filters" [...] and found elements of the music video for Madonna's 1998 single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", with the paparazzi shots. He declared the scenes showing Madonna's then-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, the singer's cleavage and booty slaps as highlights of the video. Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much worse because the concept is so flimsy, but I have to say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun." [...] Belinda White from The Daily Telegraph wrote that Madonna refused to act [...] "her age" [...] in the video but [...] "she has us {{more than a little}} envious of all the fun she's having, not to mention how incredible she looks." [...] Leslie Price from Pop Dust website found Madonna's getup as similar to actress Brigitte Bardot.|$|E
