5|$|On 17 March 2015 at the long-delayed {{inquiry into}} Alexander Litvinenko's fatal {{poisoning}} Bukovsky gave his views {{as to why}} the former FSB man had been murdered. Interviewed on BBC TV eight years before, Bukovsky expressed <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russian authorities were responsible for the London death of Litvinenko on 23 November 2006.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phylum Nemertea is {{monophyletic}} (meaning {{that the}} phylum includes all and only descendants of one ancestor {{that was also}} a member of the phylum). The synapomorphies (trait shared by an ancestor and all its descendants, but not by other groups) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel.|$|E
5|$|Viking {{influence}} in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and whilst there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Uí Ímair dynasty played {{a prominent role in}} this early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century. Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E

5000|$|Did the Civil Service Commission {{have the}} {{authority}} to impose the penalties it did?

2500|$|... — The Turkish {{president}} Abdullah Gül sent el-Sisi {{a message}} congratulating him {{saying he had}} <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deep-rooted relations between Turkey and Egypt would continue, and sent his best wishes for the peace, stability and well-being of the Egyptian people. The Turkish prime minister Erdogan dismissed the congratulatory message saying such messages are [...] "meaningless." ...|$|R
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family {{home and in the}} courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, {{a week after the}} shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E

5000|$|It {{may be too}} simplistic to {{say that}} Li haunts Giger still, for his life is full of {{beautiful}} and exotic women who are fascinated by his art and by his bohemian lifestyle. But there is <b>no</b> <b>doubting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> simultaneous agony and joy of life with Li Tobler established the dynamic of fear and transcendence which is present in many of his paintings.|$|R

Pakistan can rely on support from Russia and the entire international community in this fight. We have <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organizers of such inhuman crimes will surely be found and severely punished." ...|$|R
5|$|By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had {{captured}} No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After {{a telephone call}} between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, there was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, {{and they began to}} surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

[...] "I didn't know about the last eighth of a mile, but I {{suspected}} it with Lord at War as his broodmare sire. There is good stamina on the dam side.

25|$|All this {{theories}} {{may indicate}} that it's very likely that throughout the 19th century the tiple was already part of Colombia's culture. There is no clear conclusion on where in Colombia the tiple first originated since the documentation is sketchy. Nevertheless, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tiple {{is linked to the}} Spanish guitar and the timple from the Canary islands.|$|E
25|$|For {{politically}} aware Englishmen, Parliament had essentially {{elected a}} king. Although officially he was supreme, {{there could be}} <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Commons had picked the king and could pick another instead. Although there was now a law demanding that all swear allegiance to the monarch {{as head of the}} church, it became less and less clear why the nation was to be so intolerant.|$|E
25|$|What {{is clear}} from this is that these two teams are in effect one and the same. All that has {{happened}} is that the nomenclature has changed, as it so often did in Georgian times. Furthermore, all the players named above, with the single exception of Bridger who had a short career, are recognised players and so there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team in question was of top-class standard. The problem as so often is what to call it.|$|E

All victims had met their killer at the Barrowland Ballroom. Their handbags were missing. They were all strangled with their stockings and raped. All three were escorted home by the killer and murdered within yards of their doorstep, all had been menstruating at the time and all three had sanitary napkins or tampons placed on or near the bodies.|$|R

In 1955, during the destruction left by Hurricane Diane swept through New York and Pennsylvania, the dam on Lake Amenia burst. Local folklore claims the floodgates to open Lake Amenia's dam {{were supposed to}} be opened for the high waters. However, the dam keeper dropped his keys into the rushing waters of Lake Amenia, and the resulting outflow caused a catastrophe.|$|R
25|$|The earlier text, {{of which}} five short {{fragments}} {{have come down}} to us, {{is known as the}} Pactus Alamannorum, and judging from the persistent recurrence of the expression et sic convenit, was most probably drawn up by an official commission. The reference to aifranchisement in ecciesia shows that it was composed after the conversion of the Alamanni to Christianity. There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> text dates back at least to the reign of the Frankish king Dagobert I, i.e. to {{the first half of the}} 7th century.|$|E
25|$|Peter Schäfer {{states that}} there can be <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{narrative}} of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not Tannaitic but from a later Amoraic period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them. Bart Ehrman and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there is}} <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{demographic}} {{crisis of the}} 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in absolute terms, {{there has been a}} vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population. While the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the Renaissance was a result of greater opulence, more recent studies have suggested that {{there might have been a}} so-called 'depression of the Renaissance'. In spite of convincing arguments for the case, the statistical evidence is simply too incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made.|$|E

25|$|The Forestry Commission {{acquired}} the Bedford Purlieus from a timber merchant who had removed the most saleable timber, {{and soon after}} 1933 {{almost all of the}} remaining wood was cut, and a replanting programme was begun, which continued until the 1950s. By then the policy of planting both broadleaved and conifer trees within the wood had been standard practice for 100 years, and the practice continued and expanded under Forestry Commission ownership. Although there is now <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> non-native conifers damage and diminish the conservation value of the woodland, it appears that in this instance they also secured its survival.|$|E
25|$|The Embassy {{perspective}} {{is that there}} is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting {{that there may be a}} prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution. There is equally no doubt from our perspective that Roberto Micheletti's assumption of power was illegitimate. Nevertheless, it is also evident that the constitution itself may be deficient in terms of providing clear procedures for dealing with alleged illegal acts by the President and resolving conflicts between the branches of government.|$|E
25|$|But Steinschneider's {{assumption}} {{can hardly}} be supported. The Mishnat ha-Middot has {{nothing in common with}} the Baraita cited by the old scholars under that name: for the citations leave <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Baraita, even in its mathematical parts, was founded on the Bible; whereas the Mishnat ha-Middot is a purely secular work, and, possibly, it drew upon the same source as did Mohammed b. Musa, the oldest Arabic mathematician. The plea that the Mishnat ha-Middot has not been preserved in its entirety, and that in its original form there were references to the Bible for special points, is of no weight, since it is absolutely incomprehensible that haggadic or halakic matter should fit into the frame of the work as it now is.|$|E
