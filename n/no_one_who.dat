5|$|St. Teresa of Ávila (15151582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative {{prayer for}} periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa {{believed}} that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was {{faithful to the}} practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul. Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{conditions}} were announced as such: The election 67 districts {{were reduced to}} 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would {{have the money to}} enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E

5|$|Hsin {{wins the}} lottery, but selects the tile {{representing}} his heart. Chao {{comes in and}} tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over {{the table with the}} vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in the room where the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, could find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{formally}} registered {{association was}} dissolved {{some time after}} October 1956 but intermittently revived for different reasons by Plantard between 1961 and 1993, though in name and on paper only. The Priory of Sion is considered dormant by the subprefecture because it has indicated no activities since 1956. According to French law, subsequent references to the Priory bear no legal relation to that of 1956 and no one, other than the original signatories, is entitled to use its name in an official capacity. André Bonhomme played no part in the association after 1956. He officially resigned in 1973 when he heard that Plantard was linking his name with the association. In light of Plantard's death in 2000, there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> is currently alive who has official {{permission to use the}} name.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{recorded}} {{campaigns in}} Syro-Palestine during Amenhotep I's reign. However, {{according to the}} Tombos Stela of his successor, Thutmose I, when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia {{all the way to}} the Euphrates, he found <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> fought against him. If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one, it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead, which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign. One of the candidates for Amenhotep's tomb contains a reference to Qedmi, which is somewhere in Canaan or the Transjordan, and Amenemhet's tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni. However, neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning, nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhotep's reign. The location of Amenhotep's tomb is not certain, and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni. Records from Amenhotep's reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a conclusion about any Syrian campaign.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{apparent}} misconception among video game fans that the SNES title Secret of Evermore {{was released in}} lieu of an English language version of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995. Secret of Evermore was developed by a new team at Square's office in Redmond, Washington called Square Soft. According to Fehdrau, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> worked on the Evermore project would {{have been involved in}} a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 2000, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released with ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana as part of the Seiken Densetsu Collection on June 1, 2017.|$|E

25|$|In 1553 Michael Servetus {{published}} {{yet another}} religious work with further anti-trinitarian views.

Other penitents were present until the end but were denied communion in the table of the Lord.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{unstable}} {{state of affairs}} in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard {{to try to find}} evidence of treason in Boston.

Bernard could find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was willing to provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials. The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.|$|E
