Crack initiation in ultra-fine grained and <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>materials</b> compared with unmodified materials is favourable however crack growth is faster. In order to improve the elongation at fracture for UFG materials a number of approaches exist, as for instance the creation of a bimodal structure or the combination of dissimilar areas of micro-structure configurations in different sections of a component. The present article focuses on the theoretical fundamentals of manufacturing of a hybrid component by incremental forming and presents first results of experimental tests. Incremental forming methods are evaluated with respect to the creation of ultra-fine grained material - with increased strength and lower propensity for crack initiation - in combination with a ductile core or ductile inner wall respectively.

Conversely, an electron beam can be focused on a spot of few nanometres, allowing single nano-crystal analysis. Well known problems related with electron diffraction are the strong dynamical effects due multiple scattering, the reduced number of reflections achievable with conventional techniques and the amorphization produced by the electron beam damage, quite fast especially for high polymerized and hydrated phases.

40|$|Silicon {{is widely}} used in {{optoelectronic}} devices, including solar cells. In recent years new forms of silicon have become available, including amorphous, microcrystalline and <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>material.</b> These new forms have great promise for low cost, thin film solar cells {{and the purpose of}} this work is to investigate their preparation and properties with a view to their future use in solar cells. A Hot Wire-Deposition Chemical Vapour Deposition CVD (HW-CVD) system was constructed to create a multi-chamber high vacuum system in combination with an existing Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) system; to study the amorphous to crystalline transition in silicon thin films. As the two chambers were linked by a common airlock, it was essential to construct a transfer mechanism to allow the transfer of the sample holder between the two systems. This was accomplished by the incorporation of two gate valves between the two chambers and the common airlock as well as a rail system and a magnetic drive that were designed to support the weight of, and to guide the sample holder through the system. The effect of different deposition conditions on the properties and structure of the material deposited in the combined HW-CVD:PECVD system were investigated. The conditions needed to obtain a range of materials, including amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline silicon films were determined and then successfully replicated. The structure of each material was analysed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The presence of crystallites in the material was confirmed and the structure of the material detected by TEM was compared to the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of each sample was decoupled into three components representing the amorphous, intermediate and crystalline phases. The Raman analysis revealed that the amorphous silicon thin film had a dominant amorphous phase with smaller contribution from the intermediate and crystalline phase. This result supported the findings of the TEM studies which showed some medium range order. Analysis of the Raman spectrum for samples deposited at increasing filament temperatures showed that the degree of order within the samples increased, with the evolution of the crystalline phase and decline of the amorphous phase. The Selected Area Diffraction (SAD) patterns obtained from the TEM were analysed to gain qualitative information regarding the change in crystallite size. These findings have been confirmed by the TEM micrograph measurements. The deposition regime where the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline silicon took place was examined by varying the deposition parameters of filament temperature, total pressure in the chamber, gas flow rate, deposition time and substrate temperature. The IR absorption spectrum for [mu]c-Si showed the typical peaks at 2100 cm- 1 and 626 cm- 1, of the stretching and wagging modes, respectively. The increase in the crystallinity of the thin films was consistent with the evolution of the 2100 cm- 1 band in IR, and the decreasing hydrogen content, as well as the shift of the wagging mode to lower wavenumber. IR spectroscopy {{has proven to be a}} sensitive technique for detecting the crystalline phase in the deposited material. Several devices were also constructed by depositing the [mu]c-Si thin films as the intrinsic layer in a solar cell, to obtain information on their characteristics. The p- layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited in the PECVD chamber, and the sample was then transferred under vacuum using the transport system to the HW-CVD chamber where the i-layer (microcrystalline silicon) was deposited. The sample holder was transferred back to the PECVD chamber where the n-layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited. The research presented in this thesis represents a preliminary investigation of the properties of [mu]c-Si thin films. Once the properties and optimum deposition characteristics for thin films are established, this research can form the basis for the optimization of a solar cell consisting of the most efficient combination of amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline materials...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there is a}} rise of {{interest}} in investigation and fabrication of nanometer sized magnetic structures due to their various applications (e. g. for data storage or micro sensors). Over {{the last several decades}} ion beam implantation became an important tool for the modification of materials and in particular for the manipulation of magnetic properties. Nanopatterning and implantation can be done simultaneously using focused-ion beam (FIB) techniques. FIB implantation and standard ion implantation differ in their beam current densities by 7 orders of magnitude. This difference can strongly influence the structural and magnetic properties, e. g. due to a rise of the local temperature in the sample during ion implantation. In previous investigations both types of implantation techniques were studied separately. The aim of the current research was to compare both implantation techniques in terms of structural changes and changes in magnetic properties using the same material system. Moreover, to separate any possible annealing effects from implantation ones, the influence of temperature on the structural and magnetic properties were additionally investigated. For the current study a model material system which is widely used for industrial applications was chosen: a 50 nm thick non-ordered nano-crystalline permalloy (Ni 81 Fe 19) film grown on a SiO 2 buffer layer based onto a (100) -oriented Si substrate. The permalloy films were implanted with a 30 keV Ga+ ion beam; and also a series of as-deposited permalloy films were annealed in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. Several investigation techniques were applied to study the film structure and composition, and were mostly based on non-destructive X-ray investigation techniques, which are the primary focus of this work. Besides X-ray diffraction (XRD), providing the long-range order crystal structural information, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements to probe the local structure were performed. Moreover, the film thickness, surface roughness, and interface roughness were obtained from the X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements. Additionally cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (XTEM) imaging was used for local structural characterizations. The Ga depth distribution of the samples implanted with a standard ion implanter was measured by the use of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and Rutherford backscattering (RBS), and was compared with theoretical TRIDYN calculation. The magnetic properties were characterized via polar magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements at room temperature. It was shown that both implantation techniques lead to a further material crystallization of the partially amorphous permalloy material (i. e. to an increase of the amount of the crystalline material), to a crystallite growth and to a material texturing towards the (111) direction. For low ion fluences a strong increase of the amount of the crystalline material was observed, while for high ion fluences this rise is much weaker. At low ion fluences XTEM images show small isolated crystallites, while for high ones the crystallites start to grow through the entire film. The EXAFS analysis shows that both Ni and Ga atom surroundings have a perfect near-order coordination corresponding to an fcc symmetry. The lattice parameter for both implantation techniques increases with increasing ion fluence according to the same linear law. The lattice parameters obtained from the EXAFS measurements for both implantation types are in a good agreement with the results obtained from the XRD measurements. Grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) measurements of the samples implanted with a standard ion implanter show an increasing value of microstrain with increasing ion fluence (i. e. the lattice parameter variation is increasing with fluence). Both types of implantation result in an increase of the surface and the interface roughness and demonstrate a decrease of the saturation polarization with increasing ion fluence. From the obtained results it follows that FIB and standard ion implantation influence structure and magnetic properties in a similar way: both lead to a material crystallization, crystallite growth, texturing and decrease of the saturation polarization with increasing ion fluence. A further crystallization of the highly defective <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>material</b> can be simply understood as a result of exchange processes induced by the energy transferred to the system during the ion implantation. The decrease of the saturation polarization of the implanted samples is mainly attributed to the simple presence of the Ga atoms on the lattice sites of the permalloy film itself. For the annealed samples more complex results were found. The corresponding results can be separated into two temperature regimes: into low (≤ 400 °C) and high (> 400 °C) temperatures. Similar to the implanted samples, annealing results in a material crystallization with large crystallites growing through the entire film and in a material texturing towards the (111) direction. The EXAFS analysis shows a perfect near-order coordination corresponding to an fcc symmetry. The lattice parameter of the annealed samples slightly decreases at low annealing temperatures, reaches its minimum at about ~ 400 °C and slightly rises at higher ones. From the GIXRD measurements it can be observed that the permalloy material at temperatures above > 400 °C reaches its strain-free state. On the other hand, the film roughness increases with increasing annealing temperature and a de-wetting of the film is observed at high annealing temperatures. Regardless of the material crystallization and texturing, the samples annealed at low temperatures demonstrate no change in saturation polarization, while at high temperatures a rise by approximately ~ 15 % at 800 °C was observed. The rise of the saturation polarization at high annealing temperatures is attributed to the de-wetting effect...|$|E

Their heat treatment at lower temperatures than {{is the case with}} classic powders results in polycrystals of very small grain sizes which possess enhanced mechanical properties. Although numerous methods of producing nanopowders were elaborated, serious processing problems are still encountered, mainly due to the friction between powder particles. It follows that dry pressing of such powders does not lead to satisfactory results. In the present work this is investigated using nanopowders in the yttria-zirconia system. A method for their synthesis under hydrothermal conditions is described. The effect of the two forming methods on the powder behavior during sintering, dry pressing and pressure filtration, is shown.

30|$|A {{few other}} studies {{also show that}} the flow stress of {{ultrafine}} nano-structured materials can decrease {{as a result of}} grain size reduction. With the inverse Hall–Petch effect, the deformation is no longer dominated by dislocation motion, while atomic sliding in grain boundaries starts to play the major role [44]. Narayan experimentally studied this phenomenon by pulsed laser deposition to produce <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>materials</b> [45]. It was discovered that when the copper nano-crystal is less than 10  nm, material hardness decreases with the decrease of grain size. The decrease in the slope of the Hall–Petch curve and eventually the decrease in hardness below a certain grain size can be explained by a model of grain-boundary sliding [46]. Because of this, as the grain size decreases from 61 to 30  nm, the overall material strength increases, but further decrease in the grain size may result in a decrease of strength. The grain-boundary sliding theory is supported by other researchers [47, 48], where the small and independent slip events in the grain boundary are seen in the uniaxial tension deformation process of fcc metal with a very small grain size (less than 12  nm).|$|R
30|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that mechanical attrition of elemental powder blends of metals, ceramics, etc. provides a route {{for the production}} of <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>materials</b> which may possess unusual chemical and physical properties in comparison to their course-grained counterparts. These materials [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are of tremendous technological importance. During ball milling, a number of processes such as cold welding, fracture, recovery and recrystallization take place and a detailed characterization of all these processes may provide essential information about the nature and property of heavy cyclic deformation. For example, evolution of microstructure of single phase metallic system is characterized by the following stages: (1) The deformation is localized in shear bands—regions of high dislocation density, (2) formation of subgrains as a result of dislocation annihilation, (3) grain rotation to produce a completely random orientation. Several authors have observed that for initial hours of milling, there exists microstructural inhomogeneity. A common example of this is the existence of non-unimodal size distribution [6, 7]. The microstructural inhomogeneity has been attributed to dynamic recrystallization [6], ‘undeformed’ and ‘deformed’ components, etc. [7]. We have also observed a similar nature for ball-milled α-Al 2 O 3, which has been attributed to bimodal distribution of particles of spherical and cylindrical morphology [8].|$|R

[...] The {{company has a}} history of multiple Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awarded projects with the US Army, {{in a wide range of}} applications. One such project focused on decontamination wipes for war fighters to use when coming in contact with chemical warfare agents, and acid-gas remediation research to treat hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and other chemical compounds. Another project sponsored by the US EPA, SBIR division, focused on <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>materials</b> for the hot fuel-gas clean-up applications, such as zinc oxide-based sorbents for moderate-temperature, high-capacity hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide clean-up, supported copper oxide sorbents for high-temperature H2S, COS, and possibly mercury clean-up, and nickel-based supported catalysts for high temperature ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) decomposition. The US Army SBIR Newsletter stated, [...] "In addition to all of the first response applications for FAST-ACT, the technology is being further developed for decontamination wipes, residue-free wipes, and is currently utilized in commercial odor elimination products such as OdorKlenz and Nano-Zorb." [...] Altogether, NanoScale Corporation continues to research, develop, and produce products for environmental remediation, often at the actual nano scale.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissolution}} behaviour of disassociated cellulosic {{materials in}} N,N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (DMAc/LiCl) was investigated. The parameters monitored were chromatographic elution profiles and recovered mass {{by means of}} gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with RI detection. In order to elucidate {{the impact of the}} disassembly on cellulosic fibres, comparative studies were performed with the non-disassociated cellulose counterparts. The importance of the presence of water was addressed by Karl Fischer titration and solvent exchange experiments. Morphological changes during the dissolution process were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dissolution of fibrillated cellulosic materials is impeded compared to the non-fibrillated material. This is a consequence of the high-surface-area fibrils prone to retain high amounts of water. Dissolution behaviour of <b>nano-crystalline</b> cellulosic <b>materials</b> appeared to be source-dependent. Due to the absence of entangled networks, these materials retain only water bound at the surface of the nano-crystallites, indicative of both the exposed surface area and solubility. The small cellulose nano-particles extracted from dissolving pulp show lower solubility compared to the large NCC particles from cotton...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the photoelectrochemical {{properties}} of nanocrystalline ZnS electrodes doped with Mn 2 þ are presented and discussed. The observation of both anodic and cathodic photocurrent is direct {{evidence for the}} nanocrystalline nature of the system. In-situ photoluminescence measure-ments showed stable Mn 2 þ related photoluminescence over a large potential range. Due to the unfavourable kinetics of electron and hole transfer across the interface between the nanocrystal-lites and solution, it is concluded that recombination accounts {{for most of the}} charge carriers gen-erated by illumination. Breakdown of the ZnS into elementary Zn and S 2 in solution was also observed at negative potential. This breakdown introduces new non-radiative decay paths and is responsible for the slow luminescence decrease as a function of operating time. 1.

The main reasons for the increasing interest in these materials are, on the one hand, the simple fabrication of (doped) semiconductor nanocrystals [4, 5] and, on the other hand, the fact that in combination with a suitable semiconducting polymer and conducting substrate electrons and holes can be injecte...|$|R
