50|$|<b>Note</b> <b>issuance</b> <b>facility</b> (NIF) is an {{underwriting}} agreement/arrangement in the Eurocurrency market {{under which}} borrowers place short/medium term (one to six months) notes via a syndicate of prime/commercial banks, and the borrowers' issue {{is backed by}} {{the commitment of the}} syndicate banks to purchase any paper which the borrowers may be unable to sell. Since the facility/guarantee itself is contingent, the creation of NIF does not give rise to an entry in the financial account and will be treated as an off-balance sheet item in the guarantor books. When the underwriting institution is requested to make funds available, it will acquire the actual asset (notes) and will be recorded in the financial account.|$|E
40|$|Since early 1984, <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> <b>facilities</b> (NIFs) have in {{considerable}} degree replaced syndicated Eurocurrency bank credits in international credit markets, especially for borrowers in industrial countries, because borrowers {{have found it}} cheaper to bypass bank syndications and obtain funds more directly by issuing Euronotes. Factors behind this include an increasing awareness of borrowing possibilities, more freedom for Japanese investors to buy foreign securities, {{a drop in the}} relative popularity of bank obligations with investors, and banks' desire to slow asset growth to improve capital ratios.; Measurement of the cost savings to borrowers on NIFs as compared with Eurocredits is difficult because of limited comparison possibilities. Most NIFs arranged so far have not been drawn on through <b>issuance</b> of <b>notes,</b> and few of the actual issuers have arranged LIBOR-priced Eurocredits recently. In the 12 cases, as of mid- 1985, where meaningful comparisons could be made, it appears that the cost savings to the borrowers ranged from about 10 to around 50 basis points. All of the savings were in the interest spread, where the NIFs appear to have been about 15 to 55 basis points cheaper. Fee costs were slightly higher on NIFs than on Eurocredits; although front-end fees are lower, the total fee costs for NIFs are higher because of the annual facility fee paid to banks that underwrite the NIF. ...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the puzzle}} of underissuance of {{national}} bank notes can be resolved for the period 1880 - 1900 (the period when detailed, bank-level data are available) by disaggregating, taking account of regulatory limits, and considering differences in banks' opportunity costs cross-sectionally and over time. Banks with poor lending opportunities issued more, within regulatory limits. Banks tended to issue more when bond yields (the backing for notes) were high relative to lending opportunities. The profitability of <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> was insufficient to attract entrants primarily or mainly {{for the purpose of}} <b>note</b> <b>issuance.</b> The observed lack of a general relationship between <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> and reserve demand is inconsistent with the view that redemption costs from <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> explain low <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> in general.

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of interest rates}} under the U. S. National Banking System is puzzling because of the apparent presence of persistent and large unexploited arbitrage opportunities for note issuing banks. Previous attempts to explain interest rate behavior have relied on the cost or the inelasticity of note issue. These attempts are not entirely satisfactory. Here we propose a new rationale to solve the puzzle. Inelastic <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> arises endogenously because the marginal cost of issuing notes is an increasing function of circulation. We build a spatial separation model where some fraction of agents must move each period. Banknotes can be carried between locations; deposits cannot. Taking the model to the data on national banks, we find it matches the movements in long-term interest rates well. It also predicts movements in deposit rates during panics. However, the model displays more inelasticity of <b>notes</b> <b>issuance</b> than is in the data. Bank notes; Interest rates; National banks (United States) ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the years}} between 1861 and 1893 six banks were {{authorized}} to issue notes redeemable in gold or silver — though with frequent episodes of suspension — and accepted at par in Italy. Because {{of the existence of}} several issuing banks the Italian experience was often referred to as an example of competition in money issuance; as a result, the regime of competition was blamed for the financial crisis which took place {{at the end of the}} period. This article challenges the idea that <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> in Italy was carried out under competition. The theoretical framework used to analyse the Italian experience from the viewpoint of competition is free-banking; the theory provides a model to analyse competition between notes issued by unrestricted banks which are changed at par and redeemable in some standard good on a fractional reserve basis. Although the Italian case cannot be considered an example of freebanking, this framework can help explain whether — and under which circumstances — <b>note</b> <b>issuance</b> conditions in Italy came close to a situation of competition. According to the model, redeemability and the absence of any role by Government are essential conditions for competition between currencies to take place. Judged on these basis, Italian experience has been on the whole a far cry from competition, not only because of the frequent suspensions of redeemability but because Government interventions distorted competitive decision-making by banks and on some occasions prevented the clearing process to take place. In addition to the direct support granted to single banks — in exchange for loans or for political purposes — and to several forms of regulation on the issuing activities, competition was hampered by the willingness of Government to suspend redeemability in time of crises. On several occasions banks were given the opportunity to be exempted from the rules of competition instead of maximizing their profit subject to those constraints. ...|$|R

The international economy developed as a credit economy and this international credit economy led to more flexible monetary policy.
