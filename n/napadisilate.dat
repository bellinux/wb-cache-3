40|$|Background: Clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> {{has better}} {{clopidogrel}} stability than clopidogrel bisulfate. Our trial’s {{objective was to}} compare the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> with clopidogrel bisulfate in participants with ischemic stroke. Methods: The study was a phase 4, 4 -week, randomized, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial. Patients are randomized to receive either clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> 75 mg or clopidogrel bisulfate 75 mg. The primary study endpoint was change from baseline in P 2 Y 12 percent inhibition at week 4. The primary analysis was conducted in the per-protocol population. Noninferiority was confirmed if the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the treatment difference was more {{than or equal to}} – 9. 0 % points. The secondary endpoint was change in P 2 Y 12 reactivity units (PRU). At a final visit, all adverse events were recorded. Results: Sixty-one participants were randomly assigned clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> and 60 were randomly assigned clopidogrel bisulfate. Thirty-nine participants in the clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> group and 39 in the clopidogrel bisulfate group were analyzed for the primary endpoint. At 4 weeks, mean percent inhibition had increased in both treatment groups. The estimated mean change from baseline was 22. 3 % with clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> and 21. 4 % with clopidogrel bisulfate; the estimated treatment difference of 0. 9 % (95 % CI, – 8. 6 to 10. 4) confirmed the non-inferiority of clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> to clopidogrel bisulfate. The mean reduction in PRU and rates of adverse events were not significantly different between treatments. Conclusion: Clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> was noninferior to clopidogrel bisulfate as assessed by change in platelet inhibition. Rates of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Therefore, clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> can be a suitable alternative to clopidogrel bisulfate in ischemic stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Clopidogrel is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} and prevention of peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, and coronary artery diseases. This clinical trial was designed to demonstrate that clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> (CN) is not inferior to clopidogrel bisulfate (CB) with respect to its effectiveness in inhibiting platelet aggregation. Methods: This 4 week multi-center, prospective, open-label, randomized trial was conducted at five clinical centers in South Korea. Patients were randomized into the 75 mg CN group or the 75 mg CB group. Platelet aggregation was assessed by the VerifyNow assay. The primary outcome was the difference of the percentage P 2 Y(12) inhibition and the secondary outcome was the baseline and change in P 2 Y(12) reaction units (PRU). Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in the percentage P 2 Y(12) inhibition (CN vs. CB, 34. 92 +/- 21. 33 % vs. 30. 43 +/- 17. 90 %, p = 0. 203). The mean difference of the percentage P 2 Y(12) inhibition between groups was 4. 49 %, their two-sided 95 % confidence interval was - 2. 45 % to 11. 44 %, and the lower bound (- 2. 45 %) was greater than the acceptable non-inferiority margin of - 9. 0 %. The baseline PRU was 96. 67 +/- 76. 76 in the CN group and 216. 95 +/- 68. 86 in the CB group (p = 0. 121), and the change in the PRU was - 3. 32 +/- 51. 71 in the CN group and 10. 52 +/- 43. 31 in the CB group (p = 0. 106). Four subjects experienced AEs (6. 3 %, 5 events) in the CN group and 7 subjects (11. 11 %, 13 events) in the CB group without statistical significance (p = 0. 364). With respect to serious adverse events, 2 events were reported in 2 subjects, 1 in each group. Conclusion: Clopidogrel <b>napadisilate</b> was not inferior to clopidogrel bisulfate in terms of antiplatelet efficacy and tolerability, and there were no clinically significant adverse events.
