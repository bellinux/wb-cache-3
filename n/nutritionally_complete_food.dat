5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> <b>food</b> containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E

Portions were adjusted from pH 4. 2 to 6. 4 at. 2 pH intervals and subjected to HTST pasteurization at 73. 9, 76. 6, and 79. 5 C for 25 sec. Milk clotting activity in whey was determined before and after pasteurization. Resistance to heat in-activation increased with decreasing pH. All measurable activity was destroyed above pH 5. 4 by pasteurization at 79. 5 C, above pH 5. 8 at 76. 6 C and above pH 6. 0 at 73. 9 C. Milk clotting activity in Cheddar cheese mad with Mucor miehei remained unchanged for 26 weeks. Four commercial sterile liquid-milk-based consisting of infant formula, concentrated infant formula, <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> <b>food,</b> and diet food was aseptically inoculated with sterile Mucor miehei protease solutions to concentrations ranging from 5 x 10 - 3 to 1 x 10 - 7 chymosin units/ml of product.

40|$|Eggs {{have been}} {{consumed}} throughout human history, though the full potential of this <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> <b>food</b> {{has yet to}} be realized in many resource-poor settings around the world. Eggs provide essential fatty acids, proteins, choline, vitamins A and B 12, selenium, and other critical nutrients at levels above or comparable to those found in other animal-source foods, but they are relatively more affordable. Cultural beliefs about the digestibility and cleanliness of eggs, as well as environmental concerns arising from hygiene practices and toxin exposures, remain as barriers to widespread egg consumption. There is also regional variability in egg intake levels. In Latin American countries, on average, greater proportions of young children consume eggs than in Asian or African countries. In China and Indonesia, nutrition education and social marketing have been associated with greater amounts of eggs in the diets of young children, though generally, evidence from interventions is minimal. Homestead chicken-and-egg production with appropriate vaccination, extension service, and other supports can simultaneously address poverty and nutrition in very poor rural households. With undernutrition remaining a significant problem {{in many parts of the}} world, eggs may be an uncracked part of the solution. © 2014 International Life Sciences Institute...|$|E

40|$|Guarding against disease Milk, {{a natural}} liquid food, {{is one of}} our most <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> <b>foods,</b> adding {{high-quality}} protein, fat, milk sugar, essential minerals, and vitamins to our diet. However, milk contains bacteria that––when improperly handled––may create conditions where bacteria can multiply. Most of the bacteria in fresh milk from a healthy animal are either harmless or beneficial. But, rapid changes in the health of an animal, or the milk handler, or contaminants from polluted water, dirt, manure, vermin, air, cuts, and wounds can make raw milk potentially dangerous. How do microorganisms enter the milk supply? Our environment contains an abundance of microorganisms that find their way to the hair, udder, and teats of dairy cows and can move up the teat canal. Some of these germs cause an inflammatory disease of the udder known as mastitis while others enter the milk without causing any disease symptoms in the animal. In addition, organisms can enter the milk supply during the milking process when equipment used in milking, transporting, and storing the raw milk is not properly cleaned and sanitized...|$|R
50|$|Although {{men have}} {{generally}} been {{thought of as the}} primary breadwinners for families in recent history, the division of labor between men and women in traditional societies required both genders to {{take an active role in}} obtaining resources outside the domestic sphere. Prior to discovering agriculture and animal husbandry, predictable food sources were a scarce commodity. To achieve optimal nutrition during this time, it was imperative that both men and women focus their energies on hunting and gathering as many different edible foods as possible to sustain themselves on a daily basis. Lacking the technologies necessary to store and preserve food, it was critical for men and women to seek out and obtain fresh food sources almost continuously. These nomadic tribes used gender differences to their advantage, allowing men and women to use their complementary adaptations and survival strategies to find the most diverse and <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> <b>foods</b> available. For example, in the context of daily foraging, childcare itself was not a hindrance to women's productivity; rather, performing this task with her children both increased the overall efficiency of the activity (more people participating equals a greater yield of edible roots, berries, nuts and plants), and functioned as an important hands-on lesson in survival skills for each child. By sharing the burden of daily sustenance - and developing specialized gender niches - humans not only ensured their continued survival, but also paved the way for later technologies to evolve and grow through experience.|$|R
40|$|Despite the public’s perception, {{widespread}} malnutrition following disasters is not common. The disasters {{that are}} most likely to result in significant malnutrition are those that occur in developing nations and that destroy or restrict access to major food supplies. Both protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and micronutrient malnutrition can occur. PEM occurs when the diet lacks sufficient calories and protein to meet daily needs. Common types of micronutrient malnutrition seen in disasters are deficiencies of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Iron, and Niacin. Both types of malnutrition often take several weeks or months to develop. Certain diseases such as diarrhea and measles can promote malnutrition due to impaired absorption of nutrients. Particularly vulnerable populations include families headed by women, unattended children, the elderly, and pregnant or lactating women. Measures to prevent malnutrition following a disaster include assuring that emergency <b>food</b> supplies are <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete,</b> that <b>food</b> is distributed equitably among the affected population, that safe drinking water is available, that adequate sanitation is maintained, and that diseases which promote malnutrition are controlled...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{nutritional}} compliance of formulated meal replacements available in Australian pharmacies with the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand guidelines; {{and to assess}} the nutritional adequacy of formulated meal replacements recommended diets based on meal replacement or total diet replacement (very low energy diets). Design: Products available at major pharmacies as of November 2007 were identified and nutritional information and instructions for use {{were obtained from the}} product packaging and/or the manufacturing company. Main Outcome Measures: Individual serves, prepared as directed, were compared to Standards Australia and New Zealand standard 2. 9. 3 of the food standards code. Nutritional adequacy was assessed by comparing the nutritional composition to the Nutrient Reference Values for average obese adult males and females, using Foodworks 2007. Results: Results demonstrated that while most products were compliant with the Standards Australia and New Zealand standard for formulated meal replacements composition the majority of the products and/or programs were deficient in one or more nutrients. Of the 17 products from 11 brands, no very low energy diets programs (of seven) were found to be <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete.</b> Only two meal replacement programs (of 16) were <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> in comparison to the recommended dietary intakes and AIs for both a representative obese man and woman. Conclusion: The results highlight the important role of clinicians in ensuring programs followed by patients are nutritionally adequate and implemented and supervised as intended, in order to minimise side-effects and risks. There is a need for Standards Australia and New Zealand regulations governing very low energy diets, where formulated meal replacements are recommended for total diet replacement...|$|R

40|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} {{efficiently}} and lastingly reduces excess body weight and reverses {{type 2 diabetes}} in obese patients. Although increased energy expenditure may also play a role, decreased energy intake {{is thought to be}} the main reason for weight loss, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the changes in ingestive behavior in a rat model of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Obese (24 % body fat compared with 18 % in chow-fed controls), male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained for 15 wk before and 4 mo after RYGB or sham-surgery on a two-choice low-fat/high-fat diet, were subjected to a series of tests assessing energy intake, meal patterning, and food choice. Although sham-operated rats gained an additional 100 g body wt during the postoperative period, RYGB rats lost ∼ 100 g. Intake of a <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> and palatable liquid diet (Ensure) was significantly reduced by ∼ 50 % during the first 2 wk after RYGB compared with sham surgery. Decreased intake was the result of greatly reduced meal size with only partial compensation by meal frequency, and a corresponding increase in the satiety ratio. Similar results were obtained with solid food (regular or high-fat chow) 6 wk after surgery. In 12 - to 24 -h two-choice liquid or solid diet paradigms with <b>nutritionally</b> <b>complete</b> low- and high-fat diets, RYGB rats preferred the low-fat choice (solid) or showed decreased acceptance for the high-fat choice (liquid), whereas sham-operated rats preferred the high-fat choices. A separate group of rats offered chow only before surgery completely avoided the solid high-fat diet in a choice paradigm. The results confirm anecdotal reports of “nibbling” behavior and fat avoidance in RYGB patients and provide a basis for more mechanistic studies in this rat model...|$|R
