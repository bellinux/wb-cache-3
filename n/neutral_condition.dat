40|$|The present paper reexamines the {{relative}} {{role of the}} tropical Pacific and tropical South Atlantic (TSA) on the rainfall over Northeast Brazil (NEB). For several variables, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and TSA-related anomalous patterns are obtained. These patterns are then compared to the combined ENSO and TSA-related patterns to infer {{the relative}} importance of the two oceanic basins on the rainfall over NEB. Analyses are done for austral summer and autumn seasons. Considering the composite technique, six cases are examined: El Niño and <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions</b> in the TSA, La Niña and <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions</b> in the TSA, ENSO <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions</b> and warm TSA, ENSO <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions</b> and cold TSA, El Niño and warm TSA, and La Niña and cold TSA. The most important result comes from the cases with competing influences of the tropical Pacific and the TSA. In some of these cases, the SST variability in the TSA is the determining factor of the NEB climate. The result of this study might be useful mainly for regional climate monitoring purposes.

50|$|Hart and Gable {{examined}} {{the effect of}} low and high motivational intensity on positive affect. Participants were either asked to write about a positive event where someone was kind to them to induce low motivational intensity, write down a goal they want to accomplish and the steps {{it will take to}} accomplish it to induce high motivational intensity, or write about a typical day in their life, as a neutral control condition. Results indicated that high motivational intensity positive affect lead to more successful goal pursuit and occurred only when task goals were explicitly stated.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} negative emotion {{on the degree of}} self-reference effect using event-related potentials (ERPs). We presented emotional pictures and self-referential stimuli (stimuli that accelerate and improve processing and improve memory of information related to an individual’s self-concept) in sequence. Participants judged the color of the target stimulus (self-referential stimuli). ERP results showed that the target stimuli elicited larger P 2 amplitudes under <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions</b> than under negative emotional <b>conditions.</b> Under <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions,</b> N 2 amplitudes for highly self-relevant names (target stimulus) were smaller than those for any other names. Under negative emotional conditions, highly and moderately self-referential stimuli activated smaller N 2 amplitudes. P 3 amplitudes activated by self-referential processing under negative emotional conditions were smaller than <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the left and central sites, highly self-relevant names activated larger P 3 amplitudes than any other names. But in the central sites, moderately self-relevant names activated larger P 3 amplitudes than non-self-relevant names. The findings indicate that negative emotional processing could weaken the degree of self-reference effect...|$|R
40|$|We report {{unambiguous}} {{proof of}} the stability of a carbinol intermediate inthe case of P 450 metabolism of an N-methylated natural cyclo-peptide,namely tentoxin. Under mild acidic or <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions,</b> the lifetime ofcarbinol-amide is {{long enough to be}} fully characterized. This metabolitehas been characterized using specifically labeled 14 C-methyl tentoxin isotopomers,HPLC, HPLC-MS, MS-MS and NMR. Under stronger acidic conditions,the stability of this metabolite vanishes through deformylation. A theoretical mechanistic investigation reveals that the stability is governedby the accessibility of the nitrogen lone pair and its protonation state. Forcarbinol-amines, even in <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions,</b> the energy barrier for deformylationis low enough to allow rapid deformylation. Carbinol-amide behavesdifferently. Under <b>neutral</b> <b>conditions,</b> delocalization of the nitrogen lonepair increases the energy barrier of deformylation that is a slow processunder such conditions. After protonation, we were able to optimize adeformylation transition that is lower in energy and thus accounts for thelower stability of carbinol-amides observed experimentally in acidic conditions. Finally, by considering the protocol usually used for extraction andanalysis of this type of metabolite, carbinol-amide may thus be frequentlyignored in drug metabolism pathways...|$|R
50|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have pinpointed the brain regions {{that are involved in}} the numerical Stroop effect. In these studies the most consistent finding was the involvement of the parietal cortex, with increased activation for incongruent in comparison to congruent trials. When a <b>neutral</b> <b>condition</b> was included, it was observed that the bilateral parietal lobes were the only regions that were involved in both facilitation and interference. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies have indicated that the amplitude or the latency of the P300 wave is modulated {{as a function of the}} congruity effect. This means that when looking at amplitude, the difference between the amplitude of the congruent and incongruent condition is observed 300 ms after the presentation of the digits. In addition, behavioral, physiological, and computational studies support the view, although not unanimously, that the conflict between congruent and incongruent conditions is observed up to the response level, and is dependent on the developmental stage of the participant.|$|E
5000|$|Gable and Harmon-Jones [...] have {{manipulated}} motivational intensity using {{a delayed}} monetary incentive paradigm. Gable and Harmon-Jones {{asked participants to}} respond to shapes that were presented on a computer screen. Half {{of the participants were}} told that participants could gain money when circles, but not squares appeared on the screen (pre-goal; high motivational intensity). Half of the participants were not given this instruction. Next, neutral words were presented either centrally or peripherally on the screen. Participants then completed a goal-related flanker task, where they were told that if they were faster than average on each trial, they could gain money on that trial (post-goal; low motivational intensity). Finally, participants’ memory for the words was tested. Results suggested that compared to the <b>neutral</b> <b>condition,</b> high motivational intensity (i.e., pre-goal) lead to better memory for centrally presented information and low motivational intensity (i.e., post-goal) lead to better memory for peripherally presented information. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated using desirable (e.g., desserts) and neutral pictures.|$|E

5000|$|The {{procedure}} {{of the experiment}} was {{very similar to the}} one conducted in 1961.

Depending on the experimental group, the film ended with a scene in which the model was rewarded with candies or punished with the warning, [...] "Don't do it again". In the <b>neutral</b> <b>condition</b> the film ended right after the aggression scene toward the Bobo doll. Regardless of the experimental group the child was in, after watching the film the child stayed in a room with many toys and a Bobo doll. The experimenter found that the children often showed less similar behavior toward the model when they were shown the clip that ended with the punishment scene as compared to the other conditions. Also, boys showed more imitative aggression than girls toward the Bobo doll. That is the measure of the performance and it supports the results of the experiments in 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Balcetis and Dale (2007) further {{consider}} that we {{view the world}} in biased ways in their four-prong study, one part of which addressed motivated object interpretation using a situation involving the interpretation of an ambiguous object (i.e. a Necker cube) that lacks the language based labels that the priming information may suggest to the participants. Many studies claim that what humans perceive or see is based on our internal motivation and goals, {{but it is important}} to {{consider that}} some priming situations in certain studies, or even the internal views of the participant, can affect the interpretation of a stimulus. [...] With these considerations in mind, Balcetis and Dale (2007), divided 124 Cornell University undergraduates into three groups which were each asked to imagine one of three detailed conditions: an upward-looking condition (participants were asked to imagine looking up at a large building), a downward-looking position (looking into a deep canyon), and a neutral/flat condition (standing in a flat field). The participants were then shown an ambiguous Necker cube on a computer screen and were told to click one of the two blue lines that seemed the closest to them. The line the participants chose depended on whether they determined the cube to be facing upwards or downwards. The results of the study demonstrated that the majority of participants in the upward-looking condition saw the cube as facing upwards, the majority of downwards-looking conditioned patients saw the cube as facing downwards, and the participants in the <b>neutral</b> <b>condition</b> were evenly divided. These results show that the priming stimulus language influenced object identification. Motivation-affected object identification was observed in each condition.|$|E
