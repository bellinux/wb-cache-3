In this <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnet</b> the structural low-dimensionality and mixed valency of vanadium ions yield a complex temperature dependence of the static magnetization and the nuclear relaxation rates. Analysis of the different contributions to the magnetism allows to identify individual interlayer magnetic sites as well as strongly antiferromagnetically coupled vanadium spins (S = 1 / 2) in the double layers of the nanotube's wall. In particular, the data give strong indications that in the structurally well-defined vanadium-spin chains in the walls, owing to an inhomogeneous charge distribution, antiferromagnetic dimers and trimers occur.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, several key discoveries, such as Giant and Tunneling Magne- toresistance, and {{advances}} in magnetic materials have {{paved the way}} for exponentially higher bit-densities in magnetic storage. In particular, the discovery of Spin-Transfer Torque (STT) has allowed information to be written to individual magnets using spin-currents. This has replaced the more traditional Oersted-field control used in field-MRAMs and allowed further scaling of magnetic-memories. A less obvious con- sequence of STT is that it has made possible a logic-technology based on magnets controlled by spin-polarized currents. Charge-coupled Spin Logic (CSL) is one such device proposal that couples a giant spin Hall effect(GSHE) write-unit with a Mag- netic Tunnel Junction read-unit. Several theoretical reports have demonstrated that a CSL-style device can function as a fundamental building block for neuromorphic computing by harnessing the intrinsic properties of magnets. This thesis describes the working of a CSL device. Experimental progress towards building the individual components of CSL and also our efforts to integrate these components into a CSL prototype will be presented. In addition to the integration effort, this work also explores spin-injection from a GSHE metal to a <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnet</b> through an intermediate non-magnetic metal. Our results indicate that with the right choice of intermediate layers, the spin-angular mo- mentum absorbed by the magnet can be increased without engineering the intrinsic spin Hall angle of the GSHE metal. Finally, this work also proposes a Schottky-barrier model to describe the current flow through low-dimensional semiconductors and uses it to extract the band gap of black-phosphorus thin-films in an attempt to characterize novel 2 D-materials...|$|E

However, to realize more complex circuits – and eventually systems – more than just wires and gates in isolation are required.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} number of research projects with the common theme of manipulating the magnetization of a <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnet</b> through electrical means, and the major part is devoted to exploring the effect of spin angular momentum transfer from a spin-polarized current to a nanomagnet, which we call spin transfer torque. Spin transfer torque is a promising new mechanism to "write" magnetic storage elements in {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM) devices with magnesium oxide (MgO) -based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) architecture. The first part of our work aims at a quantitative measurement of the spin transfer torque exerted on one of the ferromagnetic electrodes in exactly this type of tunneling structures used for MRAM applications. We use a technique called spin-transfer-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), where we apply a microwave-frequency oscillating current to resonantly excite magnetic precession, and we describe two complementary methods to detect this precession. We resolve previous controversies over the bias dependence of spin transfer torque, and present the first quantitative measurement of spin transfer torque in MgO-based MTJs in full bias range. We also analyze and test the potential to use the ST-FMR technique for microwave detection and microwave amplification. In {{the second part of the}} our work, we fabricate ferromagnetic nanoparticles made of CoFeB or Co embedded in the MgO tunnel barrier of a typical magnetic tunnel junction device, and study the spin transfer torque exerted on these nanoparticles 2 - 3 nm in size. We present the first evidence of spin transfer torque in magnetic nanoparticles insulated from electrodes by mapping out the switching phase diagram of a single nanoparticle. We also study ferromagnetic resonance of a small number of nanoparticles induced by spin transfer torque, with the goal of approaching single electron tunneling regime. The last part of our work explores a dramatically different way to manipulate magnetization electrically. We couple a ferromagnet to a multiferroic material, bismuth ferrite (BiFeO 3), by exchange bias interaction, and try to manipulate the ferromagnet by ferroelectric switching of the BiFeO 3...|$|E

Due to the discreteness of the energy levels in small systems the resonating tunneling phenomena play an important role. At relatively high temperatures the excited levels contribute to the transition and the transition rate depends significantly on the temperature. On the other hand, at very low temperatures the magnetization process {{does not depend on}} the temperature. Even at such a low temperature, the effect of environments is still relevant.

They are needed for improving the performance of microwave filters, power supplies, etc. Although <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnets</b> have been synthesized for many years, the magnetic particles have generally been produced with a broad size distribution and poor crystallinity, whereas most applications require particles with a narrow size distribution (monodisperse particles) and a very low structural disorder in order to have magnetic characteristics, such as saturation magnetization, as close as possible to those of bulk samples. We have succeeded in preparing nanoscale manganese zinc ferrite (MZFO) monodisperse particles with good crystallinity by using forced hydrolysis in a polyol. This is a novel preparative route to powdery oxide materials developed in our laboratory, as an alternative sol-gel chimie douce method. It consists in the hydrolysis of metallic salts dissolved and heated in a polyol. Polyols are crystal growth media of particular interest for the synthesis of fine particles with a narrow size distribution and high crystallinity [1 - 3].
