5000|$|The Corporation of Trinity House of Deptford Strond, {{known as}} Trinity House (formally The Master Wardens and Assistants of the Guild Fraternity or Brotherhood {{of the most}} glorious and {{undivided}} Trinity and of St. Clement in the Parish of Deptford Strond in the County of Kent), is a private corporation governed under a Royal Charter (rather than a non-departmental public body). It has three core functions: it is the official General Lighthouse Authority for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, responsible for the provision and maintenance of navigational aids, such as lighthouses, lightvessels, buoys, and maritime radio/satellite communication systems. Trinity House is also an official deep sea pilotage authority, providing expert navigators for ships trading in Northern European waters. It is also a maritime charity, dispersing funds {{for the welfare of}} retired seamen, the training of young cadets and the promotion of safety at sea; for the financial year ending in March 2013 it spent approximately £6.5 million in furtherance of its charitable objectives. Funding for the work of the lighthouse service comes from [...] "light dues" [...] levied on commercial vessels calling at ports in the British Isles, based on the <b>net</b> <b>registered</b> <b>tonnage</b> of the vessel. The rate is set by the Department of Transport, and annually reviewed. Funding for the maritime charity is generated separately. After the corporation was founded in 1514, the first master was Thomas Spert (later Sir), sailing master of Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose and of Henry Grace à Dieu.|$|E
40|$|The tonnage {{measurement}} of ships {{is an important}} aspect of water-borne commerce. tonnage values are used to assess port fees, minimum manning requirements, and minimum safety equipment allowances aboard vessels. For example, as the tonnage value for a vessel goes up, so does the number of deckhands. Increasing the crew size may have other benefits. By adding more people to the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s crew complement there would be more people to ensure the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s safe transit. Therefore, changing tonnage values can have a direct impact on the safety of seagoing vessels. Since the creation of {{tonnage measurement}} as a means to determine a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s capacity, various measurement schemes have been created. Differences between measurement schemes in one country versus another have caused confusion in the application of shipping laws and regulations. The 1969 International Convention for the Tonnage Measurement of Ships seeks to unify the method by which all ships are measured and thus minimize the extent of interpretations currently practice. The most significant change is how the convention calculates two common tonnage measurement values; gross registered tonnage (GRT) and <b>net</b> <b>registered</b> <b>tonnage</b> (NRT). Gross registered tonnage is a value measurement of an entire vessel. <b>Net</b> <b>registered</b> <b>tonnage</b> is a volume measurement indicative of a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s earning capacity. The existing (domestic) U. S. tonnage measurement scheme measures only a few spaces, not the entire vessel. The convention eliminates many tonnage reducing mechanisms used by the United States. This paper discusses the history of tonnage, the existing U. S. measurement scheme and then focuses on implementing the Convention into U. S. law, particularly with respect to small vessels. Fully implementing the International Convention for the Tonnage Measurement of Ships as the United State 2 ̆ 7 s system of measurement will more than double the gross tonnage figures of U. S. vessels, yet with appropriate regulatory changes, have very positive effects on passenger, crew and vessel safety...|$|E

40|$|Ship {{emission}} {{has been}} one of the most crucial components of ambient air pollution in recent years because of its various environmental health effects on habitants of port regions. However, attentions were mainly paid to ocean-going vessels, while the health impact due to river vessels has rarely been assessed and in particular, there has not been any study quantifying the relationship between mortality and vessel volume including river vessels. This study aimed to assess the temporal association between marine-shipping exposure and monthly mortality in Hong Kong from 1999 to 2011. I received 491, 824 death records from the Census and Statistical Department in defining the health outcomes, and monthly data for <b>Net</b> <b>Registered</b> <b>Tonnage</b> (NRT) of ocean-going vessels (OGVs) and river vessels (RVs) from the Marine Department for the exposures for the period from 1999 to 2011. The NRT for OGVs, RVs, and their total, namely Total Vessels (TVs), were employed to assess the temporal marine-shipping exposure indicators and their association with mortality. Poisson regression model with natural cubic spline smooth function was introduced to control for seasonal confounding variations and time trend in the mortality counts, and with adjustment for temperature and relative humidity. Partial autocorrelation plots were applied to examine discernible patterns in residual plots. The analysis also included stratification by sex, age group, and interaction model for cool and warm season. Excess risks from the model were assessed. For the associations between NRT of OGVs and monthly mortality for all-natural, cardiovascular and respiratory causes for all-age, in the whole-year analysis, an increase of 1000 NRT of ocean-going vessels was associated with an increase of 1. 00 % [95 % CI: 0. 79 to 1. 21 %], 1. 35 % [0. 95 to 1. 76 %] and 1. 10 % [0. 62 to 1. 58 %], respectively. In the cool season, the estimates were 1. 00 % [0. 76 to 1. 19 %], 1. 30 % [0. 89 to 1. 70 %] and 1. 00 % [0. 51 to 1. 49 %]; while in the warm season the estimates were 1. 19 % [- 0. 59 to 3. 00 %], 1. 70 % [- 1. 04 to 4. 52 %] and 1. 49 % [- 0. 14 to 3. 14 %], respectively. For the associations between the capacity of RVs and monthly mortality for all ages, in the whole-year, the estimates were statistically significant (with the 95 % CI > 0) only for all-natural causes and cardiovascular, but not for respiratory diseases (with the 95 % CI containing zero). Particularly for analyses of interaction model for cool season the estimates were consistent with those of the whole-year analyses. The associations between the capacity of TVs and monthly mortalities were similar with those for OGVs. For the three marine-shipping exposure indicators, the estimates for the older than 65 population were greater than for the all-age population, and greater for females than for males. It is evident that there is an association between marine-shipping exposure and mortality, which is stronger for the older than the all-age population. The associations were robust in cool season for all the mortality outcomes. It is the first study worldwide to explore the associations between health outcomes and monthly capacity of marine vessels. However, the study design was based on aggregated data, making it less powerful to assess the association than designs based on individual subjects. In the future, we should use study designs with recruitment of individuals and estimate their exposure by means of spatial and temporal variations of marine emissions in the real-time using GIS technology. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
