50|$|Hylotrupes is a {{monotypic}} genus of woodboring beetles in {{the family}} Cerambycidae, the longhorn beetles. The sole species, Hylotrupes bajulus, is known by several common names, including house longhorn beetle, old <b>house</b> <b>borer,</b> and European <b>house</b> <b>borer.</b> Originating in Europe, and having been spread in timber and wood products, the beetle now has a practically cosmopolitan distribution, including Southern Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and much of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{experiment}} was to establish how exposure to a constant magnetic field of 98 mT affects behavior in terms of viability and larval mass of the old <b>house</b> <b>borer</b> (Hylotrupes bajulus L.). It is demonstrated that larvae exposed to this magnetic field show statistically significant higher viability, {{as well as a}} tendency of mass increase in comparison with the control group. These results {{can be attributed to the}} modulatory effect of the employed external magnetic field on metabolism and neurohumoral regulation in the insects...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two issues}} {{at the core of}} {{invasive}} species risk management: on the one hand, decision-makers struggle to balance environmental goals against other often competing societal goals such as economic benefits and social welfare; on the other hand, uncertainty often prevails in understanding the invasion process and in communicating invasion risks to the stakeholders. In this paper, we describe how an integrated Deliberative Multi-Criteria Evaluation (DMCE) and fuzzy set approach can tackle these two issues in the analysis of alternative risk management strategies, using the example of European <b>House</b> <b>Borer</b> (EHB, Hylotrupes bajulus Linnaeus). DMCE offers a platform for stakeholders to interact and to make a trade-off decision between multiple goals based on social learning and deliberation. The fuzzy set approach, applied within a DMCE framework, explicitly incorporates the inherent uncertainty in estimating potential EHB impacts and in evaluating participants' subjective preferences. This integrated method, therefore, provides a promising approach for tackling the dual challenges of competing goals and uncertainty in the evaluation of invasive species risk management options.

40|$|The {{supply of}} <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> in Australia has been {{experiencing}} a low increase rate since the 1990 s {{in conjunction with}} an increasingly strong housing demand. On the contrary, residential construction costs across Australia&# 039;s states maintained dramatic increases simultaneously. Economic theory suggests that <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> supply is correlated to the costs of residential constructions. However, few empirical {{studies have focused on}} examining this relationship for Australian housing markets. To comprehensively investigate the relationship between the supply of <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> and residential construction costs a function for <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> supply considering the effects of regional heterogeneities is introduced in this study. By estimating a panel error correction model (ECM) applicable for quantifying the correlation with regional heterogeneities, this research identifies that a causal link and a strong correlation exist in between <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> supply and residential construction costs in Australia...|$|R
