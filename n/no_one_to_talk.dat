25|$|Geera, {{who was now}} {{the only}} child left on their {{escarpment}} home, {{had no one to}} play with and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, hunched over and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E
500|$|Having <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E

Telling people to tell her {{he is in a}} meeting or on vacation, he {{even went so far as}} to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, [...] "Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, she could talk to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to." [...] Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his [...] "$40,000 German car." ...|$|E

50|$|A week later, the Loners {{are back}} {{together}} minus Hollow, Phil, and Mattie. None of the subplots from the series bar {{the identity of}} Namie have been resolved, and the issue ends with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their problems or what has so far happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always," [...] he declared, [...] "in England it is bridge. One dines with one's friends, and <b>one</b> {{would like}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{for a little}} time, and it is bridge.

6000|$|But Simpson jerked them away. [...] "D' ye {{know who}} I am?" [...] he demanded. [...] "I 'm Brick Simpson, an' I don't 'low <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to me in}} that tone of voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do," [...] she replied. [...] "Come {{when you}} like. My brother will be awfully pleased {{to talk with}} you. He is so quiet, because there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. Do come and swim." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{was not all}} out of {{a spirit}} of contradiction,' said Anne, 'though she said this morning, {{that she was very}} tired and very cross {{yesterday}} evening. But, Mamma, she also said that she thinks the time she spends in company wasted, and she really believes that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> dares <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> sense, or that if he does, everyone dislikes him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|While the boy {{had been}} talking several other people had {{approached}} the wagon and listened intently to his speech. Then they began <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another in long, deliberate speeches, where many words were used but little was said.

60|$|I went to {{join the}} Earl and the children, and we waited--almost in silence, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> seemed {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and Bruno was half-asleep on Sylvie's lap--till the others joined us. No telegram had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear old mother!" [...] said Pauline, [...] "I wish--oh! I wish so {{much that}} we had not left her, even though it was to be for only a few months. She must be so lonely, with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to--" ...|$|E

60|$|When {{first asked}} {{to join the}} boating party Miss Corona Raybold hesitated; she did not care very much about boating; but when she found that if she stayed in camp she would have <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to, she {{accepted}} the invitation.|$|E
6000|$|She laughed. [...] "You are a funny boy, {{but you are}} veree good. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> me a little, then. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> me. I {{would much}} rather talk, anyway. Tell me, haf you seen many German prisoners?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, this is {{my second}} journey. I hope I shall come no more. We get a little extra pay and are better fed than we are with the regiment, {{and we have no}} drill; but then it is sad. Last time I had one with me who had left his wife and family behind; he was always sad, he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me {{sometimes}} of them, there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> He was here for life, and he knew he should never see them again.

40|$|It is {{my belief}} that if society were better {{able to cope with}} death, then perhaps the {{individual}} would be better prepared for his own death. Death has always been distasteful to people because it is such a frightening happening. It is such an unpleasant and painful topic that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it and discussions do not easily surface. How are we ever to understand it if it is never discussed? Perhaps we will never understand it fully, but we can at least try to prepare ourselves and others...|$|R

Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} there would be <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to in Manchester," [...] she replied at random. Mr. Fortescue had been observing her for a moment or two, as novelists are {{inclined}} to observe, and at this remark he smiled, and made it the text for a little further speculation.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{sat around}} for a while, but as he didn't care to let his {{presence}} be known, and as there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to, he presently {{made up his mind}} that being so near the Big River he would go over there to see if Plunger the Osprey was fishing again on this day.|$|E

50|$|As {{the lead}} singer of Cowboy Junkies, Timmins is more {{comfortable}} being {{the focal point of}} attention than she used to be. But she admits that if she is invited <b>to</b> party, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her, she is quite happy sitting quietly by herself. She claims that she is not an extrovert and does not have a lot of friends. She is close <b>to</b> <b>one</b> girlfriend, a sister and her mother. She likes being at home. This is exemplified by the three essential things she brings with her on the road while touring with the Cowboy Junkies - her toothbrush, needlepoint and hot water bottle.|$|R
