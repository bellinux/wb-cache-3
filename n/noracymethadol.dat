5000|$|<b>Noracymethadol</b> (INN) is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic related to methadone {{that was never}} marketed. In a clinical trial of postpartum patients it was reported to produce analgesia {{comparable to that of}} morphine but with less nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Other side effects included salivation, ataxia, and respiratory depression that was reversible by naloxone. Similarly to many of its analogues, <b>noracymethadol</b> is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States with an ACSCN of 9633 and 2013 annual manufacturing quota of 12 grammes. [...] and is also controlled internationally under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961. [...] The salts known are the gluconate (free base conversion ratio 0.633) and hydrochloride (0.903).|$|E
50|$|<b>Noracymethadol</b> is an acetyl ester of methadol {{and it can}} be {{said with}} some {{precision}} that it is either the heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine analogue of methadol, and being a methadol it exhibits optical isomerism. The other methadols (acetylmethadol, methadol &c) have at least four optical isomers (see Orlaam).|$|E
5000|$|From this {{research}} came a generally non-controlled—or controlled {{for having the}} same precursors and effects of strong pure agonist agents of the open chain type, this one a phenaloxam derivative, levopropoxyphene with optical isomerism and one of which appeared to have no narcotic properties but was an antitussive which did have dissociative effects if misused; the isomer form which {{is removed from the}} racemic salts to yield dextromethorphan, or remove the other isomer to purify a dextropropoxyphene, or left in to finish with a racemic salts mixture dimethorphan. [...] The open chain opioids tend to have at least one isomer that is at some level a strong pure mu opioid receptor agent. Isomethadone, <b>noracymethadol,</b> LAAM, and normethadone were first developed in Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Canada, and the United States in the thirty or so years after the 1937 discovery of pethidine, the first synthetic opioid used in medicine, prolonging and increasing length and depth of satiating any opiate cravings and generating very strong analgesia (the long metabolic half-life and the strong receptor affinity at the mu opioid receptor sites, therefore imparting much of the satiating and anti-addictive effects of methadone) by means of suppressing drug cravings and the discovery in the early 1950s. of methadone's antitussive properties first tested in dogs in Europe in 1952-1955 with different inert placebos, active placebos like codeine.|$|E
