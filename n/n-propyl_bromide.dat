This allows faster cleaning, but can damage some synthetic beads and sequins if not used correctly. Healthwise, there are reported risks associated with nPB such as numbness of nerves. The exposure to the solvents in a typical dry cleaner is considered far below the levels required to cause any risk. Environmentally, it is approved by the U.S. EPA. It is among the more expensive solvents, but it is faster cleaning, lower temperatures, and quick dry times.|$|E

VSLS are mostly produced by natural processes; around 90% of VSLS are natural. “They are bromine compounds produced by seaweed and the ocean's phytoplankton”. [...] Only 10% chlorine compounds are made by the human. This substance {{is one of the}} factors that damages the atmosphere and gets into the stratosphere and also contributes to the destruction of ozone. All of these impact climate change. In previous decades, people concluded that most factors that damage ozone are CFCs; chlorofluorocarbons, but currently VSLS are increasing rapidly due to human activity; especially from industry. Even though CFCs are the main component of ozone damaging chemicals and have more impact than VSLS, and VSLS concentration is small, but it can affect the earth efficiency more than 4 times. VSLS which gas, has a short lifetime, usually decomposing in less than six months.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{pollution}} prevention program, a study was conducted at Sandia National Laboratories and at the Amarillo, ''Pantex Plant'' to identify a suitable replacement solvent(s) for cleaning hardware during routine maintenance operations. Current cleaning is performed using solvents (e. g. acetone, toluene, MEK, alcohols) that are classified as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCW) materials. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assigned four characteristics as the criteria for determining whether a material is identified as hazardous under RCRA: Ignitability, Corrosivity, Reactivity and Toxicity. Within the DOE and DoD sector, these solvents are used with hand wipes to clean surfaces prior to O-ring replacement, to remove decals for new labeling, to clean painted surfaces prior to reconditioning, and for other general maintenance purposes. In some cases, low level radioactive contamination during cleaning necessitates that the RCIL 4 solvent-containing wipes be classified as mixed waste. To avoid using RCRA materials, cleaning candidates were sought that had a flashpoint greater than 140 F, a pH between 2. 5 and 12. 5, and did not fail the reactivity and toxicity criteria. Three brominated cleaners, two hydrofluoroether azeotropes and two aliphatic hydrocarbon cleaner formulations were studied as potential replacements. Cleaning efficacy, materials compatibility, corrosion and accelerated aging studies were conducted and used to screen potential candidates.

40|$|It {{was about}} {{fifty years ago}} that I first {{developed}} a serious interest in platinum metal chemistry from my research supervisor Dr. F. G. Mann (I) in the University Chemistry Laboratory in Pembroke Street, Cambridge. It was then quite a different world: each student bench had its own individual gas light and {{you can imagine the}} fire hazard. (We students joked about our Professor, Sir William Pope, having shares in the gas company!) Even to get EIO for a piece of equipment was a feat which I IMPORTANCE achieved only once. Students bought their own research chemicals and paid for their breakages. I was lucky as Dr. Mann allowed me to draw on his personal account for chemicals, but even then we made <b>n-propyl</b> <b>bromide</b> and such from the cheaper alcohols rather than buy the alkyl halide. Thus I found myself engaged in a very productive investigation of halogen bridged palladium complexes.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper the ozone-forming {{potential}} of <b>n-propyl</b> <b>bromide</b> (NPB) was studied {{with a new}} methodol-ogy designed to address issues associated with a marginal smog-forming compound. However, the U. S. Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA) subsequently revised its policy and now recommends using the Maximum Incre-mental Reactivity (MIR) scale to rank the ozone-forming potential of all volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in-cluding those of marginal ozone productivity. Neverthe-less, EPA contemplated exceptions to the box-model-derived MIR scale by allowing use of photochemical grid-model simulations for case specific reactivity assessments. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) also uses the MIR scale and CARB has a Reactivity Scientific Advisory Committee that can consider exceptions to the MIR scale. In this study, grid-model simulations that were recom-mended by EPA are {{used to evaluate the}} incremental ozone impacts of NPB using an update to the chemical mechanism developed in an earlier paper. New methods of analysis of the grid-model output are further developed here to quantify the relative reactivities between NPB and ethane over a wide range of conditions. The new grid-model-based analyses show that NPB is significantly dif-ferent and generally less in ozone-forming potential (i. e., reactivity) than predicted by the box-model-based MIR scale relative to ethane, EPA’s “bright-line ” test for non-VOC status. Although NPB has low reactivity compared to typical VOCs on any scale, the new grid-model analyses developed here show that NPB is far less reactive (and even has negative reactivity) compared to the reactivity predicted by the MIR scale...|$|E
40|$|We present trajectory-based {{estimates}} of Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs) for very short-lived halogenated source gases {{as a function}} of surface emission location. The ODPs are determined by the fraction of source gas and its degradation products which reach the stratosphere, depending primarily on tropospheric transport and chemistry, and the effect of the resulting reactive halogen in the stratosphere, which is determined by stratospheric transport and chemistry, in particular by stratospheric residence time. Reflecting the different timescales and physico-chemical processes in the troposphere and stratosphere, the estimates are based on calculation of separate ensembles of trajectories for the troposphere and stratosphere. A methodology is described by which information from the two ensembles can be combined to give the ODPs. The ODP estimates for a species with a 20 d lifetime, representing a compound like <b>n-propyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> are presented as an example. The estimated ODPs show strong geographical and season variation, particularly within the tropics. The values of the ODPs are sensitive to the inclusion of a convective parametrization in the trajectory calculations, but the relative spatial and seasonal variation is not. The results imply that ODPs are largest for emissions from South and South-East Asia during Northern Hemisphere summer and from the Western Pacific during Northern Hemisphere winter. Large ODPs are also estimated for emissions throughout the tropics with also non-negligible values extending into northern mid-latitudes particularly in the summer. These first estimates, which include some simplifying assumptions, show larger ODP values than previous studies, particularly over Southern Asia, suggesting that emissions of short-lived halogen source gases in certain geographical regions could {{have a significant impact on}} stratospheric ozone depletion...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} two {{separate}} {{aspects of the}} chemistry of phenolic compounds. In the first section a study is reported of aryl alkyl ether synthesis using as a standard nucleophile catechol anion and as electrophilic species a range of alkyl halides. The reactions involved constituted good routes {{to a number of}} catechol mono- and di-alkyl catechol ethers. The reaction were studied systematically and key reactivity factors such as steric effects and the influence of changing alkyl chain lengths were evaluated. The high-boiling colorless products were characterize by elemental analysis, H NMR and IR spectra. As a guide to understanding the reactivity of the alkyl halides employed, kinetic runs were performed under essentially the synthetic condition, that is, with the alkyl bromides as substrates in 95 % aqueous ethanol con taining a slight excess of sodium hydroxide. Under these conditions, <b>n-propyl</b> <b>bromide</b> proved the most reactive, being about 30 % more so than the C., Cg(Cg and Cg unbranched bromides (all of which reacted equally rapidly). The three branched chain halides namely, isopropyl, isobutyl and isopentyl bromides were all substantially less active than the unbranched (clearly for steric reasons). The second section deals with phenolic electrophilic attack also but this time the electrophile attacks the phenolic ring rather than the oxyanion side chain. The work reported deals with the synthesis of a new UV-blocking monomer for use in polymer networks. The essential reaction involved amidomethylation (i. e. attack by an RCONHCH^ species, using N-hydro. xyinethylacrylamide in concentrated sulfuric acid as the electrophile) of a p-cresol ring to which is also attached at an ortho-position a benzotriazole ring. The reaction worked well. The product was cleaved with concentrated hydrochloric acid to yield the parent amine. Auxiliary runs were made (using the same electro phile) with p-cresol without any triazole substituent...|$|E
