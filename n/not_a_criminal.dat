5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the award Braham was out celebrating at a pub. He attempted {{to drive home}} whilst intoxicated and crashed into a traffic island. Although drinking and driving was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence, the police charged him with damaging public property and fined him £5, {{the equivalent of a}} weeks wages. It was his third car crash. His success did not abate. A Ju 88 and Do 217 were claimed off the English coast on the nights of the 26 and 31 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police {{headquarters}} {{is situated in}} the Neoclassical-inspired Politigården building built in 1918–24 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms {{does not lead to}} prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> one.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or {{consumption of alcohol}}ic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to exactly define the single function or goal of {{the phenomenon of the}} Mafia. Until the early 1980s, mafia was generally considered a unique Sicilian cultural attitude and form of power, excluding any corporate or organisational dimension. Some even used it as a defensive attempt to render the Mafia benign and romantic — <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> association, but the sum of Sicilian values that outsiders never will understand.|$|E
25|$|The Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) {{considers}} the forced sex in marriages {{as a crime}} only when the wife is below 15. Thus, marital rape is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense under IPC. The marital rape victims have to take recourse to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 (PWDVA). The PWDVA, which came into force in 2006, outlaws marital rape. However, it offers only a civil remedy for the offence.|$|E

25|$|In Islamic communities, {{the novel}} became {{instantly}} controversial, {{because of what}} some Muslims considered blasphemous references. Rushdie was accused of misusing freedom of speech. By October 1988, letters and phone calls arrived at Viking Penguin from Muslims, angry with the book and demanding that it be withdrawn. Before {{the end of the}} month, the import of the book was banned in India, although possession of the book is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence.|$|E
25|$|Article 7 {{prohibits the}} {{retroactive}} criminalisation of acts and omissions. No {{person may be}} punished for an act that was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence {{at the time of}} its commission. The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law, which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time, so long as it was prohibited by international law. The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed.|$|E
25|$|As {{detention}} {{under the}} CLTPA does not put a detainee in jeopardy of possible trial and punishment for an alleged offence, the detention is, in this narrow sense, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> cause or matter. Therefore, if a detainee wishes {{to challenge the}} legality of his detention, he must apply for an order for review of detention (formerly known as a writ of habeas corpus) under the civil procedure of the Supreme Court. However, it is not within the court's province to determine that a detainee should be charged and tried in open court rather than be detained.|$|E

25|$|The Boomers planned excursions, {{which they}} called raids, {{into the area}} and {{surveyed}} townsites, built homes, and planted crops. The United States sent troops to round them up and expel them. The raids continued for several years. The Boomers {{tried to get a}} legal opinion as to the status of the public lands, but the government, instead of charging them for illegal settlement of Indian land, charged them only under the Intercourse Act. Finally, in United States vs. Payne in 1884, the United States District Court at Topeka, Kansas ruled that settling on the Unassigned Lands was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense.|$|E

After being handcuffed and detained at the airport until the next morning, he was finally allowed {{to make a phone call}} to his friend Professor Jamsheed Akrami. He was finally photographed and sent back to Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} privacy is {{protected}} by Article 30 of the Basic Law and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights. At statutory level, protection is mainly offered by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which has quite a limited scope. It stipulates six data protection principles which must be adhered to when dealing with personal data. Non-compliance with the principles is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence but the party concerned may be served with an enforcement notice by the Privacy Commissioner. Non-compliance with an enforcement notice is punishable by a penalty of a fine at Level 5 and imprisonment for 2 years. The statute also creates a civil cause of action: an individual who suffers damage, including injured feeling, by reason of a contravention of the Ordinance in relation {{to his or her}} personal data may seek compensation from the data user concerned.|$|E

25|$|Marital rape is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offence within Indian legal framework, except {{during the}} period of judicial separation of the partners. The marital rape {{exception}} has restricted application when the wife has been living separately from the husband, under or without a decree of judicial separation. In such cases, again the husband can be prosecuted but, if convicted, the minimum punishment is imprisonment {{for two years and}} imposition of fine (Section 376B, IPC). This clause was enacted in the year 1983, a watershed in the history of rape law reform in India, when major changes were brought in the law of rape {{for the first time since}} its enactment by the colonial state in 1860. The parliamentary committee that gave final shape to the 1983 amendments was reluctant to treat non-consensual sex between a separated couple as amounting to rape, on the ground that a rape charge might mar the chances of reconciliation between a separated couple and make divorce inevitable. Hence, the minimum sentence stipulated for this category of rape was set much lower than that in general.|$|E
25|$|On June 29, 2008, four Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Pondicherry and Kolkata) saw coordinated pride events. About 2,200 {{people turned}} up overall. These {{were also the}} first pride events of all these cities except Kolkata, which had seen its first such event in 1999 - making it South Asia's first pride walk and then had been {{organizing}} pride events every year since 2003 (although there was a gap of {{a year or so}} in-between). The pride parades were successful, given that no right-wing group attacked or protested against the pride parade, although the opposition party BJP expressed its disagreement with the concept of gay pride parade. The next day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for greater social tolerance towards homosexuals at an AIDS event. On August 16, 2008 (one day after the Independence Day of India), the gay community in Mumbai held its first ever formal pride parade (although informal pride parades had been held many times earlier), to demand that India's anti-gay laws be amended. A high court in the Indian capital, Delhi ruled on July 2, 2009, that homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> act, although the Supreme Court later reversed its decision in 2013 under widespread pressure from powerful conservative and religious groups, leading to the re-criminalization of homosexuality in India.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Soros was {{contacted}} by a French financier named Georges Pébereau who {{asked him to}} participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Société Générale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac). Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité. In 1989, the Commission des Opérations de Bourse (COB—the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent and no charges were brought forward, however, the case was reopened a few years later and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006, but reduced the penalty to €940,000. Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover. In December 2006 he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing. On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal. In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.|$|E
