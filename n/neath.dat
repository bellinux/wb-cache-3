5|$|Encouraged by {{the recent}} grant of an Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{the building of the}} Glamorganshire Canal, it was resolved at a meeting at the Ship & Castle public house in <b>Neath</b> on 12 July 1790 to build a canal from Pontneddfechan to <b>Neath,</b> and another from <b>Neath</b> to Giant's Grave. Among those attending was Lord Vernon, who had already built a short canal near Giant's Grave to connect the River <b>Neath</b> to furnaces at Penrhiwtyn. Thomas Dadford was asked to survey a course, and he was assisted by his father and brother. He proposed a route which required 22 locks, part of which was a conventional canal, while other parts used the River <b>Neath.</b> Dadford costed the project at £25,716, but in early 1791 Lord Vernon's agent, Lewis Thomas, proposed two new cuts, and the idea of using the river was dropped soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The canals are {{the subject}} of active {{restoration}} projects. Local interest resulted {{in the formation of the}} <b>Neath</b> and Tennant Canals Preservation Society in 1974, to promote restoration of the canal, and carry out clearance and repairs using volunteers. In 2006 it was renamed the <b>Neath</b> and Tennant Canals Trust. They have worked alongside the two Canal companies, <b>Neath</b> Port Talbot Council, and a wide range of funders and bodies working for regeneration of the <b>Neath</b> valley, to enable significant sections of the canals to return to use.|$|E
5|$|The canals faced {{competition}} from the Vale of <b>Neath</b> Railway after 1851, but remained profitable until the early 1880s, {{in the case of}} the <b>Neath</b> Canal, and the 1890s for the Tennant. An unusual aspect of the Tennant's success was that tolls were maintained, although tonnage dropped. Most canals at this time made significant cuts to tolls in an attempt to remain competitive with the railways. After 1883, the <b>Neath</b> Canal carried small amounts of silica and gunpowder, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1921. Navigation on the <b>Neath</b> Canal came to an end in 1934, and on the Tennant Canal soon afterwards. However, most of the infrastructure was maintained as the canals supplied water to local industries.|$|E
5|$|At Briton Ferry, {{the canal}} ends under the M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, {{but there are}} plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In <b>Neath</b> itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a canal basin and moorings for <b>Neath.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Tennant Canal was a {{development}} of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River <b>Neath</b> called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River <b>Neath</b> to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order to increase trade, he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the <b>Neath</b> Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament {{and there was a}} long delay while Tennant attempted to resolve a dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the <b>Neath</b> traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships.|$|E
5|$|The canal was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament {{passed on}} 6 June 1791, which created The Company and Proprietors of the <b>Neath</b> Canal Navigation, who had powers to raise £25,000 by {{the issue of}} shares, and an additional £10,000 if necessary. As well as building the canal, the Canal Company could build inclined planes, railways or rollers if required, and could optionally use {{the bed of the}} River <b>Neath.</b> The canal was to run from Glynneath (called Abernant at the time), which was not as far up the valley as Pontneddfechan, to Melincryddan Pill at <b>Neath,</b> where it would join the river. Thomas Dadford was employed as Engineer, and construction started from <b>Neath,</b> northwards towards Glynneath. The canal had reached the River <b>Neath</b> at Ynysbwllog by 1792, when Dadford resigned to take up work on the Monmouthshire Canal. He was replaced by Thomas Sheasby, who failed to complete the canal by the November 1793 deadline given to him, and was arrested in 1794 for irregularities in the accounts of the Glamorganshire Canal. The canal company completed the building work by 1795, using direct labour, although the lock into the river was never built. Rebuilding of locks and other improvements continued to be made for several years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Tennant Canal in 1824 {{inspired}} Elizabeth Davies, who owned a lollipop-shop in <b>Neath,</b> to write a 19-verse poem, which was published by Filmer Fagg of Swansea.|$|E
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in Leicester to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Malthus, and one evening he met the {{entomologist}} Henry Bates. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal Zoologist. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects. William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in <b>Neath,</b> but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the Vale of <b>Neath.</b>|$|E
5|$|Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and {{included}} jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, {{rather than being}} thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been thrown into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, {{where it had been}} thrown into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at <b>Neath.</b> From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach <b>Neath</b> quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 Act {{also gave}} the Anglesey Central Railway (ACR) {{the right to}} {{authorise}} Dickson to lease or work the line, or to lease or sell the line to the LNWR. Dickson did indeed undertake to operate services. He requested permission from the LNWR to run services through to Bangor, but they refused, and passengers had to continue to change at Gaerwen. The act authorised a branch from Rhosgoch to Cemaes, {{but this was not}} built. The Fairlie engine Mountaineer was in use on the line in April 1866, but by October 1867 it was in use on the <b>Neath</b> and Brecon Railway, of which Dickson was also the contractor and whose traffic he was working. The <b>Neath</b> and Brecon's 0-6-0 Miers also operated on the ACR, under the name Anglesea. Neither of those engines was considered successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to Cyprus {{with the}} 1st Battalion was Billy's first overseas posting, and despite being ordered {{to keep in}} line, he refused to obey. He failed to keep in step, and tried to headbutt a drummer. The goat major, Lance Corporal Dai Davies, 22, from <b>Neath,</b> South Wales, was unable to keep him under control.|$|E
5|$|The main {{centre of}} the new woollen {{industry}} was initially in south east Wales drawing on sheep from the monasteries of Margam, <b>Neath</b> and Tintern and the flocks of the Bohun family, which produced 18,500 fleeces in 1372.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's work on {{the survey}} {{involved}} {{spending a lot of}} time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the <b>Neath</b> Mechanics' Institute, founded in 1843. William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near <b>Neath,</b> where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1839, {{they moved}} to Kington, Hereford, near the Welsh border, before {{eventually}} settling at <b>Neath</b> in Glamorgan in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales. By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions, and Wallace, {{at the age of}} 20, left in January.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 11th century, the Norman lord, Robert Fitzhamon entered Morgannwg {{in an attempt}} to gain control of the area, {{building}} many earth and timber castles in the lowlands. In the early 12th century the Norman expansion continued with castles being founded around <b>Neath,</b> Kenfig and Coity, while within the same period Bishop Urban established the Diocese of Llandaff under which Glynrhondda belonged to the large parish of Llantrisant.|$|E
5|$|George Tennant, born in 1765 {{and the son}} of a {{solicitor}} in Lancashire, {{moved to}} the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river <b>Neath</b> through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than <b>Neath</b> or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.|$|E
5|$|The Glan-y-wern Canal {{was built}} to connect Richard Jenkins' {{colliery}} at Glan-y-wern with the River <b>Neath</b> at Trowman's Hole, an inlet across the mud flats from the main channel of the river <b>Neath,</b> which was later known as Red Jacket Pill. Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, {{although there was no}} actual connection to the river. At Red Jacket, cargos were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in the pill, which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal {{was built to}} Elton, placed a distraint on the wharves at Red Jacket and on the barges and it became disused.|$|E
5|$|A {{world record}} crowd of 56,000 for a rugby union club match watched Llanelli RFC beat <b>Neath</b> RFC by 28 points to 13 {{points in the}} final of the Schweppes Cup (WRU Challenge Cup) on 7 May 1988. The first evening game to be played under {{floodlights}} was held on 4 September 1991 at 8.00pm, between Wales and France. The last international match to be held at the National Stadium was between Wales and England on 15 March 1997, and the last ever match that was held at the National Stadium was on 26 April 1997 between Cardiff and Swansea, Cardiff won the SWALEC Cup (WRU Challenge Cup) by 33 points to 26 points.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The <b>Neath</b> Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at <b>Neath</b> Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.|$|E
5|$|O'Gara's {{last minute}} {{conversion}} against Gloucester on 18 January 2003 helped Munster to a 27-point victory which took them {{through to the}} Heineken Cup quarter final; this match {{has come to be}} known in Munster folklore as the Miracle Match. He was part of the Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League, starting and scoring 12 points as Munster beat <b>Neath</b> 37–17 in the Millennium Stadium. O'Gara turned down the chance to join NFL side Miami Dolphins in March 2003. He started when Munster beat Llanelli Scarlets to win the Celtic Cup in May 2005, scoring 17 points in the game.|$|E

5|$|In December 1997, the Welsh Office invited {{proposals}} from Wales for the National Assembly building. 24 {{proposals were}} received, 14 {{came from the}} private sector and government-owned corporations including HTV Group, Grosvenor Waterside (owned by Associated British Ports), Tarmac Developments, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and Cardiff Airport. Nine local authorities in Wales made proposals including the Guildhall proposed by Swansea Council, Cardiff City Hall by Cardiff Council, Margam Castle by <b>Neath</b> Port Talbot Council, Cyfarthfa Castle by Merthyr Tydfil Council, proposals also came from Wrexham Council, Flintshire County Council who proposed two sites at Ewloe and Mold, Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, Powys County Council and five sites from Bridgend Council The Grosvenor Waterside proposal, known as Capital Waterside, included the Pierhead Building, Crickhowell House and Site 1E, which would become the site of the new debating chamber.|$|E
5|$|Rugby union {{took root}} in Wales in 1850, when Reverend Rowland Williams became Vice-Principal at St David's College, Lampeter, where he {{introduced}} the sport. Wales played their first international on 19 February 1881; organised by Newport's Richard Mullock, Wales played against England, losing by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil (8–0). On 12 March 1881, the Welsh Rugby Union was formed at The Castle Hotel, <b>Neath.</b> Two years later, the Home Nation Championshipnow the Six Nations Championshipwas first played and Wales did not register a win. However, rugby in Wales developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had developed the four three-quarters formation. This formation – with seven backs and eight forwards, instead of six backs and nine forwards – revolutionised {{the sport and}} was eventually adopted almost universally at international and club level.|$|E
5|$|The 5th century saw the {{withdrawal}} of Imperial Roman support from Britain, and the succeeding centuries, the Dark Ages, witnessed {{the emergence of a}} national identity and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within Glywysing, an area that incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan, ruled by a dynasty founded by Glywys. This dynasty was later replaced by another founded by Meurig ap Tewdrig whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg. With the coming of the Norman overlords after the 1066 Battle of Hastings, south-east Wales was divided into five cantrefi. The Rhondda lay within Penychen, a narrow strip running between modern day Glyn <b>Neath</b> and the coast between Cardiff and Aberthaw. Each cantref was further divided into commotes, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Wales in 2014 was about 3,092,000, {{an increase of}} 9,600 (0.31%) on the previous year, which was the slowest growth rate for {{any country in the}} United Kingdom. The main population and industrial areas in Wales are in South Wales, specifically Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and the adjoining South Wales Valleys. Cardiff is the capital city and had a {{population of}} around 346,000 at the 2011 census. This was followed by the unitary authorities of Swansea (239,000), Rhondda Cynon Taf (234,400), Carmarthenshire (183,800), Caerphilly (178,800), Flintshire (152,500), Newport (145,700), <b>Neath</b> Port Talbot (139,800), Bridgend (139,200) and Wrexham (134,800). Cardiff was the most heavily populated area in Wales with 2,482 people per square kilometre (6,428 per sq mile) while Powys had just 26.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{joined the}} revolt of Edward's wife Isabella of France and her lover Mortimer in 1326, {{pursuing}} and capturing Edward at <b>Neath</b> in South Wales. Following Edward's deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at Berkeley Castle, Thomas's conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained {{possession of the}} Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas's treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland's independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and checked the revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry's further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for {{the last fifteen years}} of his life.|$|E
25|$|When {{the line}} opened the {{stations}} were at <b>Neath,</b> Crynant, Onllwyn, Penwyllt, Devynock and Brecon. The <b>Neath</b> station was at Cadoxton, as <b>Neath</b> Low Level SVR station {{was not used}} by the B until 3 June 1867.|$|E
25|$|The Vale of <b>Neath</b> Railway was {{hostile to}} the {{extension}} to Swansea, and a mixed gauge Swansea and <b>Neath</b> Railway was in any case being promoted at the same time. The Bill was accordingly pared down to omit the Swansea extremity, {{and the name of}} the proposed company changed to the <b>Neath</b> and Brecon Railway. At Brecon it was to make arrangements with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway to use its station, and corresponding terms were to be agreed somehow at <b>Neath</b> with the Vale of <b>Neath</b> Railway.|$|E

25|$|At Court Sart {{the line}} turned west, again {{crossing}} under the GWR line and crossing the <b>Neath</b> Canal and both {{parts of the}} River <b>Neath,</b> then turning south and then west to Danygraig. Danygraig was within the Swansea Harbour complex, giving access to mineral trains to the Swansea Harbour Trust lines there. The {{main part of the}} <b>Neath</b> River was crossed by the large <b>Neath</b> swing bridge. The bridge is 388 feet in length and the structure contains 1,400 tons of iron.|$|E
25|$|A {{broad gauge}} {{ally of the}} South Wales Railway, the Vale of <b>Neath</b> Railway, ran from <b>Neath</b> over the {{watershed}} near Hirwain (now spelt Hirwaun) to Aberdare. Aberdare became the centre of a huge production of high quality coal. However {{the use of the}} broad gauge was a mixed blessing, and transits between Aberdare or Merthyr and Cardiff on that system via <b>Neath</b> involved a considerable excess mileage compared with rival, narrow (standard) gauge routes.|$|E
