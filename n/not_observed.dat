5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to discover}} {{the ways of the}} characters in The Giver movie in <b>observing</b> and <b>not</b> <b>observing</b> quality maxim. This research uses quality maxim in cooperative principle by Grice. The data of this research is all utterances of the characters in this movie. This research uses qualitative method. The data is analyzed by analyzing the characters‟ utterances and finding the ways of characters in <b>observing</b> and <b>not</b> <b>observing</b> quality maxim. The result of this research can be concluded that the characters <b>not</b> only <b>observe</b> quality maxim but also do <b>not</b> <b>observe</b> quality maxim. They do <b>not</b> <b>observe</b> the maxim in some ways such as, violating, flouting, and infringing. Based on the data obtained, there are 276 times of observance of quality maxim and 62 times of non-observance of quality maxim. In non-observance of quality maxim, it was found 46 times of violating, nine times of flouting, and seven times of infringing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} manufacturer should observe the common re-tail cost when exclusively delegating a retailer {{to sell her}} goods. We show that the expected sum of profits between the manufacturer and retailer is greater when the former does <b>not</b> <b>observe</b> the cost ex ante than when they do. However, the manufac-turer cannot acquire a greater expected private payoff when <b>not</b> <b>observing</b> the cost, regardless of the optimal contract. Even if the commitment to <b>not</b> <b>observe</b> the cost alleviates competition, the manufacturer must always pay higher information rent than the increasing payoff to the retailer...|$|R

This phosphoresence was <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.|$|E
5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico that was <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated {{the movement to}} be part of a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E
5|$|Field marshal is the five-star {{rank and}} highest {{attainable}} {{rank in the}} Indian Army. Though the rank is placed above general, it is <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in the regular structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. A field marshal receives the full pay of a four–star general, and is considered a serving officer until their death. They wear a full uniform on all ceremonial occasions. In addition to this, they also run {{an office in the}} Army Headquarters with a secretariat.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 state is <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> {{in many other}} actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} zirconium {{is composed}} of five isotopes. 90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr and 94Zr are stable, although 94Zr is predicted to undergo double beta decay (<b>not</b> <b>observed</b> experimentally) with a half-life of more than 1.10×1017years. 96Zr has a half-life of 2.4×1019years, and is the longest-lived radioisotope of zirconium. Of these natural isotopes, 90Zr is the most common, making up 51.45% of all zirconium. 96Zr is the least common, comprising only 2.80% of zirconium.|$|E

5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> before World War II, {{but with}} the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{atmosphere}} {{exhibits a}} banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature {{used to describe}} these bands {{is the same as}} on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.|$|E
5|$|The Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; {{the leading}} {{hemisphere}} is {{brighter than the}} trailing one. This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide. The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, although it is <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> near the poles. Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto. Ganymede's carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events. The first {{of these is the}} usual process of cell fusion (forming a diploid) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores. The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; this stage is <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic. These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Florence {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved through the Lesser Antilles into the eastern Caribbean on September21. The wave tracked generally westward, and spawned a tropical storm on September23 about 100mi (160km) southeast of Jamaica. Given the name Florence, the storm steadily intensified after developing, although a well-defined circulation was <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> until September24. That day, Florence attained hurricane status in the Yucatán Channel between the Yucatán Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba.|$|E
