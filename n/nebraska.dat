5|$|Despite Nebraska's early-season loss, the Cornhuskers {{still had}} a chance to win a record-setting third {{consecutive}} national championship. A win against Texas would earn <b>Nebraska</b> a bid to the Sugar Bowl and a game against No. 1 Florida State to decide the national championship. Unfortunately for <b>Nebraska,</b> the underdog Longhorns upset heavily favored <b>Nebraska,</b> 3727. Eight days after losing to Texas, <b>Nebraska</b> was awarded a bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nebraska's</b> {{domination}} continued, as {{this time}} it was Colorado held ineffective with only 37 yards to the 314 rolled up by the Cornhuskers. <b>Nebraska's</b> series lead extended to 3-0 over Colorado.|$|R
5|$|<b>Nebraska</b> {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, and {{lived up to}} the ranking in its first game of the season. On September 7, <b>Nebraska</b> {{overwhelmed}} the Michigan State Spartans, 5514. After an off week, however, <b>Nebraska</b> fans were shocked by one of the first big national upsets of the season as <b>Nebraska</b> was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State, 190. The loss dropped <b>Nebraska</b> to No. 8 in the rankings, but as the season wore on, <b>Nebraska</b> rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games. Nebraska's 101 record to that point earned it a trip to the first-ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri, against the Texas Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Nebraska</b> Cornhuskers {{began the}} 1996 season having won the {{national}} championship in both 1994 and 1995. Though <b>Nebraska</b> was {{now a member of}} a new conference—the former Big Eight Conference had been merged with four Texas schools to become the Big 12—it was widely expected that <b>Nebraska</b> would repeat the performance for a third time in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with <b>Nebraska</b> in {{possession}} of the ball at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line and facing a second down and needing six yards. On the first play of the quarter, <b>Nebraska</b> rusher Brian Schuster was tackled for a five-yard loss in a failed trick play, pushing <b>Nebraska</b> back to the 16-yard line. Sims rushed for eight yards on third down, but failed {{to pick up the}} first down and <b>Nebraska</b> sent kicker Kris Brown into the game. Brown's 25-yard field goal was successful, and <b>Nebraska</b> cut Virginia Tech's lead to 73 with 13:25 remaining before halftime.|$|E

50|$|South Dakota {{seemed to}} have {{figured out how to}} shut down <b>Nebraska's</b> offense, forcing the Cornhuskers to win with field goals instead of touchdowns. The low-scoring affair was <b>Nebraska's</b> third win in four games against the Coyotes.|$|R
5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that <b>Nebraska</b> would have a chance to score. But <b>Nebraska</b> received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the <b>Nebraska</b> 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get <b>Nebraska</b> into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, <b>Nebraska</b> proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E

50|$|Bellevue {{suffered}} {{the brunt of}} <b>Nebraska's</b> wrath following the previous week's loss to Haskell, as the Cornhuskers punched out 51 unanswered points despite having numerous starters sidelined with injuries. <b>Nebraska's</b> record over Bellevue improved to 2-0, both shutout wins. This win was <b>Nebraska's</b> third against significant in-state competition for the season, and with a win against the Lincoln Medics and an exhibition win against Lincoln High, the Cornhuskers recorded their fifth state championship.|$|R
50|$|The 2014 {{edition of}} the Gator Bowl marked <b>Nebraska's</b> second {{appearance}} in the game. The Cornhuskers won their previous appearance in 2009 in a 26-21 victory over Clemson. The 2014 Gator Bowl also marked <b>Nebraska's</b> 50th bowl game appearance.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>Nebraska's</b> {{touchdown}} {{came on a}} trick placekick {{that was}} instead run in for a touchdown. <b>Nebraska's</b> shutout streak was now eight games in a row, and the Cornhuskers pulled ahead in the series for the first time, 6-5.|$|R
5|$|At quarterback, <b>Nebraska</b> had Scott Frost, a {{transfer}} player from Stanford who had 1,440 passing yards, 13 passing touchdowns, three interceptions, and 578 rushing yards {{in his first}} season with the team. Frost's three interceptions were the third-least in Division I-A; only Army and Ohio University had fewer. Overall, <b>Nebraska</b> totaled 5,069 yards of offense and 42.7 points per game, the most in the Big 12.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>Nebraska</b> {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Following the kickoff and return, Virginia Tech began at its 19-yard line. On the first play of the second half, Oxendine broke loose for a 36-yard run to the <b>Nebraska</b> 45-yard line and a first down. Despite that strong opening play, Tech was unable to gain another first down {{and was forced to}} punt after gaining only two additional yards. The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the <b>Nebraska</b> 26-yard line.|$|E

50|$|It {{looked like}} <b>Nebraska's</b> day, as the Cornhuskers led {{at the half}} and were up 14-0 in the 3rd, but Oklahoma came back to score 17 points {{straight}} for the lead and the win, ending <b>Nebraska's</b> home winning streak dating to 1969.|$|R
50|$|The {{disastrous}} 1899 {{season was}} <b>Nebraska's</b> first losing season. Coach Branch departed after his {{one and only}} season. His single-season record of 1-7-1 (.167) was the worst single season record in program history until 1957, and brought <b>Nebraska's</b> overall program record down to 41-25-4 (.614).|$|R

50|$|The {{team went}} on to crush the Wake Forest Demon Deacons (Zac Taylor's former four year college) 31-3.

40|$|Abstract 	Eastern <b>Nebraska’s</b> saline {{wetlands}} play a {{major role}} in <b>Nebraska’s</b> environmental place in the world. Besides the role of scientific changes being important, education also is essential in the conservation of these wetlands. Through the observation of Salt Creek tiger beetle (Cicindela nevadica lincolniana) and soil electroconductivity, I propose that we need to reform <b>Nebraska’s</b> education system to help schools play a bigger part in environmental issues such as this one. There is a drastic trend in the correlations between Salt Creek tiger beetle populations and wetland degradation. Since many Lincoln residents have a limited knowledge of what is happening in this ecosystem, it is time to take action and raise the awareness. Getting involved can save <b>Nebraska’s</b> unique wetlands...|$|R
