Under the {{direction}} of Marimin and Rita Nurmalina. The rapid and complex development of the banking sector urges an implementation of risk management {{not only for the}} credit risk but also for the market risk because of the volatility of interest rate and exchange rate that create the risk as a whole. Risk management could be effective if there is an effort to measure the risk in order to determine total of reserved capital to cover the risk and to be the base of strategic planning on foreign exchange activity done by the bank. This topic was chosen since there was a need of the bank for a specific measurement method that could measure potential loss comprehensively specifically it is able to measure the sensitivity of potential loss of products or activity to the affected factors. The method is the Value at Risk that is used by most of bankers in measuring potential loss and capital charge that should be reserved.
