5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the <b>northern</b> <b>wall.</b> Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the <b>northern</b> <b>wall</b> fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched {{at both ends of}} the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the <b>northern</b> <b>wall</b> was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|R

50|$|The fortifications of the Cittadella {{consist of}} a {{semi-circular}} enceinte in {{the northern end of}} the city, and bastions linked together with curtain walls in the south. The <b>northern</b> <b>walls</b> are built on the perimeter of the natural plateau, so they were difficult to attack. They were originally built in the 15th century, although large portions of the walls were rebuilt by the Hospitallers or in modern times. The <b>northern</b> <b>walls</b> include the remains of a collapsed medieval wall tower, a blocked-up sally port, a lookout post and some walled-up windows. Masonry revetments are built in depressions within the cliff face below the <b>northern</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Small {{fragments}} on {{the southern}} and <b>northern</b> <b>walls</b> allows one to get some idea about how the mainspace was decorated. The decorations {{are likely to continue}} the tradition and to show gospel themes. Emphasizing the scene of Christmas on the <b>northern</b> <b>wall</b> along with the scene of Dormition of the Mother of God on the <b>northern</b> <b>wall</b> is a traditional approach for ancient Russian churches. Thus, the material birth and raising here is opposed to the birth after death. Even the small retained fragment imply that Dormition was represented in some special, extended variant: it shows the apostles who are moving from clouds towards the Our Lady's deathbed.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years the slurry had a low {{relative}} density that led to difficult construction conditions with seepage and sloughing on the <b>northern</b> <b>wall.</b> A drained tailings buttress was constructed against {{the face of the}} <b>northern</b> <b>wall.</b> A single ringmain around the dam was not used, contrary to current practice. A return water dam that could accept water from the dam itself was not provided.|$|R
