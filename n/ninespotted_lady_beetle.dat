40|$|Populations of {{the native}} <b>ninespotted</b> <b>lady</b> <b>beetle,</b> Coccinella novemnotata Herbst, have un-dergone precipitous declines in North America {{following}} {{the establishment of the}} exotic sevenspotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L. Recent volunteer efforts have made it possible to establish colonies of the now-rare C. novemnotata and test mechanisms contributing to its decline. We evaluated the relative frequencies of intraguild predation and cannibalism of eggs between these two species. A single C. novemnotata or C. septem-punctata adult was exposed to conspecific and heterospecific eggs in either {{the presence or absence of}} pea aphids. The study revealed two expected results: 1) eggs of C. novemno-tata were consumed more frequently than eggs of C. septempunctata by both species, and 2) egg consumption was higher when aphids were absent, independent of predator and egg species. There were also two unexpected results from the study: 1) the asymmetry between egg predation rates was higher when aphids were present, and 2) higher predation rates on C. novemnotata eggs in the absence of alternate prey was due to a relatively higher rate of intraspecific cannibalism. This implies that C. novemnotata would have suffered higher eg...|$|E

40|$|Although {{commonly}} known as ladybugs in America, Entomologists prefer to call insects in the Coccinellids family as ladybird <b>beetles</b> or <b>lady</b> <b>beetles,</b> as these insects are not true bugs. There {{have been at least}} 138 species of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coccinellids) reported to be introduced into Hawaii, either intentionally or adventively, of which 87 of these species are known to be established (Nishida, 2002). <b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> have various sizes, colors, patterns on their hardened forewings (elytra), and even on their prey preference. They can be as small as 1 mm long like those in the genera of Stethorus (A) or can be 7. 5 mm long like the 7 -spotted (B). Some can have elytra with no patterns like the metallic blue <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (C), have strips like the three striped <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (D), or have halos around their spots like the 10 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (E). The spots can be small (F), large (G), or oblong (H). The morphology of <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae can vary as much as the adults. Some can be mostly grey like the 7 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (I), be strikingly colorful as seen with the 10 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (J), be covered in white fluffy hairs like the globe-marked <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (K), or be spiky as seen with the genus Scymnus (L) and the minute 2 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (M).

50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that populations of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> {{can respond to}} increases in populations of soybean aphids in soybean. In addition, increases in populations of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> {{have the ability to}} inhibit colony growth of soybean aphids throughout the growing season. As generalist predators, <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are able to feed on alternate prey when soybean aphids are at low densities. Other characteristics of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> that are advantageous in times of soybean aphid scarcity include developmental delays of certain life stages, decreased body weights, and reduced clutch sizes. One of the most competitive <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in North America, the multicolored Asian <b>lady</b> <b>beetle,</b> is of exotic origin.

40|$|Adults of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in {{the tribe}} Scymnini {{imported}} for biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand, in eastern North America {{can be readily}} distinguished from native <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coccinellidae). The imported <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are in the genera Pseudoscymnus and Scymnus (Neopullus), {{both of which are}} Palearctic. These taxons have characteristics {{that can be used to}} separate them from Nearctic <b>lady</b> <b>beetles.</b> The most useful morphological feature is that the number of antennal segments is less than 11; ten-segmented in Scymnus (Neopullus) and ninesegmented in Pseudoscymnus. Elytral patterns and coloration also can be useful in field recognition. Larvae of the imported <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are all in the tribe Scymnini, which can be distinguished from <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in other tribes. A characteristic of the Scymnini is the wax covering of the last two larval instars and, for most species, the body lacks pronounced spines and is neither black or heavily sclerotized. Identification of a Scymnini larva to the genus level requires careful microscopic examination. Pseudoscymnus tsugae larval antennae have been described as onesegmented, but our examination indicates that they are two-segmented. Scymnus (Neopullus) larvae have three-segmented antennae.

The {{objective}} of this 2 [*]yr on-farm study was to document {{the impact of a}} grain sorghum trap crop on the density of Coccinellidae on nearby cotton.

40|$|Chemical {{signals are}} {{involved}} in the courtship behavior of many invertebrate and vertebrate species. <b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are no exception to this rule; a significant number of published reports highlight the role of cuticular chemicals involved in the reproduction of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles,</b> including gender recognition. Recent data have also demonstrated the presence of a volatile female sex pheromone that facilitates male attraction in some species.

Because <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are often reared as biological control agents, the chemical cues involved in their sexual behavior could be used as components in integrated management approaches against soft-bodied hemipterans.

50|$|Some insects, like {{converge}}nt lady beetles, reuse {{the same}} hibernacula, year after year. They converge with other <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> and migrate to hibernacula used by prior generations. They {{are able to}} find old hibernacula due to hydrocarbons released by <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> feet which create a lasting path. This allows <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> to retrace their footsteps to previously used hibernacula. Their tendency to aggregate and overwinter in groups is likely due to their attraction to similar environments and conspecifics.

40|$|Background Non-essential facultative endosymbionts {{can provide}} their hosts with {{protection}} from parasites, pathogens, and predators. For example, two facultative bacterial symbionts of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Serratia symbiotica and Hamiltonella defensa, protect their hosts from parasitism by {{two species of}} parasitoid wasp. Previous studies have not explored whether facultative symbionts also play a defensive role against predation in this system. We tested whether feeding on aphids harboring different facultative symbionts affected the fitness of an aphid predator, the <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> Hippodamia convergens. Results While these aphid faculative symbionts did not deter <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding, they did decrease survival of <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. <b>Lady</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae fed a diet of aphids with facultative symbionts had significantly reduced survival from egg hatching to pupation and therefore had reduced survival to adult emergence. Additionally, <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> adults fed aphids with facultative symbionts were significantly heavier than those fed facultative symbiont-free aphids, though development time was not significantly different. Conclusions Aphids reproduce clonally and are often found in large groups. Thus, aphid symbionts, by reducing the fitness of the aphid predator H. convergens, may indirectly defend their hosts’ clonal descendants against predation. These findings highlight the often far-reaching effects that symbionts can have in ecological systems...|$|R
