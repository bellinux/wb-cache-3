5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|Muncy Creek {{was known}} to the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as Occohpocheny. Historically, <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> painted on Picture Rock, a cliff on the creek. Additionally, six Native American lance heads made of stone were found near the creek by Joseph Fahrenbach {{in the autumn of}} 1872.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{contemporary}} <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> {{images on}} skateboards that extend <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> art beyond such traditional crafts as beadworks and pottery are explored. The study reveals that <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> skateboard graphics express history, culture, and myths. <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> curriculum, <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> art, and <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> stereotyping in visual culture are critically examined. The {{purpose of the}} study is to provide additional <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> art and visual culture examples and methods for the development of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> art curricula...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{through a}} series of four studies Fryberg aimed to {{investigate}} the impact of the stereotypes portrayed by <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> mascots on <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> children's self-identity and self-conception. The first study showed that <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> High School students had positive connotations with Pocahontas, Chief Wahoo, Chief Illinweck, and other widely known <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> characters. However, the second study's results found that showing <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> High School students these images decreased their self-esteem. The third study on <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> High school students showed a decrease in <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> student's perceived community worth. The fourth study involved <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> college students, and the images of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> figures shown to college students decreased the number of ways in which they envisioned themselves achieving in the future. Fryberg's study concluded that <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> mascot imagery is harmful to <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> students because it portrays them in limited and simplistic ways, resulting in <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> students also seeing themselves more simplistically. In 2011, Fryberg testified before the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on the effects of stereotypical mascots on <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> students.|$|R

5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as a conquered people. Before long, <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, {{within striking distance of}} a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> groups advocating change include: the American Indian College Fund, National Indian Child Welfare Association, National Indian Education Association, National Indian Youth Council, National <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Law Student Association, <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Journalists Association, and <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Rights Fund (NARF).|$|R

5|$|For <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France out of the picture, the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> would have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's troops buried {{their own}} {{dead on the}} site of their camp. They built large fires over the mass grave in an attempt to conceal it from the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> After Harrison's troops {{departed}} the area, the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> returned to the grave site, digging up many of the corpses in retaliation and scattering the bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{dedicated}} <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Music Awards successfully {{proposed the}} Grammy Award for Best <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Music Album in 2000. The <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Music Awards or N.A.M.A. {{was the first}} national awards program for <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> music in North America. The Awards {{was born out of}} a need for greater recognition for <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) {{gives the}} rights to <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> {{descendants}} of the treatment of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> remains and funerary goods.|$|R

5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{in order to make}} trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> some historians now argue that the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E
5|$|The French and Indian War (1754–1763) {{led to the}} {{migration}} of many <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the Province of Pennsylvania acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, including what is now Worlds End State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> almost entirely left Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed Section 1 31 40(A)(10), South Carolina Code of Laws (Annotated), which established criteria for state recognition of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> tribes, further providing that “The South Carolina Commission for Minority Affairs shall promulgate regulations as may be necessary regarding State Recognition of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Indian entities in the State of South Carolina.” These rules and regulations shall be applicable to all entities seeking <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Indian State Recognition as a: A. <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Indian Tribe; B. <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Indian Group; C. <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Special Interest Organization.|$|R

5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.

5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Researchers {{utilizing}} {{quantitative methods}} have established that sexual violence against <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women is a severe and persistent problem in <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> communities. Currently, <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women suffer {{some of the}} highest and most violent rates of sexual victimization in the United States; experts estimate that between one-third and one-fourth of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women will be sexually victimized in their lifetimes. Researchers conducting qualitative research on sexual violence against <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women have explained that, not only are <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women outraged and highly critical of this issue, but that <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women desire for their perspectives, knowledge, and experiences to be legitimized and validated. Additionally, scholars from a variety of disciplines have also demonstrated that sexual violence against <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women must be contextualized within the historical and intersecting legacies of colonialism, sexism, racism, and genocide. However, qualitative, interview-based research in the field of sexual violence against <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women has not been widely pursued and has thus afforded the women whom this issue most affects extremely limited opportunities to speak out about sexual violence in their communities. This research, then, based on feminist methodology and practices, was an effort to fill this gap and prioritize the voices of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women. I conducted semi-structured interviews with three <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women from a tribe in the greater Tacoma area about their perspectives and experiences regarding sexual violence against <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women in their community. As a result of this research, the overarching argument I make is twofold. I contend that, as researchers, we must make a conscious effort to acknowledge, validate, and legitimize the knowledge <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women have of colonialism and how it intersects with sexual violence and violent victimizations against <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women and other community members. In doing so, we can support the activism that is already present in <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> communities and encourage the empowerment of <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> women and community members to continuously deconstruct intersecting oppressions and decolonize their communities...|$|R
