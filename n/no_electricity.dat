5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science fiction and read comics by candlelight (as the house had <b>no</b> <b>electricity),</b> eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction Society. At the age of 13, he produced his own science fiction fanzine, Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies. His pen friend {{at the time was}} Michael Moorcock; the writer of science fiction and fantasy novels. After winning a scholarship to the Junior School of Art in Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, Harry started his first school newspaper, Premier.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{population}} live in poverty, occupied in farming or raising livestock. Some have moved to the cities to seek {{a higher standard of}} living, returning to help during the peak periods of agricultural activity. Infrastructure is underdeveloped; there is <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> supply, most water comes from traditional wells, and the rudimentary school system provides only elementary education in poorly equipped establishments.|$|E
5|$|The pews and the {{elevated}} pulpit {{date from the}} 19th century. The church has some marble memorials on the walls, dating from the 18th century, and a 15th-century octagonal font. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a bier from 1746, an oak communion table from about 1700, and an inscribed Elizabethan silver cup. Paraffin lamps are used to light the church, since there is <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> connection.|$|E

50|$|There is <b>no</b> mains <b>electricity</b> {{available}} on the island, all dwellings are therefore off-the-grid, relying on generators, oil lamps and renewable power sources such as solar and wind.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmitting}} station itself featured the latest transmitters from the Marconi Company. <b>No</b> public <b>electricity</b> supply was available so large generators were installed and extensive support staff was recruited and {{trained by the}} BBC.|$|R
5|$|Huntsville was {{the largest}} city with <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> from TVA. All the traffic lights were off, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, {{students}} were sent home from United States Space Camp, and the Panoply Arts Festival was canceled. Power was restored gradually to Huntsville, beginning with 3 percent {{on the morning of}} May 1. Only localized outages remained eight days after the storm. In addition to traffic and safety issues, the outage caused difficulties with water treatment and distribution and retail of all kinds, including gasoline and food purchases.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E
25|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Nevis in 1954, when two generators were shipped in to provide electricity to the area around Charlestown. In this regard, Nevis fared better than Anguilla, {{where there were no}} paved roads, <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> and no telephones up until 1967. However, electricity did not become available island-wide on Nevis until 1971.|$|E

25|$|To escape some of {{the stress}} of the business, he moved onto a {{sailboat}} with his wife where he lived for seven years, moored in the harbor of Newport Beach, California. The boat had <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> and refrigeration, conditions were spartan. Living without a television on the boat gained the family a sense of peace and solitude while they could take advantage of the city.|$|E
25|$|During WWII Clark {{lived with}} her sister {{at the home of}} their {{grandparents}} in South Wales, in a small stone house with <b>no</b> <b>electricity,</b> no running water and a toilet {{at the bottom of the}} garden. Her grandparents spoke little English and Clark learned to speak Welsh. Her grandfather was a coal miner. Her first ever live audience was at the Colliers' Arms in Abercanaid, near Merthyr Tydfil.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{the family}} moved to Moorcourt Cottage at Moorcourt Farm, where Fred's father worked as a milking {{herdsman}} and harvest hand. The cottage had <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> and the sole source of heat came from a log fireplace. By 1951, Fred's mother had given birth to eight children, six of whom survived, but Fred was always his mother's favourite. He was seen as a mother's boy, and relied mostly on his siblings for companionship.|$|E

25|$|The {{reactors}} at the KK plant {{were shut}} down one by one after the discovery of deliberate falsification of data. The first one was taken offline September 9, 2002, {{and the last one}} was taken offline January 27, 2003. The newest units, the more inherently safe ABWRs, were taken back online the quickest and suffered the smallest effect. Units 1, 2, and 3 on the other hand, generated <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> during the fiscal year of 2003.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> {{generation}} stations {{located within}} the city. There were two natural gas-fired power stations (the 380MW Otahuhu B owned by Contact Energy and the 175 Southdown owned by Mighty River Power) have been shut down. Since {{there is very little}} generation north of Auckland, almost all of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from Huntly Power Station and the Waikato River hydroelectric stations.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1970s onwards the country’s water {{infrastructure}} was expanded significantly {{with the construction}} of the King Talal Dam completed in 1977 and the completion of the East Ghor Canal (renamed King Abdullah Canal) in 1987. The country’s first wastewater treatment plant at Ain Ghazal had been commissioned in 1968, but the construction of other wastewater treatment plants was addressed in only beginning in the late 1970s. In 1985, the largest wastewater treatment plant in the country was commissioned in As-Samra, serving Greater Amman. The plant used the stabilization pond technology, a natural technology that needed <b>no</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Ueschinen Hut is {{situated}} in the Ueschinen Valley, at a height of 1,890metres, and about two to three hours' {{walk away from the}} centre. It is usually open from May to October. During the summer it is used mainly as a base for climbing and hiking activities, but it may be used by groups at any time if weather allows. The hut is actually half of a cowshed, so sometimes it is a bit noisy at night. It can sleep up to 30 people and has a fully equipped kitchen with wood stove, a general living and eating room and a special toilet– there is <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> and no shower.|$|E
25|$|All {{group members}} were {{expected}} to work in common for the settlement. The women did domestic chores, while the men worked the farm and did some prospecting for gold, {{on a small scale}} and without much success. Water was scarce, but they installed a windmill-driven water pump and concrete cisterns for irrigating their fields. Members constructed the buildings themselves. There was <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> or indoor plumbing, consistent with their belief in material simplicity. They also made their own furniture and household goods by hand, supplemented by Ogden's occasional shopping trips to Monticello. Despite this spartan existence, the colony continually added new members, the population growing to around 100 at its height in 19345.|$|E
25|$|Since 1991 an {{outhouse}} at {{the back}} of the lodge has been maintained by Dundee University Rucksack Club as an open bothy – it is a good base for climbing Lochnagar. Equipped with a stove and a composting toilet (as well as a candelabra) it used to be a storeroom and is now available to anyone free of charge for overnight stays. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>electricity,</b> the water supply is from the Glas Allt very near by, and there is no fuel unless it has been left by previous users. When royal parties are visiting the lodge backpackers are still allowed to stay in the bothy but they are asked to keep discretely out of the way.|$|E

25|$|The first {{commutator}} DC {{electric motor}} capable of turning machinery {{was invented by}} the British scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made {{with the intention of}} commercial use was built by the American inventor Thomas Davenport, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. <b>No</b> <b>electricity</b> distribution had been developed at the time. Like Sturgeon's motor, there was no practical commercial market for these motors.|$|E
25|$|A Coulter counter is an {{appliance}} {{that can}} count cells {{as well as}} measure their volume. It {{is based on the}} fact that cells show great electrical resistance; in other words, they conduct almost <b>no</b> <b>electricity.</b> In a Coulter counter the cells, swimming in a solution that conducts electricity, are sucked one by one into a tiny gap. Flanking the gap are two electrodes that conduct electricity. When no cell is in the gap, electricity flows unabated, but when a cell is sucked into the gap the current is resisted. The Coulter counter counts the number of such events and also measures the current (and hence the resistance), which directly correlates to the volume of the cell trapped. A similar system is the CASY cell counting technology.|$|E
25|$|The only {{power plant}} in Gaza is not {{operational}} {{due to the lack}} of industrial fuel and spare parts. As of 1 January, power outages last 16 hours per day. Due to localised damage following the airstrikes, some electrical lines have been cut, causing some areas to suffer from power cuts lasting 24 hours. In addition, due to the damage caused by the air strikes to 15 electrical transformers, as many as 250,000 people in central and northern Gaza have <b>no</b> <b>electricity</b> supply during the entire day and night. On 1 January, a 5MW line from Egypt to Rafah was damaged, extending the power cuts to Rafah, which usually has a continuous supply. Fuel for heating and cooking are no longer available and most of the 240 gas stations in Gaza City have been closed.|$|E
50|$|Aru is a {{town and}} the seat of Aru Territory in the Ituri Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2004 its {{population}} {{was estimated to be}} 26,290. Aru has a small airport but <b>no</b> public <b>electricity</b> grid as of 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Aleuts {{were transported}} to Southeast Alaska and crowded into “duration villages.” Conditions were harsh {{as there was}} <b>no</b> plumbing, <b>electricity</b> or winter clothes. Camp food was poor and the water was tainted. Medical care was inadequate, and {{pneumonia}} and tuberculosis were rampant.|$|R
