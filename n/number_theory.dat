Previous D <b>numbers</b> <b>theory</b> provides a rule to combine multiple D numbers. However, the commutative law is not satisfied in the rule of combining multiple D numbers. In this paper, a modified method for multiple D numbers combination is proposed. The proposed method defines a new function for multiple D numbers combination which is mainly determined by the original value of D numbers. Then the proposed combination rule is applied to environmental impact assessment (EIA); our results show that the proposed method is efficient for multiple D numbers combination and it is useful when dealing with uncertainty and incompleteness...|$|R

5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve <b>number</b> <b>theory</b> problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic <b>number</b> <b>theory.</b> In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E

40|$|Dempster-Shafer {{theory is}} widely applied to {{uncertainty}} modelling and knowledge reasoning {{due to its}} ability of expressing uncertain information. However, some conditions, such as exclusiveness hypothesis and completeness constraint, limit its development and application to a large extend. To overcome these shortcomings in Dempster-Shafer theory and enhance its capability of representing uncertain information, a novel <b>theory</b> called D <b>numbers</b> <b>theory</b> is systematically proposed in this paper. Within the proposed theory, uncertain information is expressed by D numbers, reasoning and synthesization of information are implemented by D numbers combination rule. The proposed D <b>numbers</b> <b>theory</b> is an generalization of Dempster-Shafer theory, which inherits the advantage of Dempster-Shafer theory and strengthens its capability of uncertainty modelling.

5|$|In the 19th century, the Euclidean {{algorithm}} led to {{the development}} of new number systems, such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers. In 1815, Carl Gauss used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of Gaussian integers, although his work was first published in 1832. Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (published 1801), but only as a method for continued fractions. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of <b>number</b> <b>theory.</b> Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of <b>number</b> <b>theory,</b> such as unique factorization, would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied. Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on <b>number</b> <b>theory</b> were edited and extended by Richard Dedekind, who used Euclid's algorithm to study algebraic integers, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove Fermat's two-square theorem using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers. Dedekind also defined the concept of a Euclidean domain, a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described below). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind's more general theory of ideals.|$|E

Another issue is comparisons between Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) and CPIs. Likewise, the construction of sub-indexes for households, economic and social groups is investigated, {{in order to obtain}} specific inflation measurement instruments. The book provides evidence from the most updated databases.
