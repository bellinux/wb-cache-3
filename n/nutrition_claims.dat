40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} the {{changes of the}} nutrition labeling of packaged food in China {{two years after the}} promulgation of the Regulation for Food Nutrition Labeling, which encourages food manufacturers to identify nutrition labeling. Methods: Investigators copied out the nutrition information panel, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and nutrient function claim of packaged food in a supermarket with prepared questionnaire and finished normative judgment in 2008 and 2010. Results: 4693 and 5526 kinds of packaged food were investigated separately. Nutrition information panel, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and nutrient function claim were found on the food label of 27. 6 %, 13. 0 % and 1. 9 % of packaged food respectively in 2008, while 35. 1 %, 7. 7 % and 2. 3 % in 2010. The nutrition information panel which labeled energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium was 597 (43. 8 %) and 1661 (85. 9 %) in 2008 and 2010, only 134 (9. 8 %) and 985 (51. 0 %) nutrition information panel were totally normalized. <b>Nutrition</b> <b>claim</b> and nutrient function claim focused on vitamin, mineral and dietary fiber.

50|$|Embedded brands in {{television}} programs and movies {{is another way}} in which marketers can get their message across. This strategy can apply a power message on the child’s memory and choices without having them directly exposed to advertisements. A study conducted by Professor Charlie Lewis involved two groups of children to watch a clip from Home Alone. One group saw a clip where had a cup labelled Pepsi been spilt, the other group saw the same clip but with an unlabelled cup. After watching the clip, the children were then offered a can of fizzy, with a choice between Coca-Cola and Pepsi. The children {{who were exposed to}} the branded ad {{were significantly more likely to}} choose Pepsi. This proves the effect that of embedded marketing on children can directly influence and motivate there product choice. Food marketing is a prominent feature in children’s lives, with food advertising been predominantly for high energy and low nutritional content foods, having the ability to change the habits and preferences of children. In the United Kingdom, many Non-Governmental Organisations look at food and drink marketing to children. They focus on four key types of food marketing to children: television advertising, non-broadcast marketing in digital media, packaging which includes the use of characters and cartoons and <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and sponsorship.|$|E

A total of 1, 025 northern Italian consumers were surveyed. We estimate one binary logit model to investigate the use of nutrition labelling, and seven other ordinal regression models to analyse consumer interest towards <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and labelling. Consumers who use nutrition labelling have characteristics different from those who use <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims.</b> Consumers using nutrition labelling show a marked interest in food safety concerns, use experts as their source of information and have specific dietary habits.

A national UK food retailer: Tesco. Three hundred and eighty-two products randomly sampled from those available through the retailer's website. Of the products, 32 % (95 % CI 28, 37 %) carried either a health or nutrition claim; 15 % (95 % CI 11, 18 %) of products carried at least one health claim and 29 % (95 % CI 25, 34 %) carried at least one nutrition claim. When adjusted for product category, products carrying health claims tended to be lower in total fat and saturated fat than those that did not, but {{there was no significant difference}} in sugar or sodium levels. Products carrying health claims had slightly higher fibre levels than products without. Results were similar for comparisons between products that carry <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> and those that do not.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nutrition {{and health}} claims are {{permitted}} in foods marketed in the European Union under Regulation 1924 / 2006. Quality {{products such as}} traditional foods might benefit from this act, as it can highlight their nutritional richness. In this study the nutritional content of 33 traditional foods from the Black Sea Area Countries was evaluated against the thresholds of the Regulation for <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims.</b> RESULTS: Most of the foods were eligible to bear several <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims,</b> mostly related to their fat, sugar, fiber and sodium content. The average number of claims per traditional food was two, with a range between zero and nine. Overall, about 72 <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> were potentially relevant for the 33 traditional foods studied. Foods linked with the most claims were nuts and seeds. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of traditional foods under this standardized European scheme could be {{an efficient way to}} highlight their possible beneficial nutritional properties. The production and marketing of traditional foods could be of benefit to both the health of consumers and the economic viability of producers, especially small- and medium-size enterprises.

40|$|Health claims may {{contribute}} to better informed and healthier food choices and to improved industrial competitiveness by marketing foods that support healthier lifestyles in line with consumer preferences. With the more stringent European Union regulation of <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>claims,</b> insights into consumers' health-related goal patterns and their reactions towards such claims are needed to influence the content of lawful claims. This study investigated how consumers' explicit and implicit health-related motive orientations (HRMOs) together {{with the type of}} calcium-claim (<b>nutrition</b> <b>claim,</b> health claim and reduction of disease risk claim) influence perceived credibility and purchasing intention of calcium-enriched fruit juice. Data were collected in April 2006 through a consumer survey with 341 Belgian adults. The findings indicate that stronger implicit HRMOs (i. e., indirect benefits of calcium for personal health) are associated with higher perceived credibility, which is not (yet) translated into a higher purchasing intention. Consumers' explicit HRMOs, which refer to direct benefits or physiological functions of calcium in the body-as legally permitted in current calcium-claims in the EU-do not associate with reactions to the claims. Independently of consumers' HRMOs, the claim type significantly affects the perceived credibility and purchasing intention of the product.

40|$|Breakfast cereals {{substantially}} {{contribute to}} daily energy and nutrient intakes among children. In New Zealand, new regulations are being implemented to restrict nutrition and health claims to products that meet certain 'healthy' criteria. This {{study investigated the}} difference in nutritional quality, labelling and promotion between 'healthy' and 'less healthy' breakfast cereals, and between breakfast cereals intended for children compared with other breakfast cereals on the New Zealand market. The cross-sectional data collection involved taking pictures of the nutrition information panel (NIP) and front-of pack (FoP) for all breakfast cereals (n[*]=[*] 247) at two major supermarkets in Auckland in 2013. A nutrient profiling tool was used to classify products into 'healthy'/'less healthy'. In total 26 % of cereals {{did not meet the}} 'healthy' criteria. 'Less healthy' cereals were significantly higher in energy density, sugar and sodium content and lower in protein and fibre content compared with 'healthy' cereals. Significantly more <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> (75 %) and health claims (89 %) featured on 'healthy' compared with 'less healthy' cereals. On the 'less healthy' cereals, <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> (65 %) were more predominant than health claims (17 %). Of the 52 products displaying promotional characters, 48 % were for 'cereals for kids', and of those, 72 % featured on 'less healthy' cereals. In conclusion, most breakfast cereals met the 'healthy' criteria; however, 'cereals for kids' were 'less healthy' and displayed more promotional characters than other cereal categories. Policy recommendations include: food composition targets set or endorsed by government, strengthening and enforcing current regulations on health and <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims,</b> considering the application of nutrient profiling for <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> in addition to health claims, introducing an interpretative FoP labelling system and restricting the use of promotional characters on 'less healthy' breakfast cereals...|$|E

This is an initial response from the EFSA to a question concerning <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims.</b> The reactions in Spain regarding the <b>nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> for omega- 3 fatty acids proposed by the European Commission has been varied, mainly from entities in the food and drink industry and from associations in the sector.

Results. <b>Nutrition</b> <b>claims</b> reach at-risk people, but their consumption is limited by prices and household income constraints. Under assumptions of price and quality modifications, we show that claim regulations that are not too stringent seem to favor a healthy diet more than very demanding claim constraints. This induces a large quality gap between standard and claimed products. Conclusions. A smaller increase in the nutritional quality of the food can be more efficient for public health than a large improvement.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how consumers&#x 2019; thoughts about these claims and food products are affected by various types of food-related experiences. Material and Methods: The data collection comprised 30 individual interviews among Swedish consumers aged 25 to 64 years. Results: The results indicated that participants who expressed special concern for their own and their families&#x 2019; health were eager to find out the meaning of concepts and statements made. A lack of understanding and lack of credibility of concepts and expressions often caused suspicion of the product.
