5|$|Any future {{renovation}} to {{the stadium}} will involve replacing the old North Stand of the former National Stadium with a new one similar to the three existing stands of the <b>new</b> <b>Millennium</b> Stadium. This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the existing problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand.|$|E

5|$|Betts was one {{of several}} {{longtime}} editors to leave Vogue around the <b>new</b> <b>millennium.</b> A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.|$|E

The Park Grill group's proposal was {{twice as long as}} the other two but, technically, promised the Park District the lowest revenues. By the end of the year, O'Malley's team had been selected to run the restaurant, souvenir and concession stands, and a cafe in the <b>new</b> <b>Millennium</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|In Hungarian historiography, the Battle of Arcadiopolis is {{considered}} {{as the final}} chapter of the Hungarian invasions of Europe, a series of plundering raids both westward and southward {{since the end of}} the 9th century. Following that the new Grand Prince, Géza consolidated his authority and also supported Christian missionaries from Western Europe (experiencing the fate of the Bulgarian patriarchate after John Tzimiskes's campaign against Bulgaria, when lost its independence), which led to the Christianization of the Magyars and the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary by the beginning of the <b>new</b> <b>millennium.</b>|$|E

5|$|Metal {{remained}} {{popular in}} the 2000s, particularly in continental Europe.

Entries are organised alphabetically, and most descriptions of the political parties span a few paragraphs or pages. Space is allotted to each entry based on the individual party's history and influence; 34 pages are devoted to the Conservative Party, whereas only two paragraphs are given to the Captain Beany's <b>New</b> <b>Millennium</b> Bean Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} 4X games borrowed {{ideas from}} board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X computer games {{were published in}} the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the <b>new</b> <b>millennium,</b> several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a {{greatest}} hits record, the duo took a hiatus from the mid-1990s before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day (1999) and Room Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards {{until the beginning of}} the <b>new</b> <b>millennium.</b> In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again {{for the first time in}} 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and {{the first few years}} of the <b>new</b> <b>millennium</b> brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the <b>new</b> <b>millennium,</b> {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of Catalan nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for Catalan separatism. The politicalisation of the club drew criticism from several club members who accused Laporta of alienating Barcelona fans, both within and outside of Catalunya. By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, and in turn the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E

5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the <b>new</b> <b>millennium</b> in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Dave Kelly, who {{had been}} a member of the John Dummer Blues Band formed The Blues Band with ex-Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher, who {{continued}} to tour and record rhythm and blues into the <b>new</b> <b>millennium.</b> Roots music, including rhythm and blues, began to enjoy another resurgence of interest towards the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. Annual blues festivals were established, including The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival, held at Colne in Lancashire from 1989, which hosts both US and British R acts. In 1994 Jools Holland, former keyboard player with Squeeze and presenter of the highly influential TV show Later..., reshaped his backing band as Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and, as well as supporting him on the show, they embarked on a series of tours. After leaving the Rolling Stones in 1997 Bill Wyman formed the Rhythm Kings, which featured guitarists Peter Frampton and Albert Lee as well former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker, touring and producing a series of R based albums. By 2000 the fanzine Blues Matters! had managed to become a regular glossy magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Gerry Anderson {{supervised}} {{the production of}} a short computer-animated test film, Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons, to explore the possibility of updating a number of his 1960s Supermarionation series for a 21st-century audience. The working title was Captain Scarlet – The <b>New</b> <b>Millennium.</b> Produced in London by the Moving Picture Company, the film features Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop reprising the roles of Captains Scarlet and Blue. Made using a combination of Maya 3D computer graphics software and motion-capture technology, the plot commences a few years after the Mysterons end their hostilities against Earth, but the reappearance of Captain Black sets the stage for a revival of the war with Mars. Although the film has yet to receive a home video release, it was publicly screened at a Fanderson convention in 2000 and at a science lecture in 2001.|$|E

5000|$|The 1999 {{released}} album [...] "Resurreccion" [...] was a {{more mature}} work and a great experience for the band who recorded the album in Argentina. It sounds louder and treats topics like the human being and {{the world that we}} live in, a real resurrection for the <b>new</b> <b>millennia.</b> The number of fans of the band grew, and by 2001 La Trampa sold out in well-known performing centers like Teatro de Verano and Plaza Mateo.|$|R
5|$|Mired in this {{theoretical}} crisis, the Modern Benoni remained unpopular in the 1990s. Veselin Topalov was {{the only}} top-level player to play it regularly, and he too generally preferred the 2...e6 3.Nf3 c5 move order. At {{the beginning of the}} <b>new</b> <b>millennium,</b> the theoretician John Watson published a well-regarded survey of the opening that {{may have contributed to the}} opening's revival. Many of the ideas he recommended, such as 9...Qh4+ versus the Taimanov Attack and 9...Nh5 in the Modern Main Line, grew in popularity after its publication. The opening regained some more of its former respectability when Vladimir Kramnik, needing a win with Black against Peter Leko, played it in the second to last game of the 2004 World Championship. While he did achieve a winning position at one point, the game ended in a draw. Nevertheless, Étienne Bacrot, Boris Gelfand and Vassily Ivanchuk have all since used the Modern Benoni at the highest levels of competition, while Vugar Gashimov became the opening's most notable proponent. He was the strongest player willing to use the original 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 move order and defend Black's cause in both the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their {{relationship}} seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (Rosie Cavaliero) and she a man much younger than her (Hugh Dancy)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a stay-at-home dad for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she {{had a crush on}} Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom Adam was also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him {{to move out of the}} house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts things into perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the <b>new</b> <b>millennium</b> on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.|$|E
5|$|Vijay {{began the}} <b>new</b> <b>millennium</b> with {{critically}} and commercially successful {{films such as}} Kushi and Priyamanavale. The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. While Friends was commercially successful, the other two underperformed. His subsequent films that were released for the next year-and-a-half did not do well at the box office. The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player opposite Trisha in Dharani's Ghilli (2004), which {{went on to become}} the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year. It was also the first Tamil film to earn 500million (Indian rupees). His performance as a caring brother in the masala film Thirupachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007). The latter garnered him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor. Barring Vettaikaaran (2009), all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Thamizh Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career, to his 50th film, Sura (2010), were commercial failures.|$|E
