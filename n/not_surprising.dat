5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{then that}} Kaiser, Hunka, and Bianchini (1971) {{concluded}} that the affective symptoms of depression are less specific and appear to shift from loading on one dimension to another {{depending on the type}} of sample being studied.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the cure for {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E

5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{where there}} was an {{increasing}} interest in {{the remains of the}} city's pagan past, where scholars turned from reading Medieval Church Latin to Classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of St Augustine, the presence, in the Sistine Chapel of five pagan prophets is <b>not</b> <b>surprising.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that their players {{dominated}} the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs {{at a much}} higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were {{a large part of the}} success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} {{when proposing}} a disputation {{to have the}} theses printed by the university press and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the Ninety-five Theses have survived, but this is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as Luther was not famous {{and the importance of}} the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the Theses, only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the Theses on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the Theses to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all. Regardless, the Theses were well-known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} {{delegation}} to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter {{and leader of the}} Saint-Laurent Métis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-Métis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause—which was perhaps <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> in view of Riel's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed 4 June, and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July. Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite {{different from those of the}} settlers, and nothing was then resolved. Inspired by Riel, Honoré Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition, and Jackson on 28 July released a manifesto detailing grievances and the settler's objectives. A joint English-Métis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis André cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. Also, in response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel. Nevertheless, the work continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it. By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.|$|E
