500|$|In 2004, {{eighteen}} years after Hubbard's death, the Church claimed eight million followers worldwide. According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, {{this is an}} overestimate, counting as Scientologists people who had merely bought a book. The City University of New York's American Religious Identification Survey found that by 2009 only 25,000 Americans identified as Scientologists. Hubbard's presence still pervades Scientology. Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard, with a desk, chair and writing equipment, ready to be used. Lonnie D. Kliever notes that Hubbard was [...] "the only source of the religion, {{and he has no}} successor". Hubbard is referred to simply as [...] "Source" [...] within Scientology and the theological acceptability of any Scientology-related activity is determined by how closely it adheres to Hubbard's doctrines. Hubbard's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>signature</b> are official trademarks of the Religious Technology Center, established in 1982 to control and oversee the use of Hubbard's works and Scientology's trademarks and copyrights. The RTC is the central organization within Scientology's complex corporate hierarchy and has put much effort into re-checking the accuracy of all Scientology publications to [...] "ensur the availability of the pure unadulterated writings of Mr. Hubbard to the coming generations".|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} mummies themselves, {{a wealth of}} {{artifacts}} found at the site suggest that the people buried there were Maronites from the al-Hadath village, and that their death occurred circa 1283, which corresponds to {{the reign of the}} Mamluks and the presence of the Crusaders. Among the many examples of medieval pottery excavated, one pot attracts attention by its Arabic inscription: [...] "This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath.". Artistic and archaeological significance is manifested in the designs and motifs embroidered on textiles which are identical to designs found in the Syriac Rabbula Gospels, a 6th-century artistic masterpiece which belonged to the Maronite Patriarchate until the mid-15th century, but is now housed in Florence, Italy. A striking copy of two peacocks facing one another with a tree of life in-between remains vivid in color seven hundred years later. From the Grotto over twenty manuscripts were unearthed. One of which is in Syriac and is a Maronite hymnody, another is in Arabic and bears the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>signature</b> of George son of David, the Archdeacon of al-Hadath. Among the discovered items, several engraved wooden double-toothed combs, thin teeth on one side and coarse on the other, are identical to the combs used by Mamluk women in Egypt and are on display at the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo, Egypt. Many poles, arrows, and notches {{have been found to be}} identical with the Mamluk era arrows now on display at the Traditional Art Museum of Aleppo in Syria. An assortment of Crusader and Mamluk coins also invite the speculation that these mummies are of the 13th century.|$|E
