25|$|To conclude, the non-smooth {{approach}} {{changes the}} underlying mathematical structure if required {{and leads to}} a proper description of mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction. As {{a consequence of the}} changing mathematical structure, impacts can occur, and the time evolutions of the positions and the velocities can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> to be smooth anymore. As a consequence, additional impact equations and impact laws have to be defined. In order to handle the changing mathematical structure, the set-valued force laws are commonly written as inequality or inclusion problems. The evaluation of these inequalities/inclusions is commonly done by solving linear (or nonlinear) complementarity problems, by quadratic programming or by transforming the inequality/inclusion problems into projective equations which can be solved iteratively by Jacobi or Gauss–Seidel techniques.|$|E

Estimates of Earth's current species range from 10 to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented in a central database to date. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E

The changes themselves might not be controversial, but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is, unlike, say, in the United States." [...] In reply, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two-thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly, as the intensive discussions and the two-year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved. He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people, and that it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that the Constitution, drafted in 1965, would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time.

500|$|These {{comments}} were extremely dangerous, as Mickl {{did not know}} all his officers or their allegiances, and many officers and men had been court-martialled and shot for similar pronouncements that revealed the speaker {{did not believe in}} [...] "ultimate victory". Mickl recognised the difficulties he faced, with [...] "volunteers" [...] who were really conscripts, and the Croats' allegiance divided between the Ustaše regime and the Partisans. As a young officer in World War I, Mickl had commanded Croatian soldiers, and knew them to be brave fighters. In that war, Croats had served in a multi-ethnic army under Austrian officers, and they all spoke German well enough to understand and be understood. In contrast, his new command consisted of Croatian soldiers who hardly understood German, and whose patriotism could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed.</b> Mickl saw that instilling German discipline and standards was a second order of business, and that the main role of his officers was to [...] "awaken and maintain their will to fight". Despite an understaffed headquarters, he was fortunate to have Hauptmann der Reserve Bransch as the commander of the divisional reconnaissance battalion. Bransch had served with Mickl since Africa. Mickl decided that he needed a reliable, proven officer as his divisional chief of operations, so he arranged for Bransch to be promoted to Major, and appointed him to lead his operations staff. However, a few days later, Major im Generalstab Gerd Kobe arrived fresh from the Eastern Front. Kobe had served in the operations departments at both corps and army-level, and had experience in working for brave but difficult commanders.|$|E
500|$|Contrectatio meant [...] "handling" [...] and was {{established}} as the prohibited action associated with furtum {{before the end}} of the republic. Furtum had in the early and mid-Republic required the carrying away of a thing. This was widened and there are several examples from the classical Rome and later where it is even hard to find physical contact in any sense. Contrectatio extended to dealing with the thing as if the owner, and [...] "physical interference" [...] can be considered a more accurate term than just touching. The idea of furtum, and conrectatio in particular, broadened during the republic to complement the narrowly defined Lex Aquilia. This did, for example, include using a borrowed thing in a way which went beyond that agreed with the lender (furtum usus), such as borrowing a horse and riding it for longer than agreed. During the Republic, no distinction was made in language between furtum usus and furtum in general. Contrectio included what might be thought of as fraud: knowingly accepting a wrongful payment, or embezzlement, for example. The case of wrongful payment is problematic, because a mistaken payment still transferred ownership; it seems contradictory that the receiver was granted ownership and still liable for theft. To accept a thing as a pledge knowing that it did not belong to the pledgor was also furtum [...] not merely acting as an accomplice. Plautus, a playwright, suggests that failing to report a theft after the fact was furtum, but this should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed.</b> The development of contrectio as the preferred prohibited act accompanied that of the criminal law, the actio doli (for fraud) and the Aquilian actions.|$|E

500|$|Lord Hope {{disagreed}} with the principles and analogies relied upon by the majority. [...] Of the principle that [...] "where there is a wrong {{there must be a}} remedy", he said that the policy decision to protect witnesses from litigation had been taken some time ago, without anything being said to cast doubt on the policy choice. [...] He also asked how the rule could be altered to allow negligence claims but not defamation claims, since if there was a well-founded defamation claim barred by witness immunity then a wrong would have been done without remedy in that instance. He said that advocates and experts performed different functions and so it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that the fact that advocates' immunity had been removed without difficulty would mean that immunity could be removed from experts without any problems. [...] He was more impressed with the difficulties about where to draw the line if the claim was allowed to proceed than the argument {{that there would be a}} [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the availability of witnesses, wondering what the impact would be for experts involved in criminal proceedings or family cases involving children. He wondered whether a company director, owing a duty of care to the company, would face removal of the immunity if making an [...] "inexcusable error" [...] when giving evidence on the company's behalf. [...] Overall, he considered that the matter was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission. He furthermore noted that the decision in Watson remained binding in Scots law, in preference to the decision in Jones (since Jones only concerned the law of England and Wales), adding that the issue ought also to be considered by the Scottish Law Commission.|$|E
