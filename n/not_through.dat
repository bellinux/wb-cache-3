However, the mayor is appointed by the king and <b>not</b> <b>through</b> elections. In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael Babouk who became the first ever Mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district centre was founded.|$|E

5|$|Its two {{drivers are}} a 180mm paper woofer and a 35mm soft-domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, {{weighing}} 3.7g, is manufactured from a flat sheet of pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape <b>not</b> <b>through</b> moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together. Against the black finish of the cabinet, the white bass/mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic {{feature of the}} product.|$|E

His summer program graduates found roles in prestigious research positions in fields across the sciences. The Ross Program was acclaimed by mathematicians as highly influential.|$|E
5|$|The French PACS is not included, nor {{are some}} other legal {{relationships}} – for example, the Dutch civil partnership {{and some of the}} domestic partnerships in the United States.

5|$|There {{are also}} many {{cases where the}} remains of the fetus are found {{separate}} from the body of the mother, but expulsion was <b>not</b> <b>through</b> the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani {{intelligence}} sources {{stated that the}} U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and <b>not</b> <b>through</b> tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|E
5|$|In late February, ground sensors {{detected}} the 66th Regiment, 304th NVA Division preparing {{to mount an}} attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February the Combat Base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible North Vietnamese staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the North Vietnamese finally withdrew. NVA, however, was <b>not</b> <b>through</b> with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during the month of March.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and <b>not</b> <b>through</b> the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E
5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions <b>not</b> <b>through</b> science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, Maisky {{agreed to}} the sending of two {{commissions}} to Spain, to enumerate foreign volunteer forces, and to bring about their withdraw. It was estimated to cost £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, borne by member countries of the Committee. The Nationalists wished to prevent {{the fall of the}} favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom, and so were seen to accept the plan. With much bemoaning, the Republicans also accepted the plan. The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first, then withdrawals of 10,000 from each side after, which amounted to a rejection of the plan. Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby showing his contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee. Similarly, Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo-Italian agreement, <b>not</b> <b>through</b> the Committee.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death of former President Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made in {{the hearts and minds of}} people and <b>not</b> <b>through</b> legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture.|$|E

5|$|Żółkiewski's {{popularity}} waned in {{the latter}} years of his career. He was accused of not supporting Samuel Korecki {{during the battle of}} Sasowy Róg in 1616, of signing the Treaty of Jaruga (Busza) in 1617 which relinquished influence in some borderlands to Moldova and the Ottoman Empire; and of failing to stop the Tatars at the battle of Orynin in 1618. But in 1618 he finally received his coveted buława of the Grand Crown Hetman, and shortly afterwards the office of Grand Crown Chancellor. He was thus for a brief period the most powerful individual in the Commonwealth after the king, a position he reached <b>not</b> <b>through</b> wealth or family but by military achievement and reputation.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{despatched}} his lieutenant Baltasar Guerra {{to pacify}} the rebel Chiapanecas and Zoques, and the victorious conquistadores in turn demanded encomiendas. The general instability continued, but the Mazariegos family managed {{to establish a}} power base in the local colonial institutions. In 1535, the Mazariegos faction succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and <b>not</b> <b>through</b> a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists. At around the same time, the Audiencia de los Confines intervened, appointing judges to exert greater control over the allocation of encomiendas.|$|E
