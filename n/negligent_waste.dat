5000|$|Leroux {{first put}} forward {{his theory of}} circulus in 1834, {{as part of an}} attempt to explain the failure of a Fourierist phalanstery. In {{response}} to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: [...] "Madame, donnez-moi fumier" [...] (Madame, give me dung). Despite public ridicule, Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in Jersey {{after the fall of the}} Second Republic, he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus. However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile Victor Hugo. In the digression on the sewers of Paris in Les Misérables, Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is [...] "a misunderstanding" [...] ("Un égout est un malentendu"), a <b>negligent</b> <b>waste</b> ("coulage") of public wealth ("la richesse publique"),and that were the [...] "givens of a new social economy" [...] ("les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated. But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer Edwin Chadwick, who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing [...] "the circle and realising the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth".|$|E
50|$|In 1898, Parsons was {{appointed}} keeper of Gloucester's almshouse. Following {{the death of}} an inmate of the almshouse in December 1903, an investigation was launched into its conditions. Parsons was accused of <b>negligent</b> care, <b>wasting</b> supplies, serving food that had gone bad or was poorly cooked, and abusing inmates. Further, allegations of disorderly conduct were made against Parsons' wife, who served as matron of the house, and improper sexual relationships were said to have existed between inmates and members of Parsons' family. The investigation was eventually dropped, however, in 1905, the new mayor, George E. MacDonald, replaced Parsons with his brother, William E. McDonald.|$|R
6000|$|... "At Sinzheim?" [...] {{thinks his}} Royal Highness; and has spoken privily to the Page Keith. To glide {{out of their}} {{quarters}} there, in that <b>waste</b> <b>negligent</b> old Town (where post-horses can be had), in the gray of the summer's dawn? Across the Rhine to Speyer is but three hours riding; thence to Landau, into France, into--? Enough, Page Keith has undertaken to get horses, and the flight shall at last be. Husht, husht. To-morrow morning, before the sparrow wake, it is our determination to be upon the road! ...|$|R
40|$|One {{may feel}} choleric about the posture {{consistently}} {{taken by the}} United Nations since evidence began to emerge in late 2010 linking the cholera outbreak in Haiti to <b>negligent</b> organic <b>waste</b> management and disposal at a base {{being used by the}} UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti, which was hosting troops from Nepal, a country endemically affected by the disease. That posture has been translated into stone-wall tactics, an absence of transparency and inexplicable silences, refusals to acknowledge responsibility for the deaths and infections despite overwhelming evidence, and most important for our purposes, indefensible legal argumentation purportedly ruling out any duty to provide redress to the victims {{on the part of the}} UN. The real bone of contention in the case at hand seems to involve the extent of the UN’s third-party liability for acts of a private law nature, as well as the repercussions, if any, of the non-fulfilment of that liability on the jurisdictional immunity of the Organization in domestic courts...|$|R
