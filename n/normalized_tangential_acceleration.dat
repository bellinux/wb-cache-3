40|$|Running agility is {{required}} for many sports and other physical tasks that demand rapid changes in body direction. Quantifying agility skill remains a challenge because measuring rapid changes of direction and quantifying agility skill from those measurements are difficult to do in ways that replicate real task/game play situations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to define and to measure agility performance for a (five-cone) agility drill used within a military obstacle course using data harvested from two foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Thirty-two recreational athletes ran an agility drill while wearing two IMUs secured to the tops of their athletic shoes. The recorded acceleration and angular rates yield estimates of the trajectories, velocities and accelerations of both feet as well as an estimate of the horizontal velocity of the body mass center. Four agility performance metrics were proposed and studied including: 1) agility drill time, 2) horizontal body speed, 3) foot trajectory turning radius, and 4) <b>tangential</b> body <b>acceleration.</b> Additionally, the average horizontal ground reaction during each footfall was estimated. We hypothesized that shorter agility drill performance time would be observed with small turning radii and large <b>tangential</b> <b>acceleration</b> ranges and body speeds. Kruskal-Wallis and mean rank post-hoc statistical analyses revealed that shorter agility drill performance times were observed with smaller turning radii and larger <b>tangential</b> <b>acceleration</b> ranges and body speeds, as hypothesized. Moreover, measurements revealed the strategies that distinguish high versus low performers. Relative to low performers, high performers used sharper turns, larger changes in body speed (larger <b>tangential</b> <b>acceleration</b> ranges), and shorter duration footfalls that generated larger horizontal ground reactions during the turn phases. Overall, this study advances the use of foot-mounted IMUs to quantify agility performance in contextually-relevant settings (e. g., field of play, training facilities, obstacle courses, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel pair of noncircular gear profiles for minimising shaft accelerations of the driven gear. The proposed profiles are developed {{based on an}} "exponential" function that is valid {{for a portion of}} gear rotation, and this function is extended to the remaining parts of the rotation of both gears. The exact shapes of the centrodes of the toothed bodies, which depend on a "smoothness" parameter, b, constitute a trade-off between the maximum shaft acceleration and the smoothness of the centrodes, so as to control the maximum tooth dynamic forces and stresses. A comparison between the derived noncircular gears and a gear pair that provides a sinusoidal variation of the angular velocity is presented. Results indicate that, for two-lobule gears, the maximum and minimum values of the polar radii, the velocity at the contact point, and the gear ratio are the same for both profiles. In contrast, there are significant differences in the angular acceleration of the driven gear, the <b>tangential</b> <b>acceleration</b> at the contact point, and the pressure angle, especially in the first one.
