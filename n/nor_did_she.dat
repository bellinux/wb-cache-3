5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She {{was never able to}} walk, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
5|$|To the {{surprise}} of Lacrosse and his officers, Indefatigable did not retreat from the ship of the line, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> pass the ship of the line at long-range to leeward as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of Droits de l'Homme and opened a raking fire. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy volley of musket fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of Droits de l'Homme and rake her bow, to which Lacrosse responded by attempting to ram Indefatigable. Neither manoeuvre was successful, as Droits de l'Homme raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean.|$|E

5|$|HMS Foresight {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet upon completion. Unlike her sister ships, she {{does not appear to have}} been attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Foresight was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of Dakar. The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1941 and Arctic convoys during 1942. Later that year, Foresight participated in Operation Pedestal, another convoy to Malta. She was torpedoed by an Italian aircraft on 12 August and had to be scuttled the next day.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{observed}} the routine flights of SU-24 aircraft {{and had no}} interaction while both operated in international waters. Ross continued on her mission after observing the aircraft return to base. At no time did Ross act aggressively <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> deviate from her planned operations. The conduct of her crew has been {{and continues to be}} professional.|$|E
25|$|She was {{a staunch}} defender of women's rights {{in general and}} refused to allow jokes at women's expense to be told in her company. Those who {{questioned}} the capabilities or equality of women earned her wrath, as Brigham Young discovered when the First Lady grilled him about the Mormons' practice of polygamy and its negative effect on women. Yet while she believed in the abilities of women, she was not sure that women should work <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> publicly support women's suffrage although she refused to sign an anti-suffrage petition—an obvious omission to many.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB {{conducted}} a full {{investigation of the}} accident. It found that although the aircraft had encountered a crosswind during landing, the conditions were well within the safe capabilities of the aircraft. However, {{it was discovered that}} the first officer did not properly line up the plane before touchdown, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> slow the plane adequately before touchdown, so that the plane came down excessively hard. As the plane came down, due to the crosswind, the right wing suddenly lowered approximately six degrees. This was beyond the design capabilities for the right main landing gear, and it snapped as a result. The NTSB also cited the captain for failing to check the work of the first officer.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, a {{previously}} unknown crypt was discovered when a tourist on a self-guided tour through the cemetery {{fell through the}} ground into {{what appeared to be}} a stairway leading to a crypt. The stairway had been covered with a piece of slate which eventually gave way due to advanced age. (The tourist was not hurt, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come into contact with any human remains.) The crypt is reported to be 8 by 12 feet and is structurally intact. It is possibly the resting place of Jonathan Armitage, a Boston selectman from 1732 to 1733. Officials from the City of Boston announced in May, 2011 a $300,000 refurbishment project designed to repair and restore the historic site, including widening paths in the cemetery and providing new observation sites. $125,000 will be provided by the Freedom Trail Foundation and the city will pay the rest.|$|E

500|$|Shepard {{was devoted}} to his {{children}}. Frequently Julie, Laura and Alice were the only astronauts' children at NASA events. He taught them to ski and took them skiing in Colorado. He once rented a small plane to fly them and their friends from Texas to a summer camp in Maine. Later, he doted on his six grandchildren as well. After Apollo 14 he began {{to spend more time}} with Louise, and started taking her with him on trips to the Paris Air Show every other year, and to Asia. Louise heard rumors of his affairs. The publication of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book The Right Stuff made them public knowledge, but she never confronted him about it, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> [...] ever contemplate leaving him.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "She's Madonna" [...] {{was shot in}} Los Angeles during a break from Williams' Close Encounters Tour, and {{features}} him as a professional drag queen in full regalia, as well as performing with drag queens in a nightclub, {{dressed in a white}} jacket. His hairstyle and the wig was compared to those of Lily Allen and Uma Thurman's wig in the film Pulp Fiction (1994). Alexis Arquette appeared as one of the drag queens, along with RuPaul's Drag Race contestant Tammie Brown. The video was directed by Johan Renck, who had previously directed the music videos for Madonna's [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] in 1999 and [...] "Hung Up" [...] in 2005. Despite media speculation, Williams did not imitate Madonna in the video, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> appear in it. Renck explained that the main inspiration behind the video was to portray the paranoia one faces onstage.|$|E
500|$|While Wollstonecraft's {{arguments}} in The Wrongs of Woman may appear commonplace {{in light of}} modern feminism, they were [...] "breathtakingly audacious" [...] during the late eighteenth century: [...] "Wollstonecraft's final novel made explosively plain what the Rights of Woman had only partially intimated: that women's entitlements — as citizens, mothers, and sexual beings — are incompatible with a patriarchal marriage system." [...] However, while The Wrongs of Woman is now read as the progenitor of many feminist texts and the inspiration for many feminist arguments and rhetorical styles (e.g., the personal confession), Wollstonecraft herself {{was not part of}} a feminist movement <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> ever argue for one. Although The Wrongs of Woman presents [...] "woman" [...] as [...] "wronged", neither Wollstonecraft nor any other British woman who highlighted the inequalities suffered by women at the time (such as Mary Hays or Mary Robinson) ever put forth a collective solution. As part of the Enlightenment, they were dedicated to individualistic solutions.|$|E

50|$|However, Eisler {{does not}} use the term “patriarchy.” <b>Nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> use “matriarchy” to {{describe}} a more gender-balanced society, noting that rule by fathers (partriarchy) and rule by mothers (matriarchy) are two sides of a dominator coin, and proposing that the real alternative is a partnership system or gylany.|$|R
50|$|She {{was brought}} into British service as HMS Aventurier. She appears to have had an {{unremarkable}} career, appearing only once in the Naval Chronicle, when she {{was reported to have}} arrived at Plymouth on 27 April 1800, having escorted a convoy. <b>Nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> appear in the London Gazette.|$|R
500|$|Academic archaeologists criticised Jones' work at Mucking {{as one of}} {{the prime}} {{examples}} of [...] "excavation without publication". They argued that since the primary aim of any archaeological excavation is [...] "preservation by record", failing to publish the results amounted to destroying the archaeology without purpose, and that it was irresponsible to excavate large areas without the means to properly process and disseminate the results. Indeed, in thirteen years of continuous excavation at Mucking, Jones only published a single, short paper on the results of her trial excavations in 1965. When the project was completed in 1978, despite the huge volume of material that had been recovered, very little had been analysed and none had been published. Ultimately, the final publication of Mucking was undertaken by others (English Heritage and the Cambridge Archaeological Unit), the first volume of which did not appear until 2015, fourteen years after Jones' death. Jones argued that as the site was being constantly destroyed by the gravel extraction on the site, she could not afford to take time out of the year for post-excavation, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> have the funding to complete it.|$|E
500|$|Though 15 delegates of her {{parliament}} (16%) were women, few {{advances in}} women's rights were made during Chamoro's administration. Chamorro {{was not a}} feminist, since her beliefs prevented her from advocating many {{of the goals of}} traditional feminism. She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into prostitution and crime. According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into [...] "street professions", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution. In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central ( [...] , CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan. She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women's participation in political life, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> appoint women to governmental positions.|$|E
