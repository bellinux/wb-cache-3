5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war.

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu wrote the {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), which made him well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the most}} performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth <b>New</b> <b>Culture</b> Movement.|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} in {{the southern}} portion of the Florida peninsula dates to 15,000years ago. Before European colonization, the region was dominated by the native Calusa and Tequesta tribes. With Spanish colonization, both tribes declined gradually during the following two centuries. The Seminole formed from mostly Creek {{people who had been}} warring to the North; they assimilated other peoples and created a <b>new</b> <b>culture.</b> After being forced from northern Florida into the Everglades during the Seminole Wars of the early 19th century, they adapted to the region and were able to resist removal by the United States Army.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A <b>new</b> <b>culture</b> of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|While in {{the desert}} Moses defends three young girls from brigands, {{only to find out}} their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, Jethro. After assimilating this <b>new</b> <b>culture,</b> Moses becomes a {{shepherd}} and marries Tzipporah. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a burning bush through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|Whittle {{was born}} in Peckham, before {{studying}} at the University of Kent. He worked in journalism, before founding the <b>New</b> <b>Culture</b> Forum think-tank in 2006. He became UKIP's cultural spokesperson in 2013 and stood for Eltham at the 2015 general election, receiving 15% of the vote. Whittle became the first the openly-LGBT candidate selected by any party as a Mayor of London candidate. Whittle confirmed his support the UK's exit from the European Union, stating that this would not damage London's financial industries. He pledged to work to ensure that workers can afford to live in London, and opposes further expansion of Heathrow Airport.|$|E

Starting from c. 950 BC, <b>new</b> regional <b>cultures</b> such as the Este culture, Latial culture, and the Villanovan culture appeared. Although these <b>new</b> <b>cultures</b> share many similarities with the preceding Proto-Villanovan culture, especially funerary customs, they also show innovations.|$|R
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and <b>new</b> <b>culture</b> techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{probably}} {{arrived in}} Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority {{emerged in the}} 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Oghaminscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now {{generally considered to be}} of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times. The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a <b>new</b> <b>culture</b> and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A <b>new</b> <b>culture</b> of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
