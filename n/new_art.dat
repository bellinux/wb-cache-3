5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with <b>new</b> <b>art</b> to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{the castle}} was sold for around £2 {{million to the}} Hay Castle Trust, who {{intended}} {{to turn it into}} an arts and education centre. The firm of Rick Mather Architects were taken on in 2015 to manage the work at a projected cost of £4.35 million, to include a <b>new</b> <b>art</b> gallery and a viewing point {{at the top of the}} keep. A grant of £528,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 supported initial planning, and further grants were given by the Country Houses Foundation and the Headley Trust.|$|E

5|$|The first {{railroad}} station in Erie {{was established in}} 1851 but was replaced with the Romanesque Revival-style Union Depot in 1866. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions by competing railroad companies which started {{not long after the}} establishment of Erie's first railroads, Union Depot became jointly owned and operated by the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads. To meet the changing needs of the rapidly growing city, planners designed a more modern structure to replace the original depot. The <b>new</b> <b>Art</b> Deco Union Station, dedicated on December3, 1927, was the first {{railroad station}} of that style in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} three {{cultural events}} {{associated with the}} opening exhibitions of <b>New</b> Zealand’s National <b>Art</b> Gallery in 1936 and the centennial celebrations of 1940 : the Loan Exhibition of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Art,</b> 1936; the National Centennial Exhibition of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Art</b> curated by Alexander Hare McLintock, 1940 - 1 and Eric Hall McCormick’s publication Letters and <b>Art</b> in <b>New</b> Zealand (1940) to evaluate how <b>New</b> Zealand <b>art</b> was put {{to use in the}} construction of a national history of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>art.</b> In the case of McLintock’s exhibition and McCormick’s text, the employment of works from library and museum collections importantly ‘recovered’ more ‘historical’ works for <b>New</b> Zealand’s <b>art</b> history. But they also attempted to identify a modern element within <b>New</b> Zealand <b>art,</b> or ‘an art truly national’. Taken together, these exhibitions and associated publications provided the first attempts at a critical evaluation of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>art</b> and are consequently foundational documents for the writing of <b>New</b> Zealand’s <b>art</b> history...|$|R
5|$|The longest {{surviving}} {{member of}} the Scottish Colourists, Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the <b>New</b> <b>Art</b> Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the <b>new</b> <b>art</b> was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|While Multimedia Intelligence Transfer {{developed}} most of {{the games}} in the series, Enterbrain and Index Corporation also developed one game each. The music {{for the first two}} games was composed by Tomoyuki Hamada, who made use of both orchestral music and rock. Yuji Himukai, known for his work on the Etrian Odyssey series, worked as character designer and illustrator on the 2011 game, creating <b>new</b> <b>art</b> for returning characters. The series received a wide range of reviews, from negative to positive. Reviewers enjoyed the demon fusion, while the music and visuals were criticized.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{referred}} to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: <b>new</b> <b>Art</b> Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof {{was added to the}} North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.|$|E
5|$|With {{the obvious}} {{exception}} of Brancaccio, all the singers in the concerto were female sopranos. Although the music {{written for the}} concerto focused on high voices, {{there is no evidence}} that the ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. This fact is surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a <b>new</b> <b>art</b> form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi's Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita's father's court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.|$|E
5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would be}} for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the <b>new</b> <b>art</b> took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 to 1914 Jolin {{started to}} paint {{in his own}} naïve {{interpretation}} of Expressionism. By {{the end of the}} 1910s his works became more expressed and the shapes more plastic, but in 1916, Jolin's paintings were still inspired by the years he spent in France. That spring, members of the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artists Association) and their young pupils, were invited to present the new style, Expressionism, to the Swedish audience as exhibition number two (number one being Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors and Carl Larsson) at the <b>new</b> <b>art</b> venue, the Liljevalchs konsthall, in Djurgården. Participating in the second exhibition were a number of noted Swedish artists at that time, including Leander Engström, Isaac Grünewald, Gösta Sandels, Birger Simonsson and Jolin who exhibited thirteen paintings.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive <b>new</b> <b>art</b> form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E

A drama CD titled 2035 was released on December 18, 2002, also by Scitron.

5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding {{a gun to his}} own head, was replaced in the English edition with <b>new</b> <b>art</b> of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary English-speaking audience of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E
