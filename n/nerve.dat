5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{the lateral}} pectoral <b>nerve</b> innervates the axillary arch, although instances {{have been found}} where the intercostobrachial <b>nerve,</b> the medial pectoral <b>nerve</b> and the thoracodorsal <b>nerve</b> provide the nervous supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} <b>nerve</b> is one {{of twelve}} cranial nerves found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the <b>nerve</b> or <b>nerve</b> pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the <b>nerve</b> have been explored through studies of the <b>nerve</b> in rodents and reptiles. The <b>nerve</b> is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate <b>nerve</b> over the course of evolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens <b>nerve</b> (sixth <b>nerve)</b> is involved. This <b>nerve</b> supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth <b>nerve</b> palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor <b>nerve</b> and trochlear <b>nerve</b> (third and fourth <b>nerve</b> palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial <b>nerve</b> (seventh cranial <b>nerve)</b> is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

5|$|A pudendal <b>nerve</b> block, {{also known}} as a saddle <b>nerve</b> block, is a local {{anesthesia}} technique used in a obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor. In this procedure, an anesthetic agent such as lidocaine is injected through the inner wall of the vagina about the pudendal <b>nerve.</b>|$|E
50|$|During development, semaphorins {{and their}} receptors may be {{involved}} in the sorting of pools of motor neurons and the modulation of pathfinding for afferent and efferent axons from and to these pools. For instance, Sema3a repels axons from the dorsal root ganglia, facial <b>nerves,</b> vagal <b>nerves,</b> olfactory-sensory, cortical <b>nerves,</b> hippocampal <b>nerves</b> and cerebellar <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} spinal cord, {{there are also}} {{peripheral}} <b>nerves</b> of the PNS that synapse through intermediaries or ganglia directly on the CNS. These 12 <b>nerves</b> exist {{in the head and}} neck region and are called cranial <b>nerves.</b> Cranial <b>nerves</b> bring information to the CNS to and from the face, as well as to certain muscles (such as the trapezius muscle, which is innervated by accessory <b>nerves</b> as well as certain cervical spinal <b>nerves).</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the nervous}} system, Rhazes stated that <b>nerves</b> had motor or sensory functions, {{describing}} 7 cranial and 31 spinal cord <b>nerves.</b> He assigned a numerical {{order to the}} cranial <b>nerves</b> from the optic to the hypoglossal <b>nerves.</b> He classified the spinal <b>nerves</b> into 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 3 sacral, and 3 coccygeal <b>nerves.</b> He used this to link clinical signs of injury to the corresponding location of lesions in the nervous system.|$|R
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory <b>nerve</b> continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory <b>nerve</b> crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the <b>nerve</b> pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory <b>nerve.</b> As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory <b>nerve</b> that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory <b>nerve</b> to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory <b>nerve</b> contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's <b>nerve</b> cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one <b>nerve</b> cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in <b>nerve</b> cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that <b>nerve</b> transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the <b>nerve</b> cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E
40|$|We {{question}} {{the assumption that}} the common complaint of <b>nerves</b> in small Newfoundland fishing villages is a legacy of the late 19 th century syndrome called weak <b>nerves</b> or neurasthenia, and instead trace the development of a Western medical science of <b>nerves</b> from the early 1700 s to the present. Native descriptions of the physical, especially tonic, nature of <b>nerves</b> and of the moral strength needed to fight <b>nerves</b> are correlated with 18 th century medical notions. Less resemblance exists between Newfoundland <b>nerves</b> and concepts of neurasthenia in the late 19 th century.

5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic <b>nerve</b> (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic <b>nerve</b> (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor <b>nerve</b> (III), trochlear <b>nerve</b> (IV) and abducens <b>nerve</b> (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E

A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal <b>nerve</b> is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the <b>nerve</b> from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} <b>nerve</b> {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the <b>nerve</b> was severed. Injury to the <b>nerve</b> can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus.

Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, <b>nerve</b> end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
