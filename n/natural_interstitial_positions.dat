In particular, the potential can reproduce the strong interaction with self interstitial atoms characteristic of Fe-Cr alloys. The results, {{when compared to the}} case of pure Fe, show that the presence of Cr does not significantly influence either the ballistic phase of the cascade, or the primary damage state, in terms of number of surviving defects or clustered fraction. However, the fraction of Cr atoms in <b>interstitial</b> <b>position</b> greatly exceeds the alloy concentration, in agreement with some experimental indications, and this feature is expected to influence the long-term evolution of radiation damage in the alloy.

The larger {{radius of the}} dopant ion, compared to the Li+, may cause an expansion of the lattice parameter in the Nb 5 +-doped lithium silicate nanomaterials.
