5|$|When {{the issue}} of secession reached a crisis, Cleburne sided with the Southern states. His choice was not due to any love of slavery, which he claimed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about, but out of affection for the Southern people who had adopted {{him as one of}} their own. As the crisis mounted, Cleburne joined the local militia company (the Yell Rifles) as a private soldier. He was soon elected captain. He led the company in the seizure of the U.S. Arsenal in Little Rock in January 1861. When Arkansas left the Union, the Yell Rifles became part of the 1st Arkansas Infantry, later {{designated}} the 15th Arkansas, of which he was elected Colonel. He was promoted to brigadier general on March 4, 1862.|$|E

His obsession with hunting Rhaknam for revenge leads him to search the skies on his small fishing airship, Little Jack. He travels with Vyse and the others {{for part of the}} game, and pretends <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about them, but he shows up to save them quite a few times. He use a mechanical right arm as a weapon during battle.|$|E
25|$|Esperanto {{has some}} slang {{in the sense}} of in-group talk as well. Some of this is borrowed; for example, fajfi priio (to whistle about something) means <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about it, as in German. Other {{expressions}} deriving from Esperanto history or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A volapukaĵo, for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years and was replaced by it.|$|E

Mary Eunice tells the patients to be a creative as she improvises and decorates the tree with their belongings – dentures and hair clippings. In the laboratory, Frank (Fredric Lehne) prays over Grace's (Lizzie Brocheré) body and tells Dr. Arden (James Cromwell) they should report the recent kitchen events to the police. Arden asks if {{he wants them to}} know Frank killed Grace, who was unarmed, but Frank seems <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
500|$|However, reviews {{were not}} uniformly positive. Tim Teeman posed the {{question}} in The Times: [...] "I know she's a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night's Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He noted that Jordan's script worked best as Dot remembered Ethel, but assessed that the episode was overly indulgent, and did not reveal anything [...] "substantially new" [...] about Dot. As with Banks-Smith's review, Teeman felt that the episode was incompatible with Dot's former characterisation, suggesting that her Christian faith ought to have tempered her decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for Jim. He felt that overall, the episode was somewhat dull and boring, describing Dot as an EastEnders [...] "jewel" [...] who should be cherished, not turned into a [...] "drag act".|$|E
500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E

500|$|Peckham {{often was}} in {{conflict}} with his subordinate bishops, mainly because of his efforts to reform them, but Peckham's own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to the problem. He once wrote to Roger de Meyland, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield [...] "These things need your attention, but you have been absent so long that you seem <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b> We therefore order you, on receipt of this letter, {{to take up residence}} in your diocese, so that—even if you are not competent to redress spiritual evils—you may at least minister to the temporal needs of the poor." [...] The historian Richard Southern says that Peckham's disputes with his suffragan bishops were [...] "conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill-will", which probably owed something to a [...] "petulant strain in Peckham's character". Peckham's conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a Franciscan, but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs. These strains between the archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority, as well as Edward's great need for income.|$|E
500|$|Much of [...] "Media Blitz" [...] {{revolves}} around the backstory of Ben Wyatt, which {{was introduced in the}} second season episode [...] "The Master Plan", involving his attempts to rebuild his political career after a humiliating public spectacle as a teen mayor. This was originally a concept the Parks and Recreation creators considered for Leslie Knope's background, but they ultimately abandoned the idea. [...] "Media Blitz" [...] marked the end of a plotline between April and Andy that began with the second-season finale, [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", when Ann kissed Andy just as April had agreed to start dating him. April had been angry with Andy ever since, and Andy had been desperately trying to win her back, culminating with the events in [...] "Media Blitz". Schur called it a [...] "key moment" [...] for April and Andy, and said, [...] "It's almost like Andy’s a Knight of the Round Table, and he’s got a lot of different obstacles that he’s got to overcome in order to win the love of a fair maiden." [...] The episode also continued a development of Ron Swanson's character as more of a father figure to his employees, particularly Andy and April, even though Ron himself outwardly claims <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about affairs. This began in the episode [...] "Flu Season", where Ron offered advice to Andy about winning April back, and continued in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] with Ron giving April advice that ultimately led her to take Andy back.|$|E
500|$|After her {{break up}} with Jay, Abi becomes a much nastier and bitter person. She begins a {{relationship}} with Ben (now played by Harry Reid), which is discovered by Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) who informs Max of the relationship. [...] Max demands that Abi does not see Ben anymore, which Abi refuses to do. Abi later discovers that Max used Ben to sign over part of Phil's businesses to him. In February 2015, Abi is accused by Max of killing Lucy. Abi did not kill Lucy, but it is revealed that on the night Lucy died, Abi had a confrontation with Lucy about her affair with Max, which resulted in Abi slapping Lucy. After Max tells her that Tanya would like her to move to Devon with her, Abi refuses and instead moves in with Ben and his family. After she moves in, Ben reveals {{to her that he}} might still be gay and is worried he will never get over his homosexuality but Abi assures him that they will make things work. She continuously mocks Jay and accuses him of being jealous of her relationship with Ben. Jay tries to make Abi see that Ben is not interested in her, but she pretends <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about what Jay says. Abi discovers a letter from Sharon's birth mother and Sharon says that she intends on meeting her birth father after discovering that her mother has died. When Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) arrives in Walford, Abi suspects Ben of cheating on her with Paul. She and Ben have sex, so Ben can convince her he is not gay. Following Ben's arrest for Lucy's murder, Abi tells Phil that Max assaulted Lucy to get Ben off. Despite being innocent, Max turns himself in and is formally charged while Ben is released. Stacey visits Max, who tells her that he thinks Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, who attacks Stacey, blaming her for her parents' split and Bradley's death, and later vents to Carol that she does not think Max cares about her. Carol visits Max in prison, where he informs her that the reason he thinks Abi killed Lucy is because she attacked and beat her {{on the night of the}} murder. After confronting Abi on this, Carol agrees that she has been out of control lately and advises her to call Tanya for moral support. During the phone call, Abi finds out that not only is Oscar ill, but Cora had apparently not stayed with Tanya at her house as she had earlier said. Abi, Carol and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) find Cora living rough and bring her home. She reveals she saw Max and Abi cleaning the car lot after Lucy was killed, forcing Abi to admit that Max and Lucy had argued there and she was helping Max clean Lucy's blood. Abi then gives a statement to the police. Max is later found guilty of the murder.|$|E

Kitty is invited in. She fits {{effortlessly}} and confidently into this post-war world of domestication, {{she seems to have}} it all. She notices Laura's amateur efforts at making a cake, just what Laura was dreading. Laura recognises her inability to fit into this domestic world, but also her inability <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> -she is trapped between two worlds. She also recognises, however, that Kitty does not have the perfect world her confidence implies. For example, Kitty has remained barren despite her desire to have children. On the other hand, the one thing Laura seems to be excelling at in the domestic sphere is producing progeny.|$|E
2500|$|In Games Workshop's {{tabletop}} game [...] "The Horus Heresy" [...] the Emperor's Children Space Marine legion {{is described}} as having a gene-seed defect that results in an [...] "occasional incidence of albinism, and a shift in iris colour to violet in some recruits." [...] The Emperor's Children are initially depicted as being obsessed with achieving personal perfection in all ways, though they seemed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about this defect.

30|$|One {{of the big}} {{advantage}} of RDBMS is that they keep the data relational, normalized and enforce the foreign Keys for the data consistency.

2500|$|Noddings {{describes}} wrong {{actions in}} terms of [...] "a diminishment of the ethical ideal" [...] and [...] "evil". A person's ethical ideal is diminished when she either chooses or is forced {{to act in a}} way that rejects her internal call to care. In effect, her image of the best person it is possible for her to be is altered in a way that lowers her ideal. According to Noddings, people and organizations can deliberately or carelessly contribute to the diminishment of other's ethical ideals. They may do this by teaching people <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> or by placing them in conditions that prevent them from being able to care (1984, 116-119). A person is evil if, in spite of her ability to do otherwise, she either fails to personally care for someone, or prevents others from caring. Noddings writes, [...] " [...] one intentionally rejects the impulse to care and deliberately turns her back on the ethical, she is evil, and this evil cannot be redeemed" [...] (1984, 115).|$|E
2500|$|The Soviets {{took him}} to the Siberian town of Chita. He lived in a sanatorium, then later in Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, where he was well treated and allowed to keep some of his servants. As a {{prisoner}} in a spa in Khabarovsk, Puyi spent his days praying to the Buddha, expected the prisoners to treat him as an emperor and slapped the faces of his servants when they displeased him. By listening to Chinese language broadcasts on Soviet radio, Puyi was aware of the civil war in China, but seemed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b> The Soviet government repeatedly refused requests from the Republic of China to extradite Puyi; he had been indicted on charges of high treason by the Kuomintang government, and the Soviet refusal to extradite him almost certainly saved his life, as Chiang Kai-shek had often spoken of his desire to have Puyi shot. Puyi's cousin Eastern Jewel was captured by the Kuomintang and publicly executed in Beijing in 1948 after she was convicted of high treason. Not wishing to return to China, Puyi wrote to Joseph Stalin several times asking if he might be granted asylum in the Soviet Union, and that he be given one of the former tsarist palaces to live out his days.|$|E
