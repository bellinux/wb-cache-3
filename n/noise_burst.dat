40|$|In {{adaptive}} filtering, undetected <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> often {{disturb the}} adaptation and {{may lead to}} instabilities and divergence of the adaptive filter. The sensitivity against <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> increases with the convergence speed of the adaptive filter and limits the performance of signal processing methods where fast convergence is required. Typical applications which are sensitive against <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> are adaptive beamforming for audio signal acquisition or acoustic echo cancellation, where <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> are frequent due to undetected double-talk. In this paper, we apply double-talk resistant adaptive filtering [2] using a non-linear optimization criterion to adaptive beamforming in the discrete Fourier transform domain for bin-wise adaptation controls. We show the efficiency of double-talk resilient adaptive filtering for a generalized sidelobe canceller for speech and audio signal acquisition. The improved robustness leads to faster convergence, to higher noise-reduction, and to a better output signal quality in turn...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze data {{produced}} by the kilometer-scale gravitational wave detectors that will begin operation early next century, one needs to develop robust statistical tools capable of extracting weak signals from the detector noise. This noise will likely have non-stationary and non-Gaussian components. To facilitate the construction of robust detection techniques, I present a simple two-component noise model that consists of a background of Gaussian noise as well as stochastic <b>noise</b> <b>bursts.</b> The optimal detection statistic obtained for such a noise model incorporates a natural veto which suppresses spurious events that would be caused by the <b>noise</b> <b>bursts.</b> When two detectors are present, I show that the optimal statistic for the non-Gaussian noise model can be approximated by a simple coincidence detection strategy. For simulated detector <b>noise</b> containing <b>noise</b> <b>bursts,</b> I compare the operating characteristics of (i) a locally optimal detection statistic (which has nearly-optimal behavior for small signal amplitudes) for the non-Gaussian noise model, (ii) a standard coincidence-style detection strategy, and (iii) the optimal statistic for Gaussian noise.

The sources of actual noise may be not only a con-tinuous noise but also a <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> and a mixture of them.

RSF focuses on modulation spectrum and extracts speech compo-nents with FIR filtering. DRA normalizes maximum amplitudes of cepstrum. The compensation for <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> influences is performed by <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> skipping algorithm. It skips <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> periods and links speeches before and after those periods.

A comparison between simulations and experimental data indicated that, in principle, all mechanisms lead to increased spectral loudness summation for short <b>noise</b> <b>bursts,</b> but bandwidth-dependent integration may be the most realistic approach.

40|$|The {{perception}} of modulation of a tone {{interrupted by a}} <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> was investigated. The tone and its modulation were perceived as continuing through the noise. In experiment 1, subjects rated the similarity of an uninterrupted tone and a tone interrupted by noise, {{in terms of the}} perceived level and modulation depth of the sinusoidal carrier. The values of these parameters in the central portion of the uninterrupted tone were systematically varied. Both amplitude and frequency modulation (AM and FM) were used. The results indicated that the perceived level and modulation depth of the carrier did not change greatly during the <b>noise</b> <b>burst.</b> When the modulation rate differed before and after the <b>noise</b> <b>burst,</b> the modulation-rate transition was perceived to occur {{near the end of the}} <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> for the FM stimuli. Hence, for these stimuli, the continuity illusion appears to be dominated by the portion of the tone before, rather than after, the interruption. Results for the AM stimuli showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. Experiment 2 used forced-choice tasks to evaluate the ability to detect a change in the ongoing phase of AM and FM following interruption by a <b>noise</b> <b>burst.</b> The results confirmed earlier findings for FM tones, and extended them to AM tones, showing that listeners lost track of the phase of the modulation, even though the modulation was perceived as continuous. © 2005 Elsevier B.

The association of the <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> events with local midnight and high geomagnetic activity argues against a lightning link, as well as the lack of close thunderstorm location relative to Sodankylä during noise periods.
