5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|After the 2005–06 season, the Senators opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> back Hašek, instead {{acquiring}} Martin Gerber {{to compete}} with Emery for the starter position. Gerber was the starter {{at the beginning of}} the season, but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November. On February 10, 2007, Emery was suspended three games from the NHL for striking Montreal Canadiens forward Maxim Lapierre with his stick on his face after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.|$|E

5|$|Chances {{the bill}} would be passed ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, {{there was}} {{fighting}} both west (Hill's Corps renewing their {{attacks on the}} I Corps) and north (Ewell's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps) of Gettysburg. Ewell, on Oak Hill with Rodes, saw Howard's troops deploying before him, and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen. Lee's order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about a general engagement.|$|E
5|$|After Nader got {{help for}} his drug {{addiction}} at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota, All My Children opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him back. Nader filed a $31.7 million lawsuit against ABC for {{breach of contract}} under the Americans with Disabilities Act. ABC's lawyers cited Nader's violation of the morals clause in his contract as justification for not rehiring him. The firing and lawsuit {{caught the attention of}} non-soap opera medias such as TV Guide, Inside Edition, People, Celebrity Justice, Extra, Entertainment Tonight, and Larry King Live. Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff threw out the suit in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Since Wellington {{was anxious}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> on an engagement, {{he tried to}} flank Soult out of position. He sent Beresford to cross the Gave de Pau {{downstream}} at Lahontan and circle around Soult's right flank. At the same time, Hill's corps moved directly toward Orthez. By 25 February, Soult had massed his army at Orthez and courted battle with the Allies. The French marshal counted 33,000 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 48 field guns. Wellington could bring 38,000 infantry, 3,300 cavalry, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 54 artillery pieces against the French. Five battalions were absent: 1/43rd Foot and 1/95th Rifles from the Light Division, 2nd Provisional from 4th Division, 79th Foot from 6th Division and 51st Foot from 7th Division. Confronted with Soult in a fighting mood, the British commander planned to send Beresford to break Soult's right flank while Picton and three divisions kept the French center busy. Meanwhile, Hill's corps was to attack Orthez, get across the Gave de Pau and envelop the French left flank. With luck, Soult would be crushed between Beresford and Hill.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E

As well, less costly studio time is spent moving in gear and setting it up. Another benefit is that microphones can be set up in appropriate locations near all of the studio-owned instruments, and bass amps can have their DI units plugged into the mixing board, which speeds up set-up time.|$|R
