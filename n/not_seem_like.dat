5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Dodgers {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start. Even so, an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in {{response}} to questions and that he did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a manager who had won ten consecutive games. The 1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship. They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the year than any team had in NL history. In the World Series, Alston started Johnny Podres, who had a mediocre 9-10 regular season record, in the third and seventh games; Podres won both games. The pitcher had struggled with arm problems for much of the season.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E

500|$|Redmond, {{a fan of}} series creator Chris Carter and {{recurring}} director David Nutter, had {{auditioned for}} another first-season episode directed by Nutter. Although she did not get that part, she was contacted about a minor recurring role (which led to her casting as Butler). Butler's character was received positively by critics; her use did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> [...] "rote horror", instead having clear motives and characterization. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, found the character a good balance of the depictions of evil throughout the series: [...] "something very strange and new and terrifying".|$|E
500|$|Corbie Dillard at Nintendo Life {{criticized the}} Wii version for using resized {{graphics}} from the Nintendo DS version without doing any [...] "touch-ups", {{resulting in a}} pixelated look. He also disliked the Wii Remote-based gameplay changes, {{saying that they were}} annoying for people who have already played the portable versions of the game. Lucas M. Thomas at IGN also found it disappointing how the graphics, audio and content had not been changed at all compared to the Nintendo DS release, saying that the visuals did not look attractive when resized to fit a larger screen; he concluded that it did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> the Wii version had been given [...] "any extra love and attention at all". Marissa Meli at GameZone called it a [...] "3/10 interpretation of a 9/10 title", saying that the pixelated graphics made the game look ugly and shoddy.|$|E
500|$|In South African {{newspaper}} The Star, {{the episode}} {{was identified as}} the most cynical of the first series. For the reviewer, it [...] "parades before us the depravity to which the human animal will stoop, and explores how agendas can be furthered under the noble cover of altruism". David Upton, writing for PopMatters, called it [...] "easily the most acerbic and most overtly comic" [...] episode of the series. He listed three reasons that the episode does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> something produced by Pemberton and Shearsmith: its avoidance of the horrific; {{the fact that it}} does not star Shearsmith; and its direct focus on celebrity culture, which Upton considers a modern phenomenon. Instead, he suggested that it feels closer to a story from Charlie Brooker's anthology programme Black Mirror. The focus of [...] "Last Gasp" [...] on comedy to the exclusion of horror, for Upton, leaves it [...] "stranded" [...] when compared to the other episodes.|$|E

Although <b>not</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>like</b> much, the provision of thirty flights in two months was considerable because the combined strength of the five Air Force Reserve C-124 groupsinvolved was a mere twenty aircraft.|$|R
500|$|Dearly Stars {{features}} 10 songs the idols perform {{written and}} composed {{by a variety}} of songwriters. The chief music director Kōji Nakagawa told Satoru Kōsaki, the composer of the game's theme song [...] "Hello!!", that he wanted it to be [...] "similar to the opening theme of an anime." [...] It was decided beforehand who the three composers would be for the other three songs introduced in Dearly Stars—"Alive", [...] and [...] "Dazzling World". When discussing who would compose which song, Go Shiina said he wanted to compose the song for the game's main idol, so he was given in charge of composing Ai's song [...] "Alive". Producer Yōzō Sakagami pointed out that as a ballad, [...] "Alive" [...] does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a typical idol song, but as noted by Nakagawa, the song is meant to reflect the fact that Ai's mother Mai originally sang the song once she became a prominent idol. When recording Ryō's song [...] "Dazzling World" [...] sung by Yuuko Sanpei, Nakagawa decided on the spot to record the song used in the game in two versions: one with a female voice and the other in a male voice. Of the 10 songs in the game, Kujioka specifically wanted to include [...]|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an [...] "A", finding {{it to be}} a particularly well-executed version of kidnapping trope in crime thrillers. Handlen also praised the development of the Lucy Butler character, feeling positively that her scenes did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> [...] "rote horror" [...] but made use of clear motives and characterization. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, praising the dialogue and the use of [...] "Love Is Blue". However, Gibron felt that the episode did little to move the series along, not exploring any of the season's themes or mythology. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "A Room With No View" [...] five stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was the season's most frightening installment, as it dispensed with the wider theological trappings that he felt lessened the impact of other episodes. He also praised the decision to bring back Redmond as Lucy Butler, finding the character to be a good balance between the different depictions of evil depicted throughout the series.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the game}} {{characters}} were animated using motion capture, filmed at a rented studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited polygons heavily inhibited this. Animating non-player characters entering and driving cars proved to {{be difficult for the}} team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. [...] "It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code," [...] recalled software engineer Alan Campbell. The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions. For the voice acting, the team wanted [...] "natural, subtle performances", which proved difficult as many of the actors [...] "had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated", explained motion capture director Navid Khonsari. The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game, and his name is not officially revealed as Claude until his appearance in [...] (2004). He is a silent protagonist, never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it [...] "did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a major issue", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character.|$|E
