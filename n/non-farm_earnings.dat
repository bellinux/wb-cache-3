40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to identify a}} pathway out of poverty over generations in the rural Philippines, based on long-term panel data spanning for {{nearly a quarter of}} a century. Specifically, it sequentially examines the determinants of schooling, subsequent occupational choices, and current <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> for the same individuals. We found that an initial rise in parental income, brought about by the land reform and the Green Revolution, among other things, improves the schooling of children, which later allows them to obtain remunerative non-farm jobs. These results suggest that the increased agricultural income, improved human capital through schooling and the development of non-farm sectors are the keys to reducing poverty in the long run. It must be also pointed out that the recent development of the rural non-farm sector offers ample employment opportunities for the less educated, which also significantly contributed to the poverty reduction.

40|$|This study uses {{a spatial}} logit model to {{evaluate}} the statistical effect of conditions of communities on municipal bond ratings. It finds that private (<b>non-farm)</b> <b>earnings</b> in the community positively explain bond ratings with statistical significance, while earnings from personal transfers negatively affect ratings. Own source of revenues of local governments (local taxes) increase ratings and inter-governmental revenues (transfers to local governments) negatively impact ratings. Outstanding debt fails to significantly explain ratings. The composition of the local economy (e. g., the service sector) weights heavily in a rating, and proximity of the local government to areas with high municipal bond ratings increases ratings. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{large amounts}} {{invested}} in rural roads in developing countries, {{little is known}} about their benefits. This paper derives an expression for the willingness-to-pay for a reduction in transport costs from the canonical agricultural household model and uses it to estimate the benefits of a hypothetical road project. Estimation is based on novel cross-sectional data collected in a small region of Madagascar with enormous, yet plausibly exogenous, variation in transport cost. A road that essentially eliminated transport costs in the study area would boost the incomes of the remotest households - those facing transport costs of about $ 75 /ton - by nearly half, mostly by raising <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings.</b> This benefit estimate is contrasted to one based on a hedonic approach.

40|$|This study explores {{occupational}} and earnings dynamics of rural non-farm economy (RNFE) in Thailand. Using occupational transition matrices, we finds significant occupational transitions in rural Thailand, mainly involving moving to non-farm employment, rather than starting businesses. Moreover, results from conditional micro mobility regressions show that transitions into the RNFE {{are associated with}} statistically significant earnings gains while transitions into farming are associated with earnings losses. The cumulative distribution of income indicates that <b>non-farm</b> employers’ <b>earnings</b> distribution stochastically dominates the others, signaling an occupational ladder. However, {{only a small number}} of individuals become non-farm employers, reflecting the difficulty involved in starting, expanding or even keeping a rural <b>non-farm</b> business. <b>earnings</b> mobility, <b>non-farm</b> employment, non-farm business, occupational choice, Community/Rural/Urban Development, International Development, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{a relationship}} between <b>non-farm</b> income (primarily <b>earnings</b> and pensions) and agricultural outlays in Bulgaria, using the 2003 Multitopic Household Survey. The outcomes analyzed are expenditures on working capital (variable inputs such as feed, seed, and herbicides) and investment in livestock. I find that while non-farm income has no {{significant effect on the}} probability of purchasing variable inputs, it does {{have an effect on the}} amount spent if positive, with an estimated elasticity of 0. 14. Non-farm income also has an effect on the number of households that purchase farm animals, with an estimated elasticity of 0. 35. The use of non-farm income for farm investment is consistent with the presence of credit constraints, as is the fact that less than one per cent of farmers report outstanding debts for agricultural purposes. Yet it is also noted that many farm households take out large unsecured loans for other purposes, suggesting that a lack of demand for agricultural borrowing may also be part of the problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The rural non-farm {{sector has}} {{traditionally}} been viewed as a low-productivity sector which produces low quality goods. It is often expected to wither away as a country develops. Recent years have seen a shift away from this position towards recognition that the rural non-farm sector can, and often does, contribute to economic growth, rural employment, poverty reduction, and a more spatially balanced population distribution. This paper reviews {{the literature on the}} conceptual and empirical underpinnings of this more recent perspective, focussing on the experience in developing countries. The paper documents the size and heterogeneity of the sector, pointing to evidence that in many countries the sector is expanding rather than declining. The issues associated with measuring the sector's economic contribution are discussed, followed by empirical assessments for several countries and regions. The distributional impact of <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> is examined and it is found that a pro-poor impact, while by no means inevitable, can be considerable. The sector's trajectory over time, in different settings, is reviewed and the scope for, and experience of, various policy interventions is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Small-scale farm {{holdings}} in many EU countries have shown remarkable resilience {{in the face}} of declining real farm incomes and a widening gap between farm and <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings.</b> This article examines the extent to which favourable off-farm labour market conditions coupled with growth in land values has contributed to the observed resilience of small-scale family farms. Using Northern Ireland data, our analysis indicates that farm household behaviour is influenced not just by current farm income, but also expected capital asset returns. Increased wealth, associated with continuing land ownership, gives rise to the proposition that the link between off-farm incomes, increased land values and remaining in farming may be associated with farmers pursuing wealth maximizing objectives, whilst still maintaining a rural way of life. In this context, the capitalization of agricultural support payments into land values, under successive CAP reforms, has encouraged farmers to hold land back from the market in expectation of future gains. In addition, preferential tax arrangements in the treatment of land also impede adjustment. Alongside increased wealth through land ownership the study confirms off-farm sources of income and, in particular, income from off-farm employment, as being of paramount importance in ensuring the sustainability of small farms.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the environmental, {{demographic and}} socio-economic characters of a topographically discrete area of 521 square kilometres of the Lower and Mid-Tutong Plain within the State of Brunei, a Muslim Sultanate on the Northwest coast of Borneo. The {{majority of the}} data was obtained through face-to-face interviews with {{a random sample of}} six hundred and fifty nine householders, an estimated sixty per cent of those resident within the project area. Detailed descriptions are given of agricultural production and farm sales. Also, information is provided on the levels of <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> {{and the degree to which}} these contribute to household incomes. Production data on liveweight gains per animal and per hectare and management regimes are detailed for a model small-holder beef unit situated in the north of the project area. Using these data an estimate is made of the possible range of smallholder beer production systems and incomes calculated using current 1977 prices. Beef consumption figures for the period 1975 - 1977 are detailed and a calculation made by income and ethnic group on the probable demand for beef within the State in 1984. These indicate that the State will not be able to achieve its aims of self-sufficiency and that because of location constraints on production significant advisory efforts will be necessary to increase production by any real amount. Broad based extension recommendations are made as to the methods by which production increases can be achieved within the project area...|$|E
30|$|Most studies {{revealed}} that <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> {{account for a}} substantial share of farm household income in rural Africa. There is widespread reliance on non-farm income sources by African farm households (Author and Bryceson 2002). The question {{that needs to be}} justified is that why do households branch out their income? The diversification motives are classified into two; these are pushing and pulling factors (Barrett et al. 2001). Pushing factors include risk reduction, response to diminishing factor returns in any given use, such as family labour supply in the presence of land constraints goaded by population pressure and fragmented land holdings, reaction to a crisis or liquidity constraints, high transaction costs that influence households to self-provision in several goods and services. Quite the opposite, pulling motive factors comprise the realisation of strategic complementarities between activities, such as crop-livestock integration or milling and hog production. An interrelated but distinct role of diversification is to cope ex-post with distresses to income (Barrett et al. 2001; Ellis 1998; Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001). When crops fail or livestock die, households must reallocate labour to other livelihood pursuits, whether formal employment off-farm (e.g. wage labour), informal employment off-farm (e.g. hunting) or non-agricultural activities on-farm (e.g. weaving, brewing). The auxiliary explanation for diversification is the existence of economies of scope in production. Economies of scope exist when the same factor inputs generate greater per-unit profits when spread across multiple outputs than when dedicated to any one output. On the other hand, an economy of scale leans to favour specialisation rather than diversification (Barrett et al. 2001; Ellis 1998; Kimhi and Lee 1996; Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001).|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Education {{plays an}} {{important}} role in improving Chinese rural laborers' non-farm incomes. However, in Chinese western rural area, the level of return to education is very low due to the underdeveloped economy and the condition of the education system. For improving the schooling returns level, Chinese central government is paying great attention to the condition of education in the rural western area. To date, no research has examined what educational style is more favorable for improving western rural laborers' non-farm incomes. To answer this question, the purpose of this paper is to compare the treatment effect of high school education and secondary vocational education on their non-farm incomes. That will provide significant evidence for the government to carry out educational policy. Design/methodology/approach - Base on the Mincer model, several methods is used to estimate the average return to a year education on western rural labors' non-farm income, including OLS, IV and Heckman tow-steps method, to accounting for the ability endogenous and self-selection bias. And the propensity score matching method is used in estimate the treatment effects of high school education and secondary vocational education. Findings - The results from Mincer model showed that the schooling returns in Chinese western rural area were estimated to range from 2. 7 to 3. 9 percent, that were lower than the average levels in Chinese whole rural area that are estimated in the other recent studies. By using propensity score matching to roll out the heterogeneous bias, show that the treatment effect from high school education was higher than that from secondary vocational education, indicating that the secondary vocational education is better. Originality/value - Studies concerning the causal relationship between schooling (high school education and secondary vocational education) and <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> in the western region of China remain very limited, even empty. This paper will make an update contribution to the literature in the area of education earnings in China...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} in Sub-Saharan Africa {{has put the}} emphasis on two main subjects: geographical vulnerability to climate changes and extremes; the economical dimension of food insecurity while urban populations are facing a daunting set of problems including increasing poverty, social inequalities and political insecurity. It has seldom drawn on the studies of rural food insecurity in non-sahelian areas and rural societies capable of coping with low climate instability. Most people consider that the major risk facing rural households stems from drought and famine - caused by ineffective regulations or insufficient food supplies - rather than from poverty, inadequate capacity for earning food, or inappropriate behaviour combined with geographical enclavement. Data were collected from two 1997 household surveys carried out, in collaboration with Bouake University, in the western Baule and southern Senufo areas, ''in-between'' agricultural parts of Ivory Coast (Figure 1). The panel data of 320 cotton and food crop small-holders was built upon economic and demographic criteria {{in order to give}} a representative idea of the geographical diversity. This paper draws on such studies to show that rural food insecurity is rapidly changing, widening the gap between earns, costs and needs in a post-structural adjustment period. It seems now - under circumstances where the rural smallholders may spend a larger portion of their total income on expensive outlays such as fertilizers or insecticides while maintaining social expenses or may sell more supplies for the urban market - that food security now belongs to individual strategies of earnings more than traditional status and land entitlements according to collective traditional decision making. The data also show the importance of local and outside <b>non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> to food security, or rather to the economic ability to face unexpected changes and the disruption of livelihoods (Table 2 and Figure 2). Moreover, the lack of perception and the shifting of responsibility for coping with environmental depredation away from the individual and collective level towards the state or the NGO's has tended to increase the risk of food insecurity in densely inhabited areas where rural producers are still practising shifting cultivation. Si l'agriculture ivoirienne est réputée pour le dynamisme à l'exportation des agro-industries et des petites plantations familiales cacaoyères et cotonnières, une fraction importante du monde rural - le Centre et le Nord - pratique encore essentiellement une agriculture extensive de subsistance. Celle-ci est toutefois insérée depuis longtemps dans les échanges marchands et joue un rôle croissant dans l'approvisionnement des marchés urbains nationaux et sous-régionaux depuis la dévaluation du franc CFA. En zone centrale ivoirienne, le niveau élevé des « disponibles vivriers » après récolte garantit habituellement l'autonomie alimentaire du groupe familial et réduit le risque d'insécurité à certains épisodes exceptionnels. Or, avec le changement de mode de régulation macro-économique et la dégradation accélérée de l'environnement, la nature et l'intensité de ce risque évoluent progressivement. Il ne dépend plus seulement des disponibilités mais également des modes de gestion et de répartition des ressources. À l'avenir, il dépendra plus encore, comme en milieu urbain, de la capacité à acheter des denrées sur le marché. L'insécurité alimentaire existe donc mais reste souvent cachée et progresse de manière très inégale selon l'orientation économique des petites exploitations familiales...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the role of transaction costs in determining market participation of smallholder farmers. It is expected that the identification of these transaction cost factors could assist in the formulation of policy interventions and/or institutional innovations to alleviate constraints on market participation and improve the ability of these small-scale farmers to become part of the commercial agricultural economy. Transaction costs differ between households due to asymmetries in access to assets, market information, extension services and remunerative markets. The study particularly investigated the factors contributing to different levels of transaction costs amongst households. The main hypothesis of the study is that small-scale farmers facing lower transaction costs will participate more in agricultural markets. Transaction costs reflect the character of the market, but are mainly embedded in the characteristics of individual households and their economic environment. In order to test the hypothesis, selectivity models identifying and testing significant factors related to market participation are applied to a survey of 157 farming households in the Northern Province. These households take part in the markets for horticulture, livestock, maize and other field crops. The selectivity models used involve two-step estimation similar to the Heckman's two-stage procedure. The study reveals that access to assets and market information in combination with particular household characteristics are important determinants of market participation. Among the assets of a household, a reasonably sized area of arable land tends to encourage participation in all markets, apart from the market for other field crops market. Ownership of livestock tends to stimulate livestock selling and also the level of maize sales. Ownership of arable land and livestock contribute to the economies of scale of production, which leads to lower transaction costs per unit output sold. <b>Non-farm</b> <b>earnings</b> only alleviate variable transaction costs in horticultural markets, but not in other field crops markets. Pensions discourage participation in high value commodities markets since they are viewed as alternative cash income. Indicators enhancing the role of information access include proximity to markets and contacts with the extension service. Proximity to markets reduces variable transaction costs in horticultural markets and fixed transaction costs in livestock markets. The study shows that every kilometre closer in proximity to markets, the horticultural sales increase by R 152. Proximity and contact with extension services discourage participation in other field crops markets. Good road conditions reduce transaction costs for livestock and other field crops. The study also shows that in spite of bad road conditions some horticulture farmers still manage to market most of their products. A larger sized household tends to increase the transaction costs in marketing all commodities except for the other field crops. Female farmers tend to participate more in livestock markets as they own small livestock and poultry that are easy to sell, and keep livestock for livelihood purposes rather than for social status. On the other hand, female farmers appear to be constrained in their participation in horticultural markets, ostensibly due to problems of access to irrigation resources and cultural and legal perceptions. Older farmers with enough social capital are willing to sell, but in horticulture and maize they tend to sell lower quantities. The study raises issues which, when attended to, might reduce the transaction costs, particularly by enhancing access to information and providing endowments to farming households. Some constraints require direct policy measures, such as policies dealing with land reform, extension services, education and legal reforms, and then there are those that require indirect intervention and private sector involvement such as road networks and market availability.
