25|$|While it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ABC did {{not make}} an {{immediate}} announcement about the show's fate - many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor's schedules and production demands - it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both {{moved on to other}} projects.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to be expected of {{a man of his}} ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{despite the}} other successes, it was <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> League Challenge Cup saw yet another first round exit, {{this time to}} Stranraer.|$|R
5000|$|.....a stone {{monument}} is {{an expression}} of permanence. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Roman obsession with personal immortality acquired its physical form in stone." ...|$|R
50|$|It came as <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> home {{ground of}} Atlético Paranaense, which was {{originally}} constructed back in 1914, {{was among those}} venues chosen to host games at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.|$|R
25|$|In 1846 another Act of Parliament {{established}} the Great Western Dock Company to provide full facilities for shipping at Millbay. Gill sold his Millbay Pier to this company {{and became a}} director. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to design new docks; both he and Gill {{were involved in the}} South Devon Railway, so it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first railway station in Plymouth was opened nearby in 1849. The next year a railway extension was built to the new docks, customs facilities were granted and the docks were recognised as a Government mail packet station.|$|E
25|$|Since prehistoric times, {{trade routes}} like the Lindenweg or Linienweg {{connected}} the Rhine-Main plain with the Usingen basin, {{which had been}} a centre of population since the Neolithic. Such routes would have followed a course {{from the mouth of}} the Nidda near Höchst, northwards across the low Taunus ridge, as does the modern Bundesstraße 456. A location along major communication routes almost always equals a strategic importance. Thus, it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mountain pass beside the Saalburg was first fortified by Roman troops during Domitian's wars against the Chatti (AD 81-96), when two simple earthen enclosures were erected (Schanzen A and B, located between the restored fort and the modern road).|$|E
25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, it should come as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E
50|$|He also self-published a few book-like volumes, made of sketches, {{drawings}} {{and his own}} texts, often written in an enigmatic and expressive manner. “The world is very sick. <b>No</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> only <b>the</b> Artists can rescue it”, wrote he in one of such books.|$|R
25|$|Upper Canadians saw {{themselves}} as citizens of Great Britain with all the rights granted by the British Constitution. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Upper Canadian Reform Movement should adopt the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement.|$|R
50|$|In {{his second}} season with Tottenham, Mendes {{was reduced to a}} {{peripheral}} role. He made only six appearances {{in the first half of}} the season, so it came as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> January 2006 transfer window, then-Tottenham coach Martin Jol was looking to offload him.|$|R
25|$|Given the {{disagreements}} {{about the}} structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the second world war to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were polyphyletic, i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially Sidnie Manton. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the monophyletic theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{formation}} of Los Ingobernables ("The Unruly") Rush, La Sombra, La Máscara and Marco Corleone had claimed to be tecnicos diferentes, or {{a different kind of}} good guys, which meant that they did not get along with other tecnico wrestlers but generally fought against rudos. For the Sin Salida show {{that was not the case}} Rush, La Sombra and Marco Corleone faced the tecnico team of Atlantis, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. and Los Ingobernables clearly played the rudo part of the match, cheating whenever they had a chance including pulling Diamante Azul's mask off at one point and tearing Atlantis' mask apart. With Volador Jr. and La Sombra being bitter rivals for years it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two did not fight a clean match but both Rush and Corleone used underhanded tactics to win the match including a low kick to Volador Jr. to win the third and deciding fall. After the match Volador Jr. challenged La Sombra to put his mask on the line against Volador Jr.'s hair, a challenge turned down by La Sombra as he had already unmasked Volador Jr. Moments later Diamante Azul upped the challenge, Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. against La Sombra and Rush and Azul would put his mask on the line as well. The challenge was not accepted, nor declined by Los Ingorbernables at the time.|$|E
500|$|Forces {{regrouping}} in {{the sector}} {{ran into the}} rasputitsa, which turned much of the soil into mud. This caused severe delays in the preparations and made reinforcing the Southern and Southwestern Front take longer than expected. Senior Soviet representatives criticized the front commanders for poor management of forces, an inability to stage offensives and for their armchair generalship. Because the regrouping was done so haphazardly, the Germans received some warning of Soviet preparations. Moskalenko, {{the commander of the}} 38th Army, placed the blame {{on the fact that the}} fronts did not plan in advance to regroup and showed a poor display of front management. (He commented afterwards that it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "German-Fascist command divined our plans".) ...|$|E
5000|$|During this time, the British Government {{feared the}} threat of spies in the country. And so, the {{government}} created the Aliens Act of 1793, which regulated the amount of immigrants who could move into Britain. Thus, it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> once <b>the</b> radicals were caught, they were sentenced to serious arrests.|$|R
30|$|A {{new idea}} that {{advances}} {{science and technology}} is commonly recognised as {{an important source of}} wealth creation, economic growth, and societal change [2, 3]. The steam engine, transistor and lithium ion battery are all such examples. Therefore, it is of <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> understanding <b>the</b> dynamics of generation of new ideas sits at the centre of many disciplines [4 – 18].|$|R
50|$|Rubisch was the 2nd overall draft pick, {{going to}} the Boston Blazers in the 2010 NLL Entry Draft. In his rookie season Rubisch headed the Blazers defense {{recording}} a team-high 143 loose balls and 20 forced turnovers. Rubisch also netted his first NLL goal against Rochester on April 2. <b>No</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> after <b>the</b> season, Rubisch was named to NLL All-Rookie Team.|$|R
500|$|Elizabeth Taylor's {{performance}} as Maggie was praised by critics. She {{was named the}} 13th greatest guest spot {{in the history of}} the show by IGN. Taylor also appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. Todd Everett at Variety called the last scene in the episode, where Maggie speaks her first word, [...] "quite a heart-melter". He added that [...] "it is probably <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> casting of Elizabeth Taylor as the voice for baby Maggie Simpson's first word was a publicity stunt [...] No mind, the episode in question delivered well-rounded view of series' multiple attractions." [...] Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked her {{performance as}} the best guest appearance in the show's history. Fox rebroadcast the episode on April 3, 2011 in memory of Taylor, following her death on March 23.|$|E
500|$|The head {{of comedy}} at Television Centre deserves {{six of the}} best for {{bringing}} back Chalk (BBC1) for a second term. If the opening episode of the new series is anything to go by, we are in for six of the worst half-hours of comedy {{in the history of}} television ... It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show has been relegated to a late slot. It is a watershed for smut. Some of the jokes were in the worst possible taste. The standards of comedy are so pitiful, Galfast High School should not have been given a grant from TV licence-payers' money and it is time it closed its gates for good. David Bamber ... deserves a better vehicle for his acting talents. He was lured into playing Eric Slatt because the character {{was supposed to be the}} classroom equivalent of Basil Fawlty. They are as different as Chalk and Cleese.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is perhaps}} <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> complex {{ultimately}} led to and fuelled conflicts between the pair, with Jung accusing Freud of [...] "treating your pupils like patients...Meanwhile you are sitting pretty on top, as father". In his efforts to struggle free from his psychoanalytic father figure, Jung would reject the term [...] "father complex" [...] as Viennese name calling — despite his own use {{of it in the}} past to illuminate precisely such situations.|$|E
5000|$|Whether the proto-Huastecs {{split from}} the rest of the Maya in 2200 or in 1200 BCE, the {{separation}} occurred at least a millennium before the rise of classic Maya culture. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "to write" [...] is different in proto-Huastec (θuc-) and in the other Maya language branch (c’ib).|$|R
50|$|As a Congregation founded {{with the}} purpose of evangelizing German East Africa, it is <b>no</b> great <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vast {{majority}} of early monks were Germans. As the Church grew in Africa and Asia, the Missionary Benedictines eventually began to accept indigenous vocations. Though the Congregation's European houses currently possess the greatest number of solemnly professed monks, these will soon be outnumbered by the African monasteries.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Steve Huey states [...] "It's <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two work well together, given the musical {{affinity}} demonstrated on Frisell's masterful reinterpretations of Painted from Memory material {{on his own}} album The Sweetest Punch. The pleasures of Deep Dead Blue are, to be sure, much subtler than either of those recordings, but they make an elegant and fascinating supplement".|$|R
2500|$|Given Neill's {{childhood}} {{exposure to}} early Westerns, and {{his passion for}} wartime theatre and pantomime, it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lobey strips exhibited many of those genre's stylistic devices: depiction {{of good and evil}} as white and black respectively, the overblown evil machinations of [...] "Rank Bajin" [...] and the rhyming speech of [...] "Fairy Nuff" [...] are good examples. The compliment was repaid in the early 1950s when a Lobey sketch was included in a production of Little Red Riding Hood at the Citizen's Theatre in Glasgow.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{approach}} to develop cannabinoid antagonists {{in the late}} 1980s was to modify the structure of THC but the results were disappointing. In the early 1990s new family of cannabinoid agonists was discovered from the NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drug pravadoline {{which led to the}} discovery of aminoalkyl indole antagonists with some but limited success. [...] As the search based on the structure of agonists was disappointing it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first potent and selective cannabinoid antagonist belonged to an entirely new chemical family. In 1994 the first selective cannabinoid antagonist, [...] SR141716 (rimonabant), was introduced by Sanofi belonging to a family of 1,5-diarylpyrazoles.|$|E
2500|$|Senior {{scholar at}} The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Alexander C. McCormick, {{adds to the}} above {{discussion}} by arguing against {{the way in which}} the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is used in the creation of U.S. News rankings. The problem, he argues, with this use is that there is [...] "no basis for inferring national versus regional focus, because it’s not a factor in the classification criteria. So it should come as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> national and regional lists contain a great many inconsistencies and bizarre placements [...] By continuing to rely on the Carnegie Classification, they avoid the tough job of defining their terms." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen Kevin Kennedy, COO for Openwave Systems (on {{the boards}} of Quantum Corp, JDS Uniphase and {{formerly}} with both Cisco and Bell Laboratories) turned his agile mind to writing a joint book with the former VP operations and director of human resources at Stanford University, Mary Moore, it comes as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> “Going <b>the</b> Distance” focuses on the high technology sector and definitely goes its own distance...|$|R
30|$|It is also <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> to see <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MLE reduces to BLUE, {{which is}} often applied in {{centralized}} estimation [14], where the FC can obtain all raw observations of the sensors.|$|R
25|$|Much <b>the</b> {{same way}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{influential}} Duke Ellington matched his scores {{to the unique}} abilities of his performers, Hefti {{was able to take}} advantage of the same kind of 'fine-tuning' to bring out the best of the talents of the Basie band. Therefore, it should come as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> same charts are played by a different band, even <b>the</b> composer's own, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> result is not as strong.|$|R
2500|$|The Dutch Republic {{relied on}} trade by sea for its {{exceptional}} wealth, had naval wars with Britain {{and other nations}} during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genre of maritime painting was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step. [...] Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a Dutch navy {{at the peak of}} its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Wrong Question", Sachs further argued that: [...] "The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus {{was asked to}} {{allocate}} an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world’s biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum — {{a tiny fraction of}} global income — the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services." ...|$|E
2500|$|New {{addition}} Dayton Mcpherson and Veteran Brendan McCarthy {{put in some}} monster hits in {{the second}} half and were often seen in the backfield being a constant problem for the Rebels, all with the help of that destructive d line that were getting pressure on Dennehy all day long. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rebels had trouble on offence when the Limerick defense put in their best performance in recent history. The unsung heroes as usual were the Vikings offensive line creating gaps for the Vikings allowing them to keep the chains moving, Paul Keane also helped to keep the chains moving with a few crucial first downs. The sheer power and strength of Adrian Garvey proved to much for the rebels defense again {{in the second half}} as Garvey ran in two more touchdowns both from within the Rebels' redzone.|$|E
50|$|While {{the festival}} is popularly known as the 'Tanuki Festival', Tokushima has been home to many tales of the tanuki since long past. Several of these tales talk of the {{interaction}} between tanuki and the local town residents, with the tanuki often acting as positive, changing forces. It should come as <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tanuki was chosen as a symbol to energise local culture in this way.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the start}} of a new era. In 1993 the club took the step in fielding a senior women’s team. The girls {{finished}} the season being runners up in the final of the night series competition, won the Top Four Cup and the Premiership to gain promotion to 1st Division. It was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> 1994 season, with so much talent, eleven of the girls were chosen to represent Western Australia in various age groups.|$|R
50|$|It came as <b>no</b> great <b>surprise,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ill {{feelings}} harbored by some {{blacks and}} whites alike eventually flared into an ugly race riot that {{ended up with a}} deadly exchange of gunfire lasting several hours.|$|R
