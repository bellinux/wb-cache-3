50|$|Praziquantel (5 mg/kg body weight) and {{epsiprantel}} {{have both}} {{been shown to be}} efficacious in the treatment of taeniataeniaeformis in cats. Similarly, febantel and fenbendazole are approved for the treatment of this parasite in most of the world. Mebendazole and <b>nitroscanate</b> are also products that have efficacy against taeniataeniaeformis in cats.|$|E
50|$|Amoscanate (INN), {{also known}} as nithiocyamine, is an {{experimental}} anthelmintic agent of the arylisothiocyanate class which {{was found to be}} highly effective in animals against the four major species of schistosomes which infect humans, and is also highly active against hookworm infection. However, significant liver toxicity was seen in lab animals at higher doses. The ether analogue of amoscanate, <b>nitroscanate,</b> is used in veterinary medicine as an anthelmintic.|$|E
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey of 716 veterinary practices was undertaken {{to determine the}} incidence of Spirocerca lupi in dogs in South Africa. In total, 49 %of the questionnaires were returned, indicating a possible incidence of 28 %. Fewer than 4 cases per year were recorded by 82 %of the respondents; 4 - 12 by 14 %; 12 - 24 by 3 %; and more than 48 by only 1 %. No seasonal incidence was reported by 48 %of the respondents. Large breeds {{were considered to be}} at greater risk by 43 % of respondents. No specific age or sex was identified to be at higher risk. The most common complaints by owners and clinical findings were vomition (46 %), weight loss (27 %), coughing (21 %) or regurgitation (20 %), although 14 %of respondents reported no abnormal clinical findings. Diagnostic methods used were radiology (74 %), endoscopy (27 %), post mortem examination (34 %) and faecal flotation (4 %). Complications associated with S. lupi were reported by 76 % of respondents, which included oesophageal neoplasia (41 %), hypertrophic osteopathy (38 %) and acute haemothorax (30 %). Specific treatments were used by 58 % of the respondents, whereas 42 % of the respondents either used no treatment (72 %) or recommended euthanasia (28 %). Of the treatment group, 52 % used ivermectin, 27 % doramectin, 13 % other deworming drugs (benzimidazoles, <b>nitroscanate),</b> and 8 % used disophenol. Sixty-three percent of the respondents considered their treatment ineffective, whereas 31 % considered it effective, and 6 % were unsure. The overall mortality rate was high...|$|E
