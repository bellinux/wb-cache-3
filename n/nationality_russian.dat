Stalin remained proud of his Georgian identity and culture, and throughout his life, he retained his Georgian accent when speaking Russian. According to Montefiore, his adoption of Russian culture has been exaggerated, and he was profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality, spending much of his final years in his homeland. Montefiore was of the view that [...] "after 1917, he became quadri-national: Georgian by <b>nationality,</b> <b>Russian</b> by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship." [...] Service stated that Stalin [...] "would never be Russian", could not credibly pass as one and contrary {{to what has been}} previously suggested, he never really tried to be one. Stalin was described as [...] "Asiatic" [...] by his colleagues, and told a Japanese journalist, [...] "I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian". He first adopted the pseudonym [...] "Stalin" [...] in 1912; being based on the Russian word for [...] "steel" [...] it has often been translated as [...] "Man of Steel".

With this in mind, he declared Germany a satisfied power, using his talents to preserve peace, for example at the Congress of Berlin. Bismarck had barely any success in some of his domestic policies, such as the anti-Catholic Kulturkampf, but he also had mixed success on ones like Germanisation or expulsion of Poles of foreign <b>nationality</b> (<b>Russian</b> or Austro-Hungarian).|$|E

30|$|Two recent papers by Constant, Kahanec and Zimmermann (2011, 2012) look at {{the effect}} of ethnic and {{linguistic}} diversity on earnings and political preferences. The first paper studies significant political and economic tensions between ethnic Russians and Ukrainians unveiled by the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. In particular, the authors raise the question whether this divide stemmed from purely ethnic differences or from ethnically segregated reform preferences. Using ULMS data collected prior to the revolution they find that voting preferences for {{the forces of the}} forthcoming Orange Revolution were strongly driven by preferences for political and economic reforms, but were also independently significantly affected by ethnicity; namely language and <b>nationality.</b> <b>Russian</b> speakers, as opposed to Ukrainian speakers, were significantly less likely to vote for the Orange Revolution, and nationality had similar effects. The second paper employs ULMS data and the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition of earnings, to investigate differences in earnings between ethnic Russians and Ukrainians throughout Ukraine’s transition era. A persistent and increasing labor market divide is documented. They authors find that language, rather than nationality, is the key factor behind an ethnic premium favoring Russians.|$|E

In contrast, educational standards in the Soviet Union were quite uniform across the country.|$|R
