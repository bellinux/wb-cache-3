Macleod {{embarked}} on 1 June, ready for the invasion which was then postponed from 5 June to 6 June. The 50th Division, a highly experienced veteran formation which had fought in North Africa and Sicily, was tasked with capturing Arromanches, where the Mulberry artificial harbour was to be set up, {{and by the end of}} the day patrols had pushed to the outskirts of Bayeux. Macleod spent much of the day touring the beachhead area to check on progress, driving past enemy-held strongpoints, with Lieutenant Colonel “Bertie” Gibb. He later recorded that he had “a patchwork of memories” of D-Day. He could remember what he ate but <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ate it, or that when he went to load his revolver he found his batman had instead filled his ammunition pouch with boiled sweets. British planners had expected 40% casualties on D-Day, and Macleod later recorded that he himself had fully expected to be killed, but on realising at midnight that he had survived D-Day decided that he would survive the war and see the birth of his second child in October.|$|E

Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much.

2500|$|Bill (Rick Green) is {{the star}} of the [...] "Adventures with Bill" [...] segment, in which he and at least one other {{character}} (usually Red) attempt to perform relatively simple tasks or try a sport or game in the clumsiest, most accident-prone way possible. (These segments are done in a silent home-movie format with a voiceover by Red.) Bill rarely actually speaks, and has only appeared on the main set of the show in the second season (still silently) and in the series' final episode—these are also the only times Bill is ever seen in colour (though he shows up in color {{at the end of the}} credits sequence for the first season, at least), since the [...] "Adventures" [...] segments are shown in black & white. [...] When something goes wrong, as it invariably does each episode, Bill can be heard as a muffled scream; these are anticipation of injury, not actual injury, such as Bill screaming as he falls off the ladder, <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hits the ground. [...] In some segments, Bill can be heard speaking in gibberish, but the explanation for not hearing him clearly is usually that the camera they use for these segments has a weak microphone. Later in the show's history, the [...] "Adventures with Bill" [...] segment was expanded to include more characters and not necessarily Bill himself.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn's {{physical}} appearance defied his athleticism. He stood , thick {{around the middle}} and thighs. Even at his athletic prime when he could really run, he weighed around [...] and was considered pudgy. His roly-poly frame was a self-described [...] "body by Betty Crocker", {{a reference to the}} food product brand. Towards the end of his breakout season in 1984, he conceded that his [...] "extra weight hasn't helped me. My bat's slower than it has been all year." [...] At the time, he attributed his weight gain to soft drinks: [...] "It's killing me. It's always been a weakness. I've gotta cut down on the soda pop." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times opined in 1993 that Gwynn's [...] "deceptive" [...] looks and not [...] "look the part" [...] contributed to his regularly being overlooked in the voting for league MVP. Gwynn was sensitive about his weight. His knee injuries over his career prompted the Padres organization, media, and fans to question his weight, conditioning, and eating habits. However, he rejected the notion that his weight led to his injuries. Gwynn contended that his weight was only a topic when he was struggling, and <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was performing. He also believed that the criticism stemmed mainly from his not fitting people's profile of what an athlete should look like. He said he had [...] "a football player's body", with his father, grandfather and brothers also being big. Gwynn said his hitting style put a lot of torque on his knees. He started experiencing problems with his legs in 1986, when he suffered from shin splints. In his career, he had 13 operations, including eight involving his knees. Limited by injuries, he played over 135 games just once in his final 11 seasons. Gwynn used to run a great deal to keep in shape, but his last five years were mostly limited to working out in the gym.
