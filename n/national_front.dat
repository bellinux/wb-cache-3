5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the <b>National</b> <b>Front,</b> joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Valiente {{became a member}} of a far right white {{nationalist}} political party, the <b>National</b> <b>Front,</b> for about eighteen months, during which she designed a banner for her local branch. Valiente's biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party's nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and that she might have hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement. At the same time she also {{became a member of}} another, more extreme far right group, the Northern League. However, she allowed her membership of the <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> to lapse, sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group, she was critical of the party's opposition to women's liberation, gay rights, and sex education, all of which she lauded as progressive causes. Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain's intelligence agencies.|$|E

5|$|Escalating {{the scale}} of American {{intervention}} in the ongoing conflict between Ngô Đình Diệm's South Vietnamese government and the communist <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) insurgents opposing it, Johnson deployed some 575,000 troops in Southeast Asia to defeat the NLF and their North Vietnamese allies in the Vietnam War, but his costly policy weakened the US economy and, by 1975, it ultimately culminated in what {{most of the world}} saw as a humiliating defeat of the world's most powerful superpower at the hands of one of the world's poorest nations.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E

5|$|Parker's murder led to {{increased}} racial tensions in Peterborough. At his former school, three Asian pupils were suspended {{for an attack}} on an Afro-Caribbean pupil; a relative of the victim then attacked an Asian teacher. A number of taxi firms stopped work early {{in the days after}} the attack in fear of reprisals. In November 2001 Home Secretary David Blunkett banned all marches in Peterborough for three months as it was feared violence would be caused by the Anti-Nazi League and <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> who both sought to hold protests on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> was a {{marginal}} party from 1973, the first election it participated in, until its {{breakthrough in the}} 1984 European elections, where it won 11% of the vote and ten MEPs. Following this election, the party's support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15%, although it saw a drop to around 5% in some late 2000s elections. Since 2010, the party's support seems to have increased towards its former heights.

5|$|The Sihanouk Trail was a {{logistical}} {{supply system}} in Cambodia {{used by the}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and its <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or Viet Cong) allies during the Vietnam War (19601975). Between 1966 and 1970, this system operated {{in the same manner}} and served the same purposes as the much better known Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese) which ran through the southeastern portion of the Kingdom of Laos. The name is of American derivation, since the North Vietnamese considered the system integral to the supply route mentioned above. U.S. attempts to interdict this system began in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{maintained}} good {{contacts with}} nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The Vlaams Blok did traditionally have the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party '86, the Centre Democrats and Voorpost, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations {{particularly with the}} French <b>National</b> <b>Front,</b> {{as well as the}} German People's Union, The Republicans and National Democratic Party of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the Vlaams Blok.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{had become}} the key {{logistical}} artery for PAVN and the <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF or commonly, Viet Cong), {{in their effort to}} conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

5|$|Mohammed Daoud Khan, in {{collaboration}} with the Parchamite PDPA and radical military officers, overthrew the monarchy and instituted the Afghan Republic in 1973. After Daoud's seizure of power, an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet-style Central Committee, in which Karmal and Mir Akbar Khyber were given leading positions. Most ministries were given to Parchamites; Hassan Sharq became Deputy Prime Minister, Major Faiz Mohammad became Minister of Internal Affairs and Nematullah Pazhwak became Minister of Education. The Parchamites took control over the ministries of finance, agriculture, communications and border affairs. The new government quickly suppressed the opposition, and secured their power base. At first, the <b>National</b> <b>Front</b> government between Daoud and the Parchamites seemed to work. By 1975, Daoud had strengthened his position by enhancing the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency. To the dismay of the Parchamites, all parties other than the National Revolutionary Party (NRP, established by Daoud) were made illegal.|$|E

The French <b>National</b> <b>Front's</b> rhetoric is undoubtedly one of the key elements behind the party's growing popularity. The right wing party transformed under the Marine Le Pen's leadership.

The thesis aims to characterize the <b>National</b> <b>Front's</b> immigration discourse in regards to the course of time and current affairs from 2012 to 2015. The main themes emerging in the <b>National</b> <b>Front's</b> immigration discourse are Foreigners and Alien Environment, Emergency and Combat, Political Competition, European Union and Economics. The link frequency to those themes depends on the current affairs, nevertheless it could be said that the foreigner theme links are the most frequent and the economic ones are the less frequent. Some religious fundamentalism links are also noticeable. These serve to contrast the cultural differences and to stigmatize the Muslim community.
