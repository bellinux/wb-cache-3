5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced <b>new</b> <b>tools</b> of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires the development of <b>new</b> <b>tools,</b> approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services {{have to be performed}} at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>new</b> <b>tooling</b> system for forming end shells of {{aluminum}} beverage cans to improve panel wall thinning. Shell forming simulations are then performed {{to investigate the}} effective factors on forming quality using the finite element method. The structural optimization technoloygy based on numerical simulations is finally applied to search optimum design points of the <b>new</b> <b>tooling</b> system. Optimization results show that panel wall thinning of end shell can be improved 7. 4 % by the design optimization of forming processes and tool profiles in the <b>new</b> <b>tooling</b> system, {{as compared with the}} base line model of conventional tooling system. It is also confirmed that the end shell formed by the <b>new</b> <b>tooling</b> system has higher buckling strength under internal pressure...|$|R
40|$|Editor: Editor’s name We {{develop a}} <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> for data-dependent {{analysis}} of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in learning under limited feedback. Our tool is based on two main ingredients. The first ingredient is a new concentration inequality {{that makes it possible}} to control the concentra-tion of weighted averages of multiple (possibly uncountably many) simultaneously evolving and interdependent martingales. 1 The second ingredient is an application of this inequality to the exploration-exploitation trade-off via importance weighted sampling. We apply the <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> to the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem, however, the main importance of this paper is the development and understanding of the <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> rather than improvement of existing algorithms for stochastic multiarmed bandits. In the follow-up work we demon-strate that the <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> can improve over state-of-the-art in structurally richer problems, such as stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (Seldin et al., 2011 a) ...|$|R

5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which the door is open. Once the timer is active, the player must get to the door before the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase <b>new</b> <b>tools</b> with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E

5|$|Being Naughty Dog's first PlayStation 3 game, {{the project}} {{required}} {{the company to}} familiarize themselves with the new hardware, and resulted in several development mistakes. The switch from developing for the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation 3 prompted the staff to implement changes to their development technology. Naughty Dog switched to the industry standard language C++ in order to participate in technology sharing among Sony's first-party developers—the company had previously used their own proprietary programming language GOAL, a Lisp-based language. In rewriting their game code, they decided to create new programming tools as well. This switch, however, delayed the team's progress in developing a prototype, as the <b>new</b> <b>tools</b> proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use. Ten months into full production, the team decided to recreate the game's pipeline, the chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system. In retrospect, Naughty Dog's Co-President Evan Wells considered this the greatest improvement to the project. Additionally, the animation blending system was rewritten several times to obtain the desired character animations.|$|E
40|$|A new {{equilibrium}} thermodynamics analysis tool {{was built}} {{based on the}} CEA method using the OpenMDAO framework. The <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> provides forward and adjoint analytic derivatives for use with gradient based optimization algorithms. The <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> was validated against the original CEA code to ensure an accurate analysis and the analytic derivatives were validated against finite-difference approximations. Performance comparisons between analytic and finite difference methods showed a significant speed advantage for the analytic methods. To further test the <b>new</b> analysis <b>tool,</b> a sample optimization was performed to find the optimal air-fuel equivalence ratio,, maximizing combustion temperature {{for a range of}} different pressures. Collectively, the results demonstrate the viability of the <b>new</b> <b>tool</b> to serve as the thermodynamic backbone for future work on a full propulsion modeling tool...|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested in plant ice themselves. <b>New</b> <b>tools</b> were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution networks to artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
5|$|On December18, 1998, the United Nations {{launched}} a large-scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba. Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved jump-starting agriculture and fisheries. Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase <b>new</b> <b>tools</b> and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in water-borne disease prevention funds. Through various agencies, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided Cuba with roughly $86million in disaster funding.|$|E
