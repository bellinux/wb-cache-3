5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning {{that they are not}} native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E

25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to be expected of {{a man of his}} ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with no surprise that the public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E
500|$|St Ffinan's Church, Llanffinan {{is a small}} 19th-century parish church {{built in}} the Romanesque revival style, in Anglesey, north Wales.

[...] The church was rebuilt in 1841, reusing a 12th-century font and 18th-century memorials, {{as well as the}} cross at the eastern end of the roof.|$|E

[...] "People think this season {{is the first time}} I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years – just <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> level, because I never got the chance.

2500|$|In {{his home}} country of Brazil, the main freeway from the {{international}} airport to São Paulo and a tunnel along route {{to the heart of}} the city are named in his honour. Also, one of the most important freeways of Rio de Janeiro is named after Senna ("Avenida Ayrton Senna"). The main road in Senna's Portuguese resort at Quinta do Lago, Algarve, was also dedicated to him, because his villa there was very near (but <b>not</b> <b>on)</b> <b>this</b> road. A portion of the Interlagos circuit in São Paulo is named the [...] "Senna Esses Chicane" [...] in his honor. In the English town of Reading, Berkshire, where Senna lived for a short period of time, an avenue in the suburb of Tilehurst was named after him.|$|E
2500|$|In the Temple of Hera at Olympia, Hera's seated cult {{figure was}} older than the warrior figure of Zeus that {{accompanied}} it. Homer expressed her relationship with Zeus delicately in the Iliad, in which she declares to Zeus, [...] "I am Cronus' eldest daughter, and am honourable <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king of the gods." [...] Though Zeus is often called Zeus Heraios 'Zeus, (consort) of Hera', Homer's treatment of Hera is less than respectful, and in late anecdotal versions of the myths (see below) she appeared {{to spend most of}} her time plotting revenge on the nymphs seduced by her consort, for Hera upheld all the old right rules of Hellene society and sorority.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emergency}} Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The {{first day}} consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission {{be established in}} Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of Corn Laws. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of [...] "actual or apprehended scarcity" [...] and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was <b>not.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel. Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.|$|E

2500|$|Park rangers began {{patrolling the}} park, the game protected, and forest fires were suppressed. [...] By 1910 {{wildlife}} numbers were increasing. [...] Thousands {{of people had}} visited the great pleasure resort and it {{was said to be}} undeniably {{one of the most beautiful}} natural parks in the Dominion, if <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> continent." [...] All this had entailed a large expenditure by the government, which was recovered chiefly through the maintenance of timber licenses. [...] There was no fee for camping permits, though a nominal charge was introduced for fishing and guides' licenses when [...] "an Act to establish the Algonquin National Park of Ontario" [...] was again passed by the legislature, March 19, 1910. [...] This new legislation included the original area as well as portions of ten townships annexed into the park since 1893, and allowed for further expansion by the addition of adjacent townships, should it become necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Almost a year later, U-God {{released}} his third solo album entitled Dopium, which features guest appearances from several Wu-Tang members, and affiliates, among others, and {{was met with}} mostly lukewarm reviews. Released one week later was Wu-Tang Chamber Music, a side project executively produced by RZA, featuring live instrumentation from a Brooklyn soul band called The Revelations. The album features appearances from five Wu-Tang members, along with New York City mainstays AZ, Kool G Rap, Cormega, Havoc, Sean Price, and M.O.P. The first single from Chamber Music was a track titled [...] "Harbor Masters" [...] featuring Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, and AZ. To clear up confusion, RZA spoke about the album to Billboard.com: [...] "I think the Chamber Music title is very fitting. This music is totally in the chamber, or in the mind-frame of Wu-Tang like in the [...] days. But it's not a Wu-Tang album. The whole Clan's <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album. But it couldn't be in any other category but Wu-Tang.|$|E
2500|$|The Adelaide Oval had {{produced}} another draw {{to leave the}} series tied on 1-1, but the three hours lost on Australia Day would have probably have given England enough {{time to make the}} extra 133 runs required for victory, {{but it would have been}} an historic victory if they had. Ted Dexter said afterwards [...] "Australia never had a hope of bowling us out - [...] <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> pitch and with their attack so depleted". This took some of the heat off Richie Benaud whose reputation for [...] "go-ahead", entertaining cricket had taken a severe blow by his refusal to declare on the last morning. The truth was that the Australian bowling attack depended heavily on the injury-prone Alan Davidson and Benaud with the young McKenzie and two batting all rounders in support. Without any turn in the pitch to help Benaud or Simpson Australia were in great trouble. With the retirement of their two premier bowlers Garth McKenzie would have to carry the Australian bowling through the 1960s.|$|E
