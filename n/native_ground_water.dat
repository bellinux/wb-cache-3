40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the chloride to bromide ratio (Cl/Br) of water imported via interbasin transfer can be used to trace the mixing of imported water with <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> Laboratory experiments and a chemical literature review indicate that chloride's and bromide's properties should make the Cl/Br a useful environmental ground-water tracer. This study has shown that the Cl/Br can be accurately quantified at environmental levels, is not attenuated by aquifer or soil media, is chemically stable, and is present in different levels in waters from different sources. Infiltration and mixing of irrigation water from the Colorado River (Cl/Br = 1300) with <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> (Cl/Br = 630) was investigated at the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District near Yuma, Arizona.

40|$|Various {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} and employed for field determinations of aquifer dispersivity. This paper {{is the result of}} an attempt to evaluate one of these techniques, the "Single Well Technique," in an alluvial basin aquifer as a field method for investigating aquifer dispersivity. The "Single Well Technique" was employed at the University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center's artificial recharge facilities by imposing on the aquifer a systematic series of injection and pumping regimes through a 150 foot recharge well. Cooling tower blowdown water from a power plant was injected into the pump column. Rhodamine WT fluorescent dye was used as a tracer, as well as the relative difference in dissolved solids between the <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and the recharge water. The concentration of the dye was measured continuously by a C. K. Turner Model 111 Fluorometer during the injection and subsequent pumping phases. Temperature and specific conductances were also taken throughout the tests. The relation between the relative concentration of the pumped water during the discharge phase and the ratio between the pumped to the injected volume yielded values of aquifer dispersivity that ranged from 0. 25 feet to 0. 82 feet...|$|E
40|$|A USGS finite-difference {{computer}} program {{was used to}} assess possible artificial recharge and recovery scenarios as part of a technical prefeasibility study of Butler Valley, Arizona. Available hydrogeologic data were compiled and analyzed to build a numerical groundwater flow model of the valley. Input data for the model were gathered from previous work as well as from field studies, including seismic refraction and gravity surveys and aquifer-pump tests performed as part of this investigation. The results of the computer simulations indicate that aquifer storage capacity increases in the upper portion of the basin due to a confined system in the lower portion. The computer model and available geologic data were used to identify potential locations in Butler Valley for artificial recharge operations. The areas along Cunningham Wash and the basin margins appear to be the most favorable for surficial water spreading. Artificial recharge using injection wells, though expensive, appears to be feasible from a hydrogeological standpoint, but chemical interactions between recharge water and <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> could create undesireable well-screen clogging.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the herbicides isoproturon (IPU) and chlortoluron (CTU) in ground water and shallow unsaturated zone sediments were evaluated at a site situated on the Chalk in southern England. Concentrations of IPU in ground water samples varied from < 0. 05 to 0. 23 μg/L {{over a five-year period}} of monitoring, and were found to correlate with application of the pesticide. Concentrations of pesticides in ground water samples collected during periods of rising water table were significantly higher than pumped samples and suggest that rapidly infiltrating recharge water contains higher herbicide concentrations than the <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> Significant variations in herbicide concentrations were observed over a three-month period in ground water samples collected by an automated system, with concentrations of IPU ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 5 μg/L, and concentrations of a recent application of CTU ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 8 μg/L. Different extraction methods were used to assess pore water concentrations of herbicides in the unsaturated zone, and samples were analyzed by standard HPLC analysis and immunoassay (ELISA) methods. These data indicated highly variable concentrations of herbicide ranging from 4 to 200 g/ha for HPLC and 0. 01 to 0. 04 g/ha for ELISA, but indicate a general pattern of decreasing concentrations with depth. The results {{of this study indicate that}} transport of IPU and CTU through the unsaturated zone to shallow ground water occurs and that this transport Increases immediately following herbicide application. Measured concentrations of herbicides are generally lower than specified by the European Union Drinking Water Directive, but are observed to spike above this limit. These results imply that, while delivery of pesticides to ground water can occur as a result of normal agricultural practices, the Impact on potable supplies Is likely to be negligible due to the potential for degradation during the relatively long travel time through the unsaturated zone and high degree of dilution that occurs within the aquifer. As a result of the wide variation in concentrations detected by different techniques, it is suggested that for future site Investigations more than one sampling strategy be employed to characterize the occurrence of pesticide residues and elucidate the transport mechanisms...|$|E

INTRODUCTION: The use of treated sewage effluent by the Buckeye Irrigation Company began with 800 acre -feet in 1962 and had increased to 40, 000 a. f. by 1968. The effluent was diverted by the Buckeye Irrigation Company from the Gila River approximately seven miles below the City of Phoenix 91 st Avenue treatment plant, as it became available at their diversion point. Natural streamflow, used in earlier years, had virtually stopped due to upstream development except in heavy runoff years such as 1941. The ground water in the district of the Buckeye Irrigation Company is relatively high in dissolved solids. The quality of the treated effluent is better. In 1971 the company signed a 40 -year contract with Phoenix to assure its use of 30, 000 a. f. of effluent per year. The effluent is mixed with <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> to bring the total water applied on the 18, 000 -acre district up to approximately 90, 000 a. f. (Halpenny, 1973). The treated effluent use by the Buckeye Irrigation Company is the largest in the State of Arizona and one of the largest land applications of treated effluent in the United States. It is unique in that it is being utilized by an irrigation district. Most other uses have been by city operated farms or private farms under a single ownership. In spite of its uniqueness the effects of effluent use by the Buckeye Irrigation District had not, prior to this research, been well documented. This documentation was made in order to improve the general knowledge needed to extend this type of use to other areas in the state and nation. "Widespread consideration and utilization of land application cannot be made until such time as adequate information concerning the technique involved is made available. The experience gained by those who have successfully utilized this wastewater management should be used [...] . specific evaluation of established systems in the various climatic zones would appear to be more fruitful than new research installations for determining long term effects on soils, vegetation, ground water and the indigenous ecology [...] .

40|$|For perhaps eleven {{months of}} the year, surface water flow in the Santa Cruz River {{consists}} entirely of wastewater effluent from the Roger Road Wastewater Treatment Plant (RRWTP) and the Ina Road Water Pollution Control Facility (IRWPCF). Like other conventional plants that treat primarily domestic wastewater, effluents from the RRWTP and IRWPCF contain numerous trace organic contaminants [...] an unintended consequence of our reliance on water to carry waste from points of generation to central treatment facilities. The fates of these compounds in the environment are not entirely clear since the instruments necessary to measure process-dependent changes in concentrations at levels relevant to environmental health are just now coming into widespread use. Chemical fate during planned or incidental infiltration and transport to points of recovery is therefore relevant {{to the quality of}} delivered water, as water and contaminants are transported in surface waters and unintentionally reused. Interventions that reduce human and environmental exposures to contaminants present in this water, including natural processes, are thus important to protect human health. Here, it is hypothesized that there is a reasonably continuous discharge of trace organics from wastewater treatment effluents to the Santa River. Because the river is effluent dependent, and travel times can be determined from gauging station flows, some measure of fate and transport of trace organics in the surface water can be obtained. The relative levels of trace contaminants in wastewater treatment plant effluent and downstream waters will provide compound specific attenuations due to dilution with <b>native</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> sorption on sediments, biodegradation, etc. If destructive mechanisms can be distinguished from dilution, the resultant analysis will be of general interest [...] an indication of the combination of travel distance and time of travel that is necessary to protect the public when recovered water is eligible for unrestricted potable use without additional treatment. Primary Objectives. *To measure the time-dependent changes in trace organic composition of Santa Cruz River water. *To determine if correlations between known quantities such as biodegradation can be correlated to compound attenuation or persistence during travel. *To apply conclusions from the Tucson data set to other location where dilution and time of travel are also contributing factors; Austin TX and Boston MA. In Tucson, the data suggests that relatively biodegradable compounds are removed by natural processes on a time scale of hours. In areas where dilution and time of travel differ from the Tucson area; such as the Boston area, greater transport distances and times of travel in the Charles River (Boston area) resulted in natural attenuation of most compounds measured, suggesting that even biochemically persistent compounds such as carbamazepine, TCEP and sulfamethoxazole are attenuated to a degree during in-stream transport over periods of days to weeks. The mechanism(s) for these removals is not clear, and the effects of dilution from tributaries are uncertain despite efforts to account for those flows. The limited data from a dry period in a short stream reach in the Little Colorado River (Austin), which was also analyzed, generally support this picture. With one or two exceptions (e. g. DEET), there is limited evidence of compound attenuation between the two proximate monitoring points. Overall, the data indicate that natural mechanisms can be counted on to biochemically degrade or physiochemically transform many of the trace contaminants that are added to surface streams in municipal wastewater effluents. Time scales for compound disappearance range from hours (for relatively biodegradable compounds) to weeks. Although none of the contaminants reported on here is now subject to US federal drinking water regulations, the human health effects of long-term chronic exposure to multiple trace organic contaminants at sub-ppb levels remain uncertain. Environmental impacts are generally acknowledged. Cost effective risk management due to trace organic exposure may eventually include reliance on natural attenuation during in-stream transport to downstream points of reuse...|$|E

Thedischarge of the springs and the artificial drainage works, and the base flow of the brook in thewatershed are summed up and compared with the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge. It is shown that about 60 % of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge flows away without appearing on the ground surface in this area. It is generally said that the <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> Flow in landslide areas usually exists as ground waterveins in the underground channels. It is demonstrated that, in such a case, distribution of thepotential of <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> direction of significant flow, and water balance of each part of thewatershed must firstly be investigated to know the fundamental network of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow,and to know, then, its more detailed structure through further investigations...|$|R

The impact of land reclamation on coastal environment and marine ecology is well recognized and widely studied. It has not been recognized yet that reclamation may change the regional <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime, which may in turn modify the coastal environment, flooding pattern, and stability of slopes and foundations. This paper represents the first attempt to examine quantitatively the effect of reclamation on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Analytical solutions are developed to study the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> change in response to reclamation based on two hypothetical models. In the first model, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow regime changes only in the hillside around the reclamation areas. In the second model, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime changes in the entire hill. Both models assume that the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow is in a steady state and satisfies the Dupuit assumptions. Hypothetical examples are used to demonstrate how the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> divide and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> submarine discharge will change with the scale and hydraulic conductivity of the reclamation materials. The {{results show that the}} change of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime depends mainly on the length of the reclaimed area and the values of hydraulic conductivity of the reclaimed materials. It is also seen that the reclamation may impact not only the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime near the coast areas around the reclamation site, but also that in the coast areas opposite the reclamation area. A reclamation site near Tseung K wan 0 in the New Territories in Hong Kong, China, is used as a case study to discuss the possible modification of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system caused by reclamation...|$|R

In {{the tradition of}} other western states with significant <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> supplies, Nebraska has followed a largely local-control approach to <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> management. This means that local political subdivisions (Natural Resource Districts, or NRDs in Nebraska, other <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> districts in other states) have had the option whether to regulate <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> development and use to {{extend the life of}} local <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> supplies. In Nebraska, as well as in Texas, there has traditionally been no effective state role in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> management – if <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> problems developed and the local district ignored them, the state had no authority to step in. Arizona’s local control <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> management philosophy was changed dramatically to a state control program in the early 1980 s, primarily because Wall Street signaled it would refuse to continue financing Arizona’s real estate development unless the long-term adequacy of municipal water supplies could be assured. Arizona responded with new legislation closing overdeveloped areas to new wells, by imposing water use efficiency requirements on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> irrigators, by requiring real estate developers to demonstrate a 100 -year assured water supply for new residential subdivisions and by allowing farmers to sell their water rights (with much water being sold to real estate developers) ...|$|R
