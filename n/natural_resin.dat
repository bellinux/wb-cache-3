2500|$|The {{painting}} was rehung in a new, wider frame in 2002; {{according to the}} NGV conservators this was in line with Roberts' original frame, which had been trimmed down {{over the years as}} framing fashion changed. In 2006, the NGV began a major restoration of the picture, the first in over 80 years. The painting had slowly lost its cover as the <b>natural</b> <b>resin</b> used in the previous restoration gradually degraded. The restoration revealed much of Roberts' original colour palette as well as background details previously not recognised. After the {{painting was}} cleaned, Lane claimed that he [...] "could see the way the space and light flowed across the back reaches of the shearing shed in a way we really hadn't been aware of before." [...] The painting is currently displayed with the NGV's Australian art collection in the Ian Potter Centre at Federation Square in Melbourne.|$|E

50|$|Mastic is a <b>natural</b> <b>resin</b> {{that runs}} down when a mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus) is cut. Originally mastic is sun-dried into pieces of brittle, {{resulting}} in producing translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens {{and becomes a}} bright natural white and opaque gummy substance. The flavour is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing, Mediterranean-maple-syrup-like flavour, however it has a stickier texture than maple syrup.|$|E

50|$|Perachora is {{a smaller}} village (1,141 inhabitants) NW of Loutraki at a {{landlocked}} position surrounded by mountainous landscape. Large pine forests are found there.

50|$|Natural {{adhesives}} {{are made}} from organic sources such as vegetable starch (dextrin), <b>natural</b> <b>resins,</b> or animals (e.g. the milk protein casein and hide-based animal glues). These are {{often referred to as}} bioadhesives.|$|R
25|$|The {{scent of}} amber was {{originally}} derived from emulating {{the scent of}} ambergris and/or labdanum but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum. The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from <b>natural</b> <b>resins.</b> When derived from <b>natural</b> <b>resins</b> it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.|$|R
50|$|Guaiacum officinale {{is one of}} {{two species}} {{yielding}} the true lignum vitae, the other being Guaiacum sanctum. Guaiac, a <b>natural</b> <b>resin</b> extracted from the wood, is a colorless compound that turns blue when placed in contact with substances that have peroxidase activity and then are exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Guaiac cards are impregnated with the resin and are used in determining whether stool contains blood. The heme portion of hemoglobin contains peroxidase and will catalyze the oxidation of guaiaconic acid when hydrogen peroxide is placed on the Guaiac card if blood is present in the stool.|$|E
50|$|Varnishes {{are applied}} to {{paintings}} to enhance {{the appearance of the}} image, as well as to protect it over time. When dry, varnishes are typically transparent and can vary in gloss and durability as its composition changes. Varnishes may be organic or synthetic. Since natural varnishes tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it. It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new varnish. Varnishes often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally <b>natural</b> <b>resin</b> provided.|$|E
50|$|Hopanoids {{are natural}} pentacyclic {{compounds}} (containing five rings) {{based on the}} chemical structure of hopane. The first known triterpenoid of the class, hydroxyhopanone, was isolated by two chemists at The National Gallery, London working on the chemistry of dammar gum, a <b>natural</b> <b>resin</b> used as a varnish for paintings. The name hopane {{was derived from the}} genus Hopea (a source of the resin) itself named after John Hope, the botanist. Since this first finding, however, hopanoids {{have been found to be}} present in nature in vast amounts as components of bacteria and other primitive organisms. A range of hopanoids are found in petroleum reservoirs, where they are used as biological markers. Hopanoids are not detected in archaea.|$|E

50|$|Fluxes can be also {{prepared}} from synthetic resins, {{often based}} on esters of polyols and fatty acids. Such resins have improved fume odor and lower residue tack, but their fluxing activity and solubility tend to be lower than of <b>natural</b> <b>resins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between the {{two world}} wars the sites started {{production}} of synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>resins</b> as used in paint and varnish.

50|$|Picric acid was {{probably}} first {{mentioned in the}} alchemical writings of Johann Rudolf Glauber in 1742. Initially, it was made by nitrating substances such as animal horn, silk, indigo, and <b>natural</b> <b>resin,</b> the synthesis from indigo first being performed by Peter Woulfe in 1771. Its synthesis from phenol, and the correct determination of its formula, were successfully accomplished in 1841. Not until 1830 did chemists think to use picric acid as an explosive. Before then, chemists assumed that only the salts of picric acid were explosive, not the acid itself. In 1871 Hermann Sprengel proved it could be detonated and most military powers used picric acid as their main high explosive material. Picric acid is also used in the analytical chemistry of metals, ores, and minerals.|$|E
50|$|While at YAL, Yunizar {{worked on}} a new project which {{included}} six pieces made of bamboo and banana leaf paper coated with a <b>natural</b> <b>resin.</b> The creation of Yunizar’s works utilized experimental production methods and new material and textural combinations, including molten-metal, thick paper (made by hand at YAL by Hungerford), as well as colors created with local materials, including dyes more commonly used in batik production. In {{the process of creating}} these works, Yunizar laid hot metal onto the thick pieces of hand-made natural paper, manipulating the fibers during the drying process, synthesizing the simple depictions of his everyday life in Indonesia with new elemental properties and visual textures. The result is a series of multi-textural works, two of which were presented at Art Stage Singapore 2013.|$|E
