25|$|In telecommunications, when {{planning}} a wireless network, design must be proved {{to work for}} a wide variety of scenarios that depend mainly on the number of users, their locations and the services they want to use. Monte Carlo methods are typically used to generate these users and their states. The <b>network</b> <b>performance</b> is then evaluated and, if results are not satisfactory, the network design goes through an optimization process.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>network</b> management, <b>network</b> <b>performances,</b> and democratic legitimacy {{is a highly}} debated issue. In this article, we explore this relationship theoretically. Building on the literature, we expect to find that democratic throughput legitimacy has a partly mediating role in the {{relationship between}} connective network management and <b>network</b> <b>performances.</b> To empirically test this relation, we conducted research by way of a survey among participants involved in complex water projects in The Netherlands, using structural equation modeling to analyze our data. The results indicate that governance networks have indeed democratic potential but, in order to make this potential manifest, network managers can play a key “connective” role. Furthermore, it seems that throughput legitimacy positively affects <b>network</b> <b>performances</b> and has indeed a strong mediating effect on the relationship between connective network management and <b>network</b> <b>performances.</b> <b>Network</b> managers can create important conditions for the evolution of a democratic governance process, but are dependent on the way stakeholders interact with one another and the democratic quality of that interaction...|$|R

He formed, led, and trained the team that designed the commercial QNAP Computer and <b>Network</b> <b>Performance</b> Modeling Tool. He introduced the Flexsim Object Oriented approach for the simulation in manufacturing systems. He carried {{out some of the}} first work on adaptive control of computer systems, and published seminal papers on the performance optimisation of computer network protocols and on the use of diffusion approximations for <b>network</b> <b>performance.</b> He developed new product form queueing networks with negative customers and triggers known as G-networks. He also introduced a new spiked stochastic neural network model known as the random neural network, developed its mathematical solution and learning algorithms, and applied it to both engineering and biological problems. His inventions include the design of the first random access fibre-optics local area network, a patented admission control technique for ATM networks, a neural network based anomaly detector for brain magnetic resonance scans, and the cognitive packet network routing protocol to offer quality of service to users.|$|E
25|$|While {{subnetting}} {{may improve}} <b>network</b> <b>performance</b> in an organizational network, it increases routing complexity, since each locally connected subnet must {{be represented by}} a separate entry in the routing tables of each connected router. However, by careful design of the network, routes to collections of more distant subnets within {{the branches of a}} tree-hierarchy can be aggregated by single routes. Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) functionality in commercial routers made the introduction of CIDR seamless across the Internet and in enterprise networks.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusion}} {{from this}} hypothetical example is that measurements should be combined {{if one is}} interested in minimizing their total MSE. For example, in a telecommunication setting, {{it is reasonable to}} combine channel tap measurements in a channel estimation scenario, as the goal is to minimize the total channel estimation error. Conversely, there could be objections to combining channel estimates of different users, since no user would want their channel estimate to deteriorate in order to improve the average <b>network</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
