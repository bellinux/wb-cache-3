5|$|Only {{two more}} Windows RT devices, the Microsoft Surface 2 and Nokia Lumia 2520 in late-2013, were {{released}} {{outside of the}} five original launch devices, and <b>no</b> <b>Windows</b> RT counterpart of the Surface Pro 3 was released due to a re-positioning of the Surface line into a high-end market, and a switch to Intel architecture for the Surface 3. These developments left Microsoft's future support of the platform in doubt. As of February 2015, {{with the end of}} production for both Surface 2 and Lumia 2520, Microsoft and its subsidiaries no longer manufacture any Windows RT devices.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Justinian also {{tore down}} the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The {{original}} building was a cruciform basilica {{with a central}} domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but with a central dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over {{the arms of the}} cross had pendentives but <b>no</b> <b>windows.</b> The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{a signal}} is given, {{such as a}} series of tones (ex. Continuous Tone), or a voice announcement. Upon {{receiving}} the signal, building occupants of schools, hospitals, factories, shopping centers, etc. proceed to a designated location, usually an interior room or corridor with <b>no</b> <b>windows,</b> and assume a protective position.|$|E
25|$|The dome, {{supported}} by 12 steel ribs, would rise 100ft above the floor, and be illuminated by an electric lantern 45ft in diameter — {{the only source}} of light, for the room had <b>no</b> <b>windows.</b> The building was constructed of non-combustible materials intended to protect the Jezreelites when the Last Trump was called and fire rained down upon the rest of existence.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} further emulates its rail model, with {{tables in}} booths {{along the east}} and west walls with a single aisle between them. The ceiling is also vaulted. The rear is mostly given over to counter and cooking space; it has <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> as a result, a deviation from the model. A later rear addition expands the kitchen facilities to the east.|$|E
25|$|Like their Irish neighbours, the Norsemen of Dublin {{used the}} post-and-wattle method to {{construct}} their dwellings. A series of sturdy vertical posts were first {{driven into the}} ground; these were then interlaced with horizontal osiers, as in basketwork. A plaster of mud and dung was generally applied to the outer surfaces of the walls to seal them (wattle-and-daub). Finally, the roofs were thatched with straw. There was usually just one door, and <b>no</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was built from reinforced concrete and steel, and was visibly {{divided into two}} halves: one with windows to allow in a maximum of daylight, {{and the other with}} <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> at all, to exclude daylight. A central tower housing a lift and staircases delineated the two areas. A border frieze at the top of three of the building's sides depicting different stages in the brewing process was designed by John Oldham and executed by sculptor Edward F. Kohler. An image of the 1938 building featured on Emu beer labels for over fifty years.|$|E

25|$|The main {{structure}} consists of thirteen transverse buttress-walls, pierced by three superimposed brick arches, which create twelve compartments, each 9–13 m wide. The two lengthwise walls are not parallel, but steadily move apart {{as they go}} north. The eastern wall features a pair of superposed corridors on its upper two levels, built inside the wall's body and lit by loopholes in the wall's façades. The basement-level compartments have <b>no</b> <b>windows,</b> but the upper levels are lit through small openings in the western wall. A spiral stairway tower connects the {{main structure}} with the two towers.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} two fare control areas at 73rd Street and two at 74th. The 74th Street {{mezzanine}} has a wooden floor with windscreen on the stairs, a booth, and a crossunder, with stairs {{to both the}} new station building and to {{the northeast corner of}} 74th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The 73rd Street mezzanine contains wooden stair walls, <b>no</b> <b>windows,</b> and no booth (the booth being in the IND entrance at street level). The canopy at the west end is different, having been added later than the original canopy.|$|E
25|$|The Hakkas {{who settled}} in the mountainous region of {{south-western}} Fujian province developed a unique form of architecture known as the tulou (土樓), literally meaning earthen structures. The tulou are round or square and were designed as a combined large fortress and multi-apartment building complex. The structures typically had only one entrance-way, with <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> at ground level. Each floor served a different function: the first floor contained a well and livestock, the second food storage, and the third and higher floors living spaces. Tulou were built to withstand attack from bandits and marauders.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{common policy}} on Unix systems using X Window System (X11) is the [...] "focus follows mouse" [...] policy (or FFM), where the focus {{automatically}} follows the current {{placement of the}} pointer. The focused window is not necessarily raised; parts of it may remain below other windows. Window managers with this policy usually offer [...] "autoraise," [...] which raises the window when it is focused, typically after a configurable short delay. A possible consequence of a followfocus policy is that <b>no</b> <b>window</b> has focus when the pointer is moved over the background with <b>no</b> <b>window</b> underneath; otherwise the focus simply remains in the last window.|$|R
25|$|The {{cells were}} {{extremely}} small, with three concrete walls with <b>no</b> <b>windows,</b> {{and a solid}} steel door with a five-inch square window facing the corridor. The cells contained only a wash basin/toilet combination (cold water only), and a radio selector (there were two channels), and a concrete pad covered with a sheet of plywood four inches off the floor on which the inmates slept. Inmates could not control {{the volume of the}} radio nor the temperature of the cell. The lights in the cell remained on 24 hours a day, but were dimmed to 25 watts at night.|$|E
25|$|After 1825, {{the first}} Western-style royal tomb was {{constructed}} for {{the bodies of}} King Kamehameha II and his queen Kamāmalu. They were buried on August 23, 1825. The idea was heavily influenced by the tombs at Westminster Abbey during Kamehameha II's trip to London. The mausoleum was a small house made of coral blocks with a thatched roof. It had <b>no</b> <b>windows,</b> {{and it was the}} duty of two chiefs to guard the iron-locked koa door day and night. No one can enter the vault except for burials or Memorial Day, a Hawaiian holiday celebrated on December 30.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that these houses had <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> and only one doorway. The door was located {{at one end of}} the house. Internally, the house had one or two {{partitions}} creating up to three areas. Interpretations of the use of these areas vary. Working activities might be carried out in the better lit door end, the middle used for sleeping and eating and the end farthest from the door could have been used for grain storage. According to other view, the interior was divided in areas for sleeping, common life and a fenced enclosure at the back end for keeping animals.|$|E

25|$|Whereas most {{dwellings}} in Madagascar {{are traditionally}} constructed from pliable plant materials, the Antandroy {{are one of}} the few ethnic groups to use wood plank to build their homes. Antandroy homes are traditionally square (not rectangular, as elsewhere on the island), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame. These houses traditionally have <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> and feature three wooden doors: the front door is the women's entrance, the door at the rear of the house is for children, and the third door is used by the men. Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using prickly-pear cactus (raketa) or lengths of indigenous succulents from the surrounding spiny forests.|$|E
25|$|The east wall of {{the room}} is a half circle, with a {{centered}} fireplace and doors on either side. Cast bronze bas-relief plaques with profile portraits of Theodore Roosevelt by James Earle Fraser and of FDR by John DeStefano hung on the south wall until removal during a refurbishment during the second term of President George W. Bush. The room has <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> and is lit by a false skylight. A large conference table seating a maximum of 16 {{is located in the}} center. The room is painted a buff color with white trim. A triglyph molding, similar to that found in Independence Hall encircles the room. The furniture is mostly twentieth century reproductions of Chippendale and Queen Anne Style furniture.|$|E
25|$|Acoma Pueblo {{has three}} rows of three-story, apartment-style {{buildings}} which face south {{on top of}} the mesa. The buildings are constructed from adobe brick with beams across the roof that were covered with poles, brush, and then plaster. The roof for one level would serve as the floor for another. Each level is connected to others by ladders, serving as a unique defensive aid; the ladders are the only way to enter the buildings, as the traditional design has <b>no</b> <b>windows</b> or doors. The lower levels of the buildings were used for storage. Baking ovens are outside the buildings, with water being collected from two natural cisterns. Acoma also has seven rectangular kivas and a village plaza which serves as the spiritual center for the village.|$|E
