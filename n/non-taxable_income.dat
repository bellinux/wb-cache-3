500|$|Since its creation, {{the program}} has {{received}} much criticism {{both within and outside}} Puerto Rico. Critics argue that, since the program provides <b>non-taxable</b> <b>income</b> without any employment requirements, recipients receive free money without incentives for work, which hinders the economic output and development of the island, especially when Puerto Rico's employment participation and unemployment rates have been consistently inferior to U.S. national levels, while the average aid provided in Puerto Rico has exceeded the U.S. national average ($94 versus $74.79, respectively; 2001 estimate). Because of this, Puerto Rico has been called the [...] "welfare island". People from the Dominican Republic do many of the jobs in Puerto Rico that pay too little to attract the locals. However, proponents of the program argue that Puerto Rico's social condition is in far worse shape than any of the 50 U.S. states. Approximately half of the island's population lives below the U.S. Federal poverty guidelines, and many have difficulties in meeting their nutritional needs due to increasing inflation and economic stagnation in the island. Furthermore, the relation between the NAP program's benefits and the low employment participation and high unemployment rates has not been studied, and there is no consensus on their actual causes.|$|E

40|$|The {{public is}} {{constantly}} told income inequality is rising {{and the government}} should do something. This report seeks to explain why inequality matters, {{even though it has}} barely changed. It shows how income inequality did rise in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, but has since flattened out. Meanwhile consumer spending inequality has returned to mid- 1980 s levels. Even so, higher housing costs have probably exacerbated wealth inequality. There is considerable income mobility in New Zealand, but it’s hard to tell whether it’s rising or falling, based on the available data. But isn’t the real issue that the gap between ‘the haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ is unfair? The report addresses this issue.   A striking 72 % of Kiwis believe that wealth is deserved and perceived to be legitimate in the sense of coming from individual talent and efforts.  The New Zealand Initiative and every decent person should care deeply about eliminating all forms of injustice in our society. This report tries to sort out some of the facts to help us better identify where that injustice lies.   Key findings 	It is a myth that income inequality, as most commonly measured, is progressively rising in New Zealand. On the Gini measure for household disposable income, adjusted for differences in household composition, income inequality rose markedly from the late 1980 s to the early 1990 s, but it has not trended up since the mid- 1990 s. Moreover, some of the earlier rise may be illusory, reflecting a changing balance between taxable and <b>non-taxable</b> <b>incomes.</b> Income inequality in New Zealand prior to the mid- 1980 s was understated to this extent. 	On the Gini measure, consumer spending in 2013 was as equal as in the mid- 1980 s. 	It is a myth that economic growth must increase economic inequality everywhere. While globalisation has markedly reduced global income inequality, it has also increased income inequality within many of the world’s most prosperous countries. 	Globalisation and technological changes have increased the labour income of top income earners, particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries, including those in New Zealand. 1 Nevertheless, top salary and wage incomes in New Zealand are modest relative to international norms. Broadly speaking, globalisation has put downwards pressure on the relative incomes of those in {{the bottom half of the}} population in prosperous countries. This is a threat to social cohesion.  It is a myth that the increased income share for top income earners in New Zealand is due to a growing share of investment income in national income due to accumulating concentrated wealth. Increased labour income has been the main driver. 	The rise in the ratio of private wealth to GDP in New Zealand is not evidence in support of Piketty’s thesis that the real capital stock will rise faster than real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The real stock of capital in New Zealand has not grown faster than GDP. The private wealth ratio has instead risen because of the alarming increase in house prices. 	In general, incomes peak in middle age and wealth peaks at retirement. These sources of inequality are natural. 	On the limited evidence available, income mobility in New Zealand is comparable to that in other prosperous countries. 	The funding of government spending, in particular of benefits for the bottom six deciles of the household income distribution, currently depends critically on getting a high net tax take from those in the top four deciles. 	Current research indicates that the taxable income of top income earners is very responsive to the top income tax rate. Higher tax rates on top incomes may produce disappointing outcomes if greater tax revenue is the goal. 	The sources of income inequality matter. A degree of income inequality is inevitable given inequalities in educational attainment, the proportion of the adult population without paid work, the number of paid hours worked, and employment experience (age). 	Household formation and structure matters. On the evidence, perhaps half the increase in household disposable income inequality from the mid- 1980 s to the mid- 1990 s reflects this. 	Higher housing costs hit those on lowest incomes hardest. In current circumstances, public policies relating to housing are important whether the concern is inequality or deprivation. 	Corporate welfare and regulations that appear to protect incumbents are a potential threat to public confidence that high market incomes are justifiable. There should be a presumption against such policies. This report is the second of three reports. The first report was Poorly Understood: The State of Poverty in New Zealand. It argued that issues of hardship were more important than issues of inequality, or low relative income. The third report, to be released in 2017, will examine welfare policy issues...|$|R

(Note: The IRS insists that {{comparisons}} of adjusted gross income pre-1987 and post-1987 are complicated by large changes in the definition of AGI led to households in the top income quintile reporting a lot more of their income in their individual income tax form's AGI, rather than reporting their business income in separate corporate tax returns, or not reporting certain <b>non-taxable</b> <b>income</b> in their AGI at all, such as municipal bond income. Anyone who wants to discuss incomes in the U.S. fairly must include a chart of all available data split by quintile up to the mid-1980s. That should be followed by a chart from 1990 to 2011. The five-year gap would avoid the major AGI definition changes. The big picture of this subject is not just a segment of all available data starting in 1979, especially after the IRS warned about the large AGI definition changes in the late 1980s). In addition, IRS studies consistently show a majority of households in the top income quintile have moved to a lower quintile within one decade. There are even more changes to households in the top 1%. Without including those data here, a reader is likely to assume households in the Top 1% are almost the same from year to year.) [...] In 2009, people in the top 1% of taxpayers made of $343,927 or more. According to US economist Joseph Stiglitz the richest 1% of Americans gained 93% of the additional income created in 2010.

The object of this dissertation is to determine the approach by our courts to apportionment of expenditure in terms of section 11 (a) read with section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962. A single expenditure incurred for more than one purpose poses a problem when deduction of such an expenditure, is sought by a taxpayer. The problem that ttie courts have always encountered when dealing with the deductibility of expenditure incurred for a dual purpose, {{is that there is no}} provision in the Income Tax Act that directs what to do when faced with such a problem. The courts have always chosen apportionment of expenditure as a solution to the deductibility of expenditure incurred for more than one purpose, one such purpose being for tax purposes and the other being for non tax purposes. Apportionment of expenditure is used as a device to allocate part of the expenditure, which was incurred to produce income, as taxable expenditure, and another part of that expenditure which was incurred to produce <b>non-taxable</b> <b>income,</b> as non-deductible expenditure. This dissertation seeks to find out whether courts do take into consideration the provisions of the Income Tax Act applicable to the deduction of expenditure when called upon to make a decision on a particular case. The South African Revenue Services use apportionment of expenditure where it deems appropriate and the courts have never opposed it. The Legislature, which is responsible for the enactment of the act, seems to be happy to lie low, and allow the courts to dominate in handling the disputes that arise as a result of expenditure incurred with a dual purpose. It has been suggested that whilst the Income Tax Act does not provide any direction in situations where the deductibility of dual purposes expenditure is in dispute, apportionment is implied in the terms of section 11 (a) read with section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act no 58 of 1962. The main aim of this research is to establish whether the path taken by the courts is the correct one in terms of section 11 (a) and section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act no 58 of 1962.

Check with a financial aid advisor for information specific to your circumstances. Financial Aid is required by US Department of Education to include RA/SPC compensation as part of a student’s financial aid package. However, it cannot be counted against a student’s entitlement aid (Pell Grants and Need Grants). Current tax law interpretation indicates that the room and board portion of the SPC compensation package is considered a “convenience to the employer” and, as such, is <b>non-taxable</b> <b>income.</b> Meals are provided on premises and the SPC is required to live in an assigned room as a condition of employment. Also, the SPC is an “at will” employee. As such, the University may terminate the position at any time given reasonable cause...|$|E
