5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, {{it is useful to}} consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{a matrix}} {{is defined by the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> and columns that it contains. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m×n matrix or m-by-n matrix, while m and n are called its dimensions. For example, the matrix A above is a 3×2 matrix.|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E

5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, but the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, {{with the exception of}} Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.|$|E
25|$|In this formal definition, {{provision}} {{is made for}} repetition of the t-tuples (λ {{is the number of}} repeats) and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> is determined by the other parameters.|$|E
25|$|For {{matrices}} with {{an infinite}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> and columns, the above {{definitions of the}} determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) {{would have to be}} calculated. Functional analysis provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{invention}} by Kalender in the 1980s, helical scan CT machines have steadily {{increased the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> of detectors (slices) they deploy. The prototype 16 multi-slice scanner {{was introduced in}} 2001 and in 2004, 64 multislice scanners are on the market. These can produce an image {{in less than a}} second and thus can obtain images of the heart and its blood vessels (coronary vessels) as if frozen in time.|$|E
25|$|Boettcher's {{cells are}} found in the organ of Corti where they are present only in the lower turn of the cochlea. They lie on the basilar {{membrane}} beneath Claudius' cells and are organized in rows with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> the number of which varies between species. The cells interdigitate with each other, and project microvilli into the intercellular space. They are supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. They are named after German pathologist Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).|$|E
25|$|Folio size is {{approximately}} 28×16cm {{with a single}} column of text averaging 11.5cm. There are between 26 and 32 lines (rows) of text per page, although both {{the width of the}} rows and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> per page increase progressively. Rows of text at the bottom of each page are damaged (lacunose), with between 1–2 lines lacunose {{in the first quarter of}} the MS, 2–3 lines lacunose in the central half, and up to seven lines lacunose in the final quarter.|$|E
50|$|Longships can be {{classified}} into a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different types, depending on size, construction details, and prestige. The most common way to classify longships is by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rowing</b> positions on board.|$|R
30|$|In the {{scenario}} 1, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>row</b> and column {{components of the}} t–f representation of PCG signals must be augmented to achieve a stable behavior. In the case of EEG signals used in {{the scenario}} 2, both methods provided a stable behavior as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> components in <b>rows</b> and columns increased. Furthermore, the accuracy increased with a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> column components, whereas it got stable as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>row</b> components augmented. Since the column components {{are related to the}} temporal activity, and the row components are associated with the spectral variability, the behavior exhibited by the EEG signals can be interpreted as a smooth temporal activity with a higher spectral variability, while in PCG both temporal and spectral activities present a large variability.|$|R

25|$|The weaver needs {{a number}} of {{essential}} tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; {{and a pair of}} shears for trimming the pile after a row of knots, or a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows,</b> have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.|$|E
25|$|Around 200 stone monuments (taalos) {{are found}} in the northeastern Botiala site, most of which consist of cairns. The bigger cairns are covered in {{shingles}} and tend to be more sturdily constructed. There are a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> of standing stones (menhirs) on {{the eastern side of the}} structures, which are similar to those at Salweyn, a great cairn-held situated close to Heis. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments.|$|E
25|$|In 1775, a {{fire had}} {{destroyed}} the Royal Theatre which {{was located in}} one of the palace wings. The boxholders association together with Archduke Ferdinand seized the opportunity to build a prestigious new theatre. Charged with its design in 1776, Giuseppe Piermarini immediately decided not to use the old site but rather the ground made available after the closure of the convent of Santa Maria della Scala, hence the name Teatro alla Scala. Brick rather than wood was chosen as the building material and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> of boxes was increased to six. Additional rooms were included for various functions: there was a dance hall, a gaming room, workshops, cafes and restaurants. An extremely innovative feature, {{at least as far as}} Italian theatres were concerned, was the addition of an entrance for carriages. Access was further facilitated by widening the street now known as Santa Redegonda which had been a narrow old winding lane.|$|E

50|$|Although other Sudoku {{variations}} {{have different}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows,</b> columns, <b>numbers</b> and/or {{different kinds of}} constraints, they all involve possibilities and constraint sets, and thus {{can be seen as}} exact hitting set problems.|$|R
25|$|Assessing the {{accuracy}} of CT pulmonary angiography is hindered by the rapid changes in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines. According to a cohort study, single-slice spiral CT may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism. In this study, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity was 84%. In this study which had a prevalence of detection was 32%, the positive predictive value of 67.0% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. However, this study's results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study {{with a mixture of}} 4 slice and 16 slice scanners reported a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%, which means that it is a good test for ruling out a pulmonary embolism if it is not seen on imaging and that it is very good at confirming a pulmonary embolism is present if it is seen. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results. CTPA is non-inferior to VQ scanning, and identifies more emboli (without necessarily improving the outcome) compared to VQ scanning.|$|E
500|$|The dorsal (or body) {{scales on}} the snake's body are {{arranged}} in rows {{along the length of}} their bodies. Adjacent rows are diagonally offset from each other. Most snakes have an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> across the body though certain species have an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> e.g. Zaocys spp. [...] In the case of some aquatic and marine snakes, the scales are granular and the rows cannot be counted.|$|E
500|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> {{range from}} ten in Tiger Ratsnake Spilotes pullatus; {{thirteen}} in Dryocalamus, Liopeltis, Calamaria and Asian coral snakes of genus Calliophis; 65 to 75 in pythons; 74 to 93 in Kolpophis and 130 to 150 in Acrochordus. The {{majority of the}} largest family of snakes, the Colubridae have [...] 15, 17 or 19 rows of scales. The maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rows</b> are in mid-body and they reduce in count towards the head and on the tail.|$|E
