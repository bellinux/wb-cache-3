50|$|Fisheries {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} in the 1970s by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to determine the fishery composition and life stages of estuarine fish using this specific bay. Sixty-six species were caught during these studies and, as in the Barnegat system, the catches were dominated by forage species, with bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) being very abundant. The top ranked fish by their relative abundance were: bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), sea herring (Clupea harengus), white perch (Morone americana), northern puffer (Sphoeroides maculatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), and striped anchovy (Anchoa hepsetus). Commercial fisheries activities include the harvest of <b>northern</b> <b>quahog</b> (Mercenaria mercenaria), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), white perch, winter flounder, and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). The bay is an important spawning and nursery area for blue crab. The area between Graveling Point and the Wading River tributaries supports large eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) beds, {{many of which are}} considered extremely productive seed beds.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for <b>northern</b> <b>quahog</b> and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, hatchery-growout {{culture of}} oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and <b>northern</b> <b>quahogs,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, has been commercially {{successful}} in Atlantic United States and oysters in Atlantic Canada. Culturists {{have not had}} success, as yet, with northern bay scallops, Argopecten irradians irradians. Large mortalities occur during the culture process, mainly because the scallops are relatively delicate and some die when handled. In addition, too little edible meat, i. e. the adductor muscle, is produced for the culture operation to be profitable. However, three companies, one in Massachusetts, one in New Brunswick, and one on Prince Edward Island, Canada, have discovered that they can produce bay scallops successfully by harvesting them when partially-to fully-grown and selling them whole. In restaurants, the scallops are cooked and served with all their meats (adductor muscles and rims) and also with the shells, which have been genetically-bred for bright colors. The scallop seed are produced in hatcheries and then grown in lantern or pearl nets and cages to market size. Thus far, production has been relatively small, just beyond the pilot-scale, until a larger demand develops for this product...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a broad}} {{historical}} {{overview of}} the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, fishery on the East and Gulf Coasts of North America (Fig. 1). For {{a little over a}} century, from about the mid 1870 ’s to the mid 1980 ’s, bay scallops supported large commercial fisheries mainly in the U. S. states of Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina and on smaller scales in the states in between and in western Florida. In these states, the annual harvests and dollar value of bay scallops were far smaller than those of the other important commercial mollusks, the eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and <b>northern</b> <b>quahogs,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, but they were higher than those of softshell clams, Mya arenaria (Table 1). The fishery had considerable economic importance in the states’ coastal towns, because bay scallops are a high-value product and the fishery was active during the winter months when the economies in most towns were otherwise slow. The scallops also had cultural importance as a special food, an ornament owing to its pretty shell design, and an interesting biological component o...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{response}} of adult <b>northern</b> <b>quahogs,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, to Aureococcus anophagefferens (brown tide) {{at the level}} of the gill was determined using video-endoscopy. Feeding activity, particle-approach velocities, and ventral-groove-transport velocities were documented after the quahogs were exposed to Isochryis galbana (baseline observations) supplemented with either toxic or nontoxic A. anophagefferens at two bloom concentrations (8 7 105 or 2 7 106 cells ml- 1). Externally, there was no evidence of adverse effects of brown tide on feeding, as siphons remained extended and dilated. Toxic brown tide at both concentrations elicited gill muscular contractions, intermittent cessation of water flow, and decreased particle loading within the pallial cavity. The 8 7 105 cell ml- 1 toxic treatment had no significant effect on approach velocities or ventral-groove-transport velocities after 2 h, although timeaveraging showed significant reduction of the latter during the last 30 min of exposure. The higher concentration of toxic brown tide caused a significant decrease in these velocities after only 1 h. Nontoxic brown tide produced none of these effects. Thus, A. anophagefferens compromised quahog feeding by stimulating contractions of the branchial musculature and interfering with lateral and ventral groove ciliary beating. These effects were both timeand concentration-dependent and could be caused by either a dopaminergic or a serotonergic toxic factor. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Possible interactions between this parasitic disease and exposure to the harmful dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum in M. mercenaria were studied experimentally. Quahogs from Massachusetts with variable intensity of QPX infection were exposed, under controlled laboratory conditions, to cultured P. minimum added to the natural plankton at a cell density equivalent to a natural bloom. After 5 days of exposure, individual clams were diagnosed histologically to assess prevalence and intensity of parasitic infection, {{as well as other}} pathological conditions. Further, cellular defense status of clams was evaluated by analyzing hemocyte parameters (morphological and functional) using flow-cytometry. Exposure of quahogs to P. minimum resulted in: a lower percentage of phagocytic hemocytes, higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), larger hemocyte size, more-numerous hemocytic aggregates, and increased numbers of hemocytes in gills accompanied by vacuolation and hyperplasia of the water-tubular epithelial cells of the gills. Quahogs had a low prevalence of QPX; by chance, the parasite was present only in quahogs exposed to P. minimum. Thus, the effect of QPX alone on the hemocyte parameters of quahogs could not be assessed in this experiment, but it was possible to assess different responses of infected versus non-infected quahogs to P. minimum. QPX-infected quahogs exposed to P. minimum had repressed percentage of phagocytic hemocytes, consistent with immuno-modulating effect of P. minimum upon several molluscan species, as well as smaller hemocytes and increased hemocyte infiltration throughout the soft tissues. This experiment demonstrates the importance of considering interactive effects of different factors on the immunology and histopathology of bivalve shellfish, and highlights the importance of considering the presence of parasites when bivalves are subjected to harmful-algal blooms...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{epizootiology}} is {{the study}} of environmental influences on the health of animals including disease incidence, persistence and transmission. It is a conceptual approach that unifies molecular biology, environmental sciences, and epidemiology for the purpose of identifying causes, classifying risks, and controlling health problems. Ecological epizootiology has been successfully applied in terrestrial systems, but its adaptation to marine ecosystems is relatively new. My dissertation uses this approach to evaluate the role of marine aggregates (i. e., marine snow, organic aggregates, flocs) in the ecology of Quahog Parasite X (QPX), a disease of <b>northern</b> <b>quahogs</b> (=hard clam), Mercenaria mercenaria. Marine aggregates are a ubiquitous feature of aquatic ecosystems, but have no terrestrial counterpart. They have the potential to serve as a link between aquatic pathogens (e. g., QPX) and benthic hosts (e. g., hard clams) in two ways: (1) as environmental reservoirs for pathogens embedded in aggregates; and (2) as vectors for aggregate-bound pathogens transported between hosts. The results of this research include the descriptive epizootiology of QPX disease in hard clams, along with the first quantitative assay for the QPX organism, and data to support QPX as a facultative pathogen. Evidence that QPX is facultative is critical because it supports that once QPX is established in a location, eradication will be difficult because QPX is capable of surviving on environmental resources other than hard clams. In this research, marine aggregates were characterized using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of suspended aggregates in modified settling cones. The results provide a starting point for determining the temporal and spatial scales at which aggregates influence persistence and transmission of aquatic pathogens. Overall, these results have important implications for the way in which aquatic pathogens are collected, quantified, and monitored for water quality assessments in shallow-water ecosystems. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>quahog,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, ranges {{along the}} Atlantic Coast of North America from the Canadian Maritimes to Florida, while the {{southern}} quahog, M. campechiensis, ranges mostly from Florida to southern Mexico. The <b>northern</b> <b>quahog</b> was fished by native North Americans during prehistoric periods. They used the meats as {{food and the}} shells as scrapers and as utensils. The European colonists copied the Indians treading method, and they also used short rakes for harvesting quahogs. The Indians of southern New England and Long Island, N. Y., made wampum from quahog shells, used it for ornaments and sold it to the colonists, who, in turn, traded it to other Indians for furs. During the late 1600 ’s, 1700 ’s, and 1800 ’s, wampum was made in small factories for eventual trading with Indians farther west for furs. The quahoging industry has provided people in many coastal communities with a means of earning a livelihood and has given consumers a tasty, wholesome food whether eaten raw, steamed, cooked in chowders, or as stuffed quahogs. More than a dozen methods and types of gear {{have been used in}} the last two centuries for harvesting quahogs. They include treading and using various types of rakes and dredges, both of which have undergone continuous improvements in design. Modern dredges are equipped with hydraulic jets and one type has an escalator to bring the quahogs continuously to the boats. In the early 1900 ’s, most provinces and states established regulations to conserve and maximize yields of their quahog stocks. They include a minimum size, now almost universally a 38 -mm shell width, and can include gear limitations and daily quotas. The United States produces far more quahogs than either Canada or Mexico. The leading producer in Canada is Prince Edward Island. In the United States, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island lead in quahog production in the north, while Virginia and North Carolina lead in the south. Connecticut and Florida were large producers in the 1990 ’s. The State of Tabasco leads in Mexican production. In the northeastern United States, the bays with large openings, and thus large exchanges of bay waters with ocean waters, have much larger stocks of quahogs and fisheries than bays with small openings and water exchanges. Quahog stocks in certified beds have been enhanced by transplanting stocks to them from stocks in uncertified waters and by planting seed grown in hatcheries, which grew in number from Massachusetts to Florida in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s...|$|E

Data on the percent prevalence of QPX infections were compiled from published reports along with our data to describe the epizootiology of QPX disease. QPX infections occurred in clams collected from both cultured beds and wild populations, but {{a higher percentage of}} QPX cases (76. 5 %) were from cultured clam beds. In addition, samples from cultured beds had a significantly higher prevalence (29. 2 ± 27. 2 %) of QPX infections compared with samples from wild populations (9. 6 ± 9. 6 %). The highest prevalence of QPX infections occurred in clams from samples with an intermediate size range (shell lengths 20 – 55 mm). QPX infections occurred in both male and female clams, but infection prevalence {{does not appear to be}} correlated with sex or sex ratios. The geographical range of QPX-related clam mortalities was Atlantic Canada to the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA. Only marginally significant differences were detected between the prevalence of QPX at different locations. There were no latitudinal gradients in QPX prevalence or frequencies, suggesting local factors were important in determining its distribution. Although QPX infections occurred throughout the year, no seasonal trends in the prevalence or frequencies of QPX were discernable. This summary of information available on QPX disease highlights the need for more thorough data collection regarding factors believed to be associated with its presence and severity in hard clams...|$|E

Exploratory trials were conducted using Argopecten irradians concentricus juveniles fed different algal diets: Isochrysis, Chaetoceros, Pavlova, Tetraselmis, or a mix of all four in a 2 : 1 : 2 : 2 ratio. No differences between {{the left and right}} valves were revealed, thus, subsequent analysis of the dietary influence on shell chemistry utilized both valves. Only Mg/Ca and K/Ca were significantly different between the diet groups, though different influences were determined. Experiments with juvenile Mercenaria mercenaria compared shell chemistries among clams fed unicellular diets of Isochrysis sp. (CCMP 1324), Pavlova pinguis (CCMP 609), Chaetoceros mulleri (CCMP 1316), Isochrysis sp. (CCMP 1611) culture, Pavlova sp.

The results indicate that diet can influence shell chemistry either directly or indirectly, with degree of influence varying by diet and mollusc species. Additional information concerning the use of alternative element ratios and changes in the shell chemistry due to starvation-induced stress are also presented. Altogether, the present research provides valuable information concerning shell dynamics and potential diet-associated fluxes, thus demonstrating the need to consider the composition of dietary inputs when assessing environmental associations with elemental shell chemistries...|$|E

Here, we test {{the hypothesis that}} extremely long-lived bivalves are not uniquely resistant to oxidative stressors (eg, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, as demonstrated in previous studies) but exhibit a multistress resistance phenotype. We contrasted resistance (in terms of organismal mortality) to genotoxic stresses (including topoisomerase inhibitors, agents that cross-link DNA or impair genomic integrity through DNA alkylation or methylation) and to mitochondrial oxidative stressors in three bivalve mollusc species with dramatically differing life spans: Arctica islandica (ocean quahog), Mercenaria mercenaria (<b>northern</b> <b>quahog),</b> and the Atlantic bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians (maximum species life spans: > 500, > 100, and ~ 2 years, respectively). With all stressors, the short-lived A i irradians were significantly less resistant than the two longer lived species. Arctica islandica were consistently more resistant than M mercenaria to mortality induced by oxidative stressors as well as DNA methylating agent nitrogen mustard and the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. The same trend was not observed for genotoxic agents that act through cross-linking DNA. In contrast, M mercenaria {{tended to be more}} resistant to epirubicin and genotoxic stressors, which cause DNA damage by inhibiting topoisomerases. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing resistance to genotoxic stressors in bivalve mollusc species with disparate longevities. In line with previous studies of comparative stress resistance and longevity, our data extends, at least in part, the evidence for the hypothesis that an association exists between longevity and a general resistance to multiplex stressors, not solely oxidative stress. This work also provides justification for further investigation into the interspecies differences in stress response signatures induced by a diverse array of stressors in short-lived and long-lived bivalves, including pharmacological agents that elicit endoplasmic reticulum stress and cellular stress caused by activation of innate immunity...|$|E

Within their respective ranges of distribution, these shellfish species can experience blooms of several HAB species, including Prorocentrum minimum, Heterosigma akashiwo, Alexandrium fundyense, Alexandrium minutum and Karenia spp.; thus, these algal species were chosen for testing. Possible differences in haemocyte variables attributable to harmful algae and also effects of haemolymph and haemocytes on the algae themselves were measured. Using microscopic and flow cytometric observations, changes were measured in haemocytes, including cell morphology, mortality, phagocytosis, adhesion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as changes in the physiology and {{the characteristics of the}} algal cells, including mortality, size, internal complexity and chlorophyll fluorescence. These experiments suggest different effects of the several species of harmful algae upon bivalve haemocytes. Some harmful algae act as immunostimulants, whereas others are immunosuppressive. P. minimum appears to activate haemocytes, but the other harmful algal species tested seem to cause a suppression of immune functions, generally consisting of decreases in phagocytosis, production of ROS and cell adhesion and besides cause an increase in the percentage of dead haemocytes, which could be attributable to the action of chemical toxins. Microalgal cells exposed to shellfish haemolymph generally showed evidence of algal degradation, e. g. loss of chlorophyll fluorescence and modification of cell shape. Thus, in vitro tests allow {{a better understanding of the}} role of the haemocytes and the haemolymph in the defence mechanisms protecting molluscan shellfish from harmful algal cells and could also be further developed to estimate the effects of HABs on bivalve molluscs in vivo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: The {{hard clam}} or <b>northern</b> <b>quahog,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, {{is one of}} the most {{valuable}} seafood products in the United States representing the first marine resource in some Northeastern states. Severe episodes of hard clam mortality have been consistently associated with infections caused by a thraustochytrid parasite called Quahog Parasite Unknown (QPX). QPX is considered as a cold/temperate water organism since the disease occurs only in the coastal waters of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from Maritime Canada to Virginia. High disease development at cold temperatures was also confirmed in laboratory studies and is thought to be caused predominantly by immunosuppression of the clam host even though the effect of temperature on QPX virulence has not been fully investigated. In this study, the QPX transcriptome was sequenced using Roche 454 technology to better characterize this microbe and initiate research on the molecular basis of QPX virulence towards hard clams. Results: Close to 18, 000 transcriptomic sequences were generated and functionally annotated. Results revealed a wide array of QPX putative virulence factors including a variety of peptidases, antioxidant enzymes, and proteins involved in extracellular mucus production and other secretory proteins potentially involved in interactions with the clam host. Furthermore, a 15 K oligonucleotide array was constructed and used to investigate the effect of temperature on QPX fitness and virulence factors. Results identified a set of QPX molecular chaperones that could explain its adaptation to cold temperatures. Finally, several virulence-related factors were up-regulated at low temperature providing molecular targets for further investigations of increased QPX pathogenicity in cold water conditions. Conclusions: This {{is one of the}} first studies to characterize the transcriptome of a parasitic labyrinthulid, offering new insights into the molecular bases of the pathogenicity of members of this group. Results from the oligoarray study demonstrated the ability of QPX to cope with a wide range of environmental temperatures, including those considered to be suboptimal for clam immunity (low temperature) providing a mechanistic scenario for disease distribution in the field and for high disease prevalence and intensity at low temperature. These results will serve as basis for studies aimed at a better characterization of specific putative virulence factors...|$|E

This study assessed {{the effects of}} exposure of these bivalves to K. brevis during their early development. In separate experiments, embryos of 2 - 4 cell stage of M. mercenaria and C. virginica were exposed to both whole and lysed K. brevis cells isolated from Manasota Key, Florida. Low bloom concentrations of 500 to 3000 cellsmL(- 1) were simulated for 96 h. Shell length, percent abnormality (and normality), and percent mortality of resulting larvae were measured. Percentages were recorded after 6, 24, and 96 h of exposure; larval shell length was measured at 24 and 96 h. For both quahogs and oysters, the effects of exposing embryos to K. brevis on all larval responses were generally dose- and time-dependent. Percent mortalities and abnormalities of both clam and oyster embryos increased significantly after only 6 h of exposure to whole cells of K. brevis. For clams, these parameters were significantly higher in whole and lysed treatments (at 3000 cellsmL(- 1)) than in controls. Percent mortalities of oysters were significantly higher in the whole-cell treatment (3000 cellsmL(- 1)) than under control conditions. After 24 h of exposure, mean larval shell length of both bivalve species was significantly reduced relative to controls. This was evident for clam larvae in both the lysed treatment at 1500 cellsmL(- 1) and in whole and lysed treatments at 3000 cellsmL(- 1), and for oyster larvae in the lysed treatment at 3000 cellsmL(- 1). After 96 h, both species exposed to the lysed cell treatment at 3000 cellsmL(- 1) had significantly smaller larvae compared {{to those in the}} control. Overall, lysed cells of K. brevis had a more pronounced effect on shell length, percent abnormality, and mortality in both clams and oysters than did whole cells. Given the fact that blooms of K. brevis overlap with the spawning periods of these two bivalves, and that cells of this naked dinoflagellate are readily lysed by wave action, these results suggest that exposure to K. brevis during the early life history stages of clams and oysters could adversely affect their population recruitment. Further, the presence of whole or lysed cells of K. brevis in hatcheries could have a major negative impact on production...|$|E
