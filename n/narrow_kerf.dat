50|$|A {{splitter}} is {{a stationary}} blade of similar thickness to the rotating saw blade mounted behind it {{to prevent a}} board from pinching inward into the saw kerf and binding on the saw blade, potentially causing a dangerous kickback. Like a riving knife, its thickness should be greater than {{the body of the}} saw blade but thinner than its kerf. Blades with a <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> relative to their body are more susceptible to grabbing and kickback.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{relatively}} <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf,</b> {{water jet cutting}} can {{reduce the amount of}} scrap material produced, by allowing uncut parts to be nested more closely together than traditional cutting methods. Water jets use approximately 0.5 to(-) 1 gal L per minute (depending on the cutting head's orifice size), and the water can be recycled using a closed-loop system. Waste water usually is clean enough to filter and dispose of down a drain. The garnet abrasive is a non-toxic material that can be mostly recycled for repeated use; otherwise, it can usually be disposed in a landfill. Water jets also produce fewer airborne dust particles, smoke, fumes, and contaminants, reducing operator exposure to hazardous materials.|$|E

Linear scans using the maximum average power and different cutting directions and pulse durations are executed to measure the maximum cutting speeds. Then, cutting tests are performed by varying beam travel direction, pulse duration and cutting speed.

40|$|Abstract. A newly {{developed}} multi-wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) method would accomplish the high performance slicing of silicon and silicon carbide with a <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> width under a clean process environment. However, the thinner wire is challenging process with a normal round shape wire electrode. Therefore, a new wire electrode with track-shaped section was proposed {{in order to satisfy}} both the <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> width and the high wire tension even in the case of thin wire electrode. In this study, the running control of wire electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated, and the possibility of proposed process was discussed. A brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section of aspect ratio 1 : 2 could perform the smaller vibration and the stable running up to 300 m/min. The side support method with fixture plates could improve the running stability of brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section and reduce the kerf width. The brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section could accomplish the uniform and straight kerf shape by increasing the wire tension...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} laser micro-cutting of shape memory alloys, which is {{currently}} used in the manufacturing of micro components such as miniaturized actuators in robotic systems and coronary stents in medicine. The influence of the laser pulse energy {{on the characteristics of}} micro-cuts produced in 400 μm thick sheets of nickel-titanium alloy, by means of a flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser, was investigated. Experimental results showed that micro-cuts produced using this laser are characterized by a <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> width, cut surfaces with a high perpendicularity and low roughness, and the absence of dross in the bottom side when the pulse duration is reduced to 0. 25 ms. In particular, {{it was found that the}} minimum kerf width is approximately 60 μm and the Ra values of cut surfaces are in the range of 1 - 2 μm. Since a single laser scan is sufficient to produce micro-cuts, when using such lasers it is also possible to achieve shorter machining times than the ones obtainable by ultra short pulse lasers, which still have the advantage to induce negligible heat affected zones...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} 10 years, the laser {{process has been}} studied for {{dismantling}} work; however, relatively few research works have addressed the effect of high-power fiber laser cutting for thick sections. Since in the nuclear sector, a significant quantity of thick material is required to be cut, this study aims to improve the reliability of laser cutting for such work and indicates guidelines to optimize the cutting procedure, in particular, nozzle combinations (standoff distance and focus position), to minimize waste material. The results obtained show the performance levels that can be reached with 10  kW fiber lasers, using which {{it is possible to}} obtain <b>narrower</b> <b>kerfs</b> than those found in published results obtained with other lasers. Nonetheless, fiber lasers appear to show the same effects as those of CO 2 and ND:YAG lasers. Thus, the main factor that affects the kerf width is the focal position, which means that minimum laser spot diameters are advised for smaller kerf widths...|$|R
40|$|In {{hot press}} forming, changes of {{mechanical}} properties in boron steel blanks {{have been a}} setback in trimming the final shape components. This paper presents investigation of kerf width and heat affected zone (HAZ) of ultra high strength 22 MnB 5 steel cutting. Sample cutting was conducted using a 4 kW Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) laser machine with 10. 6 µm wavelength with the laser spot size of 0. 2 mm. A response surface methodology (RSM) using three level Box-Behnken design of experiment was developed with three factors of peak power, cutting speed and duty cycle. The parameters were optimised for minimum kerf width and HAZ formation. Optical evaluation using MITUTOYO TM 505 were conducted to measure the kerf width and HAZ region. From the findings, laser duty cycle was crucial to determine cutting quality of ultra-high strength steel; followed by cutting speed and laser power. Meanwhile, low power intensity with continuous wave contributes the <b>narrowest</b> <b>kerf</b> width formation and least HAZ region...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the recent}} years the novel fiber laser {{technology}} and its potentials have been exciting laser manufacturers as well as researchers and industrial users. Fiber lasers with their excellent beam quality promised noticeable advantages and improvements in high precision and micro material processing. Besides the excellent beam quality there are more advantages of the fiber laser technology such as compact installation size, high laser efficiency, moderate system price and easy to be integrated. The paper {{presents the results of}} extensive comparative tests of short pulse fiber laser systems and a common q-switch rod solid state laser with nearly identical system parameters. The intention was to determine the specific advantages in practical application work. Where are the advantage and how large are the improvements? Therefore typical applications of laser micro machining have been chosen - drilling, cutting and lateral material removal as well as marking. By choosing different materials like aluminum, silicon and ruby a broad field has been examined. Distinct improvements have been proven in several applications especially regarding precision and surface quality of the created structures. Under almost identical conditions the fiber laser achieved more <b>narrow</b> cutting <b>kerfs</b> and smaller hole diameters compared to the rod laser system...|$|R
40|$|Fiber laser {{has many}} {{advantages}} such as compact size, high conversion efficiency, good beam mode, air cooling and maintenance free. Therefore, it has high possibility as an industrial light {{source in the}} near future. The beam from fiber laser can be focused in a micro spot because of its excellent beam quality. However, the <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> leads {{to the difficulty of}} outflow of melted mate-rial. Therefore, micro cutting by a single-mode fiber laser is considerably difficult, then the high performance nozzles are strongly required. In the previous work, authors developed a high perform-ance nozzle, which can increase the velocity of assist gas flow and makes it possible to reduce the dross in the micro kerf. Therefore, high performance cutting by a single-mode fiber laser can be ex-pected by using our newly designed nozzle. In this study, the effect of nozzle shape on the machin-ing results in precision cutting of thin copper plate by a Q-switched single-mode fiber laser was ex-perimentally investigated. It was found that the high speed cutting at 30 mm/s could be carried out by the high performance nozzle under low pulse frequency condition. Besides, the reduction of the dross and good kerf shape could be attained in the case of nitrogen assist gas...|$|E
40|$|Laser cutting is {{the largest}} laser {{material}} processing technology deployed in modern industries, and the 10. 6 µm wavelength CO 2 laser is the most used laser source for this process. One advantage that lasers have over conventional thermal cutting processes, such as plasma and flame, is the instantaneous energy transfer, and <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf,</b> which can result in higher cutting speed and therefore lower processing cost. Normally, in the laser cutting process, a minimum focus beam diameter is located on or into the material surface; depending on the laser power density, this leads to melting and vaporisation of the material. A gas jet, coaxial with the laser beam, creates a narrow kerf-channel and flushes away the melted volume of material; but the process becomes less effective as the material thickness increases and conventional cutting using lasers in the 2 to 6 kW power range is restricted to a thickness of less than 25 mm in stainless steel. However, using an oxygen assist gas jet on carbon steel allows thicker material to be cut, since in addition to blowing away the debris the exothermic oxidation reaction can add 25 % more energy to the cutting process.

40|$|Laser {{material}} processing is an enabling technology {{that has resulted}} in revolutionary product designs as well as novel manufacturing practices that have improved quality, productivity and flexibility in industry. Laser technology has changed precision drilling capabilities in the manufacturing industries. The highly focused beam of collimated light emits energy allowing the laser to drill accurate patterns of holes into extremely difficult-to-machine materials such as ceramics. With drill contact eliminated, a minimal heat affected zone (HAZ), and <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf,</b> ceramics can be drilled without distortion of the finished product. Although the use of lasers for drilling of structural ceramics has increased rapidly in recent years, the failures due to high thermal stresses and brittleness of the ceramic structures are still a major problem for manufacturing industries. Figure 1 shows a cracked alumina plate after laser drilling. Temperature gradients that occur during laser-material interaction result in strong thermal stresses in the heat affected zone. Due to the high thermal stresses and short process time (nanoseconds), many micro- cracks initiate and propagate through the ceramic. Sometimes, if thermal stress is high enough, the ceramic can fail [1]. Previous theoretical studies have some models of the laser machining of ceramics [1, 2]. Gross et. al. [2] investigated crack formation during laser drilling of silicon wafers...|$|E
5000|$|A {{serrated}} edge, such as on a saw or a bread knife, concentrates force {{onto the}} tips of the serrations which increases pressure as well as allowing soft or fibrous material (like wood, rope, bread, vegetables) to be expand into the spaces between serrations. Whereas pushing any knife, even a bread knife, down onto a bread loaf will just squash the loaf as bread has a low elastic modulus (is soft) but high yield strain (loosely, can be stretched or squashed by a large proportion without breaking), drawing serrations across the loaf with little downward force will allow each serration to simultaneously cut the bread with much less deformation of the loaf. Similarly, pushing on a rope tends to squash the rope while drawing serrations across it sheers the rope fibres. Drawing a smooth blade is less effective as the blade is parallel to the direction draw but the serrations of a serrated blade are at an angle to the fibres. Serrations on knives are often symmetric allowing the blade to cut on both the forward and reverse strokes of a cut, a notable exception being Veff serrations which are designed to maximise cutting power while moving the blade away from the user. Saw blade serrations, for both wood and metal, are typically asymmetrical so that they cut while moving in only one direction. (Saws act by abrading a material into dust along a <b>narrow</b> channel, the <b>kerf,</b> whereas knives and similar act by forcing the material apart. This means that saws result in a loss of material and the serrations of a saw also serve to carry metal swarf and sawdust out of the cut channel.) ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedFabrication of {{high-frequency}} (30 MHz - 50 MHz) ultrasonic linear arrays {{is still}} a challenge. The task is {{even more difficult to}} build arrays at a frequency higher than 100 MHz, which has the potential to provide more detail skin texture for early diagnosis of melanoma or to image small objects such as stem cells. Integrating of PZT films into MEMS micro-machined is a potential solution to such high-frequency applications. This thesis presents the development of high-frequency (~ 100 MHz) PZT thick-film transducers and arrays.; PZT thick films thicker than 10 µm were fabricated with a composite spin-coating method. The functional properties of the films were improved by optimization of composite solution ball-milling time, PZT sol-gel to powder mass ratio and sol-gel infiltration process. Films suitable for high frequency ultrasonic transducer applications were produced and characterized. The films were found to have a remanent polarization of 37 µC/cm 2, a dielectric constant of 1250 (at 1 kHz), and electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt) of 0. 34.; High-frequency (~ 100 MHz) single-element transducers and linear arrays were afterwards fabricated with the PZT films. The single-element transducer was constructed by transferring the film from silicon substrate to E-solder backing material. The finished transducer was found to have a center frequency of 120 MHz and a bandwidth of 60 % with a layer of parylene. Ultrasonic images of the porcine eyeball and normal human skin were also successfully acquired with the transducer. 32 -element kerfless high-frequency linear array was fabricated with a 12 -µm PZT film by photolithography. The array had a center frequency of 120 MHz, a bandwidth of 60 % with parylene matching and an insertion loss of 41 dB. Performance of the array was compared to a PZT- 5 H ceramic sheet kerfless array fabricated with an identical array pattern.; The development of 32 -element kerfed arrays was also presented. DRIE dry-etching technique was investigated to produce an array with sharp element edges (profile angle > 85 º) and <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> (~ 12 µm).

40|$|Titanium and its alloys are {{nowadays}} {{widely used}} in many sectors: in the medical field (orthopedic and dental ones), in the architectural field, in the chemical plants field and in aeronautic [1]. In this last field it {{is more and more}} used both for its contribution to make lightweight and time durable structures and for its compatibility with new materials, first of all Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP). Cutting of titanium sheets is one of the primary requirements in the fabrication of most of the components. Laser cutting offers several advantages over conventional cutting methods. It includes <b>narrow</b> <b>kerf</b> width (minimum material lost), straight cut edges, low roughness of cut surfaces, minimum metallurgical and surface distortions, easy integration with computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines for cutting complex profiles and importantly non-contact nature of the process (suitable for cutting in hostile environments and in areas with limited access) [2]. However, due to very limited literature available on laser cutting of titanium, {{it is very difficult to}} predict the cut surface quality and optimum process parameters for laser cutting, especially when dross-free cuts are required. Laser cutting of titanium and titanium alloys needs to be carried out with an inert gas, this due to the high reactivity of the titanium with the oxygen at high temperatures [3]. However when the available power is limited, as in the present case, the use of a reactive gas (air) can help to achieve cutting speed value reasonable for industrial applications. The aim of this work is to study the cutting of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rolled sheets 1 mm in thickness, by means of a 100 W fibre laser, (SPI-Red Power) working at wavelength  = 1090 nm. The maximum cutting speed were measured in both CW and pulsed regime at different mean power and different duration. Furthermore, the kerf geometry and the heat affected zone (HAZ) were studied decreasing the cutting speed from the maximum to the 80 % of this values. The results obtained showed that both the power and the cutting speed influence the cutting kerf geometry and HAZ. In particular the synergy of power and speed, resulting roughly into the heat input, seems to rule the whole cutting process...|$|E
