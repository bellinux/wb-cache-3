5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the <b>nucleotid</b> sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E

40|$|Estrogen is a {{steroid hormone}} that plays an {{important}} role during sperm development in the male and female reproductive tract. Estrogen signalling is a complex process that depends on cell milieu and presence of receptors. Thanks to the steroid nature of estrogens, they can pass through the plasmatic membrane and bind to the intracellular estrogen receptors (ERs). Within the cell, there are several pools of ERs. One of them is localized to the cell nucleus and their activation leads to direct or indirect binding to DNA and ultimately to alternation in gene expression (genomic pathway). Other pools of ERs are associated with plasma membrane or are located in cytosol. Activation of membrane associated ERs leads to rapid non-genomic responses. Nowadays, two classical estrogen receptors are known – ERα and ERβ. Since ERβ is a predominant variant in testes, we focused our study on expression of ERβ variants in murine testes and sperm. We detected two variants of ERβ at mRNA level in both, testes and sperm. These variants differ in 54 <b>nucleotids</b> within the ligand binding domain and this variability results in different affinity to estrogen. We analyzed individual testicular cell types (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, Sertoli cells) by RT-qPCR. Our results suggest that both ERβ variants are coexpressed in the same cell type and may therefore interact together. This may have consequences in mediating of estrogen signalling. Moreover, ERβ is expressed more in the later stages of spermatogenesis suggesting the role of ERβ in these stages or alternatively in spermatozoa alone. At the protein level, we detected ERβ in nuclear, membrane and cytosolic fraction prepared from testicular tissue suggesting the involvement of both, genomic and non-genomic, pathways of estrogen signaling in testes. In sperm, anti-ERβ antibodies localized ERβ in acrosome region and tail which is in accordance with the known role of estrogen on capacitation, acrosome reaction and motility...|$|R

40|$|Dugesia is a genus of {{free-living}} flatworms which species inhabit freshwater bodies {{across a}} wide distribution range that includes Africa, Madagascar, Eurasia and Australasia. They do not survive in salt water or under desiccation conditions. All Dugesia species have a characteristic triangular-shaped head with two eyes and an elongated and dorsoventrally flattened body. This general shape makes them recognizable to non-experts that also know them because of their regeneration capabilities. The two first works of this thesis {{are focused on the}} Dugesia historical biogeography. In first place we studied its species on Greece, because of its complex and well-known geological history and the high diversity of species known on the area. The results showed interesting evidences of the diversification of the genus on the area driven by its history of geological breakage since the Neogene, by the contact and severing of ancient freshwater bodies, and probably by changes in the sea level of the Mediterranean. We also observed patterns of dispersion in the Greek mainland and the Peloponnese. In a second work we included the whole Dugesia distribution range. The aim was to test the previous hypotheses on the antiquity and dispersal routes of the genus to its present geographical distribution. The last hypothesis proposed an African origin in a Gondwanan scenario during the Mesozoic period followed by a dispersion in Eurasia through the impact of the Indian subcontinent or through the impact of the Arabian plate. Our results suggest an older origin, being the genus already present on Pangaea before its breakage. Taking into account this old origin and the internal and external homogeneity of the Dugesia genus species, this is probably a case of long-term or extreme morphological stasis. The copulatory apparatus is essential for Dugesia species description and identification. However, fissiparous specimens do not have this organ, making impossible to know which species are we dealing with. In other cases the inner morphology is very similar or identical among different species, hindering the species identification. In these cases the use of molecular species delimitation methods are of major interest {{in order to try to}} overcome these morphology associated drawbacks. In a third work we used one of these methods called General Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) together with morphological data in an integrative taxonomy framework in order to describe new species from Greece and to give more support to those already described. We formally described four new Dugesia species and the new genus Recurva containing two species and a putative third one. For those clades delimited by the GMYC method for which we did not have any or incomplete morphological data we proposed two different categories: Unconfirmed or Confirmed Candidate Species. The use of molecular species delimitation methods seems to be very convenient when dealing with freshwater flatworms. At the beginning of this thesis we aimed to obtain more molecular markers by the obtention of complete mitogenomes from different triclad species. Unfortunately, this work was delayed and finally we did not succeed in the obtention of a Dugesia mitogenome but of Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) and Obama sp. (Geoplanidae). We took advantatge of these new free-living flatworm mitogenomes and we carried out an evolutionary analysis comparing them with those of parasitic flatworms in order to test if, as previously thought, the different lifecycles have had a selective effect on the nucleotide composition of the mitogenomes. Surprisingly, our results showed a more relaxed selection in the Geoplanoidea species (Dugesia, Obama and Schmidtea) in comparison with the parasitic platihelminths and Crenobia. Dugesia és un gènere de planàries de vida lliure que habita en les l'aigües dolces d'Àfrica, Madagascar, Eurasia i Australàsia. Són organismes fràgils que no poden sobreviure en aigua salada ni en condicions de dessecació. Les Dugesia tenen un cap triangular amb dos ulls molt característic i un cos allargat i aplanat dorsoventralment. Són conegudes popularment per les seves capacitats de regeneració. Els dos primers treballs d'aquesta tesi s'ha centrat en la biogeografia històrica de les Dugesia. Primerament vam fer un estudi de les espècies que habiten a Grècia, degut a la seva història geològica complexa i ben coneguda. Els resultats mostraren evidències de la diversificació del gènere com a conseqüència de la fragmentació d'aquesta regió, del contacte i aïllament històric dels diferents cossos d'aigua dolça i dels canvis eustàtics. El segon treball de biogeografia històrica inclou tota la distribució de Dugesia, amb el propòsit de testar les hipòtesis prèvies que han volgut explicar l'antiguitat i rutes de dispersió del gènere fins a ocupar la distribució actual. Els nostres resultats descarten un origen sobre Gondwana, com s'havia proposat anteriorment, seguit per una dispersió a Eurasia a través de l'Índia o per la península Aràbiga. Dugesia s'hauria originat al supercontinent Pangea abans del seu trencament. En un tercer treball hem emprat el mètode molecular de delimitació d'espècies General Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) sobre Dugesia gregues. Vam combinar-ne els resultats amb els d'anàlisis morfològiques per identificar i descriure diverses espècies. Aquells clades delimitats pel GMYC pels quals no disposavem de dades morfològiques o bé eren incompletes van ser proposats com a espècies candidates confirmades o per confirmar. Vam descriure formalment quatre espècies de Dugesia i el nou gènere Recurva. En un treball diferent vam obtenir els mitogenomes de Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) i Obama sp. (Geoplanidae). Malgrat no aconseguir un mitogenoma de Dugesia vam aprofitar la disponibilitat de les noves molècules per realitzar una anàlisi evolutiva comparant-les amb les de platihelmints paràsits per comprovar si, tal i com s'havia proposat, els diferents tipus de vida tenen un efecte selectiu sobre la composició dels <b>nuclèotids.</b> Sorprenentment els nostres resultats mostren una selecció més relaxada en planàries de vida lliure...|$|R

We have now investigated the role of this motif in several steps of DNA replication and in two DNA repair pathways. RPA m associates with T antigen, assists the unwinding of double-stranded DNA at an origin of replication, stimulates DNA polymerases � and �, and supports {{the formation of the}} initial short Okazaki fragments. However, the synthesis of a leading strand and later Okazaki fragments is impaired. In contrast, RPA m can function well during the incision step of <b>nucleotid...</b>|$|E
