40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} the presence of protein inclusions with a different protein content {{depending on the type of}} disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are no exceptions to this common theme. In most ALS and FTLD cases, the predominant pathological species are RNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, these proteins are both depleted from their normal nuclear localization and aggregated in the cytoplasm. This key pathological feature has suggested a potential dual mechanism with both <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> of function and cytoplasmic gain of function being at play. Yet, why and how this pathological cascade is initiated in most patients, and especially sporadic cases, is currently unresolved. Recent breakthroughs in C 9 orf 72 ALS/FTLD disease models point at a pivotal role for the nuclear transport system in toxicity. To address whether defects in nuclear transport are indeed implicated in the disease, we reviewed two decades of ALS/FTLD literature and combined this with bioinformatic analyses. We find that both RNA-binding proteins and nuclear transport factors are key players in ALS/FTLD pathology. Moreover, our analyses suggest that disturbances in nucleocytoplasmic transport play a crucial initiating role in the disease, by bridging both <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> and cytoplasmic gain of functions. These findings highlight this process as a novel and promising therapeutic target for ALS and FTLD. status: publishe...|$|E

The constancy of the exponents α and β in the known dependences of the yield on energy Y_n ∝ E_μ^α and the atomic weight Y_n ∝ A^β allows to combine these dependences in a single formula and to connect the yield with muon energy loss in the matter.

40|$|FUS is an RNA‐binding protein {{involved}} in {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cytoplasmic FUS‐containing aggregates are often associated with concomitant loss of nuclear FUS. Whether loss of nuclear FUS function, gain of a cytoplasmic function, {{or a combination of}} both lead to neurodegeneration remains elusive. To address this question, we generated knockin mice expressing mislocalized cytoplasmic FUS and complete FUS knockout mice. Both mouse models display similar perinatal lethality with respiratory insufficiency, reduced body weight and length, and largely similar alterations in gene expression and mRNA splicing patterns, indicating that mislocalized FUS results in loss of its normal function. However, FUS knockin mice, but not FUS knockout mice, display reduced motor neuron numbers at birth, associated with enhanced motor neuron apoptosis, which can be rescued by cell‐specific CRE‐mediated expression of wild‐type FUS within motor neurons.

40|$|Peptidoglycan {{recognition}} proteins (PGRPs) are mediators of {{innate immunity}} and recently have {{been implicated in}} developmental regulation. To explore the interplay between these two roles, we characterized a PGRP in the host squid Euprymna scolopes (EsPGRP 1) during colonization by the mutualistic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Previous research on the squid-vibrio symbiosis had shown that, upon colonization of deep epithelium-lined crypts of the host light organ, symbiont-derived peptidoglycan monomers induce apoptosis-mediated regression of remote epithelial fields involved in the inoculation process. In this study, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that EsPGRP 1 localizes to the nuclei of epithelial cells, and symbiont colonization induces the loss of EsPGRP 1 from apoptotic nuclei. The loss of nuclear EsPGRP 1 occurred prior to DNA cleavage and breakdown of the nuclear membrane, but followed chromatin condensation, suggesting that it occurs during late-stage apoptosis. Experiments with purified peptidoglycan monomers and with V. fischeri mutants defective in peptidoglycan-monomer release provided evidence that these molecules trigger <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> of EsPGRP 1 and apoptosis.

30|$|When the {{energetic}} ions collide with the target atoms of the deposited Co film, {{there are two}} types of energy <b>loss</b> mechanisms - <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>loss</b> (dominant in the keV energy range) and electronic energy loss (which is dominant in the MeV energy range). In our experiment, 45 -MeV Li 3 + and 100 -MeV O 7 + ions have <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>loss</b> of 0.1762 and 1.224 keV/μm, respectively, and electronic energy loss of 3.098 × 102 and 2.076 × 103 keV/μm, respectively.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that muscle atrophy is accompanied by apoptotic loss of myonuclei and therefore recovery would require replenishment by muscle stem cells. We used in vivo time-lapse microscopy to observe the loss and replenishment of myonuclei in murine muscle fibers following induced muscle atrophy.

Muscles were inactivated by denervation, nerve impulse block, or mechanical unloading. Nuclei were stained in vivo either acutely by intracellular injection of fluorescent oligonucleotides or in time-lapse studies after transfection with a plasmid encoding GFP with a nuclear localization signal. We observed no loss of myonuclei in fast- or slow-twitch muscle fibers despite a greater than 50 % reduction in fiber cross-sectional area. TUNEL labeling of fragmented DNA on histological sections revealed high levels of apoptotic nuclei in inactive muscles. However, when costained for laminin and dystrophin, virtually none of the TUNEL-positive nuclei could be classified as myonuclei; apoptosis was confined to stromal and satellite cells.

40|$|International audienceMuscle fibers are {{the cells}} in the body with the largest volume, and they have {{multiple}} nuclei serving different domains of cytoplasm. A large body of previous literature has suggested that atrophy induced by hindlimb suspension leads {{to a loss of}} "excessive" myonuclei by apoptosis. We demonstrate here that atrophy induced by hindlimb suspension does not lead to loss of myonuclei despite a strong increase in apoptotic activity of other types of nuclei within the muscle tissue. Thus hindlimb suspension turns out to be similar to other atrophy models such as denervation, nerve impulse block, and antagonist ablation. We discuss how the different outcome of various studies can be attributed to difficulties in separating myonuclei from other nuclei, and to systematic differences in passive properties between normal and unloaded muscles. During reload, after hindlimb suspension, a radial regrowth is observed, which has been believed to be accompanied by recruitment of new myonuclei from satellite cells. The lack of <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> during unloading, however, puts these findings into question. We observed that reload led to an increase in cross sectional area of 59 %, and fiber size was completely restored to the presuspension levels. Despite this notable growth there was no {{increase in the number of}} myonuclei. Thus radial regrowth seems to differ from de novo hypertrophy in that nuclei are only added during the latter.

40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{identification and}} mechanistic analysis of reproductive toxicants constitutes {{one of the}} major hurdles in the toxicological assessment of chemicals originating from the large number of chemicals to be tested and the difficulty in examining germ cells at various stages of their development. We previously described the development of an assay in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the detection of chemicals bearing aneugenic activity and {{that could be used for}} the detection of germline toxicity. We present here new evidence for the reproductive toxicity of three pesticides identified in our germline toxicity assay: Maneb, Diazinon and Fenarimol. We show that all three pesticides cause an acute germline <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> in exposed nematodes in a dose-dependent fashion. The loss of germline nuclei coincides with the meiotic stage of pachytene during Prophase I and is dependent on the germline apoptotic machinery suggesting activation of a meiotic checkpoint. Further investigation revealed a profound dysregulation of the meiotic program revealed by (1) an alteration of the kinetics of double strand repair, (2) the disruption of the process of chromosome morphogenesis at the end of Prophase I and (3) the reorganization of the meiotic differentiation gradient inherent to the C. elegans germline following exposure to Maneb and Diazinon. These defects correlate with a significant increase in embryonic lethality and a corresponding decrease in the number of progeny. These results therefore provide strong evidence for the reproductive toxicity of Maneb, Diazinon and Fenarimol rooted in the alteration of early steps of germ cell differentiation...|$|E

40|$|Aggregations of fused in sarcoma (FUS), a {{multifunctional}} RNA processing protein, {{define a}} pathological subtype of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), whilst mutations in the FUS gene are causative for ALS. To model the impact of FUS mutations, expression vectors containing the entire genomic sequence of FUS, up and downstream regions, and native promoter sequences have been generated. The constructs have been tagged with an mCherry fluorescent tag, and three separate pathological mutations (R 244 C, R 521 C, and P 525 L) have been separately inserted. Transgenic mice have been generated using the WT and P 525 L FUS vectors to provide a highly physiological model of FUS in disease. Within transfected HEK 293 cells, insertion of the P 525 L and R 521 C FUS mutations leads to relocalisation of FUS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. R 521 C and P 525 L mutant FUS incorporates into cytoplasmic aggregations of untranslated mRNA and RNA binding proteins known as stress granules. The strong relocalisation seen with P 525 L-FUS {{is associated with a}} gain of cytotoxicity. Reversal of this cytoplasmic relocalisation by demethylation of FUS rescues this cytotoxicity, suggesting a toxic gain of cytoplasmic function in the majority of FUS mutations. By contrast, insertion of the R 244 C mutation leads to neither relocalisation, stress granule association, nor cytotoxicity. Notably the R 244 C mutation, located away from the nuclear localization domain in which the majority of FUS mutations are found, leads to the presence of smaller FUS fragments in western blot analyses. These fragments appear not to be due to splicing defects in FUS but rather are due to post-translational modifications or aberrant protein cleavage. These data suggest an alternative pathway for FUS toxicity based upon a <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> of function. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and the CH 1 {{domain of the}} transcriptional coactivator p 300 /CBP {{is necessary for the}} expression of hypoxia responsive genes and tumor angiogenesis. The transcription factor CITED 2 binds p 300 /CBP at the CH 1 domain and functions as a negative regulator of hypoxia signaling by competing with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. CITED 4, a recently identified member of the CITED family, binds p 300 /CBP via the CH 1 domain and functions as a coactivator for transcription factor AP- 2. Here, we show that CITED 4 blocks the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha to p 300 in vitro and inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha transactivation and hypoxia-mediated reporter gene activation. These studies suggest that CITED 4 might function as an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. To explore the function of CITED 4 in breast cancer, we determined its expression in normal, in situ and invasive breast cancers. We also correlated its expression in 286 invasive breast tumors with clinicopathological, hypoxia markers and survival. In contrast to the nuclear localization of CITED 4 in normal breast tissue, breast tumors were characterized by cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. Nuclear CITED 4 expression was significantly inversely associated with tumor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (P < 0. 05), tumor size (P = 0. 03), tumor grade (P = 0. 0001), and Chalkley vessel count (P = 0. 04). CITED 4 showed no significant correlation with patient age (P = 0. 45), estrogen receptor (P = 0. 11), or epidermal growth factor receptor (P = 0. 48).

40|$|Mutations in {{the human}} Cu/Zn {{superoxide}} dismutase type- 1 (hSOD 1) gene are common in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). The pathophysiology has been linked to, e. g., organelle dysfunction, RNA metabolism and oxidative DNA damage conferred by SOD 1 malfunction. However, apart from metabolically evoked DNA oxidation, {{it is unclear whether}} severe genotoxicity including DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs), originates from loss of function of nuclear SOD 1 enzyme. Factors that endogenously interfere with DNA integrity and repair complexes in hSOD 1 -mediated fALS remain similarly unexplored. In this regard, uncontrolled activation of transposable elements (TEs) might contribute to DNA disintegration and neurodegeneration. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the role of the fALS-causing hSOD 1 G 93 A mutation in the generation of severe DNA damage beyond well-characterized DNA base oxidation. Therefore, DNA damage was assessed in spinal tissue of hSOD 1 G 93 A-overexpressing mice and in corresponding motor neuron-enriched cell cultures in vitro. Overexpression of the hSOD 1 G 93 A locus did not change the threshold for severe DNA damage per se. We found that levels of SSBs and DSBs were unaltered between hSOD 1 G 93 A and control conditions, as demonstrated in post-mitotic motor neurons and in astrocytes susceptible to replication-dependent DNA breakage. Analogously, parameters indicative of DNA damage response processes were not activated in vivo or in vitro.

40|$|Intrinsic {{resistance}} to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; HER 1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib, and more generally to EGFR TKIs, is a common phenomenon in breast cancer. The availability of molecular criteria for predicting sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs is, therefore, the most relevant issue for their correct use and for planning future research. Though it appears that in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) response to gefitinib {{is directly related to}} the occurrence of specific mutations in the EGFR TK domain, breast cancer patients cannot be selected for treatment with gefitinib on the same basis as such EGFR mutations have been reported neither in primary breast carcinomas nor in several breast cancer cell lines. Alternatively, there is a general agreement on the hypothesis that the occurrence of molecular alterations that activate transduction pathways downstream of EGFR (i. e., MEK 1 /MEK 2 - ERK 1 / 2 MAPK and PI- 3 'K - AKT growth/survival signaling cascades) significantly affect the response to EGFR TKIs in breast carcinomas. However, there are no studies so far addressing a role of EGF-related ligands as intrinsic breast cancer cell modulators of EGFR TKI efficacy. We recently monitored gene expression profiles and sub-cellular localization of HER- 1 /- 2 /- 3 /- 4 related ligands (i. e., EGF, amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-α, ß-cellulin, epiregulin and neuregulins) prior to and after gefitinib treatment in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines. First, gefitinibinduced changes in the endogenous levels of EGF-related ligands correlated with the natural degree of breast cancer cell sensitivity to gefitinib. While breast cancer cells intrinsically resistant to gefitinib (IC 50 ≥ 15 μM) markedly up-regulated (up to 600 times) the expression of genes codifying for HERspecific ligands, a significant down-regulation (up to 106 times) of HER ligand gene transcription was found in breast cancer cells intrinsically sensitive to gefitinib (IC 50 ≤ 1 μM). Second, loss of HER 1 function differentially regulated the nuclear trafficking of HER-related ligands. While gefitinib treatment induced an active import and nuclear accumulation of the HER ligand NRG in intrinsically gefitinib-resistant breast cancer cells, an active export and <b>nuclear</b> <b>loss</b> of NRG was observed in intrinsically gefitinib-sensitive breast cancer cells. In summary, through in vitro and pharmacodynamic studies we have learned that, besides mutations in the HER 1 gene, oncogenic changes downstream of HER 1 are the key players regulating gefitinib efficacy in breast cancer cells. It now appears that pharmacological inhibition of HER 1 function also leads to striking changes in both the gene expression and the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HER-specific ligands, and that this response correlates with the intrinsic degree of breast cancer sensitivity to the EGFR TKI gefitinib. The relevance of this previously unrecognized intracrine feedback to gefitinib warrants further studies as cancer cells could bypass the antiproliferative effects of HER 1 -targeted therapeutics without a need for the overexpression and/or activation of other HER family members and/or the activation of HER-driven downstream signaling cascade...|$|E

However, when compared with normal control cells, Apaf- 1 (-/-) or caspase- 3 (-/-) cells fail to exhibit oligonucleosomal chromatin digestion and a more advanced pattern of chromatin condensation (stage II). Microinjection of such cells with recombinant AIF only causes peripheral chromatin condensation (stage I), whereas microinjection with activated caspase- 3 or its downstream target caspase-activated DNAse (CAD) causes a more pronounced type of chromatin condensation (stage II). Similarly, when added to purified HeLa nuclei, AIF causes stage I chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation, whereas CAD induces stage II chromatin condensation and oligonucleosomal DNA degradation. Furthermore, in a cell-free system, concomitant neutralization of AIF and CAD is required to suppress the <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>loss</b> caused by cytoplasmic extracts from apoptotic wild-type cells. In contrast, AIF depletion alone suffices to suppress the <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>loss</b> contained in extracts from apoptotic Apaf- 1 (-/-) or caspase- 3 (-/-) cells. As a result, at least two redundant parallel pathways may lead to chromatin processing during apoptosis. One of these pathways involves Apaf- 1 and caspases, as well as CAD, and leads to oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and advanced chromatin condensation. The other pathway, which is caspase-independent, involves AIF and leads to large-scale DNA fragmentation and peripheral chromatin condensation.

Quantitative photometric data demonstrate that developing spermatids lose {{a significant proportion}} of their nuclear proteins, as evidenced by diminishing binding of fluorodinitrobenzene. Photometric results also show that much (but not all) of the spermatid <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>loss</b> is in somatictype histone, as evidenced by a dramatic fall in the histone/DNA ratio of these cells during a period in which nuclear DNA content remains constant. By the end of spermiogenesis, the sperm nuclear histone and protamine content is approximately zero, whereas some nonbasic protein persists. <b>Loss</b> of spermatid <b>nuclear</b> somatic-type histone is not accompanied by synthesis of gamete-type histone (e. g. protamine or arginine-rich histone), showing that the processes of displacement and synthesis of nuclear basic proteins during histone transition are not subject to obligatory coupling. Labeling studies suggest that nonbasic acrosomal proteins (presumably partly enzymes) are synthesized in the cytoplasm, after which they move into the acrosome. Stainable basic proteins accumulate in the acrosome during precisely the period of <b>nuclear</b> somatic histone <b>loss,</b> suggesting nuclear-cytoplasmic transfer...|$|R
