40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{whether the}} combinations of cash flow components segregated by activities help predict impending financial distress {{relative to other}} financial information. Firms experience financial distress if they cannot generate adequate cash to meet their needs. When financially distressed firms fall short of cash from operations, they obtain cash from investing and financing activities to mend their financial problems. Information about the relationships among operating, investing, and financing cash flows is expected to provide users with another approach for evaluating whether firms are performing well or facing financial distress. In this study, eight combinations of operating, investing, and financing cash flows are used as predictors in the financial distress prediction models. ^ The findings {{support the hypothesis that}} the combinations of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities reported in the statement of cash flows during a fiscal period are predictive of financial distress incremental to other financial information. Relative to healthy firms, distressed firms {{are more likely to have}} the following cash flow combinations: (1) the combination of negative <b>net</b> operating <b>cash</b> flow, positive <b>net</b> investing <b>cash</b> flow, and negative <b>net</b> financing <b>cash</b> flow; and (2) the combination of negative net operating, investing, and financing cash flows. In contrast, compared to healthy firms, distressed firms are less likely to have the following cash flow combinations: (1) the combination of positive <b>net</b> operating <b>cash</b> flow, negative <b>net</b> investing <b>cash</b> flow, and positive <b>net</b> financing <b>cash</b> flow; and (2) the combination of positive <b>net</b> operating <b>cash</b> flow and negative net investing and financing cash flows. Empirical evidence suggests that firms face financial distress when they generate insufficient cash from operations to meet ongoing cash needs. Financially distressed firms acquire additional cash from investing activities or use their cash reserve to solve financial problems. However, their financial problems become more severe if they run out of assets that can be sold or if their cash reserve is exhausted. ...|$|R

2500|$|Lamont's second {{task was}} to reduce {{government}} borrowing, which was rising sharply because of the twofold impact of the ERM on the public finances. The loss of output had reduced tax revenues and increased public spending as unemployment rose. The sharp falls in inflation further reduced tax revenues compared to previous forecasts {{at the same time}} as increasing public spending after inflation, because public spending is planned in cash terms which becomes worth more in real terms if inflation falls. The March 1993 budget forecast a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993-94 of £50bn, equivalent to 8% of GDP. [...] In terms of the Public Sector <b>Net</b> <b>Cash</b> Requirement, the definition currently in use to measure the UK government deficit, the actual deficit for 1993–94 of 6.9% was the highest since 1975–76 at 9.2% but just over half the 13.3% deficit projected for 2009–10 in the April 2009 budget.|$|E
2500|$|The Build-Up Method is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} method of determining the after-tax <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a [...] "build-up" [...] method {{because it is the}} sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.|$|E
