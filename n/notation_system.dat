Examples of such systems include Shorthand Dance Notation for dances from Israel, Morris Dance Notation for Morris dance, and Beauchamp-Feuillet notation for Baroque dance. Many dance <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> are specifically designed for European dance and, as a result, cannot effectively describe dances from other cultures.

25|$|Sultan Selim III was {{concerned}} about the lack of a comprehensive <b>notation</b> <b>system</b> for music and encouraged members of his court to work on a <b>notation</b> <b>system</b> that would be easy to learn and to transcribe in. Two music systems were developed as a result and presented to Selim III, by Hamparsum Limonciyan and Abdulbaki Nasir Dede. Abdulbaki Nasir Dede's system was based on the abjad system, however differs in the ordering of the notes. Hampartsoum Limondjian's notation that he developed in two years between 1813 and 1815 was preferred over the other and became the dominant notation for Turkish and Armenian music.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} of the Franco-Flemish school in Renaissance music, use of the French <b>notation</b> <b>system</b> spread {{throughout}} Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing down of the duration of the larger note values while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa etc.). Towards the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became gradually obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for time measurements, such as bar lines and ties, were introduced, thus ultimately leading towards the modern <b>notation</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Numerical <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> are structured, visual, and {{primarily}} non-phonetic {{systems for}} representing number. This study employs a diachronic and comparative framework to examine over 100 systems {{used during the}} past 5000 years. The historical context of each system's origin, transmission, transformation, and decline is traced, linking systems together into phylogenies, but according priority to neither analogical or homological explanations. Structural aspects of numerical <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> are compared {{and the limits of}} variability among them are established. A two-dimensional typology is presented that analyzes the intraexponential and interexponential structuring of each system, in addition to one or more numerical bases. In previous approaches, the only relevant factor considered was {{the presence or absence of}} positionality, which led inevitably to unilinear and progressivist conclusions. The analysis of historical relations among numerical <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> permits a direct approach to questions of how and why they changed. The application of a multilinear cultural evolutionary framework reveals both synchronic and diachronic regularities among numerical <b>notation</b> <b>systems.</b> Where possible, these cross-cultural regularities are related to principles of cognitive psychology. Full explanations of the cultural evolution of numerical notation must also take account of social factors because changes in systems are always the product of decisions made in particular social contexts. Most numerical <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> are used only for recording and communication, not computation, so it is illegitimate to evaluate their usefulness for functions for which they were never used. A model is presented that relates structural features of numerical <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> to the contexts of their use and transmission. Because positional systems are most useful for functions related to administrative and scientific institutions that promote cultural hegemony, the observed trend towards positional numerals is a consequence of the dominance of societies that possess such institutions rather than the numerals' inherent superiority...|$|R

Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a [...] "chromatic staff" [...] in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the Ailler-Brennink notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's Dodeka system, Tom Reed's Twinline notation, Russell Ambrose's Ambrose Piano Tabs, Paul Morris' Clairnote, John Keller's Express Stave, and José A.

40|$|The {{crucial role}} that {{mathematical}} <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> {{have played in}} the success of the hard or mathematical sciences is well known and richly documented: the origin of the history of these sophisticated <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> more or less coincides with the birth of modern science. The role of our linguistic <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> (as applied to, or used in, the scientific study of nature), by contrast, is hardly documented at all, at least not in a systematic way. We distinguish between (metaphorical and non-metaphorical) meta-scientific terms and scientific terms and, as far as the latter is concerned, between methodology and content terms. It is the latter sort of terms that interest us here. Five different dysfunctions in the relationship between scientific linguistic tokens and their referents will be presented and illustrated: scientific terms or phrases can not only be imprecise, they can also be meaningless, indiscriminate, inapt and ambiguous. By correcting or alleviating such dysfunctions, our linguistic <b>notation</b> <b>systems</b> have, {{in the course of the}} past four centuries, become more refined and functional scientific tools.

25|$|The Maya {{calendar}} is {{a system}} of calendars used in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in many modern communities in the Guatemalan highlands, By its linear nature, the Long Count was capable of being extended to refer to any date far into the past or future. This calendar involved {{the use of a}} positional <b>notation</b> <b>system,</b> in which each position signified an increasing multiple of the number of days. The Maya numeral system was essentially vigesimal (i.e., base-20) and each unit of a given position represented 20 times the unit of the position which preceded it. An important exception was made for the second-order place value, which instead represented 18 × 20, or 360 days, more closely approximating the solar year than would 20 × 20 = 400 days. It should be noted however that the cycles of the Long Count are independent of the solar year.|$|E
25|$|Most of Hutchinson's {{contributions}} to American limnology came from research at Linsley Pond in Connecticut.

He advocated the use of statistical and mathematical methods in limnology. His student Raymond Lindeman furthered Hutchinson's model of the trophic dynamic concept. Together they looked at energy flows through the lake in the trophic levels of ecosystems. They followed the energy using Hutchinson's <b>notation</b> <b>system</b> in which each organism was given an integer to mark how many organisms the energy {{had to go through}} in order to reach it, this was designated as its trophic level. It then became possible to measure the efficiency of a given system, or the energy losses between ascending trophic levels.|$|E
