5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion,</b> sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E
50|$|Airwaves is a {{brand of}} sugarfree chewing gum {{produced}} by the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company and sold primarily in Europe and East Asia. The brand is marketed for its intense flavor similar to the effect one would get from the consumption of cough drops (which are also sold by Wrigley's). This intensity of flavor is obtained by including Eucalyptus and Menthol in the candy coating of the tablets of gum.This menthol and eucalyptus combination is widely used in medicated sweets to clear the head and nasal passages and to reduce the symptoms of <b>nasal</b> <b>congestions</b> and colds.|$|R

5|$|Since {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion</b> can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%, and thus patients {{with any of these}} combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing. Even {{in the absence of a}} local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} known for its {{medicinal}} properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The ground leaves of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion,</b> or boiled with water to make eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into the ears of camels to alleviate ticks, and powdered leaves {{can be used as a}} paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum to treat people affected with polio.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion</b> and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion,</b> sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E

40|$|Background: Osteoma is a bony {{slow growing}} benign tumor {{in one of}} the sinuses. It is usually {{asymptomatic}} but clinical symptoms will occur by its overgrowth, occupation of sinus space and obstruction of ostia. Methods : This descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective study was done by accessing the medical records of 17 patients with paranasal sinuses osteomas admitted in Tehran Amir Alam Hospital during 1999 - 2008. Results : The mean age of the participants was 33. 9 years and 12 (70. 6 %) were male and 5 (29. 4 %) were female. No positive family histories existed for the lesions. The mean time interval between the onset of symptom and attending the hospital was 4. 4 years. Frontal followed by ethmoid sinus osteomas were more common in comparison to other sinuses. The most reported symptoms in frontal sinus osteomas were upper eyelid inflation and headache; and proptosis, <b>nasal</b> <b>congestions</b> and diplopia in ethmoid sinus osteomas. Most patients had been endoscopically treated. Conclusion: In small-to-medium-sized osteomas with no invasion into orbit or skull base, endoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice with minimum side-effects...|$|R

25|$|Pseudoephedrine is a stimulant, {{but it is}} {{well known}} for {{shrinking}} swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion</b> commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.|$|E
40|$|Rhinitis and {{sinusitis}} usually coexist and are concurrent in most individuals. Therefore, rhinosinusitis is a {{more appropriate}} term.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Aim of the {{research}} was the demonstration of the efficacy of thermal water vs saline in the recurrent and chronic nasosinusal pathologies treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 patients randomized into 2 groups of 60 subjects each, all affected by recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis with/without I degree nasal polyposis. At the beginning {{and at the end}} of the study, in all the subjects the clinical history, objective examination and the instrumental analysis of nasal functions by active anterior rhinometry, acustic rhinometry, nasal mucociliary transport time determination and nasal mucosa scraping were performed. Patients of the study group underwent crenotherapy treatment (vapour inhalation, aerosol and nasal douching) with thermal water for 14 days at Salsomaggiore Thermal baths. Other patients underwent nasal douching and aerosol with saline twice a day for 14 days at the Rhinologic Centre of the ENT Clinic of Siena University. RESULTS: At the end of the study, only the patients undergone to crenothrapic treatment with salt-bromine-iodic water showed a significant improvement of nasal obstruction, rinorrea and number of nocturnal arousals. The improvement, even if present, was not significant in the control group. Same positive variations were observed concerning <b>nasal</b> mucosa <b>congestion,</b> <b>nasal</b> secretion and mucociliary transport time reaching the significance in the study group.

Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are debilitating headaches, green colored mucus, severe <b>nasal</b> blockages or <b>congestion</b> and heavy pressure experienced in the cheek, forehead, temple and eye regions.|$|R
25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a few moments of entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion</b> which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E
500|$|Other {{potential}} {{side effects}} include blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion),</b> reduced seizure threshold, and tics (a {{type of movement}} disorder).|group="sources"}} Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses.|$|E
500|$|One {{condition}} that occurs typically in lesions above the T6 level is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), {{in which the}} blood pressure increases to dangerous levels, high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. It results from an overreaction of the system to a stimulus such as pain {{below the level of}} injury, because inhibitory signals from the brain cannot pass the lesion to dampen the excitatory sympathetic nervous system response. [...] Signs and symptoms of AD include anxiety, headache, nausea, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, flushed skin, and <b>nasal</b> <b>congestion.</b> [...] It can occur shortly after the injury or not until years later.|$|E

30|$|Rhinosinusitis {{are defined}} as {{inflammation}} of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either <b>nasal</b> blockage obstruction <b>congestion</b> or <b>nasal</b> discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip) ± facial pain/pressure or ± reduction or loss of smell (Fokkens et al. 2007; Rosenfeld et al. 2007; Scadding et al. 2008). Anterior Active Rhinomanometric (AAR) measurement of nasal resistance and nasal peak flow correlate well with subjective sensation of nasal obstruction (Fokkens et al. 2012; Passali et al. 2000), although this correlation remain uncertain (Andre et al. 2009).

40|$|Upper-respiratory-tract {{symptoms}} (<b>nasal</b> irritation, <b>congestion</b> and rhinorrhea) are preva-lent {{complaints in}} so-called “problem buildings. ” In epidemiologic studies, symptom reporting {{is associated with}} selected subject characteristics, including younger age, female gender, {{and the presence of}} allergic rhinitis. The physiologic correlates of these differential reporting patterns, however, are largely unknown. Using dilute chlorine gas as a model upper-respiratory-tract irritant, we studied 52 otherwise healthy volunteers in a sample stratified on age (18 – 69 yr), gender, and allergy status. In a single-blinded crossover study, subjects had their nasal airway resistance measured preexposure, immediately postexpo-sure, and 15 min postexposure to both filtered air and chlorine (1. 0 ppm in air) for 15 min. Allergic rhinitic subjects showed a significantly greater net (chlorine minus air) congestive response at 15 min postexposure than did nonrhinitic controls (p <. 01). Advancing age also predicted a greater response immediately post-exposure (p <. 01). No gender effect was observed. Significant interindividual variability was evident in the nasal congestive response to irritant (chlorine) provocation. The rhinitis effect was consistent with prior observations, whereas the effect of advancing age was opposite to that hypothesized...|$|R
