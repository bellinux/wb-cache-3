40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Often low intake rate soils {{need special}} {{consideration}} when applying water during an irrigation. Surface flooding {{for extended periods}} may cause adverse crop growth conditions. Properly designed sprinkler systems often eliminate irrigation problems, because the application rate and quantity of water applied can be readily controlled. Research workers who have studied sprinkler irrigation disagree on many things. Differences {{are found in the}} literature concerning the procedures used to determine sprinkler distribution uniformity and the optimum rate of application of water to the soil. Several authors suggest that moisture movement within the soil occurs after an irrigation. If trans location of moisture occurs, {{it may be possible to}} use sprinkler system design specifications that are less critical than those now in use. In order to determine the effect of sprinkler application rate on the resulting soil moisture distribution it is necessary to have criteria relating degree of ponding, crop cover, and slope of the land to the uniformity of soil moisture. Experimental plots were designed and prepared to study and relate these factors to each other. Sprinkler distribution measurements were made to be used in computing sprinkler uniformity. Using <b>neutron</b> <b>equipment,</b> soil moisture determinations were made before the irrigation, one day after irrigation, and three days after irrigation to determine the effect of the irrigation. Final analysis of the data from the experiment indicated that there was not an optimum degree of ponding. In fact, ponding, application rate, grade of plots, and crop cover did not appear to appreciably affect the distribution of soil moisture after an irrigation...|$|E
50|$|The {{results were}} so startling, that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two {{independent}} researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, {{to repeat the}} experiment using more sophisticated <b>neutron</b> detection <b>equipment.</b> They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence. A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan et al., when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.|$|R

40|$|Most of neutron irradiators are {{realized}} with neutron sources located {{at fixed positions}} and accordingly the characteristics of neutron spectrum previously assessed do not change. However, an interesting chance {{is to have a}} modular facility, capable of varying conditions of irradiation and setting the prevalence of fast or thermal neutron spectrum components. In this work we report the Monte Carlo studies devoted to design a modular 241 Am-Be neutron irradiator making use of different moderators (water, graphite, polyethylene and so on) in order to obtain a neutron energy distribution useful to test neutron detectors or personal dosemeters. The optimization of thicknesses and shape of the moderators and shielding materials was obtained with a Monte Carlo simulation with MCNP 5 code. An experimental test to verify the reliability of the simulation by means of NAA of selected materials was also performed.

40|$|The U. S. Nonproliferation and Export Control Policy, {{announced}} by President Clinton before the United Nations General Assembly on September 27, 1993, commits the U. S. to placing under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards excess nuclear materials {{no longer needed}} for the U. S. nuclear deterrent. As of July 1, 1995, the IAEA had completed Initial Physical Inventory Verification (IPIV) at two facilities: a storage vault in the Oak Ridge Y- 12 plant containing highly enriched uranium (HOW) metal and another storage vault in the Hanford Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) containing plutonium oxide and plutonium-bearing residues. Another plutonium- storage vault, located at Rocky Flats, is scheduled for the IPIV {{in the fall of}} 1995. Conventional neutron coincidence counting is one of the routinely applied IAEA nondestructive assay (ND) methods for verification of uranium and plutonium.

50|$|The HB-2 {{thermal neutron}} beam tube is {{situated}} radially {{relative to the}} reactor core, looking directly at the fuel. Two beryllium inserts are installed in the spherical tip of the beam tube to maximize the thermal neutron flux within the critical acceptance angle of the <b>neutron</b> scattering experiment <b>equipment.</b> The beam tube cavity outboard of the reactor vessel has a rectangular cross-section that converges vertically and diverges horizontally such that the aperture at the outboard window is a rectangle nominally 6-in tall by 10-in wide. A carbon steel collimator assembly is located just outboard of the beam tube window. This collimator assembly provides further neutron-beam collimation and houses a fast-neutron filter to increase the signal-to-noise ratio at the neutron scattering instruments.|$|R

40|$|Neutron {{irradiator}} facilities with 241 Am-Be {{sources are}} worldwide used {{in order to}} perform neutron activation analysis (NAA), to investigate materials in different research areas or to test and calibrate neutron detectors and environmental or personal dosemeters. The use of a neutron irradiator is advantageous because of its very stable neutron flux, even it is many orders of magnitude lower than the one of a nuclear reactor or a particle accelerator. Most of irradiators are realized with neutron sources located at fixed positions and accordingly the characteristics of neutron spectrum previously assessed do not change. Therefore, an interesting choice {{is to have a}} modular facility, capable of varying conditions of irradiation and setting the prevalence of fast or thermal neutron spectrum component.

Instead, most neutron detector calibration is performed by placing both source and detector at some heights above the ground (or floor), and at a measured distance apart (what we will call a field geometry). Such procedures are also used by larger facilities that do have calibra$kon facilities, but which occasionally need to make calibration checks in the field. Whenever calibrations are made in this manner, some ac-count must {{be made for the}} scattered radiation arriving at the detector. Even though this phenomenon is well-under-St. Dad (cn 54), it is quite often overlooked, probably because of an alhedo term which requires looking up albedo data from graphs or tables not always available.

40|$|The Los Alamos Large Scale Demonstration and Deployment Project (LSDDP) {{in support}} of the US Department of Energy (DOE) Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area (DDFA) is {{identifying}} and demonstrating technologies to reduce the cost and risk of management of transuranic element contaminated large metal objects, i. e. gloveboxes. DOE must dispose of hundreds of gloveboxes from Rocky Flats, Los Alamos and other DOE sites. Current practices for removal, decontamination and size reduction of large metal objects translates to a DOE system-wide cost in excess of $ 800 million, without disposal costs. In FY 99 and FY 00 the Los Alamos LSDDP performed several demonstrations on cost/risk savings technologies. Commercial air pallets were demonstrated for movement and positioning of the oversized crates in <b>neutron</b> counting <b>equipment.</b> The air pallets are able to cost effectively address the complete waste management inventory, whereas the baseline wheeled carts could address only 25 % of the inventory with higher manpower costs. A gamma interrogation radiography technology was demonstrated to support characterization of the crates. The technology was developed for radiography of trucks for identification of contraband. The radiographs were extremely useful in guiding the selection and method for opening very large crated metal objects. The cost of the radiography was small and the operating benefit is high. Another demonstration compared a Blade Cutting Plunger and reciprocating saw for removal of glovebox legs and appurtenances. The cost comparison showed that the Blade Cutting Plunger costs were comparable, and a significant safety advantage was reported. A second radiography demonstration was conducted evaluation of a technology based on WIPP-type x-ray characterization of large boxes. This technology provides considerable detail of the contents of the crates. The technology identified details as small as the fasteners in the crates, an unpunctured aerosol can, and a vessel containing liquids. The cost of this technology is higher than the gamma interrogation technique, but the detail provided is much greater...|$|R
50|$|In November 2006, in {{the midst}} of accusations {{concerning}} Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure <b>neutrons,</b> using Taleyarkhan's <b>equipment.</b> Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of LeTourneau University presented two papers at the American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, deuterated benzene, tetrachloroethylene and uranyl nitrate. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of neutron detectors. They claimed a liquid scintillation detector measured neutron levels at 8 standard deviations above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated control liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid. William M. Bugg, emeritus physics professor at the University of Tennessee also traveled to Taleyarkhan's lab to repeat the experiment with his equipment. He also reported neutron emission, using plastic neutron detectors. Taleyarkhan claimed these visits counted as independent replications by experts, but Forringer later recognized that he was not an expert, and Bugg later said that Taleyarkhan performed the experiments and he had only watched.|$|R
