25|$|The {{conventional}} {{application of}} pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> and {{the insides of}} wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer Sophia Grojsman behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise. The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance {{so that it is}} released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening. Cologne fragrance is released rapidly, lasting around 2 hours. Eau de toilette lasts from 2 to 4 hours, while perfume may last up to six hours.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{women in}} Yemen {{traditionally}} wore branched pantaloons beneath their long black tunics. The pantaloons were usually {{made of a}} jet-black color, tapering close to their ankles, and decorated at the lower seams with a fine embroidered stitch of silver. The tunic served as, both, a dress and long-sleeved blouse, all in one piece. In addition, all young girls wore a black, conical shaped hat upon their heads, which took {{the place of a}} scarf. These hats were called in the local vernacular, gargoush, and were also decorated with an embroidered sash about its borders, besides being equipped with tapering flaps that extended down to the ears and to the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> Older women in Sana'a would wear a broad veil-like scarf over their heads, called maswan, especially when going out in public places, and which was traditionally worn above the closer fitting scarves that covered their hair. All women were adorned with black slippers when walking in public places, and only very small girls would walk barefoot.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{physiology of}} the black-footed ferret {{is similar to}} that of the European polecat and the steppe polecat. It is probably polygynous, based on data collected from home range sizes, skewed sex ratios, and sexual dimorphism. Mating occurs in February and March. When a male and female in estrus encounter each other, the male sniffs the genital region of the female, but does not mount her until after a few hours have elapsed, which is contrast to the more violent behavior displayed by the male European polecat. During copulation, the male grasps the female by the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> with the copulatory tie lasting from 1.5–3 hours. Unlike other mustelids, the black-footed ferret is a habitat specialist with low reproductive rates. In captivity, gestation of black-footed ferrets lasts 42–45 days. Litter size ranges from 1–5 kits. Kits are born in May and June in prairie dog burrows. Kits are altricial and are raised by their mother for several months after birth. Kits first emerge above ground in July, at 6 weeks old. They are then separated into individual prairie dog burrows around their mother's burrow. Kits reach adult weight and become independent several months following birth, from late August to October. Sexual maturity occurs at one year of age.|$|E

5000|$|A nuchal scan or nuchal {{translucency}} (NT) scan/procedure is a sonographic {{prenatal screening}} scan (ultrasound) to detect cardiovascular abnormalities in a fetus, though altered extracellular matrix composition and limited lymphatic drainage {{can also be}} detected. Since chromosomal abnormalities can result in impaired cardiovasular development, a nuchal translucency scan {{is used as a}} screening, rather than diagnostic, tool for conditions such as Down syndrome. However, increased nuchal translucency measurements are also associated with non-chromosomal abnormalities such as genetic conditions (e.g. Di George syndrome) and non-genetic ones (e.g. Body-stalk anomaly). [...] The scan is carried out at 11-13+6 weeks pregnancy and assesses <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> fluid collecting within <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fetal <b>neck.</b> There are two distinct measurements - the nuchal translucency, which is measured earlier in pregnancy at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first trimester, and for which there is a lower threshold for increased diameter, and the nuchal fold, which is measured towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second trimester. The scan may also help confirm both <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pregnancy dates and the fetal viability.
