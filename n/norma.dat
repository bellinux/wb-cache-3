She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. <b>Norma</b> died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E

40|$|O presente estudo tem por objetivo o entendimento das <b>normas</b> das sociedades no Código Civil Brasileiro, uma vez que é possível verificar três fontes normativas das sociedades: as <b>normas</b> das pessoas jurídicas (<b>normas</b> gerais em sentido amplo), as <b>normas</b> das associações (<b>normas</b> gerais por conectividade) e as <b>normas</b> das sociedades simples (<b>normas</b> gerais em sentido estrito). Por serem <b>normas</b> destinadas a vários tipos societários, foram classificadas como <b>normas</b> gerais, em função da variedade de destinatários. Cada uma destas fontes de <b>normas</b> gerais possui uma aplicação diferenciada aos nove tipos societários existentes no Código Civil. Com base nas discussões doutrinárias de mais de oitenta anos sobre os critérios para a aplicação do artigo 18 do Decreto 3. 708 / 19, que tratava da aplicação subsidiária das <b>normas</b> das sociedades anônimas às sociedades limitadas, foi possível desenvolver uma metodologia de interpretação e análise da integração das três fontes normativas às <b>normas</b> de cada tipo societário existente no Código Civil. Para tanto, foram classificadas três espécies de <b>normas</b> gerais: cogentes, dispositivas e incompatíveis. Este critério vale para a análise de qualquer uma das três fontes normativas. Para a aplicação das <b>normas</b> das associações foi constatada a necessidade de segregar aquelas que são incompatíveis com a natureza das sociedades. Para a aplicação das <b>normas</b> das sociedades simples foi verificada a necessidade de análise da compatibilidade de tais <b>normas</b> com ao menos três características essenciais dos tipos societários: responsabilidade dos sócios, capital social e forma de representação da sociedade. A partir desses critérios foi possível realizar uma análise de quais são as <b>normas</b> gerais em sentido amplo (pessoas jurídicas), por conectividade (associações) e em sentido estrito (sociedade simples). Da análise realizada verificou-se a existência de uma série de <b>normas</b> gerais, integradas pelas remissões {{realizadas}} pelo Código Civil e que devem ser sempre interpretadas em conjunto com as regras de cada tipo societário para o entendimento completo das <b>normas</b> do tipo. This {{study has}} as purpose {{the understanding of}} the rules of the companies in the Brazilian Civil Code, once {{that it is possible to}} verify three normative sources of the companies: the rules of legal entities (general rules in wide sense), the rules of associations (general rules by connectivity) and the rules of simple companies (general rules in strict sense). In virtue of being rules destined to several company types, they were classified as general rules, due to the diversity of recipients. Each one of these sources of general rules has a different application to the nine company types existent in the Civil Code. Based on the doctrinaire discussions from more than eighty years on the criteria for the application of the article 18 of Decree 3. 708 / 94, that considered the subsidiary application of the rules of corporations to the limited liability companies, it was possible to develop a methodology of interpretation and analysis of the integration of the three normative sources to the rules of each company type existent in the Civil Code. For such, three types of general rules were classified: binding, dispositive and incompatible. This criterion is valid for the analysis of any of the three normative sources. For the application of the rules of the associations, it was verified the necessity to segregate those rules that are incompatible with the nature of the companies. For the application of the rules of simple companies, it was verified the necessity of a compatibility analysis of such rules with at least three essential characteristics of the company types: liability of the partners, share capital and representation form of the company. From these criteria, it was possible to perform an analysis of which are the general rules in wide sense (legal entities), by connectivity (associations) and in strict sense (simple company). From the analysis performed, it was verified the existence of a series of general rules, integrated by remissions performed by the Civil Code and that must always be interpreted together with the rules of each company type for the full understanding of the rules of the type...|$|R
