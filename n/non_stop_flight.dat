50|$|Carleton {{played a}} pivotal role in the {{development}} of Braniff's South American route system. Braniff began Douglas DC-3 flights on January 8, 1949, from Lima to La Paz' El Alto International Airport which, with an elevation of 13,400 feet above mean sea level, was and is still today the highest international airport in the world. Larger Douglas DC-4s were substituted on the route when loads required additional capacity. The DC-4s that flew to La Paz were JATO (Jet Assisted Takeoff) equipped aircraft to aid the four engined airliners in the event that an engine was lost on takeoff. Carleton directed pre-service testing of JATO at La Paz, Bolivia, for aircraft operations at high altitude airports in the region, in early January 1949. Braniff became the first airline to be certificated by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, as a result of the successful completion of the Carleton-led tests, to operate JATO aircraft at La Paz. Carleton also flew the carrier's first proving flight over the Andean mountain range between Lima and Rio de Janeiro which led to the first <b>non</b> <b>stop</b> <b>flights</b> between the two opposite coastal points. He also oversaw the development of terminals at Campo Grande, Brazil; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and La Paz and Santa Cruz, Bolivia.|$|R
25|$|In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became MD PIA {{and also}} open skies from Karachi to Dubai were {{declared}} and 12 private air lines {{were allowed to}} operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance. Farooq Umar to meet the challenge, fought the battle of open skies and opened up six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries along with tourists attraction 'air safari'. He also made major changes in routes and schedules and started <b>non</b> <b>stop</b> <b>flights</b> from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada. PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku and Al-Ain to its destinations in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus. 'Air Safari' flights were launched in 1994 using Boeing 737–300 aircraft that used to fly over the Karakoram mountain range. Farooq Umar handed over PIA to another MD in March 1996, closing his tenure with great success and leaving PIA profitable with a profit for the previous six months of more than 55 million PKR. After his departure PIA started to nose dive. PIA purchased a Boeing 747 flight simulator to train its pilots. It also purchased another used Airbus A300 aircraft. A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 {{to cope with a}} surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 1999, GAO reported that Reagan National Airport could accommodate at least 36 more slots, which are authorizations from the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a takeoff or landing. In 2000 and 2003, two federal statutes, known as AIR- 21 and Vision 100, permitted DOT to award 44 new slots to airlines, 24 {{of which could be}} used for flights to cities more than 1, 250 miles, which was the statutorily mandated limit for <b>non</b> <b>stop</b> <b>flights</b> from Reagan National. The DOT awards went to airlines serving six cities (Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Seattle). For this year's reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), GAO was asked for an update on the capacity of Reagan National to accommodate additional slots and the effect of relaxing the perimeter rule. GAO updated its 1999 study to answer these key questions: (1) To what extent can Reagan National accommodate additional flights? (2) Since AIR- 21 and Vision 100, what changes have occurred in market share and fares for flights operating between the six beyond-perimeter cities and the three Washington, D. C., area airports? In commenting on this report, DOT and the airports authority generally agree with our findings but with one exception, the airports authority disagrees with DOT's estimate of slots because it disputes their methodological assumptions. We believe the department's methodology for estimating airport capacity is appropriate. ...|$|R
