MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E

Manilow replied {{that he was just}} friends with Byrd, an innocent picture had been taken, and that there was <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> to the supposed engagement. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of Debbie Does Dallas as a present for his birthday. Manilow told Carson that he could not watch his friend doing what she does in that movie.|$|E
25|$|After {{eleven years}} of marriage, George Boleyn {{was arrested in}} May 1536 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, accused of having had sexual {{intercourse}} with his sister, the Queen. Jane likely {{had little to do}} with these accusations, and it is usually Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester who is accredited by contemporaries with having provided the evidence against the Queen and her brother. There was <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> in these rumours, according to the vast majority of contemporary witnesses, but they provided the legal pretext that the Boleyns' enemies needed to send Lord Rochford to the block. Jane was mentioned only once during the trials, when George Boleyn was asked if the Queen had relayed information about Henry's sexual troubles to her.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} the Black Prince on 8 June 1376 and the onset of Edward III's last illness at the closing of Parliament on 10 July left John with all the reins of power. He {{immediately}} had the ailing king grant pardons to all the officials impeached by the Parliament; Alice Perrers too was reinstated {{at the heart of}} the king's household. John impeached William of Wykeham and other leaders of the reform movement, and secured their conviction on old or trumped-up charges. The parliament of 1377 was John's counter-coup: crucially, the Lords no longer supported the Commons and John was able to have most of the acts of 1376 annulled. He also succeeded in forcing the Commons to agree to the imposition of the first Poll Tax in English history — a viciously regressive measure that bore hardest on the poorest members of society. There was organised opposition to his measures and rioting in London; John of Gaunt's arms were reversed or defaced wherever they were displayed, and protestors pasted up lampoons on his supposedly dubious birth. At one point he was forced to take refuge across the Thames, while his Savoy Palace only just escaped looting. It was rumoured (and believed by many people in England and France) that he intended to seize the throne for himself and supplant the rightful heir, his nephew Richard, the son of the Black Prince, but there seems to have been <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> in this and on the death of Edward III and the accession of the child Richard II, John sought no position of regency for himself and withdrew to his estates.|$|E

500|$|This {{reveals that}} there is a {{struggle}} between the acceptance of imaginative experience that exists only within {{a small part of the}} mind. This struggle, according to Walter Evert, has [...] "no relevance to the world of external action and perhaps <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> to offer even the visionary dreamer himself." [...] However Anthony Hecht looks at the problem in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem. Regardless, the narrator never states that this worship of Psyche or embracing the imagination would aid mankind, but the poem does rejoice in exercising the imagination.|$|E
500|$|For {{other nations}} in Yugoslavia, the {{prospect}} {{of war and the}} government's close ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church was not at all appealing. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, president of the Roman Catholic Conference of Bishops of Yugoslavia, bitterly wrote in his diary that, [...] "All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds... that will never move closer to one another without an act of God". He also wrote, [...] "The Schism [...] is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. There is no morality, no principle, there is <b>no</b> <b>truth,</b> no justice, no honesty [...]" [...] On the same day, he publicly called on the Catholic clergy to pray for King Peter and that Croatia and Yugoslavia would be spared a war.|$|E

The High Court had directed adequate security to be provided to her, but later she again informed the High Court of the failure to increase security. She sought transfer to Panchkula, a city near Chandigarh. She requested this shortly after her verdict was denounced vehemently by the khap panchayats. The police chief of Karnal district, Rakesh Kumar Arya, claimed that Sharma did not complain about inadequate security. [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> in reports that Karnal's Additional District Sessions Judge wants {{to move out of}} the district on account of inadequate security," [...] he said.

50|$|Thus, {{we always}} lapse into error when {{thinking}} in moral terms. We {{are trying to}} state the truth when we make moral judgments.

5000|$|These {{pointers}} {{needed to}} be somewhat imprecise if Marxism was {{to take into account}} the complicated social processes and variety of forces at work in history.

500|$|The British steel {{industry}} was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government's high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present {{a united front}} against new competition at home. When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 [...] the Federation's chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively; his members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only {{one of the large}} steel firms in the region, the Consett Iron Company, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London's financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme. Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In a reassuring speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in Newcastle: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> in any of the reports that either the banks or any other authorities... are making a dead set to prevent anything of the kind being done in the area".|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Jackson's death, and in the {{aftermath}} of it, multiple reports surfaced that AEG Live purposely tried to hide Jackson's health concerns during preparations for his would-have-been concerts. Concerns included Jackson's frail appearance due to lack of eating that had reportedly caused Jackson to be unable to perform from lack of strength and that AEG had used body doubles in rehearsals to stand in for Jackson. After Jackson's death, AEG stated that there was <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> to any of the rumors and that Jackson was thin but in good enough condition to perform. On 23 October 2009, days before the film's release, fans of Jackson launched a protest campaign against the film entitled [...] "This Is not It". The campaign's focus was to convince people that Jackson's health was neglected by AEG, among others, and that AEG was partly responsible for Jackson's death and now the company is making a profit off Jackson's death. The group started a website and created their own 'trailer' for the movie to showcase their point-of-view on the documentary. The protestors also inaccurately claimed that Jackson was 108 pounds (49 kg) at his death, contradicting Jackson's autopsy, which had stated that Jackson weighed 136 pounds (61kg). Shortly after the protest became news, The Guardian conducted a poll on their website asking users [...] "What do you think of Michael Jackson's posthumous film This Is It?", 51.4% agreed with one of the two options: [...] "I agree with the fans who are boycotting it—it's shameless profiteering".|$|E
500|$|Augustus Jones {{had learned}} of the band's {{troubles}} and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John {{to live with him}} at his farm in Saltfleet Township, with their stepmother and halfsiblings. [...] As he knew only a few words of English, Peter was enrolled in a one-room school in Stoney Creek. With the help of the local teacher, George Hughes, Peter learned English. The next year, the family moved to Brantford, where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming. [...] Sarah Tekarihogan's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford. [...] Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name [...] "Desagondensta", meaning [...] "he stands people on their feet". [...] Jones was baptised Anglican by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820, but internally he did not accept Christianity. [...] Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father, his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion, the conduct of the white Christian settlers [...] "drunk, quarreling, fighting and cheating the poor Indians, and acting as if there was no God" [...] convinced him there could be <b>no</b> <b>truth</b> in their religion. [...] He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada, with all the privileges it entailed. [...] Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised, Jones expected it to have no effect upon him. [...] Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822, when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother-in-law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling. [...] He attended school in Fairchild's Creek during the winter of 18223 studying arithmetic and writing, hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the fur trade.
