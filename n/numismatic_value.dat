5|$|From {{the time}} numismatists {{became aware of}} 1804 dollars, they have {{commanded}} high prices, both {{in relation to their}} face value and the <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> of other silver dollars. Some early examples were maintained in the Mint's coin cabinet for use in trades, and in 1859, dealers began offering Class II dollars priced at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt reportedly offered a Philadelphia coin dealer three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was reportedly purchased in Vienna for $740, and a Class I specimen was auctioned for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, an example sold for $1,800, and the same coin reportedly sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar fetched $28,000 at an auction conducted by Stack's, a coin firm, and the same coin reached $36,000 at another Stack's sale in 1963. A Class I specimen brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's, and during a 1980 rise in coin prices, a Class III example sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A Class I example reached $990,000 at a Superior Galleries auction in 1990, and an example once owned by coin collector Louis Eliasberg became the first 1804 dollar to surpass $1 million at auction, selling for $1,815,000 at a sale conducted by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The {{face value}} of Maundy money coins was maintained, {{increasing}} all their face values {{by a factor}} of 2.4, as the coins continued to be legal tender as new pence. The <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> of each coin, though, greatly exceeds face value.|$|E
25|$|Today, most {{transactions}} {{take place}} by {{a form of}} payment with either inherent, standardized, or credit value. <b>Numismatic</b> <b>value</b> {{may be used to}} refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law, which is known as the collector value.|$|E
25|$|In <b>numismatics,</b> {{intrinsic}} <b>value,</b> {{also known}} as melt value, {{is the value of}} the metal, typically a precious metal, in a coin. For example, if gold trades in commercial markets at a price of US$1200 per fine troy ounce, then a coin minted from one troy ounce of fine gold would have an intrinsic value of US$1200.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{approximately}} 10 tonnes of {{gold coins}} were {{returned home from}} the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of Canada. The gold bars remained in the United States. Additionally, coins that were considered having no <b>numismatic</b> or historic <b>value</b> were remelted into bars.|$|R
5000|$|Junk silver is an {{informal}} term {{used in the}} United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia for any silver coin which is in fair or cull condition and has no <b>numismatic</b> or collectible <b>value</b> above the bullion value of the silver it contains. Such coins are popular among people seeking to invest in silver, particularly in small amounts. The word [...] "junk" [...] refers only {{to the value of}} the coins as collectibles and not to the actual condition of the coins; junk silver is not necessarily scrap silver.|$|R
25|$|The Australian Gold Nugget is a {{gold bullion}} coin minted by the Perth Mint. The coins have been minted in {{denominations}} of 1/20 oz, 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, 1 oz, 2 oz, 10 oz, and 1 kg of 24 carat gold. They have {{legal tender status}} in Australia and are one of few legal tender bullion gold coins to change their design every year, another being the Chinese Gold Panda. This and their limited annual mintage may, unlike for many other bullion coins, raise their <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> over the value of gold used.|$|E
25|$|Maundy {{money is}} a {{ceremonial}} coinage traditionally given to the poor, and nowadays awarded annually to deserving senior citizens. There are Maundy coins in denominations of one, two, three and four pence. They bear dates from 1822 to the present and are minted in very small quantities. Though they are legal tender in the UK, they are never encountered in circulation. The pre-decimal Maundy pieces have the same legal tender status and value as post-decimal ones, and effectively increased in face value by 140% upon decimalisation. Their <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> is much greater.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, the British Royal Mint {{produced}} several trial coins {{as part of}} experiments {{on the use of}} platinum in coins. One of these coins has the same diameter as a farthing and a weak relief owing to the high hardness of platinum. The 1812 Pattern 9 Pence Bank Token (S3773A) was used for the obverse and the farthing of 1825 for the reverse parts of this coin. No dies were manufactured for these experiments, so expired dies of the corresponding coins were used instead. Coins minted using dies from two different coins are called mules. The coin bears the year of 1825, but was likely printed at a later date. Like all test coins, the platinum farthing has a high historic and <b>numismatic</b> <b>value.</b> This coin is also interesting because it features the portrait of the already deceased monarch George III (1738–1820).|$|E
500|$|Trade dollars {{were again}} made legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which stated in part [...] "All coins and {{currencies}} of the United States (including Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national banking associations), regardless of when coined or issued, shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private, public charges, taxes, duties and dues." [...] However, the <b>numismatic</b> and bullion <b>value</b> of any trade dollar far exceeds its face value of one dollar. Because of its demand by collectors {{a large number}} of counterfeits exist made with base metal, and buyers should exercise caution when purchasing specimens.|$|R
2500|$|The {{only time}} {{there has been}} a {{deviation}} from this composition was in the production of early Australian sovereigns, which used silver as part of the alloy, and in London sovereigns dated 1887, when an additional 1.25% silver was added {{in order to make the}} blanks softer for the new Joseph Boehm relief of Queen Victoria: 1887 London Mint sovereigns are more yellow than other London-produced sovereigns. This additional silver affected the amount of copper in the coin, not, of course, its gold content. (Nineteenth-century techniques of refining were not as advanced as today, and nineteenth-century sovereigns became more accurate in terms of their gold weight as silver – which is often naturally combined with gold – was removed as an impurity from the [...] "pure" [...] gold used. Such minor inconsistencies would not affect either their <b>numismatic</b> or bullion <b>value).</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{central part}} of the thesis {{consists}} of the chronological arrangement and discussion of the coin series struck by the Chian mint {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period (c 332 BC) down to its demise during the late Roman Imperial period (c 270 AD). After establishing a sequence of issue for the individual series I consider other aspects of the coinage, such as patterns of issue, links with the economy, and developments in typology and denominations. These topics are presented and discussed in general chapters following that of the coin series. The study of coin typology has contributed to our knowledge of Chian society and economy of the period. For example the adoption and permanent use of sphinx type on the obverse of the coinage offered the opportunity to trace the development of the main civic symbol of an ancient Greek city over a continued period of six centuries. The wine amphora appearing on the reverse of most coins revealed that this jar was manufactured locally at Chios throughout the Roman period, which archaeology has failed to record. This finding has repercussions on our idea of contemporary Chian economy since it constitutes strong evidence that the export of wine -known to have been an important economic activity for Chios in earlier periods- continued after Roman domination. A separate chapter on the denominational system at Chios proved of particular importance for understanding the denominations used in the Eastern Greek world in general, since Chian coinage of the Roman period is one the few bearing marked denominational <b>values.</b> <b>Numismatic</b> findings have also contributed much to the meager information we have on the local history during Hellenistic and Roman periods. The last chapter discusses the Chian issues as economic objects and their circulation overseas. The study has established a link between the Chian trade pattern and foreign finds of this coinage during the same period...|$|R
500|$|Royal Maundy [...] is a {{religious}} service in the Church of England held on Maundy Thursday, the day before Good Friday. [...] At the service, the British monarch or a royal official ceremonially distributes small silver coins known as [...] "Maundy money" [...] (legally, [...] "the Queen's Maundy money") as symbolic alms to elderly recipients.

2500|$|The {{gold was}} {{stored in the}} Goskhran under {{military}} vigilance, and the remaining boxes of gold carried by the Kursk arrived between November 9 and 10. Shortly after, a recount on the total deposits was carried out; initial estimates suggested that the recount would take a year to complete, and despite it having been done with the utmost care, the recount was finalized {{in less than two}} months, having begun on December 5, 1936, and completed on January 24, 1937. 15,571 sacks of gold were opened, and 16 different types of gold coins were found inside: pounds sterling (sovereigns or half sovereigns) (70% of the total), Spanish pesetas, French francs, Louis, German marks, Belgian francs, Italian lire, Portuguese escudos, Russian rubles, Austrian schillings, Dutch guilders, Swiss francs, Mexican pesos, Argentine pesos, Chilean pesos, and an extraordinary amount of U.S. dollars. The total deposit was constituted of 509,287.183kilograms of gold coins and 792.346kilograms of gold in the form of ingots: thus, a total of 510,079,529.30grams of crude gold, which at an average of [...]900 millesimal fineness, was equivalent to 460,568,245.59grams of fine gold (approximately 14,807,363.8 troy ounces). This amount of gold was valued at 1,592,851,910 gold-pesetas (518 millions of U.S dollars). Additionally, the <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> of the coins was much higher than the amount of gold they contained, but the Soviets disregarded this when calculating its value. The Soviets did, however, scrupulously examine all coins to identify those that were fake, defective, or did not contain enough gold. The Soviets never explained what was done with the rare or antique coins, but it is doubtful that they were melted. Burnett Bolloten suggests that it is possible that all coins with <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> were separated with the intention of gradually selling them on the international market.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people have}} argued that {{with respect to the}} receipt of gold or silver coins, {{taxpayer}}s need only report as income the [...] "face value," [...] and not the higher actual fair market value, of the coins. In the Joslin case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that under [...] and 26 C.F.R. 1.61-2(d)(1), a taxpayer who bargains to be paid for his services in legal tender (in this case, silver dollar coins) must report the income at the fair market value (<b>numismatic</b> <b>value),</b> and not at the lower face value. Similarly, in the Cordner case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a taxpayer who receives Double Eagle gold coins as a distribution from a corporation must report as income the fair market value of the coins, not the lower face value. In this case, where a coin, by reason of its value to collectors or by reason of the intrinsic worth of its contents, has a fair market value in excess of its face value, it is treated as [...] "property other than money" [...] for purposes of , resulting in taxation at fair market value.|$|E

50|$|Assume {{that the}} largest {{denomination}} is 1 dollar, and that N is an integer. (The algorithm works even if these assumptions do not hold, by trivial modifications.) The coin collector first separates his coins into lists, one for each denomination, sorted by <b>numismatic</b> <b>value.</b> He then packages the smallest denomination coins in pairs, starting from the pair of smallest total <b>numismatic</b> <b>value.</b> If there is one coin left over, {{it will be the}} coin of highest <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> of that denomination, and it is set aside and ignored henceforth. These packages are then merged into the list of coins of the next smallest denomination, again in order of <b>numismatic</b> <b>value.</b> The items in that list are then packaged in pairs, and merged into the next smallest list, and so forth. Finally, there is a list of items, each of which is a 1 dollar coin or a package consisting of two or more smaller coins whose denominations total 1 dollar. They are also sorted in order of <b>numismatic</b> <b>value.</b> The coin collector then selects the least value N of them. Note that the time of the algorithm is linear in the number of coins.|$|E

This all made silver too hard to find for coin roll hunters, so they primarily search for 1922-1964 nickels for their <b>numismatic</b> <b>value</b> and for 1965-1981 Nickels for their metal value, which slightly exceeds their face value. Pre-1997 pennies were also pulled out of circulation due to their copper high metal value prior to the removal of pennies from circulation in 2013.
