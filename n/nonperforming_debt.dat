40|$|This paper {{provides}} a narrative {{account of the}} 1980 s Chilean banking crisis. The Chilean crisis saw the nationalization of the two largest financial conglomerates and resulted {{in more than half}} of the financial system’s assets and liabilities falling under direct control of the government. The paper provides details of the bank rescue measures as well as the resolution of the banks ' <b>nonperforming</b> <b>debt</b> problem. By providing a detailed chronology of the financial crisis, the paper highlights the evolutionary process that characterized the interventions taken by the Chilean authorities to restore the financial system to solvency. Despite the pessimism that accompanied the early stages of the banking crisis, the fifteen-year process of intervention, restructuring, and recapitalization left the financial system well-positioned to finance Chile’s economic growth, which averaged six percent per year (in real terms) for the 20 years following 1985. 1 1...|$|E
40|$|Brazil, as {{the rest}} of Latin America, has {{experienced}} three cycles of capital inflows since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. The first two ended in financial crises, and at the time of writing the third one is still unfolding, although already showing considerable signs of distress. The first started with the aftermath of the oil-price increase that followed the 1973 ‘Yom Kippur’ war; consisted mostly of bank lending; and finished with Mexico’s 1982 default (and the 1980 s ‘debt-crisis’). The second took place between the 1989 ‘Brady bonds’ agreement (which also marked the beginning of neo-liberal reforms in most of Latin America) and the Argentinian 2001 crisis. This second cycle saw a sharp increase in portfolio flows and a rise of FDI, and ended up with four major crises (as well as the 1997 one in East Asia) as newly-liberalised middle-income countries struggled to deal with the problems created by the absorption of those sudden surges of inflows — Mexico (1994), Brazil (1999), and two in Argentina (1995 and 2001). Finally, the third inflow-cycle began in 2003 as soon as international financial markets felt reassured by the surprisingly neoliberal orientation of President Lula’s government; this cycle intensified in 2004 with a (mostly speculative) commodity price-boom, and actually strengthened after a brief interlude following the 2008 global financial crash. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the Brazilian 1999 -financial crises during the second inflow-cycle from the perspective of Keynesian/ Minskyian/ Kindlebergian financial economics. I will attempt to show that no matter how diversely the above mentioned countries tried to deal with the inflow absorption problem — and they did follow different routes, none more unique than Brazil — they invariably ended up in a major financial crisis. As a result (and despite the insistence of mainstream analysis and different ‘generation’ models of financial crises), these crises took place mostly due to factors that were ‘intrinsic’ (‘endogenous’ or ‘inherent’) to middle-income countries that opened up their capital account indiscriminately to over-liquid and excessively ‘friendly-regulated’ international financial markets. As such, these crises were both fully deserved and fairly predictable. Therefore, I shall argue that the general mechanisms that led to Brazil’s 1999 -financial crisis were in essence endogenous to the workings of an economy facing i) full financial liberalisation; ii) several surges of inflows, especially immediately after the Mexican 1994 and the East Asian 1997 crises — and as a spillover of the respective rescue packages —, following a new ‘bubble thy neighbour’ speculative-strategy by international financial markets, as ever more liquid, volatile, politically-reassured, and progressively unregulated financial markets were anxiously seeking (and allowed to create artificially) new high-yield investment opportunities via a new sequential speculative-strategy; and iii) ineffective domestic financial regulation — especially lack of effective capital controls. I shall also argue that within this general framework, the specificity of the Brazilian crisis was given by having been affected by i) several external shocks; ii) by a naïve ideology directing economic reform; iii) by a exuberant (post-‘second generation’ models) -style monetarism, or ‘macho-monetarism’, that although successful in achieving initially price-stabilisation, and in avoiding that Brazil became ‘another Mexico’ (in terms of keeping Brazil away from an inflow-led Kindlebergianmania), it did so at a growing (and mostly unnecessary) cost; iv) the creation of several major financial fragilities in the banking sector (private and public) and in State finances — leading the Federal Government to sleepwalk into a Minskyian ‘Ponzi-finance’; and v) by this ‘Ponzi’ being turbo-charged by both the Government’s indiscriminate absorption of <b>nonperforming</b> <b>debt,</b> and by it paying a huge amount (mostly in the form of subsidies) in order to get the constitutional reform that would allow the President to run for a second term...|$|E
40|$|What {{difference}} does it make, and for whom, whether the <b>nonperforming</b> <b>debts</b> of emerging market borrowers are restructured? This paper begins by positing a set of counterfactual conditions under which restructuring would not matter, and then shows how several {{ways in which the}} actual world of international lending departs from these conditions give both lenders and borrowers ample reason to care whether <b>nonperforming</b> <b>debts</b> are restructured. One implication {{of the way in which}} debt restructuring matters is that restructuring should not be too' easy. Further, with a greater frequency of defaults, some credit flows to emerging market countries would not be extended in the first place. An important element driving this line of argument is moral hazard, but (unlike in much of the recent literature of emerging market debt problems) what is central here is not the availability of credit from the IMF or other official lenders but the more fundamental moral hazard inherent in all uncollateralized borrower-lender relationships. ...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{domination}} of bank financing, <b>nonperforming</b> <b>debts</b> (NPDs) in large Chinese enterprises are a proxy for nonperforming loans (NPLs) in China's major banks. Using a firm-level {{survey of more than}} 20, 000 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, this paper estimates both the level and ratio of NPDs across ownership type, industry, and region for the period 1995 - 2002. The results show that NPD ratios have been falling since 2000 {{as a result of the}} rapid expansion of better-performing non-state enterprises (NSEs), the improved performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the exit of poor-performing enterprises (which has been facilitated by asset management companies and other merger and acquisition activities). SOEs, however, are still much more likely than NSEs to generate NPDs. This paper provides useful tools and sector information for assessing enterprise debt risks and draws lessons for banking reform in China.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} some of the puzzling {{observations}} in the protracted recessions of the 1990 s in Japan and the 1930 s in the United States can be accounted for by a simple variant of the neoclassical growth model with borrowing constraints. There are three puzzles: First, a large wedge emerged between the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure and the marginal product of labor. This labor wedge is associated with declines in labor inputs. Second, although shrinkage of investment was observed in both episodes, a wedge that represents investment frictions did not emerge. Third, in spite of unprecedented monetary easing in Japan since the late 1990 s, deflation has continued. A key ingredient is the emergence of a huge accumulation of <b>nonperforming</b> <b>debts,</b> which must have been a consequence of the large fluctuations in asset prices. The debts tighten the borrowing constraints and can cause the puzzling features of the recessions, which may be protracted if the bad debt problem persists for years. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} recent {{episodes of}} government involvement in corporate debt restructurings. It argues that corporate debt restructuring {{is an important}} step toward recovery from a financial crisis. We then discuss the rationale for, and modalities of, the state intervention in corporate debt workouts through reviewing six countries with large scale corporate debt workouts. Case studies reveal that the costs of corporate sector rescue are significant and in several cases on par with the costs of financial sector bailouts. The paper sheds light on the importance of contingent liabilities and associated risks to government balance sheet from the corporate debt side and emphasizes the need for improved contingency planning for corporations with potential systemic impact.
