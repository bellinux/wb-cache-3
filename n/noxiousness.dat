50|$|The assessment/management view of {{communication}} is very general, allowing for both intra- and inter-species communication.

They are very limited in assessing their own needs much less managing them. Caregivers can assess and manage the needs of infants, but they lack direct access to emotional needs of infants (e.g., hunger, pain). Human infant crying is highly salient and normally activates the assessment and management systems of caregivers directing them to crying infants. When successful, caregivers assess the needs of crying infants and act in ways that reduce these needs (e.g., feeding a hungry infant).

40|$|The Weed Risk Assessment (WRA) {{has become}} an {{effective}} tool in predicting invasiveness of exotic plant species. In studies testing the WRA, exotic plant species are usually divided into major weeds, minor weeds and non-weeds. However, these divisions are qualitative, as the categories are assigned by experts. Many studies searching for plant traits that are indicative of plant invasiveness use quantitative estimates to measure invasiveness. We compared how quantitative and qualitative estimates of invasiveness may relate to WRA scores. As quantitative estimates we used regional frequency (spread), change in regional frequency and local dominance of naturalized exotic plant species in The Netherlands. To obtain a qualitative estimate we determined if the exotic plant species occurred on a black list in neighbouring regions. We related WRA scores of the exotic plant species to these qualitative and quantitative estimates of invasiveness. Our results reveal that the WRA predicted the qualitative (black list) estimate more accurately than the quantitative (dominance and spread) ones. The black list estimate matches with the overall impact of exotic species, which is assumed to incorporate regional spread, local dominance and <b>noxiousness.</b> Therefore, the WRA predicts the <b>noxiousness</b> component, but {{to a lesser extent}} the spatial components of impact of exotic species. On the other hand, studies that use regional spread and other quantitative estimates of invasiveness tend not to include the <b>noxiousness</b> component of impact. We propose that our analyses may also help to further solve the recent debate on whether or not performing research on exotic species. ...|$|E

40|$|Many animals {{advertise}} their chemical {{defense to}} predators with conspicuous coloration and unpalatability, but {{little is known}} about the information in these signal elements. To effectively avoid predation, is it more advantageous to invest in increased conspicuousness or greater <b>noxiousness,</b> or to allocate equally to both signal modalities? Using natural variation among poison frog species measured with spectral reflectance and toxicity assays, we tested the relative importance of warning signal components with predator-learning and avoidance experiments. We demonstrate that closely related species use alternative strategies: increasing either conspicuousness or toxicity affords equivalent avoidance by predators and provides protection to nontoxic mimic species. These equally effective predator avoidance tactics demonstrate different aposematic solutions for two potentially costly signal components, providing a mechanism for natural diversity in warning signals...|$|E

40|$|Aposematic, or warning, {{signals are}} {{generally}} interspecific in form: one species advertises <b>noxiousness</b> to a predator or parasite species. In {{a study of}} the pipevine swallowtail butterfly (Battus philenor), we show that a pattern of colouration in the caterpillars that is considered to be aposematic in the context of attack by natural enemies also deters oviposition by conspecific females. In field and laboratory assays, females avoided oviposition on plants bearing live conspecific larvae. Females avoided oviposition on plants bearing artificially constructed models identical to larvae in shape, size and colour pattern. Finally, oviposition on plants harbouring a model bearing the larval colour pattern was reduced relative to plants bearing a leaf-green model, suggesting that the larval colour pattern was essential for avoidance.

Grouping buildings by typology (defined according to their main construction material and height) reduces the variability of the building response. Furthermore, by combining IMs, the NRRD can be predicted more accurately by a Building Damage Prediction Equation.

Plants collected before the introduction of webworms in North America and during the earliest stages of establishment (1850 – 1889) are lower in toxic furanocoumarins than all plants subsequently collected in North America and lower than European plant samples collected before 1889.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} {{have been suggested}} to explain why invasive exotic plants dramatically increase their abundance upon transport to a new range. The novel weapons hypothesis argues that phytotoxins secreted by roots of an exotic plant are more effective against naïve resident competitors in the range being invaded. The common reed Phragmites australis has a diverse population structure including invasive populations that are noxious weeds in North America. P. australis exudes the common phenolic gallic acid, which restricts the growth of native plants. However, the pathway for free gallic acid production in soils colonized by P. australis requires further elucidation. Here, we show that exotic, invasive P. australis contain elevated levels of polymeric gallotannin relative to native, noninvasive P. australis. We hypothesized that polymeric gallotannin can be attacked by tannase, an enzymatic activity produced by native plant and microbial community members, to release gallic acid in the rhizosphere and exacerbate the <b>noxiousness</b> of P. australis. Native plants and microbes were found to produce high levels of tannase while invasive P. australis produced very little tannase. These results suggest that both invasive and native species participate in signaling events that initiate the execution of allelopathy potentially linking native plant and microbial biochemistry to the invasive traits of an exotic species...|$|E

Of these, dorsal anterior cingulate and midcingulate areas are involved in preparing context-appropriate motor re-sponses to painful situations, but {{it is unclear whether}} the same holds for observed pain. Participants in this functional magnetic resonance imaging study viewed short animations depicting a noxious implement (e. g., a sharp knife) or an innocuous implement (e. g., a butter knife) striking a person’s hand. Partic-ipants were required to execute or suppress button-press re-sponses depending on whether the implements hit or missed the hand. The combination of the implement’s <b>noxiousness</b> and whether it contacted the hand strongly affected reaction times, with the fastest responses to noxious-hit trials. Blood oxygen level [...] de-pendent signal changes mirrored this behavioral interaction with increased activation during noxious-hit trials only in midcingulate, dorsal anterior, and dorsal posterior cingulate regions. Crucially, the activation in these cingulate regions also depended on whether the subject made an overt motor response to the event, linking their role in pain observation to their role in motor processing. This study also suggests a functional topography in medial premotor regions implicated in ‘‘pain empathy,’ ’ with adjacent activations relating to pain-selective and motor-selective components, and their interaction...|$|E
