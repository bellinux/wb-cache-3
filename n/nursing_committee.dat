Miss Fowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time, but though she needed care she did not exhaust her attendant's vitality. On the contrary, she gave out, stimulatingly and with reminiscences. Her father had been a minor Court official in the days when the Great Exhibition of 1851 had just set its seal on Civilisation made perfect. Some of Miss Fowler's tales, none the less, were not always for the young. Mary was not young, and though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair, she was never shocked. She listened unflinchingly to every one; said at the end, 'How interesting!' or 'How shocking!' as the case might be, and never again referred to it, for she prided herself on a trained mind, which 'did not dwell on these things.' She was, too, a treasure at domestic accounts, for which the village tradesmen, with their weekly books, loved her not. Otherwise she had no enemies; provoked no jealousy even among the plainest; neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to her; she supplied the odd place at the Rector's or the Doctor's table at half an hour's notice; she was a sort of public aunt to very many small children of the village street, whose parents, while accepting everything, would have been swift to resent what they called 'patronage'; she served on the Village <b>Nursing</b> <b>Committee</b> as Miss Fowler's nominee when Miss Fowler was crippled by rheumatoid arthritis, and came out of six months' fortnightly meetings equally respected by all the cliques.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the gerontology curriculum at small baccalaureate nursing programs (BSN). The population consisted of 112 BSN programs that had graduated 25 or fewer students in 1989 - 90. Small BSN programs were studied because they annually graduate 13 % of basic BSN students. This study determined that 8 % of classroom time was devoted to gerontology nursing, while three times as much clinical time was spent with older adults. The majority of faculty did not have academic gerontology preparation. Most programs integrated gerontology nursing content, rather than requiring a separate course. Twenty-eight percent of the programs required a gerontology nursing textbook, while the remained utilized general nursing texts in medical-surgical, fundamentals, community health, psychiatry, and health assessment. Most programs taught all 16 gerontology content areas highlighted in the American Nurses' Association 1986 curriculum study. Hospitals, home health, and nursing homes were predominately used for clinical experiences with older adults. Less than 5 % of the programs utilized a wellness setting for their students' initial gerontology experience. It was concluded that most small BSN programs needed to strengthen their gerontology curriculum. Recommendations included faculty development, content expansion, ongoing coordination by a gerontology <b>nursing</b> <b>committee,</b> and initial student experiences with healthy older adults...|$|E

40|$|Implementation forum Building a {{foundation}} for evidence-based practice: experiences in a tertiary hospital The aim {{of this article is}} to report on the creation and early inno-vations of an evidence-based <b>nursing</b> <b>committee</b> in a tertiary hospital. During a post-merger transitional period, the Evidence-based Nursing (EBN) Committee conducted a number of projects, which included selecting an evidence-based practice (EBP) model for nursing; developing a process for prioritising and disseminat-ing research findings to healthcare programmes; and evaluating an important EBP application in direct patient care. Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS), a 1157 bed tertiary hospital providing inpatient and outpatient acute and long term care across several health programmes, is a recent merger of 2 hospi-tals at 4 sites in a large city in southern Ontario, Canada. Approximately 2900 nurses (2550 Registered Nurses and 380 Registered Nursing Assistants) are employed by HHS in either full or part time positions in health programmes that range from infertility services and obstetrical care to a large and progressive cardiac surgery programme. HHS provides regional services to 2. 2 million people in Hamilton and Central South Ontario. In 2000, the Nursing Practice Committee (NPC), a nursing body that represents direct care nurses, sets the general direction for nursing, and is accountable to the Chief Nursing Officer, identified 3 priorities for development. One of these priorities was to develop the use of EBP by nurses at the bedside. Therefore, with accountability to the NPC, the EBN Committee was created and given themandate of developing the use of EBP at the patient care level and recommending processes that would promote EBP among direct care nurses. In 2002, the mandate and responsibilities were expanded (see table 1). Under the co-leadership of a clinical nurse specialist (BK) and a school of nursing faculty member with a track record in health services research (EAM), the EBN Committee membership was established taking the following factors into account: c hospital sites c healthcare programmes c major representation of direct care Registered Nurses an...|$|E
