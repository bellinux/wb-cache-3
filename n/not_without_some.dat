5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that he should be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> reluctance.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} {{retirement}} in the Adams' household were <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> temporary financial adversity; in 1803 the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed.

5|$|The mill site in Billerica was <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> controversy. The dam, {{which had}} been {{constructed}} in the 1790s to provide water for the Middlesex Canal, was believed {{by some to be}} responsible for the flooding of fields upstream as far as Sudbury. There were calls to remove the dam, as well as legal action, which Talbot vigorously resisted. The dispute was partly played out in the state legislature, and brought Talbot to the attention of political leaders as a potential candidate for office. Talbot also opposed plans developed by the city of Boston to divert waters of the Sudbury River (a major tributary of the Concord River) for its water supply.|$|E

25|$|The {{township}} formula {{created by}} Thomas Jefferson was first {{implemented in the}} Northwest Territory through the Land Ordinance of 1785. The square surveys of the Northwest Territory would become {{a hallmark of the}} Midwest, as sections, townships, counties (and states) were laid out scientifically, and land was sold quickly and efficiently (although <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> speculative aberrations).|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the war the German Empire had armed cruisers {{scattered}} across the globe. Some of them were used to attack Allied merchant shipping. The Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> embarrassment from its inability to protect friendly shipping. Most of the German East Asia Squadron was defeated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914.|$|E

25|$|Leo {{was the son}} of Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, an eminent Byzantine {{general who}} had {{distinguished}} himself in southern Italy. His brother, Bardas, was also a senior general, as were Bardas's sons Nikephoros and Leo. Nikephoros eventually became Emperor in 963–969. Little is known about Leo's early life. During the late reign of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), he married the sister of Constantine Barbaros, the Emperor's powerful parakoimomenos, and rose to the post of Domestic of the Schools. Although personally brave and <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> measure of success against the Arabs in the East, his ability as a general was rather limited. Steven Runciman attributed his rise more to his aristocratic origin and his familial connection with the parakoimomenos Constantine.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 9, Leonard and Penny marry, although <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> initial problems. They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying to sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy of the other. Leonard, concerned {{that he was trying}} to sabotage his relationship with Penny, meets with the woman he kissed on the boat. She barely remembers the incident and quickly grows bored with Leonard's ramblings, taking a sarcastic and dismissive tone toward him. From that meeting Leonard comes to terms with his insecurities and he and Penny are able to become more comfortable in dealing with their mutual fears about their relationship. Leonard seriously tries to move into Penny's apartment though Sheldon has serious objections and makes them compromise to spend multiple nights a week in Leonard's old room. Early in season 10, the couple is very happy to be finally living alone after Sheldon moves in with Amy.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the German Empire had cruisers {{scattered}} across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser , part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Qingdao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, most of the German East-Asia squadron—consisting of the armoured cruisers and , light cruisers and and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it met British warships. The German flotilla and sank two armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel, but was virtually destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, with only Dresden and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the Battle of Más a Tierra these too had been destroyed or interned.|$|E
25|$|Salme's {{troops were}} only Frenchmen that {{remained}} {{east of the}} Trebbia River. On 18 June MacDonald waited for his three missing divisions to arrive on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Suvorov planned to launch a powerful stroke with his right wing {{but was unable to}} get his columns moving. It was so quiet that Salme asked permission to go into Piacenza. The Coalition assault began at 4:00 pm and struck Salme first. He was ordered to retreat as soon as the enemy applied pressure but instead he stood his ground. Salme was wounded and so was his successor Jean Sarrazin. Finally Louis Joseph Lahure took command and withdrew the Advance Guard behind the Trebbia, but <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> confusion. When the Army of Naples retreated on 20 June it left behind wounded generals Salme, Rusca and Jean-Baptiste Olivier. Salme was held a prisoner by the Austrians until the Treaty of Lunéville in March 1801.|$|E
25|$|The filming was <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> {{level of}} concern over the {{environmental}} impact on the many film locations within national parks and conservation areas managed by the Department of Conservation. Wingnut Films Limited required and were granted a permit or 'concession' from the Department of Conservation to film within national parks and other conservation areas. The Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand and the Tongariro/Taupo Conservation Board considered the concession was questionably processed by the Department of Conservation. The concession permit (granted to Wingnut Films Limited) incorrectly allowed activities, such as fantasy filming and vehicles off roads at Tongariro National Park, that were not consistent with park management plans. The ecological significance of an internationally important wetland was ignored. The process was rushed through without public involvement in spite expressions of concern from the Tongariro Taupo Conservation Board. Considerations of effects and their mitigation were not rigorous. The process facilitated access to public conservation lands for a large-scale operation that ultimately {{had nothing to do}} with conservation purposes the Department of Conservation is required to promote.|$|E

25|$|Sometime during 90s BC, Metellus Pius {{was elected}} to the College of Pontiffs {{as a result of his}} family's {{eminence}} and influence. The outbreak of the Social War saw him employed as a legate in late 89 BC, probably of the consul Pompeius Strabo, where he won some battles against the Marsi. As a result of these victories, he was elected Praetor in the following year (88 BC). During his praetorship, he was tasked with enrolling the Italian allies as new Roman citizens within sixty days, in accordance with the Lex Plautia Papiria. Once this was completed, Metellus Pius was again posted to the Social War, replacing Gaius Cosconius on the southern front. He harassed the territory around Apulia, captured the town of Venusia, and defeated the leading Italian leader, Quintus Poppaedius Silo, who died in the storming of Venusia. Cicero, at the time a young man, also remembered hearing Metellus speak at contiones in Rome during this period, most likely during his praetorship. Cicero remarked of Metellus' ability: 'although no real orator, he was nonetheless <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>some</b> capacity for public speech'.|$|E

[...] During this time Nicholson was one of the only high-level representatives of Crown Rule in the colonies: most Crown Rule had been eliminated in the northern colonies, and the other southern colonies were governed by proprietary governors. [...] Nicholson recommended to the King that, in order to better establish a common social order and a coordinated defense, Crown Rule should be established over all of the colonies as quickly as possible, including the conversion of the proprietary colonies to crown colonies.|$|E
