50|$|A {{valid patent}} also {{requires}} a <b>non-obvious</b> <b>invention.</b> The invention {{must have some}} element of inventiveness. This concept originated in common law out {{of the notion that}} an invention must be inventive. It is now explicitly codified in section 28.3 of the Patent Act.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Patent Act of 1952, the Congress {{required}} only novelty and utility for issuance of patent, and never created any statutory requirement of nonobviousness. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, {{in the case}} of Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 52 U.S. 248 (1850), invalidated a patent {{on the grounds that it}} involved only a substitution of materials rather than any real innovation. The Hotchkiss court effectively added the requirement of nonobviousness, and it had been left to the judiciary to determine whether the patent involved <b>non-obvious</b> <b>invention.</b> Following that case, the Supreme Court issued myriad decisions with an evolving and unpredictable standard for obviousness. It was not until the Congress enacted the Patent Act of 1952 that the test was to be given with some degree of predictability.|$|E
40|$|In May, 1999, a Thai patent {{was granted}} on a {{composition}} containing Kwao Krua {{and several other}} ingredients. Due {{to the way the}} claims were written, many people were confused and were led to believe that the patent granted an exclusive right for all products containing over 10 per cent of Kwao Krua. It turns out that the patent examiners did not have access to the traditional medical non-patent literature. After the prior arts were revealed to DIP, what could be done with the Kwao Krua patent. In the long run, what could be done to prevent such confusion and problem from happening again. In conclusion, even when one is a patent holder, if the invention cannot satisfy the requirements for patentability in the first place, it will not hold up and the patent rights may not be enforceable. Only new, useful, and <b>non-obvious</b> <b>inventions</b> not on the exclusion list deserve patent protection, which will stimulate more technological invention and benefits the society...|$|R
50|$|Section 28.3 has a {{grace period}} {{of one year}} that allows the inventor, or a person who {{obtained}} knowledge directly or indirectly from the inventor, to disclose the invention without rendering the subsequent <b>invention</b> <b>non-obvious.</b>|$|R
