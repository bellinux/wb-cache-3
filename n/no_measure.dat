5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if <b>no</b> <b>measure</b> was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E

2500|$|Unable {{to resolve}} the crisis, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from Malaysia, {{choosing}} to [...] "sever all ties with a State Government that showed <b>no</b> <b>measure</b> of loyalty to its Central Government". Lee refused and tried {{to work out a}} compromise, but without success. He was later convinced by Goh Keng Swee that the secession was inevitable. Lee signed a separation agreement on 7 August 1965, which discussed Singapore's post-separation relations with Malaysia in order to continue co-operation in areas such as trade and mutual defence.|$|E
2500|$|The socialist Eftimiu {{argued that}} Furnicas {{politics}} were left-of-center, with Ranetti as [...] "a convinced democrat, anti-monarchic, {{an enemy of}} those who stood for the bourgeois-landowning society". His pen, Eftimiu claims, [...] "served to castigate racketeering politicians, prejudice, debauchery, fake patriotism, and all the dovetailing high-society that was creaking at the corners." [...] King Carol I himself was ridiculed, and aware of it, but took <b>no</b> <b>measure</b> to suppress Ranetti. Some of Furnicas most noted collaborators were visual artists: Ion Theodorescu-Sion, Camil Ressu, Iosif Iser, Francisc Șirato, Nicolae Petrescu Găină, and Ary Murnu—the latter remembered especially for his routine mockery of Ioan Kalinderu, administrator of the crown domains. The articles and caricatures were more lenient toward actor Ion Brezeanu, who was the other stock character in Furnica humor.|$|E

2500|$|To explain further, the {{question}} of whether a finitely additive measure exists—that is, preserved under certain transformations—depends on what transformations are allowed. The Banach measure of sets in the plane, which is preserved by translations and rotations, is not preserved by non-isometric transformations even when they do preserve the area of polygons. The points of the plane (other than the origin) can be divided into two dense sets which may be called A and B. If the A points of a given polygon are transformed by a certain area-preserving transformation and the B points by another, both sets can become subsets of the A points in two new polygons. The new polygons have the same area as the old polygon, but the two transformed sets cannot have the same measure as before (since they contain only part of the A points), and therefore there is <b>no</b> <b>measure</b> that [...] "works".|$|E

60|$|Hence, {{throughout}} the picture, {{the expression of}} space and size is dependent upon obscurity, united with, or rather resultant from, exceeding fulness. We destroy both space and size, either by the vacancy, which affords us <b>no</b> <b>measure</b> of space, or by the distinctness, which gives us a false one. The distance of Poussin, having no indication of trees, nor of meadows, nor of character of any kind, may be fifty miles off, or may be five; we cannot tell--we have <b>no</b> <b>measure,</b> and in consequence, no vivid impression. But a middle distance of Hobbima's involves a contradiction in terms; it states a distance by perspective, which it contradicts by distinctness of detail.|$|E

60|$|He {{did not get}} on very well, {{not because}} there were not enough amusing people beside him and over against him, but because he was all the time trying to {{eavesdrop}} what was saying between Miss Hernshaw and the man on her right.
