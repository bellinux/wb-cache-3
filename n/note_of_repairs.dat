40|$|Uterine rupture is {{the primary}} concern when a patient chooses a trial of labor after a cesarean section. Bladder rupture {{accompanied}} by uterine rupture {{should be taken into}} consideration if gross hematuria occurs. We report the case of a patient with uterine rupture during a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. She had a normal course of labor and no classic signs of uterine rupture. However, gross hematuria was <b>noted</b> after <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the episiotomy. The patient began to complain of progressive abdominal pain, gross hematuria and oliguria. Cystoscopy revealed a direct communication between the bladder and the uterus. When opening the bladder peritoneum, rupture sites over the anterior uterus and posterior wall of the bladder were <b>noted.</b> Following primary <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> both wounds, a Foley catheter was left in place for 12 days. The patient had achieved a full recovery by the 2 -year follow-up examination. Bladder injury and uterine rupture can occur at any time during labor. Gross hematuria immediately after delivery is the most common presentation. Cystoscopy is a good tool to identify the severity of bladder injury...|$|R
40|$|Oral PresentationOBJECTIVE: TAPE {{technique}} {{has been described}} for the <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> supra-pubic midline incisional hernia with satisfactory outcome. Our aim is to study the feasibility and safety <b>of</b> <b>repairing</b> non-midline lower abdominal hernia as an extended indication for TAPE technique. METHOD: Patients with IPOM ventral hernia repair in all affiliated Hospitals of the University of Hong Kong were reviewed. Prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Peritoneal incision was created just below the defect with pre-peritoneal dissection. Non-adhesive mesh then placed partial intra-peritoneally to cover the defect, and partially cover the whole extra-peritoneal space prepared. Meshes were fixed by tackers for intraperitoneal part, most inferior fixation points were at peritoneal incision line. Extra-peritoneal part of meshes covered up by the peritoneal flap. Fixation {{of this part of}} the meshes were facilitated by the peritoneal flap and subsequent fibrosis and adhesion to the extra-peritoneal structures. RESULTS: From 1. 2008 to 6. 2016, among 123 patients reviewed, 3 with lateral lower abdominal hernia requiring extended TAPE repair were included for the analysis with 1 right lower paramedian and 2 post-TRAM flap donor site incisional hernia. All are female patients with mean age of 49. 7 years old, mean size of defect was 123. 3 cm 2 and mean follow-up time of 22. 2 months. All patient recovered uneventfully and no morbidity or recurrence <b>noted.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>Repair</b> <b>of</b> lateral lower abdominal incisional hernia with this novel modified technique is safe and feasible.

40|$|Previous {{results from}} this {{laboratory}} have shown that phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated bovine lymphocytes exhibit a peak <b>of</b> ultraviolet-induced DNA <b>repair</b> synthesis 3 to 4 days after addition of mitogen. The level <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> synthesis was approximately tenfold higher than that in unstimulated lymphocytes.

However, in mitogen-stimulated cells the time taken to repair DNA strand breaks was 6 hours compared to 12 hours in stationary phase lymphocytes after a U. V. dose of 5 J/m. These results suggest that the increased rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> strand breaks is due to the induction of enzymes involved at the post-incision stage <b>of</b> DNA <b>repair.</b> Thus the increased level <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> synthesis observed in earlier work correlates with an increased rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> DNA strand breaks in phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated bovine lymphocytes...|$|R

However, analysis of the historic records identified repair cycles which, when supplemented with conditions assessments, could be used to inform preventive conservation planning and the formation of building reinvestment plans.

Simultaneously, numerous existing concrete structures needs to be repaired as they do not meet today's safety standard. As a result, annually billions of EUR will continue to be spent in order to repair deteriorated concrete structures. The need to mitigate premature failure <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures has to inspire many researchers to develop service life prediction model for repaired concrete structures. However, till today, service life <b>of</b> <b>repaired</b> concrete structures is just an estimate which relies on individual's experience.

40|$|Studies {{showing that}} {{different}} types of DNA adducts are repaired in human cells at different rates suggest that DNA adduct conformation is the major determinant of the rate <b>of</b> nucleotide excision <b>repair.</b> However, recent studies <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) -induced adducts at the nucleotide level in DNA of normal human fibroblasts indicate that the rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the same adduct at different nucleotide positions can vary up to 10 -fold, suggesting an important role for local DNA conformation. To see if site-specific DNA repair is a common phenomenon for bulky DNA adducts, we determined the rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> 1 -nitrosopyrene (1 -NOP) -induced adducts in exon 3 of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene at the nucleotide level using ligation-mediated PCR. To distinguish between the contributions of adduct conformation and local DNA conformation to the rate <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> we compared the results obtained with 1 -NOP with those we obtained previously using BPDE. The principal DNA adduct formed by either agent involves guanine. We found that rates <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> 1 -NOP-induced adducts also varied significantly at the nucleotide level, but the pattern <b>of</b> site-specific <b>repair</b> differed from that of BPDE-induced adducts at the same guanine positions in the same region of DNA. The average rate <b>of</b> excision <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> 1 -NOP adducts in exon 3 was {{two to three times}} faster than that of BPDE adducts, but at particular nucleotides the rate was slower or faster than that of BPDE adducts or, in some cases, equal to that of BPDE adducts. These results indicate that the contribution of the local DNA conformation to the rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> at a particular nucleotide position depends upon the specific DNA adduct involved. However, the data also indicate that the conformation of the DNA adduct is not the only factor contributing to the rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> at different nucleotide positions. Instead, the rate <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> at a particular nucleotide position depends on the interaction between the specific adduct conformation and the local DNA conformation at that nucleotide...|$|R

40|$|High force {{eccentric}} muscle actions, during forcibly lengthening contracting muscle, {{have been}} found to produce pronounced muscle damage, especially if exercise is unaccustomed. A cascade of events is initiated in order to repair damaged skeletal muscle tissue including degeneration and regeneration processes. For the duration of muscle regeneration, satellite cells are the primary source of new myoblasts in adult muscle. This process requires activation of quiescent mononucleated satellite cells which proliferate, differentiate and fuse together to form fully functional muscle fibres. The satellite cells are specified by the gene, Pax 7, during development. Experimental studies of Pax 7 null mice that lack the Pax 7 gene revealed that after birth {{there is little or no}} skeletal muscle growth or regeneration. Recently polymorphic repeats have been determined within the promoter and intronic regions of the human P AX 7 gene. The promoter polymorphism has been shown to alter the transcription efficiency of this promoter in vitro. It is of great interest to <b>note</b> that efficiency <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> muscle damage varies considerably between individuals. This leads to a conclusion that variation in Pax 7 polymorphic sequences between individuals could affect skeletal muscle regeneration by virtue of the crucial role of Pax 7 in satellite cell specification. We have measured allelic variation of Pax 7 (promoter and intronic) in population groups and in volunteers undergoing forced exercise induced damage. Preliminary data suggests that there is a significant variation in allele frequencies between the study population groups. With respect to promoter polymorphisms, there is a trend toward high responders being associated with allele 8 (8 CCT repeats) and a trend towards low responders being associated with allele 11 (11 CCT repeats). On the other hand, allelic variation with respect to the P AX 7 intronic polymorphism cannot explain the observed differences in recovery of force following damage by eccentric exercise...|$|R
