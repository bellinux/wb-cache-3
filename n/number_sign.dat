25|$|Telephone {{numbers are}} {{sometimes}} prefixed with special services, such as vertical service codes, that contain signaling events other than numbers, {{most notably the}} star (*) and the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> (#). Vertical service codes enable or disable special telephony services either on a per-call basis, or for the station or telephone line until changed. The use of the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> is most frequently used as a marker signal to indicate the end of digit sequences {{or the end of}} other procedures; as a terminator it avoids operational delays when waiting for expiration of automatic time-out periods.|$|E

25|$|Between 2700 and 2000 BC, in Sumer, {{the round}} stylus was {{gradually}} {{replaced by a}} reed stylus {{that was used to}} press wedge-shaped cuneiform signs in clay. These cuneiform <b>number</b> <b>signs</b> resembled the round <b>number</b> <b>signs</b> they replaced and retained the additive sign-value notation of the round <b>number</b> <b>signs.</b> These systems gradually converged on a common sexagesimal number system; this was a place-value system consisting of only two impressed marks, the vertical wedge and the chevron, which could also represent fractions. This sexagesimal number system was fully developed {{at the beginning of the}} Old Babylonia period (about 1950BC) and became standard in Babylonia.|$|R

25|$|Fully {{contracted}} braille {{is known}} as Grade 2 Braille. There is an intermediate form between Computer Braille—one-for-one identity with print—and Grade 2, which is called Grade 1 Braille. In Grade 1, the capital sign and <b>Number</b> <b>sign</b> are used, and most punctuation marks are shown using their Grade 2 values.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{technical}} limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) {{and the fact}} that the sharp symbol (...) is not present on most keyboard layouts, the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> (...) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.|$|E

For example, [...] (one twentieth) is , but 20/20 [...] is [...] The braille <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> has no equivalent in print.

2500|$|In addition, {{there are}} ten {{patterns}} {{that are based}} on the first two letters (...) shifted to the right; these were assigned to non-French letters (ì ä ò [...] ), or serve non-letter functions: [...] (superscript; in English the accent mark), [...] (currency prefix), [...] (capital, in English the decimal point), [...] (<b>number</b> <b>sign),</b> [...] (emphasis mark), [...] (symbol prefix).|$|E
2500|$|Braille {{has several}} {{formatting}} marks, sometimes called [...] "composition signs", [...] "register marks", or [...] "indicators", which have no {{one-to-one correspondence with}} printed English. These are the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> , the letter sign , the capital sign , the italic sign (or more accurately the emphasis sign) , and the termination sign [...] (written cap–apostrophe). These immediately precede the sequence (word or number) they modify, without an intervening space.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{there had}} been nine decades. The fifth through ninth used dashes as well as dots, but proved to be {{impractical}} and was soon abandoned. These could be replaced with {{what we now know}} as the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> (...) , though that only caught on for the digits (old 5th decade → modern 1st decade). The dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply dropped, producing the modern fifth decade. (See 1829 braille.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In a tripcode system, {{a secret}} {{password}} {{is added to}} the user's name following a separator character (often a <b>number</b> <b>sign).</b> This password, or tripcode, is hashed into a special key, or trip, distinguishable from the name by HTML styles. Tripcodes cannot be faked but on some types of forum software they are insecure and can be guessed. [...] On other types, they can be brute forced with software designed to search for tripcodes such as Tripcode Explorer.|$|E
2500|$|Anticipating {{that the}} dashes might prove problematic, Braille {{provided}} that the supplemental sign [...] (now known as the <b>number</b> <b>sign)</b> would shift the decade by four. That is, adding it to the first four decades would produce substitutes for the fifth through eighth. Only its use to replace the old fifth decade has been retained; the old sixth decade survives as the modern fifth, with the dash removed and the dots shifted down to replace it. The original proposal was as follows: ...|$|E

By convention, [...] "#" [...] is treated as a single symbol, and specific values of # are written by replacing the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> with the value. The two ways to increase the f-stop are to either decrease {{the diameter of}} the entrance pupil or change to a longer focal length (in the case of a zoom lens, this can be done by simply adjusting the lens). Higher f-numbers also have a larger depth of field due to the lens approaching the limit of a pinhole camera which is able to focus all images perfectly, regardless of distance, but requires very long exposure times.|$|E
2500|$|The letter sign is used {{to force}} {{the end of a}} series of numbers. For example, [...] preceded by a <b>number</b> <b>sign,</b> , is read as 41. If instead 4a is {{intended}} (as in a section or apartment number), then the letter sign {{is used to}} force a reading of a rather than 1 for the final character: [...] It is also used to mark a character as standing for a letter rather than for a word. For example, [...] on its own is normally read as the word but; to indicate that it is instead the letter b, the letter sign is used: [...] b. Plurals of letters (mind your ps and qs) always use an apostrophe in braille, but other derivations may not, as in [...] nth : [...] is Sing, [...] is S-ing/Essing.

5000|$|Some {{software}} {{supports the}} use of the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> (...) {{as an alternative to the}} semicolon for indicating comments. Practically speaking, using it to begin a line may effectively change a variable name on that line. For instance, the following line creates a variable named [...] "#var", but not one named [...] "var"; this is sometimes used to create a pseudo-implementation of a comment.#var=aMore generally, use of the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> is unpredictable, as in these following lines (note the space after the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> in the second line). For this reason, the <b>number</b> <b>sign</b> character should not be used to begin comments.#section# var=a ...|$|E
