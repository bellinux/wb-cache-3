40|$|Background <b>Natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> {{products}} {{have been known}} to cause severe anaphylactic reactions during surgery. Even 25 years after the first description of anaphylactic reactions in the literature, <b>natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> products are still used in pediatric surgery. Case presentation The following article describes the case of a healthy 4. 5 -year old Caucasian boy who simultaneously developed severe hypotension, tachycardia and bronchospasm during surgery for congenital strabismus sursoadductorius under uneventful anesthesia. An allergy test conducted afterwards showed <b>natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> as the trigger for this severe intraoperative anaphylactic reaction. This case was special because of the absence of any previous clinical or anamnestical evidence of <b>natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> allergy. The fact that the child had been previously exposed to <b>natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> – because the boy’s mother used disposable gloves for her work as a cosmetician at home – was only discovered later. Such contact may have had a slight sensitizing effect that manifested after the initial contact with the conjunctiva through the surgeon’s <b>natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> gloves. Conclusion <b>Natural</b> latex <b>rubber</b> {{products have}} caused severe anaphylactic reactions time and again. Diagnosis is impeded by the highly variable clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis, the non-responsivity of patients, anesthesia-induced changes in blood pressure, surgical drapes, and blood loss. Therefore, use of alternative products and implementation of the right course of action in clinical routine seems to be even more important than raising awareness for allergies to <b>natural</b> latex <b>rubber...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} of pepper and <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> contributes {{significantly to the}} total national output.

5|$|Kerala {{produces}} 97% of {{the national}} output of black pepper and accounts for 85% of the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the country. Coconut, tea, coffee, cashew, and spices—including cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg are the main agricultural products. 80% of India's export quality cashew kernels are prepared in Kollam. The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields. Home gardens made up {{a significant portion of}} the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini.|$|E
5|$|The Free State was intended, above all, to be {{profitable}} for its investors and Leopold in particular. Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on ivory exports {{did not make}} {{as much money as}} hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting on a number of occasions. A boom in demand for <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting wild rubber which could then be exported to Europe and North America. The rubber boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits. Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.|$|E

5|$|The colour of the L.volemus {{mushroom}} {{varies from}} apricot to tawny, and the cap may {{be up to}} 11cm (in) wide. The pale golden yellow gills {{on the underside of}} the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of latex ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the common names weeping milk cap and voluminous-latex milky. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to ergosterol, some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> that has been chemically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies, rather than a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and {{by their}} agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha and even inflatable caoutchouc (<b>natural</b> <b>rubber)</b> were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the crinoline.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E

5|$|The Abir Congo Company (founded as the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{and later}} {{known as the}} Compagnie du Congo Belge) was a company that {{exploited}} <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the Congo Free State, the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{changed its name to}} the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for tax purposes to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare rubber vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (<b>natural</b> <b>rubber).</b> The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E

25|$|Close to 28 {{million tons}} of rubber were {{produced}} in 2013, of which approximately 44% was natural.

40|$|International audienceThe {{disposal}} of urban solid residues {{is an enormous}} problem, {{especially in the case}} of vulcanized rubbers like tires. The old practice of landfilling is out of use due to the rising land costs, environmental concerns, fire risks and the possibility of proliferation of mosquitoes and other disease-carrying vectors. Devul-canization is shown to be an effective technique for making rubbers to flow and to be remolded. However, this process not only breaks down sulphur links, but also creates new other bonds, modifying the structure of the material as a whole. In order to help understand structural modifications of ground tire rubbers (GTR) as a result of devulcanization by microwaves, this work proposes an in-depth study of the chemical modifications, flow and thermo-oxidative degradation behavior as a function of the exposure time of the GTR to microwaves. An important conclusion is that the final temperature reached by the sample is the primary factor responsible for the success of the process. Depending on the final temperature of the sample, different types of sulphur bonds can be broken. During the treatment, there is a balance between break down and formation of new bonds. Therefore, it is important to control the process carefully in order to avoid degradation of the main chains. Tires usually are composed of a mixture of synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>rubbers,</b> wherein <b>natural</b> <b>rubbers</b> could be more degraded by microwaves because carbon black is mainly found on this phase...|$|R
