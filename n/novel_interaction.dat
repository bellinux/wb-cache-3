40|$|Climate {{change will}} likely {{reshuffle}} ecological communities, causing <b>novel</b> species <b>interactions</b> that could profoundly influence how populations and communities respond to changing conditions. Nonetheless, predicting {{the impacts of}} <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> is challenging, partly because many methods of inference are contingent on the current configuration of climatic variables and species distributions. Focusing on competition, we argue that experiments designed to quantify <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> in ways that can inform species distribution models are urgently needed, and suggest an empirical agenda to pursue this goal, illustrated using plants. An emerging convergence of ideas from macroecology and demographically focused competition theory offers opportunities to mechanistically incorporate competition into species distribution models, while forging closer ties between experimental ecology and macroecology...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} biotic introductions, {{there is}} a great need for predictive tools to anticipate which new trophic interactions will develop and which will not. Phylogenetic constraint of interactions in both native and novel food webs can make some <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> predictable. However, many food webs are sparsely sampled, or may include inaccurate interactions. In such cases, it is unclear whether modeling methods are still useful to anticipate <b>novel</b> <b>interactions.</b> We ran bootstrap simulations of host-use models on a Lepidoptera-plant data set to remove native trophic records or add erroneous records in order to observe the effect of missing or erroneous data on the prediction of <b>interactions</b> with <b>novel</b> plants. We found that the model was robust to a large amount of missing interaction records, but lost predictive power with the addition of relatively few erroneous interaction records. The loss of predictive power with missing records was due to inaccuracy in estimating phylogenetic distance between native and novel hosts. Removal of interaction records proportionally to their encounter frequency in the field had little effect on the loss of predictive power. Host-use models may have immediate value for predicting <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> from large, but sparsely sampled databases of trophic interactions...|$|R

50|$|While Brichter was {{initially}} developing Tweetie, {{he wanted to}} add a refresh function to the application.

Here we present a supervised approach to identification of gene expression regulatory networks. Results The method {{is based on a}} kernel approach accompanied with genetic programming. As a data source, the method utilizes gene expression time series for prediction of interactions among regulatory proteins and their target genes. The performance of the method was verified using Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle and DNA/RNA/protein biosynthesis gene expression data. The results were compared with independent data sources. Finally, a prediction of <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> within yeast gene expression circuits has been performed.

It is argued that such a need arises in cases where the means for effective communication are often somewhat limited. As Carvalho [...] states, this is because [...] "...operators use verbal exchanges to produce continuous, redundant and recursive interactions to successfully construct and maintain individual and mutual awareness...".

40|$|In {{comparison}} to {{all types of}} injury, those to the brain {{are among the most}} likely to result in death or permanent disability. Some of these brain-injured people cannot communicate, recreate, or control their environment due to severe motor impairment. This group of individuals with severe head injury have received limited help from assistive technology. Brain-Computer Interfaces have opened up a spectrum of assistive technologies, which are particularly appropriate for people with traumatic brain injury, especially those who suffer from “locked-in” syndrome. The research challenge here is to develop <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> paradigms that suit brain-injured individuals, who could then use it for everyday communications. The developed interaction paradigms should require minimum training, reconfigurable and minimum effort to use. This thesis reports on the development of <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> paradigms for Brain-Body Interfaces to help brain-injured people to communicate better, recreate and control their environment using computers despite the severity of their brain injury. The investigation was carried out in three phases. Phase one was an exploratory study where a first <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> paradigm was developed and evaluated with able-bodied and disabled participants. Results obtained were fed into the next phase of the investigation. Phase two was carried out with able participants who acted as development group for the second <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> paradigm. This second <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> paradigm was evaluated with non-verbal participants with severe brain injury in phase three. An iterative design research methodology was chosen to develop the interaction paradigms. A non-invasive assistive technology device named Cyberlink™ was chosen as the Brain-Body Interface. This research improved previous work in this area by developing new interaction paradigms of personalised tiling and discrete acceleration in Brain- Body Interfaces. The research hypothesis of this study ‘that the performance of the Brain-Body Interface can be improved by the use of <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> paradigms’ was successfully demonstrated.

40|$|Current {{interactions}} on direct-touch interactive {{surfaces are}} often modeled based on {{properties of the}} input channel that are common in traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as x-y coordinate information. Leveraging additional information available on the surfaces could potentially result in richer and <b>novel</b> <b>interactions.</b> In this paper we specifically explore the role of finger orientation. This property is typically ignored in touch-based interactions {{partly because of the}} ambiguity in determining it solely from the contact shape. We present a simple algorithm that unambiguously detects the directed finger orientation vector in real-time from contact information only, by considering the dynamics of the finger landing process. Results of an experimental evaluation show that our algorithm is stable and accurate. We then demonstrate how finger orientation can be leveraged to enable <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> and to infer higher-level information such as hand occlusion or user position.

40|$|Quantitative {{outcomes}} of insect herbivore-plant interactions typically vary spatially and temporally. Prediction of {{where and when}} insects will impose significant damage, or mediate indirect interactions among plants is elusive, but important for management of exotic species. We examine two <b>novel</b> insect -plant <b>interactions</b> to address: 1) relative effects of <b>novel</b> vs. co-evolved <b>interactions</b> on plant fitness and population dynamics; and, 2) roles of phenology and spatial variation in driving those effects. In case 1, interaction between Cirsium canescens and Rhinocyllus conicus is direct, and the insect is exotic. In case 2, the interaction between C. vulgare and insect herbivores is indirect, and mediated by proximity to its native conger, C. altissimum. In both cases, {{we found that the}} <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> had larger effects on plant survival, growth and fecundity than did similar, co-evolved ones. For both, spatial variation in the abundance of alterative host plants at site and landscape scales were important in explaining variation in plant damage. Further, in case 1, C. canescens geographic location influenced the magnitude of floral herbivory; and, degree of phenological overlap between insect and plant was critical to explaining variation in weevil oviposition loads. Also in case 2, the proximity of exotic C. vulgare to native C. altissimum determined its native insect load. We conclude that key processes driving variation in <b>novel</b> <b>interactions</b> are similar to those driving coevolved interactions. However, broader consideration of such processes is needed in assessing management options...|$|R

Knock-down of Beclin 1 sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and introduction of survivin antagonized the sensitizing effect, suggesting that down-regulation of survivin mediates the enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate a <b>novel</b> <b>interaction</b> between Beclin 1 and survivin, and may provide a potential mechanism underlying the cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis...|$|E
