She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there was <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E
5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E
25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This {{would have made the}} beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|E

[...] In June 1991, Newsweek reported that staffers for Time said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for Time, who {{asked them if they}} had signed a confidentiality form about the article. Time editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told Newsweek that [...] "sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time". A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims [...] "scurrilous".|$|E

Of the fourteen individuals, five are members of the Chippewa Cree tribe on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation in Montana and are associated with the Team Redskins Rodeo club. Two are Mike Wetzel and Don Wetzel, Jr. (Blackfeet), descendants of the logo designer, and the six others are members of various tribes and state that they are fans of the team and find <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> name, or think it is positive. One of the individuals in the video is Mark One Wolf, who was reported as being born Mark E. Yancey in Washington, D.C., of African-American and Japanese descent.|$|E
500|$|The Arbiter changed {{very little}} during development, as the overall {{appearance}} of the alien Covenant Elites had been designed and developed for the previous game, 2001's [...] The only substantial difference between the Arbiter and other Elites is ceremonial armor seen in early concept sketches and {{which appeared in the}} final design. During Halo 2s early developmental stages the character's name was [...] "Dervish", a name from the Sufi sect of Islam. Out of context, Microsoft Game Studios' [...] "geocultural review" [...] consultants found <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> name. However, as Tom Edwards, a consultant who worked with Microsoft during the review noted, [...] "within the game's context this Islamic-related name of 'Dervish' set up a potentially problematic allegory related to Halo 2s plot—the -like forces (Master Chief/Sarge) versus Islam (the religious Covenant, which already had a 'Prophet of Truth' which is one title for Muhammad). Since this incident was not long after the September 11 attacks, sensitivity to the name remained high, and the character's name was changed to the [...] "Arbiter".|$|E

25|$|An inquiry by the Competition Commission – the country’s anti-trust regulator, has {{indicated}} that a difference in performance between foreign and local business owners has created a perception that foreigners are more successful than locals.

50|$|The first bench run {{took place}} in 1940, {{becoming}} the world's first turboprop engine to run. However, although the design was inherently sound, combustion problems were experienced which limited the output to around 400 bhp.

500|$|The {{ratings of}} the Itchy & Scratchy Show segment on the Krusty the Clown Show {{suddenly}} fail. Krusty orders the cartoon's producer, Roger Meyers, {{to find a way}} to fix the sagging ratings, or else a Chinese cartoon will replace Itchy and Scratchy. Meyers decides to commission a focus group to discover why Itchy and Scratchy has lost its popularity. Bart and Lisa participate in the study, by watching cartoons and answering the questions. However, things do not go well, with the children contradicting themselves when explaining what they want. Eventually, Lisa tells the executives that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show and that it is as good as it has ever been—but after being on TV for so long, the show does not have as much an impact on audiences as it did in its early years. Meyers thanks Lisa for [...] "saving" [...] Itchy and Scratchy, and decides that his cartoon's salvation lies in a new character. He tells Krusty and his team of writers that this new character should be a dog with [...] "attitude", who will be called Poochie.|$|E
500|$|Todd Gilchrist of IGN wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, stating that the film is [...] "an almost perfect achievement." [...] Gilchrist also praised how the film revived interest in animation as it was released {{at a time when}} interest in animation was at a lull. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review of the film, referring to it as a [...] "likably unspectacular adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic." [...] Hinson went on to write that the film is average even at its highest points. He wrote that while there is <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film, {{it would be difficult for}} children to identify with Ariel and that the characters seemed bland. Hinson concluded his review saying that the film is [...] "accomplished but uninspiring, The Little Mermaid has enough to please any kid. All that's missing is the magic." [...] Empire gave {{a positive}} review of the film, stating that [...] " [...] a charmer of a movie, boasting all the ingredients that make a Disney experience something to treasure yet free of all the politically correct, formulaic elements that have bogged down the more recent productions." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love Profusion" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Paoletta from Billboard described the song as a [...] "sparse number" [...] {{and said that}} it was a [...] "good fit" [...] for the radio. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "lovely". Ian Youngs of BBC News commented that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] is one of the highlights from the album, with layers of dance beats and acoustic guitar that made it a more complete song. A writer for Daily Record described it as a [...] "stunningly beautiful ballad" [...] and considered it as one of the many highlights from American Life. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it [...] "dull" [...] and wrote that [...] "it was reinvented into a vibrant piece of guitar-driven pop-rock by Ray Carroll." [...] Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone deduced that with lyrics like [...] "I got you under my skin", Madonna conveyed the theme of gaining transcendence through detachment, [...] "but finally American Life comes across as defeatist more than anything else". Dan Aquilante from New York Post was dismissive of the track, saying that although there was <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> guitar-driven composition of the track, it was not different from the strings and orchestration of other tracks from American Life, like [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] or [...] "Easy Ride". Robert Hilburn, while reviewing American Life for The Press of Atlantic City, listed the track as one of the songs that could [...] "save" [...] the album from being a [...] "profound fail". Ross Raihala, writing for The Olympian listed the track as a standout on American Life, in contrast to the [...] "dreary, directionless dance numbers and plodding ballads" [...] on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War.

The Commonwealth was further bound to the South by the Mississippi River and its tributaries, which were the main commercial outlet for her surplus produce, although railroad connections to the North were beginning to diminish {{the importance of this}} tie.

2500|$|At the time, {{opposition}} to changing the flag came from various sides, including from Confederate historical {{groups like the}} United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). Opponents to a change of the flag stated that incorporating the Confederate battle flag into the design would be too sectionalist, counterproductive, and divisive, saying that people should show patriotism towards the United States rather than the defunct Confederacy, referring to the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, which states that the U.S. was [...] "one nation" [...] and [...] "indivisible". Opponents to the flag's change also {{said that there was}} <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1920 flag and that people were content with it.

[...] He concluded by calling the game a missed opportunity; [...] "there's absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game in concept, and done properly, it would easily have established it as a classic on par with the film on which it's based.
