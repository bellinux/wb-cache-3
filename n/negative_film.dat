5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and the skills of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on August 15, 1983. All but {{two days}} of production were filmed on Paramount soundstages, by cinematographer Charles Correll. The Search for Spock {{was one of the}} first major feature films to use Eastman 5294, a color high speed <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> stock. The film allowed Correll latitude in choosing a broad range of exposure indexes. Since The Search for Spock was shot with anamorphic lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen 70mm prints, Correll needed to produce a crisp depth of field, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50foot-candles.|$|E

40|$|Affective {{films are}} often used in emotion {{research}} and <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> are frequently used as an analogue for trauma (trauma film paradigm). However, different films are used with possibly distinct consequences. We aimed to investigate specific effects of four <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> covering distinct themes (physical, sexual, traffic and food), and tested neutral and positive films with matching content. Self-reported emotional responses and heart rate during the films were examined (immediate responses) as well as intrusions of the films in the subsequent week (delayed responses). Within each theme, <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> were rated as more unpleasant than the positive and neutral counterparts. They also evoked more negative emotions and more intrusive memories. Across themes, the four <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> {{did not differ in}} terms of valence and arousal, but clearly differed on immediate (e. g., disgust, embarrassment, heart rate) and delayed (intrusions) effects. Thus, we urge researchers to carefully select <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> for their studies, as different films seem to evoke distinct emotional responses. In addition, using positive films within the same themes is recommended in order to control for effects of arousal. In general, the specific film material should be considered when comparing effects across studies...|$|R

50|$|Some {{chromogenic}} black-and-white <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> also exist, {{mainly to}} exploit the wide availability of C-41 processing. These films have softer grain and less contrast than traditional silver halide films. In these films, a single emulsion layer has panchromatic sensitivity. The dye image is typically slightly blue because of the choice of dye couplers, and this tends to produce a dark sepia tone when printed on full-color chromogenic paper. Examples of black-and-white chromogenic <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> are Ilford XP2 Super and Kodak BW400CN.|$|R

Ice received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star. SBK stated that they overexposed Ice and Ice decided to stop taking their business advice as well as distancing himself from the image that SBK was trying to create for him. In late 1991, Ice appeared in the Circus of the Stars and Sideshow, driving his motorcycle through a wall of fire. While his fame in the United States had severely dropped, Ice continued touring in 1992, playing in South America, Europe, Australia and Asia, premiering new songs like [...] "Get Loose", [...] "The Wrath", [...] "Now & Forever", [...] "Where the Dogs At? (All Night Long)", [...] "Minutes of Power" [...] and [...] "Iceman Party". [...] After a performance in Acapulco, the city honored Ice with a medal that represented [...] "all the respect and admiration to [...] music and to [...] as an artist from the Mexican people". Ice also served as a spokesperson for Nike and Coca-Cola throughout 1991 and 1992. In 1993, Ice toured Eastern Europe again and premiered songs off his upcoming album in St. Petersburg, Russia in front of President Boris Yeltsin.|$|E
40|$|Photography {{was always}} a popular pastime, and with the ever {{increasing}} availability of cameras, films and other equipment, more people are taking it up as a bobby. Many are interested enough {{to do their own}} developing and printing black and white photographs. A survey of photographic literature shows that most of the normal <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> can be processed to give black and white positives. Therefore it was decided to work out the necessary details for one particular film ILFORD HP 4, which seemed to give the best results during our trials. A general procedure, which is applicable to all <b>negative</b> <b>films,</b> should help in understanding the processes involved. N/...|$|R

500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of <b>negative</b> <b>film.</b> Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E
2500|$|A {{color film}} {{is made up}} of many {{different}} layers that work together to create the color image. [...] Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing silver halide crystals and dye-couplers. [...] A cross-sectional representation of a piece of developed color <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> is shown in the figure at the right. [...] Each layer of the film is so thin that the composite of all layers, in addition to the triacetate base and antihalation backing, is less than 0.0003" [...] (8µm) thick.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potassium}} dichromate solution in sulfuric acid {{can be used}} to produce a reversal negative (i.e., a positive transparency from a <b>negative</b> <b>film).</b> This is effected by [...] developing a black and white film but allowing the development to proceed more or less to the end point. The development is then stopped by copious washing and the film then treated in the acid dichromate solution. This converts the silver metal to silver sulfate, a compound that is insensitive to light. After thorough washing and exposure to actinic light, the film is developed again allowing the previously unexposed silver halide to be reduced to silver metal.|$|E
50|$|Instant film {{is notable}} for {{having had a}} wider range of film speeds {{available}} than other <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> of the same era, having been produced in ISO 4 to ISO 20,000. Current instant film formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.|$|R

2500|$|Photographic film is {{made for}} {{specific}} light sources (most commonly daylight film and tungsten film), and, used properly, will create a neutral color print. Matching {{the sensitivity of the}} film to the color temperature of the light source is one way to balance color. If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the tungsten incandescent lamps will appear as white (3200K) in the photograph. [...] Color <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> is almost always daylight-balanced, since it is assumed that color can be adjusted in printing (with limitations, see above). [...] Color transparency film, being the final artefact in the process, has to be matched to the light source or filters must be used to correct color.|$|E
2500|$|However, HDR tone mapping, usually using local operators, {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular amongst digital photographers as a post-processing technique, where several exposures at different shutter speeds are combined to produce an HDR image and a tone mapping operator is then applied to the result. There are now many examples of locally tone mapped digital images, inaccurately known as [...] "HDR photographs", on the internet, and these are of varying quality. This popularity is partly driven by the distinctive appearance of locally tone mapped images, which many people find attractive, and partly {{by a desire to}} capture high-contrast scenes that are hard or impossible to photograph in a single exposure, and may not render attractively even when they can be captured. Although digital sensors actually capture a higher dynamic range than film, they completely lose detail in extreme highlights, clipping them to pure white, producing an unattractive result when compared with <b>negative</b> <b>film,</b> which tends to retain colour and some detail in highlights.|$|E
2500|$|The most-used {{photograph}} of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, {{about half a mile}} (800meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter. With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk) [...] hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color <b>negative</b> <b>film,</b> allowing him to make the shot. Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world and was said to have appeared {{on the front page of}} all European papers. He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but didn't win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|These two {{perforations}} {{have remained}} {{by far the}} most commonly used ones. BH perforations are also known as N (negative) and KS as P (positive). The Bell & Howell perf remains the standard for camera <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> because of its perforation dimensions in comparison to most printers, thus it can keep a steady image compared to other perforations.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of black-and-white infrared art, landscape, and wedding photography is done using orange (15 or 21), red (23, 25, or 29) or visually opaque (72) filters over the lens {{to block the}} blue visible light from the exposure. The intent of filters in black-and-white infrared photography is to block blue wavelengths and allow infrared to pass through. Without filters, infrared <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> look much like conventional <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> because the blue sensitivity lowers the contrast and effectively counteracts the infrared look of the film. Some photographers use orange or red filters to allow slight amounts of blue wavelengths to reach the film, and thus lower the contrast. Very dark-red (29) filters block out almost all blue, and visually opaque (70, 89b, 87c, 72) filters block out all blue and also visible red wavelengths, resulting in a more pure-infrared photo with a more pronounced contrast.|$|R
