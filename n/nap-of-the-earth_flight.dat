50|$|Terrain-following radar (TFR) is an {{aerospace}} technology {{that allows a}} very-low-flying aircraft to automatically maintain a relatively constant altitude above ground level. It is sometimes referred-to as ground hugging or terrain hugging flight. The term <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> <b>flight</b> may also apply but is more commonly used in relation to low-flying military helicopters, which typically do not use terrain-following radar. The technology was originally developed by Ferranti for use with the TSR-2 aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The OH-58D (Bell Model 406) was {{the result}} of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). An {{upgraded}} transmission and engine gave the aircraft the power it needed for <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> <b>flight</b> profiles, and a four-bladed main rotor made it much quieter than the two-bladed OH-58C. The OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS) above the rotor system, and a mixed glass cockpit, with traditional instruments identified as [...] "standby" [...] for emergency use.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{computing}} {{technology of}} the time and the survey simulation nature of the game (covering multiple helicopters), Gunship 2000 {{was never going to be}} a totally realistic simulation. However, the cockpits were reasonable copies of the real helicopter cockpits, and certain features such as Mast Mounted Sights were present on the smaller scout helicopters. However, avionics and flight modelling was rather generic. Realistic tactics such as <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> <b>flight</b> and 'pop-up' attacks could be employed on account of the reasonably detailed terrain.|$|E

In particular, it considers a hierarchy of guidance components, including mission planning and obstacle avoidance. Based on this hierarchical breakdown, the functional requirements of obstacle-avoidance guidance are identified.

5000|$|The role of manned point defense designs was {{reassigned to}} {{unmanned}} interceptors—surface-to-air missiles (SAMs)—which first reached an adequate level in 1954-1957. SAM advancements ended {{the concept of}} massed high-altitude bomber operations, in favor of penetrators flying a combination of techniques colloquially known as [...] "flying below the radar". By flying terrain masking low-altitude <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> <b>flight</b> profiles the effective range, and therefore reaction time, of ground based radar was limited to at best the radar horizon. In the case of ground radar systems this can be countered by placing radar systems on mountain tops to extend the radar horizon, or through placing high performance radars in interceptors or in AWACs aircraft used to direct point defense interceptors.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{to investigate the}} impact of flying qualities on mission effectiveness is described. The objective {{of the study was}} to relate the effects of flying qualities, such as precision of flight path control and pilot workload, to the ability of a single Scout helicopter, or helicopter team, to accomplish a specified anti-armor mission successfully.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for passive ranging which is of special interest {{in areas such as}} covert <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> helicopter <b>flight</b> and spacecraft landing. This technique is based on the expansion experienced by the image-plane projection of an object as its distance from the sensor decreases. The motion and shape of a small window, assumed to fall inside the boundaries of some object, is approximated by an affine transformation. The parameters of the transformation matrix —expansion, rotation, and translation — are derived by initially comparing successive images, and progressively increasing the image time separation. This yields a more favorable geometry for triangulation (larger baseline) than is currently possible. Depth is directly derived from the expansion part of the transformation, and its accuracy is proportional to the baseline length. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} {{automated}} <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> (NOE) <b>flight</b> guidance is discussed by examining two current research efforts that approach {{the problem of}} performing obstacle avoidance along a pre-planned course from different perspectives. The first, a real-time guidance system developed by Systems Technology Inc., focuses {{on the issue of}} pilot acceptable maneuvers, under the assumption of an ideal, but nonrealizable, obstacle detection system. The second, a system created at NASA Ames, concentrates on the utilization of realistic on-board sensor data for obstacle detection and avoidance-maneuver decisions.

The pilots and navigators were asked to communicate normally during the planning and flight phases. During each flight the navigator's response time, accuracy, and subjective workload were assessed. Post-flight NASA-TLX workload ratings were collected. No main effect of map orientation (north-up vs. track-up) was found for errors or response times on any of the tasks evaluated.

The TF/TA ratio, control effort penalties and MPC prediction horizon are tuned for this application via simulation and eigenvalue analysis for stability and performance. Steps are taken to reduce complexity in the optimization problem including perturbational linearization in the prediction model generation and the use of control basis functions which are analyzed for their trade-off between approximation of the optimal cost/solution and reduction of the optimization complexity.

40|$|The recent {{interest}} {{in the use of}} machine vision for flight vehicle guidance is motivated by the need to automate the <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> <b>flight</b> regime of helicopters. Vision-based stereo ranging problem is cast as an optimal control problem in this paper. A quadratic performance index consisting of the integral of the error between observed image irradiances and those predicted by a Pade approximation of the correspondence hypothesis is then used to define an optimization problem.

40|$|Helicopter {{flight is}} among the most {{demanding}} of all human-machine integrations. The inherent manual control complexities of rotorcraft are made even more challenging by the small margin for error created in certain operations, such as <b>nap-of-the-Earth</b> (NOE) <b>flight,</b> by the proximity of the terrain. Accident data recount numerous examples of unintended conflict between helicopters and terrain and attest to the perceptual and control difficulties associated with low altitude flight tasks.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the technologies required for automating rotorcraft <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> <b>flight,</b> where {{the use of}} natural obstacles for masking from the enemy is intentional and the danger of undesirable obstacles such as enemy traps is real. Specifically, the automatic guidance structure is modeled by three decision-making levels: the far-field mission planning and the mid-field terrain-masking trajectory shaping are both driven by prestored terrain data, whereas the nearfield obstacle detection/avoidance is driven by real-time on-board sensor data. This paper summarizes the far-field and mid-field accomplishments, and reports {{on the status of}} the more-recent efforts in obstacle detection and avoidance development. Obstacle detection is based primarily on passive imaging sensors for the desirable properties of covertness and wide field of view, although active sensors are included in the structure to provide the much needed high resolution for thin-wire detection...|$|E

40|$|Multiloop pilot/vehicle {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} the problem of determining crossfeed techniques which may be employed by pilots in minimizing the effects of vehicle cross coupling. As used here, cross coupling refers to unwanted vehicle motion which occurs in one control axis or loop as the result of pilot control actuation in another control axis or loop. The minimization or elimination of such cross coupling can contribute significantly to the 'workload' associated with tasks like <b>nap-of-the-earth</b> helicopter <b>flight.</b> In contrast, situations arise in which pilot's may use vehicle cross coupling to improve performance by coordinating two control actuations in the control of a single response variable.
