25|$|The {{interactions}} of neurons {{in a small}} network can be often reduced to simple models such as the Ising model. The statistical mechanics of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically. There has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks</b> {{can be reduced to}} pairwise interactions. It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the downregulation of KCC2 observed following neuronal trauma, and the consequent depolarizing shift of GABAA-mediated synapses, may be an aspect of neuronal de-differentiation. De-differentiation of damaged portions {{of the nervous system}} would allow for <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks</b> to return to higher levels of plasticity in order to rewire of surviving neurons to compensate for damage in the network. In addition, reduced glutamatergic transmission upon KCC2 downregulation may serve as a homeostatic process to compensate for the reduced GABA transmission due to altered chloride extrusion.|$|E

25|$|Scalp EEG {{activity}} shows oscillations at {{a variety}} of frequencies. Several of these oscillations have characteristic frequency ranges, spatial distributions and are associated with different states of brain functioning (e.g., waking and the various sleep stages). These oscillations represent synchronized activity over a network of neurons. The <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks</b> underlying some of these oscillations are understood (e.g., the thalamocortical resonance underlying sleep spindles), while many others are not (e.g., the system that generates the posterior basic rhythm). Research that measures both EEG and neuron spiking finds {{the relationship between the two}} is complex, with a combination of EEG power in the gamma band and phase in the delta band relating most strongly to neuron spike activity.|$|E

50|$|The {{concepts}} underlying {{this theory}} {{derive from the}} physicists, Hiroomi Umezawa and Herbert Fröhlich in the 1960s. More recently, their ideas have been elaborated by Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue. Water comprises 70% of the brain, and quantum brain dynamics (QBD) proposes that the electric dipoles of the water molecules constitute a quantum field, {{referred to as the}} cortical field, with corticons as the quanta of the field. This cortical field is postulated to interact with quantum coherent waves generated by the biomolecules in neurons, which are suggested to propagate along the <b>neuronal</b> <b>network.</b> The idea of quantum coherent waves in the <b>neuronal</b> <b>network</b> derives from Frohlich. He viewed these waves as a means by which order could be maintained in living systems, and argued that the <b>neuronal</b> <b>network</b> could support long-range correlation of dipoles. This theory suggests that the cortical field not only interacts with the <b>neuronal</b> <b>network,</b> but also to a good extent controls it.|$|R
2500|$|By {{identifying}} these correlations and {{the individual}} neurons that contribute to predictable EEG oscillations, scientists can determine which cortical domains are processing in parallel and which <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks</b> are intertwined. [...] In many cases, metastability describes instances in which distal {{parts of the brain}} interact with each other to respond to environmental stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Noise at the 1/f regime can {{be found}} in many {{biological}} systems – for instance, in the output of a heartbeat in an ECG waveform—but serves a unique purpose for phase synchrony in <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks.</b> [...] At the 1/f regime, the brain is in the critical state necessary for a conscious response to weak or chaotic environmental signals because it can shift the random signals into identifiable and predictable oscillatory waveforms. [...] While often transient, these waveforms exist in a stable form long enough to contribute to what {{can be thought of as}} conscious response to environmental stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{theory of}} {{metastability}} involves a so-called dynamic core, {{which is a}} term to loosely describe the thalamocortical region {{believed to be the}} integration center of consciousness. The dynamic core hypothesis (DCH) reflects the use and disuse of interconnected <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks</b> during stimulation of this region. [...] A computer model of 65,000 spiking neurons shows that neuronal groups existing in the cortex and thalamus interact in the form of synchronous oscillation. [...] The interaction between distinct neuronal groups forms the dynamic core and may help explain the nature of conscious experience. A critical feature of the DCH is that instead of thinking binarily about transitions between neural integration and non-integration (i.e., that the two are either one or the other with no in-between), the metastable nature of the dynamic core can allow for a continuum of integration.|$|E

2500|$|Biology is {{concerned}} with molecular data (from genes to cell specific expression); medicine and anatomy with the structure of synapses and systems level anatomy; engineering – electrophysiology (from single channels to scalp surface EEG), brain imaging; computer science – databases, software tools, mathematical sciences – models, chemistry – neurotransmitters, etc. [...] Neuroscience uses all aforementioned experimental and theoretical studies {{to learn about the}} brain through its various levels. Medical and biological specialists help to identify the unique cell types, and their elements and anatomical connections. Functions of complex organic molecules and structures, including a myriad of biochemical, molecular, and genetic mechanisms which regulate and control brain function, are determined by specialists in chemistry and cell biology. Brain imaging determines structural and functional information during mental and behavioral activity.

2500|$|... "It is {{difficult}} to believe that until approximately year 1900 it was not known that neurons are the basic units of the brain (Santiago Ramón y Cajal). Equally surprising {{is the fact that the}} concept of chemical transmission in the brain was not known until around 1930 (Henry Hallett Dale) and (Otto Loewi). We began to understand the basic electrical phenomenon that neurons use in order to communicate among themselves, the action potential, in the 1950s (Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley and John Eccles). It was in the 1960s that we became aware of how basic <b>neuronal</b> <b>networks</b> code stimuli and thus basic concepts are possible (David H. Hubel, and Torsten Wiesel). The molecular revolution swept across US universities in the 1980s. It was in the 1990s that molecular mechanisms of behavioral phenomena became widely known (Eric Richard Kandel)." [...] A microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily of axons, along with different membranes that wrap around them and segregate them into fascicles. The neurons that give rise to nerves do not lie entirely within the nerves themselves—their cell bodies reside within the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral ganglia.|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} clock regulates daily and seasonal rhythms in mammals. This clock {{is located in}} the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which are two small nuclei each consisting of 10, 000 neurons. The neurons of the SCN endogenously generate a rhythm of approximately 24 hours. Under the influence of the light-dark cycle, the SCN produce a coordinated output that is subjected to daily environmental changes. The adaptation to the light-dark cycle is a property of the <b>neuronal</b> <b>network</b> of the SCN. This <b>neuronal</b> <b>network</b> also explains the adjustment to long summer days and short winter days, and to shifts in the light-dark cycle caused by transatlantic flights or shift work.
