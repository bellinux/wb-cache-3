40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} microelectrodes with integrated three-dimensional electrode structures. The integration of three-dimensional structures aims at an improvement of the electrode/tissue interface. Due {{to the increase in}} surface area the electrode impedance is reduced, while the density of microelectrodes per area remains the same as with flat electrodes. Two different types of electrodes have been developed: Flexible, implantable microelectrodes with pyramidal, protruding structures and tip-shaped electrode arrays on glass substrates. The protrusion heights of the electrode sites can easily be adjusted depending on the actual application. For the flexible structures we used a polyimide-based process to fabricate microelectrodes with sharp or flat pyramidal tips and with electrode arrangements on front and backside of the devices. The tip-shaped electrode arrays were fabricated from a glass substrate by isotropic wet chemical etching and subsequent metallization and passivation. Data from impedance measurements and acute brain slice recordings indicate a considerable improvement regarding electrode impedance and <b>obtainable</b> <b>signal</b> strength...|$|R

It is designed so that it can be used as a free piston tunnel, shock tube and shock tunnel. The maximum mach <b>number</b> <b>obtainable</b> depends on the type of the driver and driven gases. It is shown that a mach number of 4 can be achieved if CO 2 is used as the driven gas and Helium is used as the driver gas with diaphragm pressure ratio of 74. 76. Experimental measurements were performed with the facility working as shock tube. The barrel temperature was measured using in-house developed fast response surface junction E-type thermocouple while the pressure was measured using fast response quartz pressure transducer. The pressure and temperature results clearly show the formation of shock wave and its reflection causing the pressure and temperature to increase rapidly...|$|R

Clinical Studies E-cigarettes have not been approved by the FDA as aids in smok-ing cessation.

Recent studies, however, suggest that the number of voice calls that can be supported in the widely deployed IEEE 802. 11 WLAN is limited. In this paper, we utilize a so-called transmission opportunity (TXOP) parameter of a medium access control (MAC) protocol as a simple solution to improve the VoIP capacity. We provide a detailed analytical model to show that the capacity can significantly be improved and discuss the implications of the TXOP parameter in terms of the maximum number of calls the IEEE 802. 11 network can support.
