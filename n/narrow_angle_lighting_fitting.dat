These were compared to calculated theoretical scattering values as derived from the theory of Mie (1908). Through measurements with different particle concentrations at angles between 0. 2 ° and 0. 7 ° the effect of the unscattered main beam light was removed. Results agreed well with Mie theory for these angle...|$|R
40|$|We {{design and}} {{implement}} a system for short and medium range directional two-way wireless communication. The system uses infrared radiation to transmit and receive voice data digitally. We utilize <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> infrared <b>light</b> emitting diodes for transmission, directed across a reasonable angular range that allows the system to transmit across a narrow beam to the receiver, avoiding the dangers of detection, jamming, and eavesdropping that traditional omnidirectional radio transmission entails. On the receiving end, a wide-angle detector is used. The system is integrated inconspicuously into a military vest, allowing the wearer to communicate while on the field. In the working version of this system we use traditional semiconductor photodetectors and receivers. We also investigate the properties of optoelectronic fibers, novel semiconductor devices that can act as line detectors of light. We characterize these fibers, and analyze their potential for use as photodetecting devices in this system. by Agustya R. Mehta. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The whole process from customer requirements to f nal functional product is shown on two examples - a lens for street light and a lens for spot <b>light</b> with <b>narrow</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>angle.</b> After discussing customer requirements, optical design is made. Thanks to various commercial softwares with optimization, manufacturer of the lens can {{work as well as}} a designer which enables simplif cation and acceleration of lens manufacturing, since limitations of the manufacturing process are considered during creation of the design. When the prototype is made, its functionality needs to be evaluated. This work shows measurement of light distribution for street light lens in a dark room using goniometer and measurement of light intensity for spot lens f xed on an optical bench. These measurements can reveal the root cause in case of lens malfunction, which enables to optimize manufacturing process or modify lens design accordingly.

40|$|The goal of imaging planets {{around the}} nearby stars has {{important}} scientific significance but requires {{the use of}} advanced methods of controlling diffracted and scattered light. Over the last three years we have undertaken a study of coronagraphic methods of controlling diffracted light and of figuring hyper-contrast optics. Progress in these two general areas have led to a proposed space-based, 1. 9 meter diameter coronagraphic telescope designed specifically for very high performance in the imaging of faint objects near bright sources. This instrument, called the Circumstellar Imaging Telescope (CIT), relies on a new high efficiency coronagraph design and the careful control of scattered light by extremely smooth optics. The high efficiency coronagraph uses focal plane apodization in order to concentrate diffracted light more efficiently in the pupil. This allows convenient removal of the diffracted light by masking off parts of the telescope pupil while not sacrificing the center of the field. Reductions of diffracted light by factors exceeding 1000 are not only possible but are required in order to detect extra-solar planets. Laboratory experiments with this new design have confirmed the theoretical diffraction reductions to the limits of the optics used (factors of about 300). The extremely high efficiency of this coronagraph puts strong constraints on the <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> scattered <b>light</b> due to figure errors in the telescope mirror. Since planets orbiting nearby stars are expected at angular distances of about 1 arcsecond, it is in this small angular range in which scattering must be controlled. The figure errors responsible for scattering in this range come from mid-spatial frequencies corresponding to correlation lengths of about 10 cm on the primary mirror. A primary mirror about 15 times smoother than the Hubble Space Telescope mirror is required for the CIT. Laboratory experiments indicate that small test mirrors can be fabricated with existing technology which come within a factor of two of this requirement...|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} the mechanical effects of pilocarpine on the trabecular-iris angle opening in eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles,</b> compared with {{its effects on}} healthy control subjects with wide <b>angles.</b>  METHODS—A <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> was defined as 25 ° or less of trabecular-iris angle on ultrasound biomicroscopic examination. The change in anterior chamber depth (ACD), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle opening distance (AOD, distance between trabecular meshwork and iris) measured at 250  µm and 500  µm from the scleral spur (AOD 250 and AOD 500), and iris thickness was determined in 30  eyes of 30  patients (13  men and 17  women, between 63  and 82  years (mean 70. 4  years)) with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> and in 30  sex and age matched control subjects with wide angles before and 1  hour after the instillation of 2 % pilocarpine hydrochloride by ultrasound biomicroscopy.  RESULTS—In all eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles,</b> pilocarpine increased the TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; these changes increased significantly and linearly as the corresponding pretreatment values decreased (r =  0. 807, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 787, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 852, p =  0. 0001). Of 30  eyes with wide angles, 23  eyes whose ACD was 2670  µm and more showed {{a decrease in the}} TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; the changes in TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500 also significantly correlated with the corresponding pretreatment values (r =  0. 913, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 882, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 895, p =  0. 0001). Pilocarpine induced a smaller decrease in ACD in eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> than in those with wide angles (p =  0. 0001). There was a linear correlation between the increase in ACD change and the decrease in pretreatment ACD in eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> and those with wide angles (r =  0. 781, p =  0. 0003; r =  0. 798, p =  0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The finding that pilocarpine increases angular width in patients with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> indicates that this agent is useful for treating patients with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> and angle closure glaucoma. The prediction of the pilocarpine induced change in the angle may assist ophthalmologists in treating such patients. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} biometrically {{the differences}} between plateau iris configuration (PIC) eyes and primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes. METHODS: A comparative study involving a case series with 20 eyes of 11 plateau iris configuration patients and 45 eyes of 27 primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes patients was done. The following measurements were taken: corneal curvature, central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness (LT), axial length (AL), lens thickness and axial length ratio, lens position (LP) and relative lens position (RLP). RESULTS: The plateau iris configuration eyes presented a higher corneal cuvature value than primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes eyes but not with clinical and statistical difference (P= 0. 090). The plateau iris configuration eyes demonstrated a higher central corneal thickness, with statistical significance, when compared to primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes (P= 0. 010). Statistical significant difference between plateau iris configuration and primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes was found in axial length (21. 69 ± 0. 98 vs. 22. 42 ± 0. 89; P= 0. 003). No {{significant difference was found}} when anterior chamber depth (2. 62 ± 0. 23 vs. 2. 71 ± 0. 31; P= 0. 078), LT (4. 67 ± 0. 36 vs. 4. 69 ± 0. 45; P= 0. 975), LT/AL (2. 16 ± 0. 17 vs. 2. 10 ± 0. 21; P= 0. 569), LP (4. 95 ± 0. 25 vs. 5. 06 ± 0. 34; P= 0. 164) and RLP (0. 23 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 22 ± 0. 14; P= 0. 348) were evaluated. CONCLUSION: The eyes with plateau iris configuration presented statistical significantly shorter axial length and higher central corneal thickness than primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes...|$|R
