50|$|A {{scrap metal}} {{shredder}} {{is often used}} to recycle items containing a variety of other materials in combination with steel. Examples are automobiles and white goods such as refrigerators, stoves, clothes washers etc. These items are labor intensive to manually sort things like plastic, copper, aluminum and brass. By shredding into relatively small pieces, the steel can easily be separated out magnetically. The <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>waste</b> stream requires other techniques to sort.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince the {{beginning}} of the industrial age, the impact of human activity on the environment is becoming increasingly important in terms of environmental pollution. The town of Annaba is considered the industrial capital of the extreme north-eastern Algeria. The study area because of a particularly polluting industry, sees its environment deteriorate. Indeed, the study on the impact of ferrous and <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>waste</b> in the area of Meboudja showed high pollution especially in Meboudja river and surface slick. A sampling campaign was carried out in the study area (2012) and include eight wells located throughout the study area. The analyzes focused on the physical elements (temperature, pH, conductivity and oxygen) as well as the following heavy metals: Iron, Copper, Lead, Chromium and Nickel. The existence of relatively high concentrations of these metals indicates an origin of the pollution appears to be industrial...|$|E

In the same period, Hong Kong's exports to South Africa included watches and clocks, textile yarn, fabrics, electronic parts and accessories, telecommunications equipment and polymers of styrene.|$|R
50|$|An {{eddy current}} {{separator}} uses a powerful magnetic field to separate <b>non-ferrous</b> metals from <b>waste</b> after all ferrous metals {{have been removed}} previously by some arrangement of magnets. The device makes use of eddy currents to effect the separation. Eddy current separators are not designed to sort ferrous metals which become hot inside the eddy current field. This can lead to damage of the eddy current separator unit belt.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThermal {{treatments}} of five {{different types of}} <b>non-ferrous</b> metallurgical <b>wastes,</b> under a controlled atmosphere, were carried out at temperatures lower than 800 degrees C for the separation of their toxic compounds and the concentration of valuable metals in the treatments residues. The best results were obtained by the treatments in air or hydrogen, or both successively. Simple treatments, using air or hydrogen, of three samples allowed the elimination of more than 95 % of their toxic elements and almost doubled their valuable metals concentration. For {{the rest of the}} samples, a combined treatment was necessary for their efficient decontamination. In this case, the valuable metals content in the treatment's residue was increased to a reasonable value. Most of the solids issuing from these treatments can be recycled in current non-ferrous metallurgical processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} new hyperspectral imaging {{modalities}} {{made possible the}} implementation of flexible machine vision systems that can be designed to solve a variety of industrial tasks such as automatic material sorting. However the design of robust machine vision systems {{is far from a}} trivial task as several issues including mechanical design, development of an appropriate illumination set-up, optimal interfacing between the sensing and optical equipment with the computer vision component have to be properly addressed in order to accommodate all challenges that are encountered in a typical industrial environment. In this paper we present a novel methodology to automate the recycling process of <b>non-ferrous</b> metal <b>Waste</b> from Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) where a particular emphasis is placed on the design choices that were made {{in the development of the}} proposed waste sorting system. The developed machine vision system has been subjected to a thorough robustness evaluation and the reported experimental results indicate that the proposed solution can be used to replace the manual procedure that is currently used in WEEE recycling plants. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recovery of fine <b>non-ferrous</b> metals from <b>waste</b> streams is a {{notoriously}} difficult problem in eddy current separation technology. Existing processes either {{have a low}} capacity or an incomplete recovery for particle sizes below 5 mm. In a new process, the particles are fed slightly wet to make them stick {{to the surface of}} the conveyor belt. The action of the magnet rotor makes the non-ferrous particles tumble, so that they break loose from the belt and end up in front of the rotor. The new process combines a relatively high capacity with an almost complete recovery, even for heavy and poorly conducting non-ferrous metals. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|As from 1 January 2007 the European Directives are {{transposed}} {{into the}} national legislation and the European Regulations are truthfully applicable. In the VAT field, the European Directives, {{as well as the}} Jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice were transposed into the Fiscal Code, Title VI. Since the accession date, the legislation in the VAT field is repealed and replaced with the legislation harmonized with the Community acquis. The elimination of customs barriers between the 27 Member States of the European Union brings news as concerns the application of the "reverse charge" procedure that is applied in Romania as from the year 2005 for residue transactions and transactions with ferrous and <b>non-ferrous</b> metal <b>waste,</b> with grounds or buildings or building parts or living animals among VAT payers. Thus, starting with 1 January 2007, the reverse charge is binding and applicable to all intra-Community acquisitions. At the same time the reverse charge was also applied for imports until 15 April 2007. In this paper I shall present aspects concerning the history of reverse charge in our country, accounting of operations and advantages and disadvantages of application of this procedure in the context of accession to the European Union. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of Jacobs Engineering Group’s waste audit study of the thermal metal working industry, The goal {{of this study was to}} identify waste reduction techniques available to the industry. The report focuses on source reduction, recycling, and treatment methods for j businesses performing thermal metal working with specific focus on casting and heat treating. The processes examined include melting, mold and core making, shakeout, Land case hardening by means of thermal and/or chemical methods. Support operations which may be found at thermal metal working businesses, but have been explored in previous studies, include machining operations, metal parts cleaning and stripping, metal surface treatment and plating, and paint application. Three thermal metal working plants were surveyed as part of the project: a ferrous metal foundry, a heat treating plant and a <b>non-ferrous</b> foundry. <b>Waste</b> reduction and treatment techniques were identified and analyzed based on the information collected during these surveys, as well as from detailed literature review and discussions with industry representatives, The results include a waste reduction assessment format for generators to perform their own waste reduction opportunities assessments. Source reduction techniques, recycling and resource recovery techniques appear to offer high promise of minimizing waste generation. A waste reduction index was developed for use by foundries to measure waste reduction effectiveness. The index compensates for variation in production activity. Examples are developed here for brass foundry sand waste, iron foundry sand waste, and iron foundry baghouse waste. i ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. would like to acknowledge the efforts of Mr. Benjami...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{applying}} copper manufacturing waste locating in the Chelyabinsk {{region as a}} component of mixed is considered in this article. Application of mixed binder with superplasticizers, based on esters with carboxyl groups, have not sufficiently been studied by the present time due to the diversity of species and complexity of the chemical structure. This trend is current for today’s science because of the growing rates and scales of building production, in particular, of concrete works. Copper slag dumps located in the Ural Federal district haven’t been widely used in building production or in other industrial production by the present time. Efficient utilization of copper production waste materials will help to solve ecological problems in many regions of Russia. Structure formation period of cement stone based on mixed binder made of Portland cement and granulated cooper slag with application of superplasticizer is studied in the article. The authors present a thermal variation diagram of mortar based on mixed binder made of Portland cement and granulated cooper slag in the process of 21 hours of hardening under normal conditions and the results of ultrasound investigation of concrete structure formation period during 5 hours of hardening. The strength development process diagram of mortar based on mixed binder made of Portland cement and granulated cooper slag for 28 days of hardening under normal conditions and the research results of the compressive strength of concrete samples are shown in this article. The obtained characteristics don’t confirm the prospects of applying joint grinding for mortar with the observed kind of <b>non-ferrous</b> metallurgy <b>waste.</b> Also, the obtained results allow us to make a conclusion about little advantages of using this method of binder production. Copper slag can be more effectively used {{as a component of}} complex organic and mineral admixture for building production with different purposes and fields of application...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} solid waste {{management}} in cities of most developing countries is fast assuming the scale of a major social and environmental challenge. In Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, the combined influence of poverty, population growth and rapid urbanization has tended to worsen the situation. The gravity of this problem is perhaps best reflected {{in the level of}} attention given to it in the United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration. Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) outlined in the declaration have waste or resource efficiency implications. In response to the waste challenge many developed countries have embarked upon ambitious environmental reforms, recording remarkable advances in best practises and sustainable management of their Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). However, many developing countries such as Nigeria have fared less well in this regard as a result of several barriers militating against sustainable management of MSW. The principal aim of this research is therefore to carry out a critical analysis of the various barriers as well as success factors that affect the sustainable management of MSW using Abuja, Nigeria, as a case study. The study adopts a largely quantitative methodological approach, employing waste composition analysis of samples from the case study area, questionnaire survey and focus group interviews of stakeholders in MSW management as key methods for generation of data. Results from analysis of data, using the Statistical Programme for the Social Sciences (SPSS), indicate that between 65 - 70 % of MSW samples from Abuja is biodegradable, mostly comprising of high wet weight and high moisture content kitchen wastes. On the other hand between 11 %- 30 % of MSW samples from the City comprises mostly of non-degradable but recyclable materials such as glass, metals and cans, <b>non-ferrous</b> metals and <b>waste</b> electrical and electronic equipment. The implication of the high levels of moisture content in the biodegradable components is that samples are not suitable for incineration but are ideal for composting and other mechanical and biological management options. Data analysis also reveals that the main barriers to sustainable MSW management in the City include low public awareness/education on MSW management, obsolete and insufficient equipment and funding limitations. On the other hand, the most important success factor affecting sustainable MSW management in Abuja was found to be the bourgeoning City population which has a huge potential for uptake of recycled products. In summary, this research concludes that the factors affecting MSW management in Abuja are typical of many tropical urban environments. Fundamental shifts in current practises towards waste prevention; driven by a structured public education programme in MSW management is recommended, so as to bring about a more sustainable management regime. As a result of resource and time limitations, {{it was not possible to}} complete several potential lines of investigation related to this study. To fully understand the character of the Abuja waste stream however, further chemical characterization including proximate and ultimate analysis is required. Future research in this genre must endeavour to collect data from a larger sample to increase the precision of the analysis and to enable firmer conclusions to be drawn.
