40|$|With this diploma work we {{wished to}} find out whether the educator's style of {{direction}} really influences the entire responsiveness of children at their motion activities. We concentrated on the educator’s behavior and observed how this influences individual components of a child's personality. We captured the motion, the intellectual, the emotional and the social component of a child's personality. For the purposes of this research we constructed two rating scales assessing the response of children and adapting our <b>way</b> <b>of</b> direction. Together we performed six motion hours: three based on the positive and three based on the <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> direction. These hours were carried out by using the motion area methods appropriate for the children in the pre-school period. We carried out two hours using the method of a polygon, two hours using the method of stations and two hours using the method of a game. The sample research was carried out with 14 children who attended the kindergarten of Kokrica. During these six motion hours where half of them were performed with a positive and half with a <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the educator's direction we have established that the educators with their behavior affect all areas of a child's personality, namely intellectual, emotional, social and motion components. With the research we have acknowledged that the style of direction has a significant influence on all components of the child's development and we have highlighted the importance of the role that the adults have in the integrated development of a child. ...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the wide}} varying forms of reparenting, each {{therapist}} may adopt different methods when treating clients. However, the mechanism that underlie the theory of reparenting is generally agreed upon. Typically, reparenting starts with the regression of the client to the child ego state. The therapist accomplishes this by partaking in child-rearing acts such as bottle feeding, lap pillows, and other techniques. These actions will also gain the client’s trust in the therapist as his or her new parent. Once the ideal level of closeness is achieved, the therapist can finally proceed to providing the messages that reform the client’s <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking by lecturing, entering discussions, {{or other forms of}} communication appropriate in a parent-child relationship.|$|R
40|$|My paper, “Us and Them – an {{analysis}} of the creation of “the Other” in The Reluctant Fundamentalist and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas”, aims to examine Mohsin Hamid´s and John Boyne´s novels from the years 2007 and 2008. The paper tries to answer the following questions: How is “the Other”and“Us and Them”created in the novels? And: What consequences does the thinking in terms of “the Other”and“Us and Them”lead to in the novels? The examination is done through the method of close reading and by applying the theory of Orientalism and Edward W. Said’s analysis of the theory to the reading. It is, I believe, of utmost importance for teachers to create unity among their pupils, and peaceful and democratic classrooms where co-work is promoted. This is especially important in multi-cultural classrooms where different ethnicities, cultures, religions, nationalities, and so on, are present and represented. Unity, peace, democracy, and co-work prevent <b>negative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking in terms of “the Other”or/and“Us and Them”among pupils, and they are also terms that the curriculum refer to. Literature can be a tool and a method to do this by, used properly. This is why I, a becoming teacher, have decided to close examine two novels that many Swedish schools have in class settings and find out whether they are creating unity, peace, and democracy between people or if they on the contrary are creating disruption between people and maybe support <b>negative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> thinking in terms of “the Other”and“Us and Them”. The examination of the novels revealed that they both do create “the Other”and“Us and Them ”and that it leads to negative consequences in the novels. But this only makes the novels perfect material for teaching, if, the teacher offering this material to pupils does not just expect pupils to read the novels, but helps them reflect upon them and problematize the themes, the events, and the characters in them...|$|R

This waiting list controlled study set out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a 6 -week intervention for carers of people with first-episode psychosis. Participants and Methods: Carers were randomised into experimental or waiting list categories. Study 1 compared various outcome measures in the 2 categories. Study 2 evaluated the treatment effects. Results: After the intervention, carers showed increased knowledge about psychosis and a reduction in <b>negative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> coping. The improvement in knowledge was maintained at 6 -month follow-up, and trends towards improved caregiving burden and coping were also evident. Conclusions: A brief intervention programme can be effective in improving important variables such as knowledge, coping, and caregiving burden.

40|$|Background: The causal beliefs which {{adults have}} {{regarding}} their mental health difficulties {{have been linked}} to help-seeking behaviour, treatment preferences and the outcome of therapy; yet the topic remains a relatively unexplored one in the adolescent literature. Aims: This exploratory study aims to explore the causal beliefs regarding depression among a sample of clinically referred adolescents. Design: 77 adolescents, aged between 11 and 17, all diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule, {{at the beginning of their}} participation in a randomised controlled trial. Data were analysed qualitatively using Framework Analysis. Findings: The study identified three themes related to causal beliefs: 1) Bewilderment about why they were depressed; 2) Depression as a result of rejection, victimisation and stress; and 3) Something inside is to blame. Conclusion: Although some adolescents struggled to identify the causes of their depression, many identified stressful life experiences as the cause of their current depression. They also tended to emphasise their own <b>negative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> interpreting those events, and some believed that their depression was caused by something inside them. Adolescents’ causal beliefs are likely to have implications for the way they seek help and engage in treatment, making it important to understand how adolescents understand their difficulties...|$|R

Para ello se ha analizado la representación de mujeres no autóctonas en la publicidad gráfica. A medida que ciertos Derechos Humanos se fueron consolidando (años 70) otras etnias diversas a la blanca fueron ganando respecto a su representación, pero esta mejora parece estancada desde entonces. En otros aspectos tampoco se han logrado resultados especialmente positivos, prueba de ello es la creciente tendencia a representar a la mujer como objeto sexual (independientemente de su etnia).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to observe the causal {{mechanism}} between meritocratic recruitment and level of corruption. Previous cross country analyses showed positive results, however what is lacking in academic literature is micro-analyses that would capture the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> causal mechanism which will be an added value to the academic literature. The current research does not aim to build the hypothesis but rather complements the research on meritocracy by looking at a single case study, taking Tajikistan, a country in Central Asia. The paper identifies and analyses relative difference in implementation of the public administration reform and perception of sample agencies, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance pertaining to meritocracy and corruption. The empirical analysis is based on twenty one interviews with persons responsible for reform making and reform implementation. To validate the answers a group of independent observers is included. The findings of the empirical analysis show that meritocratic recruitment does not have an effect on the level of corruption at its earliest endorsement in a transit country such as Tajikistan. It is formally endorsed within the new public administration system, but instead a majority of civil servants are hired and promoted on the basis of patronage and all types of contacts...|$|R
