5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, <b>New</b> York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the <b>New</b> York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from <b>New</b> York City to Fredonia. The <b>new</b> telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the <b>New</b> York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this <b>new</b> technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the <b>new</b> modern system was set up. For the ten years of the <b>new</b> railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This <b>new</b> system would relieve this issue.|$|E
