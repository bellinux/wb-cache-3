5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's <b>news</b> <b>editor,</b> is that no one can know who fired the shots.|$|E

5|$|The {{paper was}} {{launched}} {{with an initial}} print-run of 60,000, and was edited by a skeleton staff during the trial run, with plans to employ more journalists if it became a permanent publication. Initial contributors included Sunday Herald journalists Jamie Maxwell and Peter Geoghegan, as well as freelance reporter Sarah Cooper. During the initial week of publication, Walker spoke of his belief that The National would continue beyond the trial period, but said the decision was {{in the hands of}} its publishers. Following healthy sales in the first few days, Newsquest executives decided on 27 November to continue printing the newspaper, and to allocate it additional resources.

5|$|On 13 September 1964, Epstein {{approached}} Harry {{to create}} a national music paper, so Harry coined the name Music Echo, and gradually merged Mersey Beat into it. Epstein had promised Harry full editorial control, but then hired a female press officer in London to write a fashion column and a D.J. to write a gossip column, without informing Harry of his intentions, leaving Harry with no other option but to resign. The paper subsequently ran into financial problems, and Epstein had to merge it with another paper, becoming the Disc & Music Echo. When Harry and his wife moved to London in 1966, he was already contributing a column for the magazine Weekend and also for the teen magazines Marilyn and Valentine. He then became the feature writer, <b>news</b> <b>editor</b> and columnist for Record Mirror (using various pseudonyms such as 'Brenda Tarry' and 'David Berglas'), and wrote features for Music Now (under the name of Nick Blaine) for Record Retailer.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the months}} and years that followed, {{commentators}} questioned the accuracy of France2's report. The Israel Defense Forces accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted. French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift his hand from his face; they acknowledged that he had died, but said the footage alone did not show it. France2's <b>news</b> <b>editor</b> said in 2005 {{that no one could}} be sure who fired the shots. Other commentators, particularly Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, went further, alleging that the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined €7,000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris. In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty's view. Jamal al-Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called for an independent international investigation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This article {{explores the}} views of journalists and <b>news</b> <b>editors</b> on {{children}} in Albania, {{through a series of}} interviews with noted media professionals. This study finds that stories about children are not considered as newsworthy and children are mostly seen as unreliable stand-alone sources by journalists and <b>news</b> <b>editors.</b> As a mechanism to mitigate the risks of being refused by their editors, journalists increase the newsworthiness of children-focused news items by directing the story towards adults (mostly politicians) and by quoting them. Considering children’s perspectives in news coverage is essential, as it contributes to a social order that acknowledges children’s agency...|$|R

40|$|This study explores {{relationships}} between public relations practitioners {{in sport and}} sport <b>news</b> <b>editors.</b> As a viable communications method used by both public relations practitioners and sport <b>news</b> <b>editors,</b> the press release was examined using the communication theory of coorientation. The study used individual press release elements as coorientational objects. Seventy-five public relations practitioners, in this case Sports Information Directors at NCAA Division I institutions, and forty-four sports <b>news</b> <b>editors</b> who cover college athletics participated in an email survey. Research questions were tested on the {{relationships between}} agreement and accuracy as it pertained to the various press release elements proposed. Findings indicated that while some press release elements are in fact agreed upon, the two professional groups take an 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 agree to disagree 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 approach regarding other press release elements. Accuracy of the perceptions {{of each of the}} professional groups was quite low likely due to negative preconceived notions regarding the other. In short, both professional groups have inaccurate views of the others estimates of what are needed elements of a successful press release. Practical applications as well as suggestions for future study are discussed...|$|R

The editors work in print, online, broadcast and television and all of them employ journalism graduates. The aim was to assess whether the five university based journalism programs in Perth provide graduates with the skillset prospective employers were seeking. Editors are uniquely placed as they employ journalism graduates as interns, or as full time employees when they complete their studies, and they know which attributes and skills will help journalism graduates to succeed. The editors, for the most part, agreed that there was a key role for universities in Perth to provide both an educational background and skills based training for people contemplating a career in journalism and early career journalists. There was, however, some disagreement as to what the ideal university based journalism program should consist of...|$|R
