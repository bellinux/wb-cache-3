5|$|An {{expansion}} pack, The Deeper Dungeons, {{was released}} on 30 November 1997. It features fifteen <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> each for single player and multiplayer, and an improved artificial intelligence for the enemies. The Avatar also reappears in the final level. A Direct3D version, which brought improved graphics and 3D acceleration support, and a level editor were released for the game. These add-ons, along with the Deeper Dungeons and a Dungeon Keeper-based desktop theme, were bundled with the game, re-released as Dungeon Keeper Gold Edition on 31 December 1998. Dungeon Keeper received a fan-made mod, called KeeperFX. This mod increases compatibility with later versions of Windows, fixes bugs, and adds features such as TCP/IP multiplayer support. A sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2 was released in 1999, and the series was rebooted by Mythic Entertainment {{with the release of}} a remake (also titled Dungeon Keeper) for iOS and Android on 30 January 2014.|$|E
5|$|Like {{in other}} {{games in the}} series, Sonic {{collects}} rings scattered throughout levels; contact with certain obstacles and enemies scatters them away, and Sonic dies if he touches an enemy without any rings. Unlike previous titles, Secret Rings does not feature a life counter or game over screen, but instead Sonic reappears at the last visited checkpoint after dying, although the player will have to restart a mission if they fail a specified objective. The game contains 100 missions (including boss battles) {{over the course of}} eight levels. New missions, cutscenes, and sometimes <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> are unlocked by completing missions. Successful missions earn Sonic experience points, which advance him levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{releasing}} unauthorised performances {{had been established}} before the 20th century, but reached <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> of popularity with Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder, a compilation of studio outtakes and demos released in 1969 using low-priority pressing plants. The following year, the Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, an audience recording of a late 1969 show, received a positive review in Rolling Stone. Subsequent bootlegs became more sophisticated in packaging, particularly the Trademark of Quality label with William Stout's cover artwork. Compact disc bootlegs {{first appeared in the}} 1980s, and internet distribution became increasingly popular in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The game {{retained}} the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced <b>new</b> <b>levels,</b> settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed {{at the lack of}} new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but lower scores than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} released with four maps, although later updates have introduced five <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> and eight community produced maps supported by Valve. The game's levels are based after real {{battles in the}} Allied campaigns in Italy, Sicily and France, such as the Falaise pocket or the beach landings of Operation Shingle at Anzio, as well as fictional battles. Combat can take place in several environments, such as city streets, buildings and sewers. Each online game can sustain a maximum of 32 players.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} is to fly through the Rætikon environment to find its titular secrets, namely by collecting relics to power an ancient device. The environment is split into themed levels such as swamp, lagoon, mountaintops, and forests. Glowing shards are dispersed throughout each level, which can be collected and redeemed at an altar within each themed level for a glowing relic. These relics can be returned to where the player started the game to power a mysterious, ancient device. The player-character carries the relics past aggressive enemies and treacherous environment, and completes puzzles of reconstructing animal statues from its pieces to access <b>new</b> <b>levels.</b> Each level features different animals and contain environmental objects that player can interact with.|$|E
5|$|The show's 2000 and 2004 {{election}} coverage, {{combined with}} a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and The Daily Show to <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> of popularity and critical respect. Since Stewart became host, the show has won 23 Primetime Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards, and its ratings steadily increased. In 2003, the show was averaging nearly a million viewers, an increase of nearly threefold since the show's inception as Comedy Central became available in more households. By September 2008, the show averaged nearly two million viewers per night. Senator Barack Obama's interview on October 29, 2008, pulled in 3.6million viewers.|$|E
5|$|TowerFall was Thorson's first {{commercial}} game. It followed from a June 2012 game jam single-player prototype. Thorson tested {{the game on}} his indie developer colleagues with whom he lived, and developed its capacity as a party game. Its mechanics were inspired by games of Thorson's youth, such as Bushido Blade and GoldenEye 007, and influenced by demo feedback at the Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament. TowerFall {{was known as the}} standout title for the Ouya at the console's launch, and sold well. When the Ouya exclusivity expired, Thorson signed another exclusivity agreement for the PlayStation 4, where Ascension received an expanded single-player mode, and <b>new</b> <b>levels,</b> weapons, and gameplay variants. A PlayStation Vita release followed in 2015 and an Xbox One version is in development. A standalone eight-player edition for Windows released in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three <b>new</b> <b>levels,</b> unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Tecmo began {{releasing}} low-priced episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for AT and Verizon {{mobile phones}} on both BREW and Java platforms. The official English Tecmo Games mobile website advertised {{it for a}} future release along with a mobile version of Tecmo Bowl. They planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 {{in a series of}} four installments – similar to what Upstart Games did when they ported the NES version of Castlevania to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack found on the NES version, and each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled Ninja Gaiden EpisodeI: Destiny, was released on , and it included only the first Act from the NES version but added two <b>new</b> <b>levels.</b> The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by GameSpot in September 2004, but it – along with the third and fourth installments – was never released.|$|E
5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> of rigour and breadth {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Super Mario Bros. {{was released}} in North America in October 1985. Within four months, it had sold {{tens of millions of}} Nintendo Entertainment System (Famicom in Japan) video game consoles and signaled the end of the 1983 video game crash. When developing a version of the game for Nintendo's coin-operated arcade machine, the VS. System, the team experimented with new, challenging level designs. They enjoyed these <b>new</b> <b>levels,</b> and thought that Super Mario devotees would too. Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Mario franchise and directed Super Mario Bros., no longer had time to design games by himself, given his responsibilities leading Nintendo's R division and their work on The Legend of Zelda. Thus, the Super Mario sequel was delegated to its predecessor's assistant director, Takashi Tezuka, as his directorial debut. He worked with Miyamoto and the R team to develop a sequel based on the same underlying technology, including some levels directly from Vs. Super Mario Bros.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack in MediEvil: Resurrection is orchestrated, {{unlike the}} first instalment. Approximately {{half of the}} themes from the {{original}} were removed while new themes were created to fit with the <b>new</b> <b>levels.</b> The music is split into two halves; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from the original game {{with the addition of}} extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for Resurrection. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Cambridge Studio's previous orchestral game Primal, which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.|$|E
5|$|Tallon responded {{during the}} 193839 season by equalling two world records. The season started poorly for Queensland, not winning {{any of their}} first three matches. Tallon made eight {{dismissals}} in the opening match of the Sheffield Shield campaign against New South Wales, but the visitors hung on for a draw with one wicket in hand. After two consecutive losses, Tallon set {{the first of his}} world records. Against New South Wales in Sydney, he dismissed 12 batsmen, six in each innings, a feat performed only once before, in 1868 by Surrey's Ted Pooley. Tallon's dozen included three stumpings and he was at the crease when Queensland hit the winning runs to complete their first victory in two years. After nine innings during the season without passing 36, Tallon returned to form with the bat, scoring 115 against South Australia, but was unable to take the field in the second innings due to injury as the match ended in a ten-wicket defeat. In the final match of the season, Tallon became the fourth keeper to make seven dismissals in an innings, in a match against Victoria. He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348, and scored 44 as Queensland completed an innings win. Tallon finished the season with 34 dismissals in six matches, setting a new Australian season record. He took more than five dismissals in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wicket. Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever; his catching and stumping style became more animated, and his appealing reached <b>new</b> <b>levels</b> of sound. He passed 100 first-class dismissals during the season, achieved in just 32 matchesthe fastest Australian to reach the mark. Tallon ended the season with 305 runs at 30.50.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Actual data {{warehouses}} models usually consider OLAP dimensions as static entities. However, in practice, {{structural changes}} of dimensions schema are often necessary {{to adapt the}} multidimensional database to chang-ing requirements. This paper presents a new structural update operator for OLAP dimensions. This operator can create a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> to which, a pre-existent level in an OLAP dimension hierarchy rolls up. To define {{the domain of the}} <b>new</b> <b>level</b> and the aggregation function from an existing <b>level</b> to the <b>new</b> <b>level,</b> our operator clas-sifies all instances of an existing level into k clusters with the k-means clustering algorithm. To choose features for k-means clustering, we propose two solutions. The first solution uses descriptors of the pre-existent level in its dimension table while the second one proposes to describe the <b>new</b> <b>level</b> by measures attributes in the fact table. Moreover, we carried out some experimentations within Oracle 10 g DBMS which validated the relevance of our approach. ...|$|R
