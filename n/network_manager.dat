It would be impossible to provide a complete list which, due to the fluid nature of this industry, would become outdated very quickly. It is important that <b>network</b> <b>managers</b> have an awareness of modern Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) requirements, training and skills. There is also a need for <b>network</b> <b>managers</b> to plan for backup of staff, equipment, premises and for disaster recover.
