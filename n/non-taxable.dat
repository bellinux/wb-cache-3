25|$|The 1887 Dawes Act {{empowered}} the President of the United States {{to survey}} commonly held tribal lands and allot {{the land to}} individual tribal members, with the individual land patents {{to be held in}} trust as <b>non-taxable</b> by the government for 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Deductions {{which are}} not {{directly}} linked to <b>non-taxable</b> income exist, which reduce overall taxable income. A key example is RRSP contributions, which {{is a form of}} tax-deferred savings account (income tax is paid only at withdrawal, and no interim tax is payable on account earnings).|$|E
25|$|Complexity of the {{tax code}} in {{developed}} economies offer perverse tax incentives. The more details of tax policy there are, the more opportunities for legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. These not only result in lost revenue, but involve additional costs: for instance, payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy. Perverse incentives also occur because of <b>non-taxable</b> 'hidden' transactions; for instance, a sale from one company to another might be liable for sales tax, but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another, no tax would be payable.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a <b>non-taxable</b> redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the income}} limit for {{allowances}} varied {{according to the}} position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a <b>non-taxable,</b> non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women’s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life. In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies. In January 1984, a decree was made granting state aid to companies which implemented equality plans for staff. That same year, a law was passed that gave the regional Caissess des Allocations Familiales the task of collecting unpaid alimony, initially for lone parents and subsequently for remarried or cohabiting mothers.|$|E

500|$|In January 1999, Javie was {{the only}} one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not {{reporting}} income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. [...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are <b>non-taxable.</b> [...] He later described the trial as [...] "the hardest two weeks" [...] of his life.|$|E
500|$|Since its creation, {{the program}} has {{received}} much criticism {{both within and outside}} Puerto Rico. Critics argue that, since the program provides <b>non-taxable</b> income without any employment requirements, recipients receive free money without incentives for work, which hinders the economic output and development of the island, especially when Puerto Rico's employment participation and unemployment rates have been consistently inferior to U.S. national levels, while the average aid provided in Puerto Rico has exceeded the U.S. national average ($94 versus $74.79, respectively; 2001 estimate). Because of this, Puerto Rico has been called the [...] "welfare island". People from the Dominican Republic do many of the jobs in Puerto Rico that pay too little to attract the locals. However, proponents of the program argue that Puerto Rico's social condition is in far worse shape than any of the 50 U.S. states. Approximately half of the island's population lives below the U.S. Federal poverty guidelines, and many have difficulties in meeting their nutritional needs due to increasing inflation and economic stagnation in the island. Furthermore, the relation between the NAP program's benefits and the low employment participation and high unemployment rates has not been studied, and there is no consensus on their actual causes.|$|E

The second tax avoidance scheme, also designed by Barclays, involved investment funds claiming that <b>non-taxable</b> income entitled the funds to tax credits that could be reclaimed from HMRC.
