Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, Brulé {{worked with}} a sports {{psychologist}} to address the mental aspect of his game, including his confidence. Near {{the end of the}} Oilers' training camp, on October 2, 2011, he was placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. While the departure of Andrew Cogliano in July 2011 made room for Brulé to move up the Oilers' depth chart at centre, the performance of Oilers rookies Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Anton Lander helped make him expendable. Regarding the move, Oilers General Manager Steve Tambellini described Brulé as having lacked consistency. Brulé cleared waivers two days later; an Edmonton Sun article suggested that he would have likely been picked up by another team if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> $1.85 million salary.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Iginla played baseball {{as a young}} man and was the catcher on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would not {{have had the opportunity to}} play sports at a high level if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.|$|E
5|$|Milne had {{admitted}} to problems with alcoholism and gambling addiction {{during and after}} his playing career. He was always an enthusiastic drinker throughout his career, but he lost his passion for football after picking up an injury in 1990 and began drinking {{in a way which}} began to severely damage his health. After retiring as a player he worked at a pub in Nailsea. He appeared in court in 2010 and 2013, but was never convicted, for allegedly attacking his partner Fiona Spence whilst highly intoxicated. Milne's manager at Dundee United, Jim McLean, has since stated that Milne would have had greater success in his career were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> problems with alcohol and discipline. Milne died on 6 September 2015, at the age of 54, due to complications from liver problems.|$|E

5|$|West Nohno {{had made}} her way to Hampton Roads, Virginia, by 29 May, when she sailed for Key West, Florida. After her 4 June arrival at Key West, she began a nine-month journey to Alexandria, Cairo, and other ports. During this {{extended}} voyage, three crewmen entered one of West Nohnos fuel tanks to clean it while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942. The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes. The second mate of the Norwegian tanker Britannia, Henning Vaagsnes, entered the tank and removed all three men. Two of West Nohnos men survived but the third, despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes, did <b>not.</b> <b>For</b> <b>his</b> efforts, Vaagsnes received a pair of binoculars from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners. He was also awarded St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch, a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|In the French sources, one {{important}} discussion {{has centered on}} the question of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|It further {{indicates}} that Braham was {{very conscious of}} his market, more so than he was for the purity of his art.

25|$|Edward William 'Ted' Pooley (13 February 1842 – 18 July 1907) was an English cricketer. Ted Pooley's {{greatest}} {{claim to}} fame is {{that he should have}} been England's first Test match wicket-keeper. The story is a good one, but it overshadows the fact that he played cricket for Surrey and Middlesex between 1861 and 1883, and was held in the highest regard for his cricketing ability if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> personal behaviour.|$|E
