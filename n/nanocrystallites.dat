The main spectral feature for all samples and both temperatures {{is a broad}} band whose position does not change considerably with <b>nanocrystallite</b> size. The band is assigned to recombination through defect states, whose energy depends on the <b>nanocrystallite</b> size {{in such a way}} that they counter-balance the similar dependence of the optical band gap on the <b>nanocrystallite</b> size. A noticeable asymmetry on the low-energy side of this band at low temperatures is attributed to the existence of a variety of surface defect states and/or a large number of volume defect states in these nanocrystals. There is evidence to suggest that the energy band diagram of CdSe nanocrystals in SiOx matrix is considerably different from that of SiOx/CdSe multi-quantum wells. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.
