5|$|Southcote saw {{development}} {{with the opening}} of the Kennet Navigation in the 1720s, where the River Kennet was made navigable by vessels as far upstream as Newbury; industrialisation along the canal continued for the <b>next</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hadspen Post Office {{opened on}} 1 November 1849, though {{the town was}} not {{declared}} in the government gazette until January 1866. A bridge was constructed in the early 1840s replacing the often impassable ford, and during the <b>next</b> <b>century</b> the bridge was often repaired and sometimes replaced.|$|E
50|$|The Northern March {{was in part}} re-established as Brandenburg march {{during the}} <b>next</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the <b>next</b> <b>centuries,</b> the {{historical}} district was consolidated. In the 19th century, {{the town had}} an urban expansion through new construction: The Paseo del Prado.|$|R
50|$|The castle was {{originally}} {{built in the}} 14th century but over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries</b> was destroyed and rebuilt. An earlier 11th-century tower may have existed at the site.|$|R
5|$|Lady Charlotte Herbert was {{the last}} of the family to control Cardiff Castle. She married twice, latterly to Thomas, Viscount Windsor and on her death in 1733 the castle passed to their son, Herbert. Herbert's daughter, Charlotte Jane Windsor, married John Stuart, who rose to become the Marquess of Bute, {{beginning}} a family line that would control the castle for the <b>next</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the <b>next</b> <b>century</b> in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Nueces Bay formed {{approximately}} 9,000 years ago, as the {{sea level}} rose {{at the conclusion of}} the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>next</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{the history}} of the Monastery of Rates was {{relatively}} unremarkable. In the early 16th century the monastery was granted to the knights of the Order of Christ.|$|R
2500|$|The first African slaves {{arrived in}} the Spanish {{territory}} of Hispaniola in 1501. [...] Over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries,</b> millions of Africans {{were taken to the}} New World in the African Slave Trade.|$|R
50|$|Over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{the castle}} fell {{increasingly}} into disuse and disrepair, {{especially after the}} end of the Thirty Years' War when it had served as a refuge for the ruling family.|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories of {{the foundation of the}} Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the <b>next</b> <b>century</b> as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a detailed study of the settlement's development.|$|E
5|$|English Freemasonry {{spread to}} France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, {{and then as}} distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the Moderns. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe {{during the course of}} the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who {{exercised}} only nominal authority. His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the <b>next</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1912 {{geologist}} Thomas Jaggar {{founded the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility {{was taken over}} in 1919 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The <b>next</b> <b>century</b> {{was a period of}} thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E

25|$|Over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries,</b> under {{pressure}} from hostile neighbors, the Tunica migrated south from the Central Mississippi Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley. Eventually they moved westward and settled around present-day Marksville, Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|The second {{documentary}} attestation (this {{time about}} the village Chișinău) dates with the chronicles from 1466. Over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries</b> Chişinău's population steadily grows and {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century it had 7,000 inhabitants.|$|R
5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on Ravenna, {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited {{as the end of the}} Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne. Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the <b>next</b> <b>century</b> when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August, al-Jamri was {{reinstated}} back to {{his position}} {{by the board of}} directors. On 11 October, al-Jamri and his colleagues were found guilty by the court and fined US$2,650 each. Subsequently, al-Jamri received two international awards; the CPJ International Press Freedom Award in 2011 and the <b>Next</b> <b>Century</b> Foundation's Peace Through Media Award in 2012. In September 2011, Al-Wasat won the UNICEF regional award for electronic media and in May 2012, it was ranked top in the Media Credibility Index ahead of Al Jazeera, BBC, Agence France-Presse {{and more than a dozen}} other media outlets.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740-41, which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> but another devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced {{over one million}} more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, {{at a time when}} the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.|$|E
25|$|In 1235, {{the stage}} was set for the <b>next</b> <b>century's</b> Breton War of Succession when Peter I dispossessed the heir of the Penthièvre Dynasty in order to give the countship of Penthièvre to his second child, Yolande.|$|R
50|$|Mirocles {{possibly}} founded {{also the}} church of San Vittore al Corpo in Milan (rebuilt many times during the <b>next</b> <b>centuries)</b> in honor of saint Victor Maurus, who was martyred {{during the reign of}} Emperor Diocletian in 303.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{was occupied by}} the government offices of the town by the 14th-century. Over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries,</b> it was converted to private housing. It incorporated the former Monte Pio, an early example of a Monte di Pietà ...|$|R
5|$|Within 20 {{years of}} its construction, {{alterations}} were made that expanded the shops and changed the façades. By {{the end of the}} 18th century it had been damaged by floods, but it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the <b>next</b> <b>century</b> alterations to the shops included cantilevered extensions on the bridge's north face. In the 20th century several schemes were carried out to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, enhancing its appeal as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>next</b> <b>centuries</b> Gniezno {{evolved as}} a {{regional}} seat of {{the eastern part of}} Greater Poland, and in 1238 municipal autonomy was granted by the duke Władysław Odonic. Gniezno was again the coronation site in 1295 and 1300.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{contact with}} Europeans came {{about in the}} mid-16th century, when Portuguese missionaries {{encountered}} Mandaeans in Southern Iraq and controversially designated them [...] "Christians of St. John". In the <b>next</b> <b>centuries</b> Europeans became more acquainted with the Mandaeans and their religion.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} recapt general taxes, the Courts of 1359 {{established}} a permanent representation of deputies, called Deputation of the General (in Catalan: Diputació del General) and later usually known as Generalitat, which gained an important political power during the <b>next</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the <b>next</b> <b>century</b> extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E
5|$|Ernst's rule, {{and that}} of his four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} the position of his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would be brought to the Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already long war of secession well into the <b>next</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1570, the Sultan of Bijapur, Ali Adil Shah I, {{entered into}} an {{alliance}} with the Sultan of Ahmadnagar, Murtaza Nizam Shah, and the Zamorin of Calicut for a simultaneous attack on the Portuguese territories of Goa, Chaul, and Mangalore. He attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur Sultans were especially renowned for their loathing of Christianity. Fearing persecution, many Goan Catholics fled to South Canara during this second wave of migrations, and settled in Barcoor, Kallianpur, Cundapore, and Basroor. For the <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> there was continual migration of Goan Catholics southwards, so that by 1650, {{a considerable number of}} Catholics were settled around Mangalore, Moolki, Shirva, Pezar, Bantval, Cundapore, Kallianpur, and Kirem. The Christian Goud Saraswat Brahmins who came during this wave belonged mostly to the Shenvi subcaste.|$|E
5000|$|Aach {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the year 1100. By the year 1150 the settlement was known in Latin as [...] Aach was granted town rights in 1283 by King Rudolph I of Germany. For the <b>next</b> <b>centuries</b> it {{was a part of}} Further Austria.|$|R
50|$|A small Franciscan order {{church and}} monastery was erected by 1232 at the site; but soon work began {{on a larger}} church. In 1341-1344, the present layout with a Gothic design is {{attributed}} to the masters Armanno, Taddeo and Falconetto da Fontana. Chapels were added over the <b>next</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1243 Grefrath was {{acquired}} by the county of Geldern (since 1339: duchy of Geldern) to which it belonged for the <b>next</b> <b>centuries.</b> In 1543 the duchy of Geldern {{was given to the}} Burgundian Netherlands, also called the Spanish Netherlands after the division of the House of Habsburg.|$|R
