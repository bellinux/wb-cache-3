40|$|In {{materials}} science and biology, optical <b>near-field</b> <b>microscopies</b> enable spatial resolutions beyond the diffraction limit, but they cannot provide the atomic-scale imaging capabilities of electron microscopy. Given {{the nature of}} interactions between electrons and photons, and considering their connections through nanostructures, {{it should be possible}} to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond). Here we report the development of photon-induced <b>near-field</b> electron <b>microscopy</b> (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (nÄ§Ï‰) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 [*]keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|We employ tip-enhanced {{infrared}} <b>near-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{to study}} the plasmonic properties of epitaxial quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene on silicon carbide. The near-field images reveal propagating graphene plasmons, {{as well as a}} strong plasmon reflection at gaps in the graphene layer, which appear at the steps between the SiC terraces. When the step height is around 1. 5 nm, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the plasmon wavelength, the reflection signal reaches 20 % of its value at graphene edges, and it approaches 50 % for step heights as small as 5 nm. This intriguing observation is corroborated by numerical simulations, and explained by the accumulation of a line charge at the graphene termination. The associated electromagnetic fields at the graphene termination decay within a few nanometers, thus preventing efficient plasmon transmission across nanoscale gaps. Our work suggests that plasmon propagation in graphene-based circuits can be tailored using extremely compact nanostructures, such as ultra-narrow gaps. It also demonstrates that tip-enhanced <b>near-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> is a powerful contactless tool to examine nanoscale defects in graphene.
