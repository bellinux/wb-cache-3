5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E

25|$|Policy {{discourse}} in Singapore has largely overlooked {{the fact that}} the linguistic market consists of permeable boundaries and the value of linguistic capital for each language changes as internal and external factors interact together.

These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over space and time.|$|E
25|$|Our {{considerations}} also yield a free construction for morphisms that do preserve meets {{instead of}} joins (i.e. upper adjoints of Galois connections). In fact, we merely have to dualize {{what was said}} above: free objects are given as powersets ordered by reverse inclusion, such that set union provides the meet operation, and the function f° is {{defined in terms of}} meets instead of joins. The result of this construction could be called a free complete meet-semilattice. One should also note how these free constructions extend those that are used to obtain free semilattices, where we only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> finite sets.|$|E

After achieving this goal, Sakanaction decided to extend this goal for their next album: 200,000 copies sold and two days performing at the Makuhari Messe. In order for the band to meet this goal, they realized they would need to reach out to a much wider audience, by agreeing to more commercial tie-ups, which they saw as a challenge for the band to do new things. Furthermore, they felt that they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> a new audience: people with no prior interest in the band, who would happen to hear their music as they watched television, as well as a younger audience.|$|E

25|$|Unlike dynamic {{metabolic}} simulation, FBA {{assumes that}} the internal concentration of metabolites within a system stays constant over time and thus is unable to provide anything other than steady-state solutions. It is unlikely that FBA could, for example, simulate the functioning of a nerve cell. Since the internal concentration of metabolites is not considered within a model, {{it is possible that}} an FBA solution could contain metabolites at a concentration too high to be biologically acceptable. This is a problem that dynamic metabolic simulations would probably avoid. One advantage of the simplicity of FBA over dynamic simulations is that they are far less computationally expensive, allowing the simulation of large numbers of perturbations to the network. A second advantage is that the reconstructed model can be substantially simpler by avoiding the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> enzyme rates and the effect of complex interactions on enzyme kinetics.|$|E
25|$|While WSS {{improvements}} were ongoing, {{the traditional}} water management approach did {{not account for}} domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and non-point sources pollution control resulting in the environmental degradation of water bodies. These systems were viewed as separate and the management strategy did not account for treatment facilities, local streams, and overall water quality within them. The philosophy is evolving however, and water resources management practice is becoming more of an integrated approach taking into account a multi-sectoral approach looking at water supply, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), drainage and irrigation as one entity. According to pollution control work presented {{by a team of}} researchers at the British Hydrological Society symposium in 2008, there is a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the sewer system, the WWTP, and the river as one system. These developments in the Bogotá water management system offer multiple opportunities to incorporate integrated methodologies both now and in the future.|$|E
25|$|Retailers {{must also}} plan for {{customer}} preferred payment modes– e.g., cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require {{some type of}} handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms {{will need to be}} determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need {{to take into account the}} storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin. For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.|$|E
