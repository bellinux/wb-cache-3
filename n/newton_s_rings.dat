40|$|A recent {{paper by}} Erik Verlinde [1] argues that gravity {{should be viewed}} not as a {{fundamental}} force, but as an emergent thermodynamic phenomenon due to some yet undetermined microscopic theory. Using well-established thermodynamic principles along with the holographic principle, Verlinde proposes that gravity {{can be seen as}} an entropic force as opposed to a fundamental one. Using this idea, Verlinde claims to be able to derive <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> 2 nd law, <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> law of universal gravitation, and Einstein gravity. We present a challenge to this reformulation of gravity. Our contention is that a detailed examination of Verlinde s argument shows that such a theory cannot correctly give <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> laws or Einstein gravity. We find that the Poisson equation for Newtonian gravity is not uniquely determined using Verlinde s theory. We are also able to show that Verlinde s theory does not uniquely determine Einstein s field equations. Specific calculations can also be done in the Reissner-Nordstrom and Schwarzschild metrics to show that the entropy of these black holes do not agree with accepted values of these entropies. _x 000 D_We will begin by introducing results by Hawking, Unruh, and Bekenstein that motivate the relationship between gravity and thermodynamics. We then summarize Verlinde s proposal of gravity being a thermodynamic phenomenon. From this new theory, we can make calculations using the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics to determine if Verlinde s theory is compatible with well-known calculations for the temperature and entropy of black holes with these metrics. Finally, we will present a detailed explanation as to why we believe Verlinde s derivation of the Poisson equation and Einstein s field equations is flawed...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} entropic forces has risen considerably since E. Verlinde proposed to interpret the force in <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> second law and Gravity as entropic forces [1]. Brownian motion, the motion of a small particle (pollen) driven by random impulses from the surrounding molecules, may be the first example of a stochastic process in which such forces are expected to emerge. In this note it is shown that at least two types of entropic force can be identified in the case of 3 D Brownian motion (or random walk). This yields simple derivations of known results of Brownian motion, Hook s law and, applying an external (non-radial) force, Curie s law and the Langevin-Debye equation.
