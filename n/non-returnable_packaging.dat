40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of the packaging system of a company with focus on beverages industry. Retrunable and <b>non-returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> is a frequently discussed topic at present, especially in connection with beverages industry [...] this work reflects a new phenomenon of beer being bottled into PET bottles and glass returnable bottles, which are not interchangeable among breweries any more. First part presents theoretical background for analysis of logistic costs; there are identified packaging functions, basic materials and legislation. Second part inspects logistic costs with focus on transportation, warehousing, packaging and reverse logistics costs...|$|E
40|$|Optimized {{logistic}} structures offer great avoidance potentials {{and allow}} for a packaging reduced good distribution. In general, the view of packaging problems is black-and-white. This is an obtacle to an efficient packaging design and can easily result in political solutions which only consider partial aspects concerning environmental pollution. Logistical optimizations are not based on trivial solutions such as: returnable packaging is better than <b>non-returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> or {{paper and cardboard packaging}} is favourable to plastic; but their whole task is the secure goods distribution with minimal packaging. 'ne development of circular systems is the basic requirement for the solution of this problem. According to the product and distribution requirements the combination of systems for returnable and non- returnable materials, i. e. of different circular processes, is the prerequisit for closed material circuits. The rules and regulations by the legislation, with the Federal Republic obvi ously playing a leading role, show that the recycling of the packing material is a first step towards an extensive product liability. Material recycling means that secondary raw materials have to be the result which can be used for products of highquality - comparable to the very first products...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Problem Little {{research}} has been conducted on how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the Scandinavian automotive supply chain. Sources also propose that returnable packaging is dealt with inefficiently within the automotive suppliers.    Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to explore and analyze how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the ASC. It also aims to identify perceived important factors for efficient returnable packaging management from the perspective of suppliers, sub-suppliers and OEMs. Method The research is based on a holistic single case study. Further, it adopts the inductive approach and exploratory purpose. Data collection is facilitated by qualitative methods, using ten semi-structured interviews and four on-site observations. Conclusion Packaging was found to be managed somewhat differently in the internal, outbound and inbound flows. <b>Non-returnable</b> and returnable <b>packaging</b> was found used in all flows at different ratios. Further, several factors were regarded important for efficient returnable packaging management. These were found specific for the internal, outbound and inbound flows and further divided into fundamental and efficiency factors...|$|R
