40|$|BACKGROUND: Dissemination of {{tumor cells}} from needle biopsy has been {{observed}} {{in a wide range}} of tumor types. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has become accepted as the first-line test in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Local recurrence of thyroid cancer from <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> seeding is an extremely rare complication of thyroid FNA. CASE: A 59 -year-old woman developed local recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma three years after FNA of the primary cancer. Local metastases developed in the skin and sternocleidomastoid muscle. The location of the recurrent cancer and the linear relationship of the metastases indicated that local recurrence was due to <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> seeding at the time of FNA. CONCLUSION: <b>Needle</b> <b>track</b> seeding has been recognized as a possible, albeit rare, complication of FNA of thyroid cancer. Although proper FNA technique can reduce the potential for <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> seeding, its occurrence is an unavoidable complication of FNA evaluation of thyroid malignancies...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{development}} of MR-guided high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy {{is under investigation}} due to the excellent tumor and organs at risk visualization of MRI. However, MR-based localization of needles (including catheters or tubes) has inherently a low update rate and the required image interpretation can be hampered by signal voids arising from blood vessels or calcifications limiting the precision of the needle guidance and reconstruction. In this paper, a new <b>needle</b> <b>tracking</b> prototype is investigated using fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) -based sensing: this prototype involves a MR-compatible stylet composed of three optic fibers with nine sets of embedded FBG sensors each. This stylet can be inserted into brachytherapy needles and allows a fast measurement of the needle deflection. This study aims to assess the potential of FBG-based sensing for real-time needle (including catheter or tube) tracking during MR-guided intervention. METHODS: First, the MR compatibility of FBG-based sensing and its accuracy was evaluated. Different known needle deflections were measured using FBG-based sensing during simultaneous MR-imaging. Then, a <b>needle</b> <b>tracking</b> procedure using FBG-based sensing was proposed. This procedure involved a MR-based calibration of the FBG-based system performed prior to the interventional procedure. The <b>needle</b> <b>tracking</b> system was assessed in an experiment with a moving phantom during MR imaging. The FBG-based system was quantified by comparing the gold-standard shapes, the shape manually segmented on MRI and the FBG-based measurements. RESULTS: The evaluation of the MR compatibility of FBG-based sensing and its accuracy shows that the needle deflection could be measured with an accuracy of 0. 27 mm on average. Besides, the FBG-based measurements were comparable to the uncertainty of MR-based measurements estimated at half the voxel size in the MR image. Finally, the mean(standard deviation) Euclidean distance between MR- and FBG-based needle position measurements was equal to 0. 79 mm(0. 37 mm). The update rate and latency of the FBG-based needle position measurement were 100 and 300 ms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FBG-based <b>needle</b> <b>tracking</b> procedure proposed in this paper is able to determine {{the position of the}} complete needle, under MR-imaging, with better accuracy and precision, higher update rate, and lower latency compared to current MR-based needle localization methods. This system would be eligible for MR-guided brachytherapy, in particular, for an improved needle guidance and reconstruction...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed 1, 400 percutaneous CT-guided thoracic biopsies {{during the period from}} August 1993 to August 2008. A case with air embolism was considered to be a patient with hypotension during or after biopsy and with an air embolism confirmed on CT. A <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> implantation was considered to be a mass in the <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> on the postbiopsy follow-up CT. RESULTS. There were three (0. 21 %) cases of air embolism. Air embolisms were confirmed in the left ventricle, coronary artery, ascending aorta, and pulmonary vein. The pulmonary venous wall was pathologically identified in one case. Although there were no fatalities, two patients needed resuscitation. Left hemiplegia occurred in one case, but it gradually disappeared. There were four (0. 56 %) cases of <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> implantation in 713 pathologically proven malignant thoracic biopsy cases with follow-up CT scans. Two were primary lung cancer and the others were lung metastasis (renal cell carcinoma and osteosarcoma). Implantation was found 4 - 7 months (mean, 5. 6 months) after the biopsy, and size was 2. 5 - 5. 6 cm (mean, 3. 5 cm). CONCLUSION.

40|$|International audienceUltrasound image {{guidance}} {{is widely}} used in minimally invasive procedures, including fetal surgery. In this context, maintaining visibility of medical devices is a significant challenge. Needles and catheters can readily deviate from the ultrasound imaging plane as they are inserted. When the medical device tips are not visible, they can damage critical structures, with potentially profound consequences including loss of pregnancy. In this study, we performed 3 D ultrasonic <b>tracking</b> of a <b>needle</b> using a novel probe with a 1. 5 D array of transducer elements that was driven by a commercial ultrasound system. A fiber-optic hydrophone integrated into the needle received transmissions from the probe, and data from this sensor was processed to estimate {{the position of the}} hydrophone tip in the coordinate space of the probe. Golay coding was used to increase the signal-to-noise (SNR). The relative tracking accuracy was better than 0. 4 mm in all dimensions, as evaluated using a water phantom. To obtain a preliminary indication of the clinical potential of 3 D ultrasonic <b>needle</b> <b>tracking,</b> an intravascular <b>needle</b> insertion was performed in an in vivo pregnant sheep model.

40|$|MR-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} {{has gained}} increasing interest {{as a treatment}} for patients with localized prostate cancer because of the superior value of MRI for tumor and surrounding tissues localization. To enable needle insertion into the prostate with the patient in the MR bore, a single needle MR-compatible robotic system involving needle-by-needle dose delivery has been developed at our institution. Throughout the intervention, dose delivery may be impaired by: (1) sub-optimal needle positioning caused by e. g. needle bending, (2) intra-operative internal organ motion such as prostate rotations or swelling, or intra-procedural rectum or bladder filling. This may result in failure to reach clinical constraints. To assess the first aforementioned challenge, a recent study from our research group demonstrated that the deposited dose may be greatly improved by real-time adaptive planning with feedback on the actual needle positioning. However, the needle insertion sequence is left to the doctor and therefore, this may result in sub-optimal dose delivery. In this manuscript, a new method is proposed to determine and update automatically the needle insertion sequence. This strategy is based on the determination of the most sensitive <b>needle</b> <b>track.</b> The sensitivity of a <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> is defined as its impact on the dose distribution in case of sub-optimal positioning. A stochastic criterion is thus presented to determine each <b>needle</b> <b>track</b> sensitivity based on needle insertion simulations. To assess the proposed sequencing strategy, HDR prostate brachytherapy was simulated on 11 patients with varying number of needle insertions. Sub-optimal needle positioning was simulated at each insertion (modeled by typical random angulation errors). In 91 % of the scenarios, the dose distribution improved when the needle was inserted into the most compared to the least sensitive <b>needle</b> <b>track.</b> The computation time for sequencing was less than 6 [*]s per <b>needle</b> <b>track.</b> The proposed needle insertion sequencing can therefore assist in delivering an optimal dose in HDR prostate brachytherapy...|$|E

In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the drugs belonged to Hendrix. Mervin Wilson, the customs agent who discovered the drugs, agreed with O'Driscoll's assertion that Hendrix had drawn attention to himself at the airport by wearing what O'Driscoll described as [...] "obviously mod clothing". Wilson stated that Hendrix had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage, and Constable W.J. Matheson confirmed that Hendrix had no <b>needle</b> <b>tracks</b> on his arms.|$|R
