5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 <b>new</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> insects, six of plants, and a <b>new</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> legless lizard.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Hokkaido, Clark {{examined}} the local flora and introduced <b>new</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> plants and trees from Japan to the United States.

5|$|During {{the course}} of his career, Beebe {{authored}} over 800 articles and 21 books, including his four-volume pheasant monograph.

While 83 of the fish that he described were done so in a conventional manner, the remaining four were done so based on visual observations.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many <b>new</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} of rail from the Chatham Islands, as a <b>new</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species {{more similar to}} the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{while on}} a fishing trip {{on the coast of}} Queensland with his father, Irwin {{discovered}} a <b>new</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> turtle. Later given the honour of naming the newly discovered species, he named it Irwin's turtle (Elseya irwini) after his family.
