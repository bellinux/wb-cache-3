5|$|Brian {{realizes that}} if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> {{about the lives}} of animals, then he is {{worthless}} to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a shared}} {{belief in the}} {{potential}} of IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users. “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have, we should fix real problems people struggle with every day.” Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters, yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives. “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set, {{we need to stop}} making toys <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about and instead work on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real people.” A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them”. A company must identify where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise non-action is the consequence. This indicates that a major roadblock to IoT adoption is not technical but analytical in nature.|$|E
60|$|Democracy was dead; for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> minded the {{governing}} class governing. England was now practically a despotism, {{but not an}} hereditary one. Some one in the official class was made King. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>cared</b> how: <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cared</b> who. He was merely an universal secretary.|$|R

500|$|... "The {{rules are}} arbitrary, unfathomable, {{and subject to}} sudden change. A brutal social {{hierarchy}} prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive {{you have to be}} totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some [...] "phase"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> who you really are or how you really feel about anything." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1959, Sinatra {{released}} Come Dance with Me!, {{a highly}} successful, critically acclaimed album which stayed on Billboard's Pop album chart for 140 weeks, peaking at #2. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, {{as well as}} Best Vocal Performance, Male and Best Arrangement for Billy May. He also released <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>Cares</b> in the same year, a collection of [...] "brooding, lonely" [...] torch songs, which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought was [...] "nearly as good as its predecessor Where Are You?, but lacked the [...] "lush" [...] arrangements {{of it and the}} [...] "grandiose melancholy" [...] of Only the Lonely.|$|E
500|$|Jake {{attends a}} $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to {{facilitate}} a [...] "chance" [...] meeting. Gekko confronts Bretton {{about what he did}} to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox, and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.|$|E

500|$|Some {{prominent}} critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 {{review for}} Sur, Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film [...] "a labyrinth with no center" [...] and predicted that its legacy {{would be a}} film [...] "whose historical value is undeniable but which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> to see again." [...] The Argus Weekend Magazine critic Erle Cox called the film [...] "amazing" [...] but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was [...] "overdone." [...] Tatlers James Agate called it [...] "the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish thing one expects from high-brows" [...] and [...] "a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed." [...] Eileen Creelman of The New York Sun called it [...] "a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee.|$|E
500|$|After much anticipation, Brian {{receives}} {{an invitation to}} an award ceremony celebrating his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love, [...] by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced {{he is a great}} writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the [...] "award ceremony" [...] however, he discovers that he has misunderstood {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "special", [...] prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he's not a writer at all, but a big fat joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to [...] "murder". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.|$|E
500|$|From the start, Marie {{had trouble}} {{adjusting}} {{to life in}} Romania. Her personality and [...] "high spirits" [...] frequently created controversies at the Romanian court, and she disliked the austere atmosphere of her household. She wrote that she [...] "had not been brought down to Romania to be adored and spoilt and made much of; {{she had come to}} be part of the machinery King Carol had wound up. She had been imported to be trimmed, educated, cut down and trained according to the great man's conception of things." [...] When describing her early days in Romania, Marie wrote that [...] "for long hours [...] would mope, whilst [...] young husband did his military service, all alone in rooms [...] hated, heavy German rooms". Marie's paternal aunt, the Dowager German Empress, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that [...] "Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you. The King is a great tyrant in his family, & has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about him, & his beautiful & gifted little wife, I fear, gets into scrapes, & like a butterfly, instead of hovering over the flowers, burns her pretty wings by going rather near the fire!" [...] Easily learning to speak the Romanian language, she followed her mother's advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals.|$|E

[...] According to a July 2010 (Iranian-run) Press TV poll, nearly two-thirds (65.99%) of the {{respondents}} described CNN's recent move to sack Nasr as [...] "an instance of intellectual terrorism reflecting the influence of Zionists on mainstream Western media outlets".|$|E
2500|$|Perkins {{plays the}} protagonist Sara, a {{veterinarian}} {{who has not}} told her parents she is gay. The comedian told Lockyer that while viewers would assume that the character is based on herself, she only used [...] "trace elements" [...] of her own story for Sara. Perkins said [...] "She's a professional, grown-up woman, with a responsible job as a vet. She has a great bunch of friends, most of them heterosexual, {{and all of them}} are saying, 'What's your problem? <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares!</b> Tell your bloody parents.'" [...] Heading Out marks Perkins' acting debut.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{dictionaries}} {{and definitions}} of shan shui {{assume that the}} term includes all ancient Chinese paintings with mountain and water images. Contemporary Chinese painters, however, feel that only paintings with mountain and water images that follow specific conventions of form, style and function should be called [...] "shan shui painting." [...] When Chinese painters work on shan shui painting, they {{do not try to}} present an image of what they have seen in the nature, but what they have thought about nature. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> whether the painted colors and shapes look like the real object or not.|$|E
60|$|So spake the King, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{immediately}} answered, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cared</b> {{to take up}} such {{a quarrel}} against so strong a knight, not knowing for whom it was that that quarrel was to be taken up.|$|R

60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>cared</b> {{whether the}} victims were really guilty of crime, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cared</b> {{if they had been}} equitably tried and been justly condemned, all that the public cared about was that the {{spectacle}} was new and amusing. The African giants were well-trained for their part, playing with the miserable victims like a feline doth with its prey, allowing them to escape, now and then, to see safety close at hand, to make a wild dash for what looked like freedom, and then suddenly bounding on them with that short wide sword that cried death as it descended.|$|R
2500|$|Sandé's {{debut album}} was {{released}} on 13 February 2012. She {{said that it is}} very hard to imagine that she is releasing an album with Virgin Records. She said that she was always going to [...] "definitely" [...] release an album, if she was signed or not. However, she stated that she did not think there would be [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement of what I was doing". She said she loves to be in the limelight and that people are talking about her so much. She said she only loves the attention because she has experienced the other side, when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Gervais {{said that}} the series is about [...] "kindness [...] more {{important}} than anything else". He added [...] "It’s about the forgotten – everyone's forgotten. It’s all these arbitrary people who didn’t know each other, and they’re in there now because they’re {{in the last years}} of their life. And it’s about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It’s about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they’re together." [...] He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched Secret Millionaire – [...] "It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about old people in this country... I think it's perfect for now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phinehas draws {{a gloomy}} {{picture of his}} time. [...] "Since the {{destruction}} of the Temple," [...] he says, [...] "the members and freemen are put to shame, those who conform to the Law are held in contempt, the violent and the informer have the upper hand, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> for the people or asks pity for them. We have no hope but in God" [...] (Sotah 49a). Elsewhere he says: [...] "Why is it that in our time the prayers of the Jews are not heard? Because they do not know the holy name of God" [...] (Pesik. R. xxii., end; Midr. Tch. to Ps. xci. 15). Phinehas, however, believes in man's perfectibility, and enumerates the virtues which render man worthy to receive the Holy Spirit. The Law, he says, leads to carefulness; carefulness, to diligence; diligence, to cleanliness; cleanliness, to retirement; retirement, to purity; purity, to piety; piety, to humility; humility, to fear of sin; fear of sin, to holiness; holiness, to the reception of the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit, to resurrection (Ab. Zarah 20b; with some slight variants, Sotah ix. 15).|$|E
