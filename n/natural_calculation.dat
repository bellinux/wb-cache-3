40|$|During {{a quarter}} of a century, the main {{characteristics}} of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio of ambient noise HVSRN have been extensively used for site effect assessment. In spite of the uncertainties about the optimum theoretical model to describe these observations, several schemes for inversion of the full HVSRN curve for near surface surveying have been developed over the last decade. In this work, a computer code for forward calculation of H/V spectra based on the diffuse field assumption (DFA) is presented and tested. It takes advantage of the recently stated connection between the HVSRN and the elastodynamic Green's function which arises from the ambient noise interferometry theory. The algorithm allows for (1) a <b>natural</b> <b>calculation</b> of the Green's functions imaginary parts by using suitable contour integrals in the complex wavenumber plane, and (2) separate calculation of the contributions of Rayleigh, Love, P-SV and SH waves as well. The stability of the algorithm at high frequencies is preserved by means of an adaptation of the Wang's orthonormalization method to the calculation of dispersion curves, surface-waves medium responses and contributions of body waves. This code has been combined with a variety of inversion methods to make up a powerful tool for passive seismic surveying. Comment: Published in Computers & Geosciences 97, 67 - 7...|$|E

40|$|Crack {{detection}} at {{an early}} stage can prevent catastrophic structural failures. In this thesis, the inverse problem of crack detection in frames is studied. The direct problem of calculating the natural frequencies of beams and frames with multiple cracks is first tackled. A new method for <b>natural</b> frequency <b>calculation</b> is devised. The cracks are modelled as rotational springs. 4 × 4 dynamic stiffness matrices for beams are evaluated in a recursive manner, according to the number of cracks, by applying partial Gaussian eliminations. The resulting transcendental eigenvalue problem is solved using the Wittrick–Williams algorithm to extract the natural frequencies. Additional sign counts resulting from the partial Gaussian eliminations must be accounted for when applying the algorithm. The dynamic stiffness matrix of a frame with multiply cracked members is then assembled. The <b>natural</b> frequency <b>calculation</b> method forms a basis for detecting a single crack in a frame using only natural frequency measurements. Each frame member is discretised into a number of points. Selected natural frequencies are calculated accurately in the uncracked case and when the crack is placed individually at each discretisation point. The variation between the uncracked and cracked frequencies is normalised giving a number of curves corresponding to the selected frequencies. The normalisation is then applied on the measured frequencies. For noise free measurements, point crack locations are obtained. Applying the principles of interval arithmetic, noisy measurements give crack location ranges. Empirical probability distributions are used to graphically represent these ranges and their relative probabilities. Crack severity ranges are then obtained. The detection method is validated experimentally on a frame with scaled down dimensions. The fast Fourier transform is used to convert the time domain vibration signal into the frequency domain. Using higher order natural frequencies, two enhancement procedures for the detection method are devised and applied theoretically...|$|R

The nuclear wave function has both strong short-range correlations and long-range contributions. Natural orbitals provide a means of adapting the single-particle basis for ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations to better match the many-body wave function. Natural orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the one-body density matrix from a calculation using an initial single-particle reference basis, such as the traditional harmonic oscillator basis. The natural orbital basis builds in contributions from high-lying oscillator shells, thus accelerating convergence of wave functions, energies, and other observables. The convergence of the ground and excited state energies, radii, and electromagnetic observables of He, Li, and Be isotopes calculated using natural orbitals in ab initio NCCI calculations is discussed.
