5|$|By July 1944, No.10 Group's {{position}} in western New Guinea was complicating Northern Command's efforts to supply it, {{and the group}} was made independent of the command. The next month, <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> headquarters transferred to Madang. In September, No.71 Wing was detached from No.10 Group to <b>Northern</b> <b>Command,</b> which {{had been given the}} task of supporting the Australian 6thDivision in the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Headquartered at Tadji in northern New Guinea, No.71 Wing comprised Nos.7, 8 and 100 Bristol Beaufort Squadrons, augmented by a flight of CAC Boomerangs from No.4 (Army Cooperation) Squadron. No.74 (Composite) Wing, which had been formed in August 1943 and was headquartered at Port Moresby, also came under the aegis of <b>Northern</b> <b>Command.</b> The command's other major operational formation was No.84 (Army Cooperation) Wing, which began moving from Australia to Torokina on Bougainville in October 1944. By this time, <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> controlled six squadrons in the New Guinea area. No.79 Wing, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, was earmarked for transfer from North-Western Area to <b>Northern</b> <b>Command,</b> to undertake operations in New Britain, but its proposed airfield was not ready and it was instead transferred to the First Tactical Air Force at Labuan the following year.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Walters was {{promoted}} to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) <b>Northern</b> <b>Command,</b> directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville {{until the end of}} the war. Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> had previously been a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No.10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Northern Command's operational formations included No.71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.84 Wing on Bougainville. No.71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6thDivision during the Aitape–Wewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. No.84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> headquarters a frank report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters. In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak.|$|E
5|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Established in April 1944, it evolved from No.9 Operational Group, which had been the RAAF's primary mobile formation in the South West Pacific theatre since September 1942, but had lately become a garrison force in New Guinea. <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> was headquartered initially at Milne Bay and then, from August 1944, in Madang. It conducted operations in New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville {{until the end of the}} war. Re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, it was headquartered in Port Moresby from March 1946 and disbanded in February 1947.|$|E
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>Command's</b> area of {{operations}} covers Queensland and the Northern Territory above 19 degrees south and the Kimberley and Pilbara Districts of Western Australia. <b>Northern</b> <b>Command's</b> headquarters are located at Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, Northern Territory.

5|$|Jaguar, Léopard and Panthère were {{assigned}} to the <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> (Forces maritimes du Nord) on 7 September in anticipation of a German invasion of Belgium. They proved, however, to be too large and unmaneuverable for operations in the shallow waters of the English Channel and North Sea; Panthère ran aground on 10 September in poor visibility, but suffered only minor damage, and Jaguar did the same thing on the night of 28/29 October. The contre-torpilleurs were relieved by smaller torpilleurs d'escadre beginning in mid-October. The other ships {{were assigned}} to the Western Command (Forces maritimes de l'Ouest) for convoy escort duties from October 1939 to May 1940 where they guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca, French Morocco, and Le Verdon-sur-Mer. They were joined by the first three ships as they were replaced in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Command.</b> Jaguar was badly damaged during a collision with a British destroyer in January 1940 and her repairs were not completed until early May.|$|E

5|$|By early 1944, No.9 Operational Group {{had become}} a static {{garrison}} force for the New Guinea area, and was renamed <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> in April to better reflect its new role. The following month No.71 Wing, now led by Wing Commander Ralph Moran, advanced to Nadzab, where it came {{under the control of}} No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). There Nos.8 and 100 Squadrons engaged in attacks on Japanese positions in Wewak, each flying over 140 sorties during the month.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed {{full control}} of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. <b>Northern</b> <b>Command,</b> having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Morgan {{volunteered for}} a six-year tour of India {{and joined the}} 118th Field Battery, 26th Field Brigade, at Deepcut, where it was forming and {{training}} for service in the subcontinent.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the war, No.11 Group {{was formed}} on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, using {{elements}} of <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> and the First Tactical Air Force; this freed the latter from garrison duties following the liberation of Borneo. In recommending the Morotai garrison's establishment, Bostock explained that while it shared the static characteristic of an area command, it differed in that the area commands were part of the permanent structure of the Air Force and situated within the borders of Australia's mainland and overseas territories, whereas the new formation was a temporary wartime measure, headquartered on foreign territory.|$|E
5|$|The Whitlam Labor Government {{subsequently}} amalgamated {{the five}} defence ministries (Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply) {{into a single}} Department of Defence in 1973, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On 1 January 1976, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all-volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Today, the ADF is headquartered at Russell Offices in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations Commands. In addition, <b>Northern</b> <b>Command</b> is based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia.|$|E

5|$|At night, A Syrian force {{attempted}} to surround the Israelis by crossing the Jordan River {{to the north}} of the Sea of Galilee, but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded. This was spotted and reported by the Israelis at Tabgha, and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children, elderly and sick, as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the Poria-Alumot region. In the panic of surprise, many men also tried to flee the frontal villages, but blockposts were set up near Afula and Yavne'el by the Military Police Service's <b>northern</b> <b>command,</b> under Yosef Pressman, who personally stopped buses and allowed only the women and children to proceed to safety.|$|E
