5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony {{dating back to the}} early 1600s, in the years leading up to the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity. Horace Mann made the state's school system a <b>national</b> <b>model.</b> Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American philosophy. Members of the transcendentalist movement emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Pittsburgh {{also became}} a <b>national</b> <b>model</b> for {{community}} development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became {{the model for the}} nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.|$|E

He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a <b>national</b> <b>model</b> and to discuss federal funding possibilities.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>national</b> <b>models</b> of {{integration}} {{is a very}} popular one in comparative migration studies {{as well as in}} the making of integration policy. A key trait of such <b>national</b> <b>models</b> is that they assume policies to be formulated and coordinated in a strongly state-centred way, reflecting national institutional legacies, national politics and public perceptions of national identity. In this respect, the literature distinguishes, for instance, the French republican model, the British race-relations model and the Dutch multicultural model. In this chapter two such models, those of France and the Netherlands, are described, analysed and critically assessed. The conclusion is that <b>national</b> <b>models</b> of integration are an inappropriate tool for the comparative study of integration inasmuch as the objective of such research is to assess the success or failure of a national approach to integrating migrants. The notion of <b>national</b> <b>models</b> is tainted by normative (if not moral) connotations that hinder the ability of social scientists to address empirical reality...|$|R

25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of social progressivism, Transcendentalism, and {{abolitionist}} activity. Horace Mann made the state system of schools the <b>national</b> <b>model.</b> Two prominent abolitionists from the Commonwealth were William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. Garrison founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832, and helped change perceptions on slavery. The movement increased antagonism over the issues of slavery, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots in Massachusetts between 1835 and 1837. The works of abolitionists contributed to the eventual actions of the Commonwealth during the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Rail {{transport}} modelling uses {{a variety}} of scales (ratio between {{the real world and}} the model) to ensure scale models look correct when placed next to each other. Model railway scales are standardized worldwide by many organizations and hobbyist groups. Some of the scales are recognized globally, while others are less widespread and, in many cases, virtually unknown outside their circle of origin. Scales may be expressed as a numeric ratio (e.g. 1/87 or 1:87) or as a letter defined in rail transport modelling standards (e.g. HO, OO, N, O, G, TT and Z.) The majority of commercial model railway equipment manufacturers base their offerings on Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen (NEM) or <b>National</b> <b>Model</b> Railroad Association (NMRA) standards in most popular scales.|$|E

40|$|Globalization is placing European {{societies}} {{under pressure}} to change. In the 1990 s, researchers identified particular <b>national</b> <b>models</b> of capitalism. These were argued to consist of integrated and reinforcing institutions that created specific {{rules of the game}} for economic actors. These rules favoured the development of globally competitive firms in particular sectors where the institutional characteristics of the home society facilitated the building of distinctive types of capabilities. In this view, a global division of labour was developing based on institutional differences. Thus, national policy makers needed to reinforce institutional advantage and institutional specialisation by incremental adaptations to globalization. Reforms needed to be consistent with the underlying model of capitalism. This paper challenges such a view. It argues that firms are highly innovative and use institutions not as constraints but as resources that enable them to build new capabilities. It further argues that institutions are more diverse, malleable and multi-levelled than the <b>national</b> <b>models</b> perspective recognizes. Thus, options for change are much broader than predicted by the path-dependent <b>national</b> <b>models</b> framework. Indeed, the main issue for European societies in response to globalization is to ensure diversity and experimentation rather than simply seeking to reproduce a dominant logic. ...|$|R
