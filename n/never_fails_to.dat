500|$|Many reviewers criticised Toadstool Tours use of camera, {{especially}} when the ball's presented route would ignore obstacles. GameSpot otherwise welcomed the game's visuals, however, arguing that the recurring Mario characters [...] "never looked better". IGN also lauded the graphics [...] present in the full motion video {{and the rest of}} the game, as well as Toadstool Tours audio. Matt Casamassina acknowledged the characters' voiced taunts, saying [...] "the muttering, complaining Waluigi, <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> bring a smile to our faces".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for About.com, Mark Edward Nero gave All I Want Is You three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and said Miguel [...] "somehow managed to vocally glide across each" [...] of the {{different}} styles he explored in music that was nonetheless rooted in R He deemed the record imperfect but devoid of a poor song. B. Wright from Vibe found the music inconsistent and [...] "schizophrenic" [...] but praised Miguel's singing and songwriting abilities while determining the record was [...] "worth the purchase price". In a three-and-a-half star review, Slant Magazines Matthew Cole said {{the second half of}} songs was [...] "less stimulating" [...] on an album that [...] "blends slick, radio-friendly R with Prince-aping theatrics, both refracted around a sense of humor that, surreal and sexually unsubtle, would have to make [...] proud". Cole also compared Miguel to singer Kelis, [...] "whose work has an undeniably commercial cunning to it, but who <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> imbue her pop confections with real personality".|$|E
500|$|In an {{otherwise}} positive review, Allan Hunter of Screendaily.com felt the film lacked [...] "nuanced characters or subtle dialogue", {{but said that}} nonetheless, the film was [...] "involving enough to forgive any infelicities". He also praised the acting and subject matter, prompting him to regard it as [...] "essential viewing on its home territory". Derek Elley of Film Business Asia found the film engrossing but unnecessarily complicated at times, writing, [...] "What keeps the viewer hooked are the performances." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a B minus grade, complimenting it as [...] "a scuzzy Filipino crime flick" [...] that was weakened by [...] "humdrum and occasionally heavy-handed police procedural". Andrew Schenker of Slant Magazine scored the film 2.5/4, saying, [...] "Even as the plot takes on increasingly convoluted turns, the movie <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> keep insisting upon the rottenness of every facet of Filipino society ... is far more successful when plunging us into one of its thrilling action set pieces." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|E

James Montgomery from MTV {{described it as}} a love-letter to the band's fans and a document of life on the road.

Karen Bliss of Noisecreep was impressed with the video and opened her review by writing, [...] "Thirty Seconds to Mars <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> impress with what they can do within the confines of a music video." [...] She believed that its simplicity turned out to be [...] "impactful, touching and uniting". Garon Cockrell from The Pratt Tribune gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "excellent". John Walker from MTV felt that throughout the fans' personal struggles [...] "music has helped these individuals persevere and continue to enjoy life. Likewise, Thirty Seconds to Mars seem so moved by the audience's emotions every time they perform live, 'Do or Die's concept seems to be that they want to return the favor." ...|$|E

But that's Beyoncé." [...] Daily Mail Marcus Barnes noted that Beyoncé [...] "dazzles", [...] "looked fab", and [...] "sparkled", later agreeing with Jay-Z's affirmation that Beyoncé is the [...] "second coming of Michael Jackson". Nekesa Mumbi Moody of ABC News wrote that though Beyoncé has nothing to prove at this point in her career, [...] "even queens need to show {{what it means to be}} royalty", making reference to her performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé. He added that the show was a [...] "dazzling rebuttal" [...] to all negative chatter revolving 4. Moody concluded, [...] "She put her track record up for display along with her new material with a subtle but undeniable message that she is not to be doubted, or counted against." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator began his review by writing that [...] "Beyonce <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> amaze." [...] He continued to praise her for [...] "raising the bar for live entertainment with a flawless display", further writing, [...] "The worldly pop icon's ability to bring new depth and texture to quality material is almost as impressive as her uncanny knack for connecting with the audience on an emotional level". Wass finished his review by making reference to Beyoncé performance of [...] "I Was Here" [...] – which lyrically revolves around leaving a mark on the world – by writing, [...] "But the pop veteran can sleep easy.

No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances.

AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character.

2500|$|Clayton and Bell were {{familiar}} with both ancient windows and with the various artistic movements of their time, such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Their work shows the influence, but not the dominance of either. It is, rather, an elegant synthesis of [...] archaeologically sourced [...] details, such as their characteristic brightly coloured canopies which are of a 14th-century-style, with figures who pay passing homage to the medieval in their sweeping robes of strong bright colours, a surety and refinement of the painted details and an excellence of design which <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> integrate the structural lines of the lead into the overall picture [...]|$|E
2500|$|Mariette Leslie Cotton (1866-1947) was {{a celebrated}} American artist who usually gave her name as Mrs. Leslie Cotton. [...] A student of William Merritt Chase, Carolus-Duran, and Jean-Jacques Henner , she worked mainly in Paris but also {{maintained}} studios in London and New York. [...] By birth and marriage she possessed {{a level of}} wealth and social prestige that, together with her artistic skill, enabled her to obtain lucrative commissions from prominent individuals. The portraits she painted were praised for their veracity, style, and fine technique. Their subjects included kings, aristocrats, celebrities, and members of wealthy families. Late in her career a critic wrote that her [...] "popularity has a sound basis, for her portraits combine such abstract artistic qualities as effective and infinitely varied design and daringly unconventional arrangements of color, with strong characterization and a likeness that <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> be convincing," [...] and added, [...] "her concern with the artistic problem never makes her obtrude her own personality or offend the sitter's susceptibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rating {{it three}} out of four stars, Steve Jones of USA Today commented. [...] "the singer is in a sexy, fun-loving mood [...] While she overdoes the between-song interludes here, she <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> get you to move. When it comes to burning up a dance floor, she is still Ms. Jackson." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms. Jackson luxuriates in textures as dizzying as a new infatuation," [...] commended the album as {{containing}} [...] "songs so baroquely sumptuous that they're virtually experimental." [...] Pareles added, [...] "Boudoir ballads undulate in torrid slow motion while Ms. Jackson moans like a phone-sex operator, and uptempo tunes hark back to disco, splice mock-operetta to hard rock or, in Better Days, conjure an easy-listening 1960's-pop apotheosis." [...] Her vocals were also praised, saying [...] "Countless overdubs of Ms. Jackson's voice turn her into an airborne choir; computer rhythms thump and sizzle." [...] He concluded saying the album [...] "isn't as immediately melodic as Ms. Jackson's previous albums, but it compensates for lost catchiness with unabashed strangeness." ...|$|E
