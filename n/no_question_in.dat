500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> my mind that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E
500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> my mind of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

[...] Cardinal Vincent Nichols {{said he did not}} think it a good paragraph, because the absence of the key words [...] "respect", [...] "welcome", and [...] "value" [...] meant it did not go far enough. He gave assurance that there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> the synod of endorsing the idea of same-sex marriage or of changing the Church's teaching on sexual morality.

[...] He concluded [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> my mind that Dark Cloud 2 {{is one of the}} most solid RPG adventures for the PS2; but what I am sure of is that it doesn't quite live up to its potential. If Level-5 had worked out all of the kinks, it'd be one of my favorite games for the PS2. Sadly, it's not.

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{relationships}} and her sexuality, Fox {{said that she}} has a general distrust and dislike of men, and that the perception of her as a [...] "wild and crazy sexpot" [...] is false because she is asocial and has only been sexually intimate with her [...] "childhood sweetheart" [...] and Brian Austin Green; she stated that she would rather stay at home instead of going out, and emphasized that she cannot have sex with someone she does not love. She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> my mind about being bisexual," [...] Fox stated. [...] "But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man." ...|$|E

Kramer was arrested dozens of times working with ACT UP, and the organization grew to hundreds of chapters in the US and Europe. Immunologist Anthony Fauci states [...] "ACT UP put medical treatment {{in the hands of the}} patients. And that is the way it ought to be... There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. In American medicine there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry. Playwright Tony Kushner offered his opinion of why Kramer fought so relentlessly: [...] "In a way, like a lot of Jewish men of Larry's generation, the Holocaust is a defining historical moment, and what happened in the early 1980s with AIDS felt, and was in fact, holocaustal to Larry." ...|$|E

Joseph Bonanno was initially infuriated at the book and refused to speak to Salvatore for a year.

Bonanno's book was published in 1983 as A Man of Honor: The Autobiography of Joseph Bonanno. The government seized the opportunity and questioned him about the Commission, hoping to prove its existence given that he spoke about it in his book.

2500|$|Justice Miller then posed three {{questions}} for the Court to answer: :"1. Did the State of Virginia ever give a consent to this proposition which became obligatory on her? [...] 2. Did the Congress give such consent as rendered the agreement valid? [...] 3. If both these are answered affirmatively, {{it may be necessary}} to inquire whether the circumstances alleged in this bill, authorized Virginia to withdraw her consent, and justify us in setting aside the contract, and restoring the two counties to that State." [...] Justice Miller then reviewed the various acts taken to reorganize the government of Virginia in 1861, and the various acts which the Reorganized Government and the United States took to create the state of West Virginia and extend its jurisdiction over the counties in question. In answering the first question, Miller wrote, [...] "Now, we have here, on two different occasions, the emphatic legislative proposition of Virginia that these counties might become part of West Virginia; and we have the constitution of West Virginia agreeing to accept them and providing for their place in the new-born State." [...] There was <b>no</b> <b>question,</b> <b>in</b> the mind of the majority, that Virginia had given its consent. Although the elections had been postponed due to a [...] "hostile" [...] environment, the majority concluded that the Reorganized Government of Virginia had acted in [...] "good faith" [...] to carry out its electoral duties in the two counties.|$|E
2500|$|Harbaugh stirred some intra-conference {{controversy}} in March 2007, {{when he was}} quoted as saying rival USC head coach [...] "Pete Carroll's only got one more year, though. He'll be there one more year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. The comment caused a rebuke from Carroll. (In fact, Carroll would be at USC for three more years.) At the Pacific-10 Conference media day on July 26, 2007, Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> my mind that USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football." [...] The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention. Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history. Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55–21 on November 14, 2009. Stanford's 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll's first November loss as USC head coach. Harbaugh never lost in USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E
