In 2010, the IFF adopted a FIFA-like continental qualification system, where teams must qualify to play at the world championships.

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Shakespeare may have used several mystery cycles as sources. Randall Martin, in his 2001 edition of the play for The Oxford Shakespeare notes the similarities between York's torture in Act 1, Scene 4 and the torture of Christ as depicted in The Buffeting and Scourging of Christ, Second Trial Before Pilate and Judgement of Jesus. He also suggests a debt of influence {{for the murder of}} Rutland in Act 1, Scene 3 from Slaughter of the Innocents. Emrys Jones further suggests that Shakespeare may have been influenced in York's death scene by Desiderius Erasmus' Tragicus Rex and Thomas More's Utopia (1516) and History of King Richard III (1518), from which some of Richard's soliloquy in Act 5, Scene 6 is taken, especially the references to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the actor.|$|E

500|$|Banks {{undertook}} {{a number of}} steps intended to facilitate the Reconstruction plans of President Lincoln in Louisiana. When Banks arrived in New Orleans, the atmosphere was somewhat hostile to the Union owing to some of Butler's actions. Banks moderated some of Butler's policies, freeing civilians that Butler had detained and reopening churches whose ministers refused to support the Union. He recruited large numbers of African-Americans for the military, and instituted formal works and education programs to organize the many slaves who had wandered from their plantations, believing they had been freed. Because Banks believed the plantation owners would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a role in Reconstruction, the work program was not particularly friendly to African Americans, requiring them to sign year-long work contracts, and subjecting vagrants to involuntary public work.

500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures."

Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade." ...|$|E
500|$|Headley is {{regarded}} by critics {{as one of}} the best batsmen from the Caribbean and one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley described Headley as [...] "the yardstick against whom all other West Indian batsmen are measured". In 1988, The Cricketer magazine placed him in an all-time West Indian team, as did a panel of judges for another such team in July 2010, while in 2004, another panel of experts named him among the top five West Indian players. He was given the nicknames [...] "the Black Bradman" [...] and [...] "Atlas" [...] by commentators, and was the first world-class batsman from the West Indies who was black. According to historian Gideon Haigh, his role was made harder by the weakness of his colleagues, as few outstanding players find it easy to play in teams which lose frequently. Although he was a naturally attacking player, Headley felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> cautiously owing to the way his team depended on him. C. L. R. James believed that no other great batsman had to carry such a burden for so long. In the years before the war, Headley scored 25.61% of the runs scored in Tests by West Indies, more than twice as many as the next best batsman, and two-thirds of the team's centuries, scoring ten of the team's first fourteen centuries in Test cricket. Headley usually batted at number three and as the opening batsmen were often dismissed quickly, he frequently began his innings early.|$|E

A Division 3 team <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a minimum of two WFTDA Sanctioned games against any opponents in order to maintain rankings. Division placement did not affect which playoffs a team qualified for, only minimum game play requirements. If a Division 2 or 3 team moved up the rankings into the top 40 at the time of tournament seeding that team would be invited to Division 1 Playoffs.
