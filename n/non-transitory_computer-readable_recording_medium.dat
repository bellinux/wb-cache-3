A system practicing the method generates transformed data using a discrete Fourier transform which samples a band-limited function f(x) without interpolating or modifying received data {{associated with the}} function f(x), wherein an interval between repeated copies in a periodic extension of the function f(x) obtained from the discrete Fourier transform {{is associated with a}} sampling ratio Q, defined as a ratio of a sampling frequency to a band-limited frequency, and wherein Q is assigned a value between 1 and 2 such that substantially no aliasing occurs in the transformed data, and retrieves a phase in the received data based on the transformed data, wherein the phase is used as feedback to an optical system...|$|R
40|$|A {{robotic system}} {{includes}} a tendon-driven finger and a control system. The system controls the finger via a force-based control law when a tension sensor is available, and via a position-based control law when a sensor is not available. Multiple tendons may {{each have a}} corresponding sensor. The system selectively injects a compliance value into the position-based control law when only some sensors are available. A control system includes a host machine and a <b>non-transitory</b> <b>computer-readable</b> medium having a control process, which is executed by the host machine to control the finger via the force- or position-based control law. A method for controlling the finger includes determining {{the availability of a}} tension sensor(s), and selectively controlling the finger, using the control system, via the force or position-based control law. The position control law allows the control system to resist disturbances while nominally maintaining the initial state of internal tendon tensions...|$|R
40|$|Disclosed herein are systems, methods, and <b>non-transitory</b> <b>computer-readable</b> {{storage media}} for {{progressive}} band selection for hyperspectral images. A system having module configured {{to control a}} processor to practice the method calculates a virtual dimensionality of a hyperspectral image having multiple bands to determine a quantity Q of how many bands are needed for a threshold level of information, ranks each band based on a statistical measure, selects Q bands from the multiple bands to generate a subset of bands based on the virtual dimensionality, and generates a reduced image based on the subset of bands. This approach can create reduced datasets of full hyperspectral images tailored for individual applications. The system uses a metric specific to a target application to rank the image bands, and then selects the most useful bands. The number of bands selected can be specified manually or calculated from the hyperspectral image's virtual dimensionality...|$|R
40|$|Disclosed herein are systems, methods, and <b>non-transitory</b> <b>computer-readable</b> {{storage media}} for radio phase retrieval. A system {{practicing}} the method gathers first data from radio waves {{associated with an}} object observed via a first aperture, gathers second data from radio waves associated with the object observed via an introduced second aperture associated with the first aperture, generates reduced noise data by incoherently subtracting the second data from the first data, and performs phase retrieval for the radio waves by modeling the reduced noise data using a single Fourier transform. The first and second apertures are at different positions, such as side by side. This approach can include determining a value Q which represents a ratio of wavelength times a focal ratio divided by pixel spacing. This information {{can be used to}} accurately measure and correct alignment errors or other optical system flaws in the apertures...|$|R

40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{provided}} for recording density {{changes in a}} flow field surrounding a moving object. A mask having an aperture for regulating the passage of images is {{placed in front of}} an image <b>recording</b> <b>medium.</b> An optical system is placed in front of the mask. A transition having a light field-of-view and a dark field-of-view is located beyond the test object. The optical system focuses an image of the transition at the mask such that the aperture causes a band of light to be defined on the image <b>recording</b> <b>medium.</b> The optical system further focuses an image of the object through the aperture of the mask so that the image of the object appears on the image <b>recording</b> <b>medium.</b> Relative motion is minimized between the mask and the transition. Relative motion is also minimized between the image <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> and the image of the object. In this way, the image of the object and density changes in a flow field surrounding the object are recorded on the image <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> when the object crosses the transition in front of the optical system...|$|R
