40|$|The {{transitional}} {{processes in}} shunt circuit of traction engines, which armatures and excitation windings are connected in <b>non-conducting</b> <b>direction</b> {{as to the}} flowing power current, are considered in this paper. The changes in the control circuits of braking switch and in the shunt power circuit of traction engines with additional mounting a resistor of 0. 5 Ohm are proposed. All this modernization will allow increasing greatly the operation reliability of power circuit of ЭР 2 Т and ЕПЛ 2 Т electric locomotives during their service life...|$|E
