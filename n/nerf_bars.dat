50|$|The {{most common}} types of <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> are: cab length step bars, wheel-to-wheel <b>nerf</b> <b>bars,</b> oval tube steps, sport tubes and single steps. The {{installation}} {{is common for}} all <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> and includes universal or model specific brackets. Brackets are attached either to rocker panels or bolt on directly to the frame of a vehicle. Some model specific brackets for <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> do not require drilling and use existing mounting holes {{in the frame of}} a vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|The term is {{sometimes}} {{applied to the}} foot-rests on a motorcycle. <b>Nerf</b> <b>bars</b> are typically made from either stainless steel, chrome or powder-coated steel, although there are considerable variations in style and design. For motorcycle tank/engine protection systems on dual sport motorcycles, the term [...] "P.D. Nerf" [...] was invented by Happy Trails Products for the Kawasaki KLR 650. On quad bikes <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> are used to help stop the wheels of two machines becoming entangled.|$|E
50|$|These spray-on {{polyurethane}} coatings are {{not just}} for truck bedliners. They also protect fenders, bumpers, floor boards, <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> and trim. In fact, whole vehicles have been sprayed. The same polyurethane spray {{can be applied to}} emergency vehicles, commercial transport, heavy construction, agriculture equipment and boats.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>nerf</b> <b>bar</b> is a tubular {{device fitted}} {{to the side}} of a racecar, {{typically}} single-seat race cars that compete on asphalt or dirt oval tracks. A [...] "nerf" [...] is a small, sometimes intentional, collision between two cars in which one driver bumps the other to facilitate a successful pass. The <b>nerf</b> <b>bar</b> protects the sides of the vehicles and also keeps their tires from becoming entangled. If fast-spinning tires come in contact with each other, {{one or both of the}} cars may lose control or even become airborne. These are commonly used on Modifieds such as used in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series, and the wheel pods behind the rear wheels on a Dallara DW12 INDYCAR is often nicknamed the <b>nerf</b> <b>bar</b> because of the similar purpose.|$|R
50|$|A more {{commercial}} {{application of}} the nerf bar is for convenience purposes on a pickup truck or sport utility vehicle. It may act as a step to ease entry and exit from the vehicle, or to help prevent damage to the vehicle when crossing rocks off-road. <b>Nerf</b> <b>bars</b> {{can also be used}} to double as side bull bars on off-road vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|A Truck {{accessory}} is an aftermarket {{part that}} is used to enhance the style or function of the original OEM pickup truck. Truck accessories are differentiated from other parts, typically referred to as [...] "hard parts" [...] or [...] "cores" [...] that include distributors, water pumps, radiators and the like. Some of the more popular accessories for light-duty trucks include tubular products such as <b>nerf</b> <b>bars,</b> grille guards, tonneau covers, truck tool boxes, autocarts, hard top and bed extenders.|$|E
50|$|The hot rod {{world will}} {{sometimes}} use {{a much smaller}} version of a racing nerf bar. It may be only about 6 inches tall and utilized {{in the front and}} rear of a hot rod in place of the traditional bumper. The hot rod nerf bar is attached {{to the ends of the}} frame rails and typically chromed. Hot rod <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> provide little protection and typically do not qualify as a bumper in most states.|$|E
50|$|Typically if {{they are}} being used to slide over rocks and past trees they are built with thicker tubing and {{attached}} directly to the truck's frame rails rather than the body. Being attached to the frame can allow them to support the entire weight of the vehicle and even be used as a jack point to change a tire. They are not called <b>Nerf</b> <b>Bars</b> any more and instead are called Sliders, Rock Bars, or another variation of the two.|$|E
5000|$|On February 14, 2006, Bailey rode again. Riding a new Honda CRF450R, {{outfitted}} with <b>nerf</b> <b>bars,</b> hand brakes, and a seat {{to hold him}} in place, Bailey completed several laps of the track in Lake Elsinore, CA. On his very first attempt to ride in 19 years, as a paraplegic, Bailey circulated the track with his son Sean. Bailey himself said, [...] "If I could stick my leg out, I think I could go as fast as I used to!" [...] He has {{expressed a desire to}} do more of this in the future.|$|E
5000|$|Truck {{accessories}} {{to change}} {{the look of the}} vehicles did not become popular until the 1990s. Products in this industry include performance and racing components, cosmetic and functional accessories, wheels and tires, mobile electronics, safety products, restoration parts, handling equipment, drivetrain parts, grille guards, bumper replacements, steps, <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> and more. Previously, domestic U.S. manufacturers including General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, and American Motors considered their light-duty trucks (Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, and Jeep) as work vehicles and often did little to accommodate appearance accessories. Aftermarket suppliers were often focused on specialty work-enhancing accessories such as snowplows, spreaders, and lift gates.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the market}} {{segments}} expanded as manufacturers offered {{a wide variety}} of pick-up truck types and sizes. With the dawn of the extended cab, trucks began taking on a more urban appeal and were being purchased for their style as well as their utility. This new audience of truck owner began to demand more than a simple tool box to adorn their trucks. They began developing an appetite for accessories that would complement the look of their truck and manufacturers began to accommodate their desires with products like billet grilles, chrome fender trim, <b>nerf</b> <b>bars</b> and hood deflectors. In addition, truck manufacturers began collaborating with and designing their vehicles to easily accommodate these accessories with bolt-on ease.|$|E
5000|$|The '29's {{body was}} given a '27 Ford {{roadster}} back section. The stock fenders were reshaped, [...] "peaked and bobbed using half-inch round rod". A new grille shell was fabricated from steel and filled with clear plastic tubing; it {{was given a}} forward rake. A three-piece hood was made created from aluminum, while louvered steel splash aprons were mounted. The bed was scratchbuilt from steel, with candy gold inserts(found by Barris at a hardware store) and chrome strips. The quadruple headlights, vertically stacked in pairs, were from a '57 Chrysler. The front bumper {{was a pair of}} <b>nerf</b> <b>bars.</b> Taillights were '56 DeSoto lenses in '58 Impala bezels, protected by hairpins. Painted overall in Swedish White Pearl with candy gold scallops, striping was done by master pinstriper Dean Jeffries (early in his career).|$|E
50|$|The Traxxas Slash was {{introduced}} in 2008 and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though {{not as high as}} the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3 inch (diameter) x 1.7 inch (width) all-terrain style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0 inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex. Out-of-the-box this car features a TITAN 12 turn motor. The 2.2/3.0 design was to clear the slayers revo-spec pillow ball suspension components, Traxxas high current battery connectors, metal transmission gears, new waterproof XL-5 ESC, Waterproof 2075 steering servo, 4 channel micro receiver, sealed water tight receiver box, adjustable camber links, rubber sealed ball bearings, <b>nerf</b> <b>bars,</b> hex hardware, light duty drive shaft yokes, new battery hold-downs, short-course truck style bumpers, progressive rate springs, and a wide short course truck style body that encompasses the tires are some of its features. The claimed top speed is about 20+MPH.|$|E
5000|$|Released in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a {{four-wheel drive}} one tenth scale short-course {{electric}} race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato {{was introduced in}} 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and axle carriers, otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length double wishbone suspension with four oil filled coilover shocks and progressive rate springs in staggered lengths ("long" [...] up front; [...] "XXlong" [...] in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same [...] "Velineon 3500" [...] 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and [...] "Velineon VXL-3S" [...] non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the M4 layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper clutch, the main one piece hollow aluminum drive shaft. The drive shaft sends power {{to the front and}} rear viscous limited slip differentials, which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping half shafts. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, <b>nerf</b> <b>bars,</b> and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A tires with white lettering, 2.2 inch satin chrome beadlock style [...] "SCT" [...] wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque steering servo, Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and hex hardware used throughout. With the stock motor/ESC combo the claimed top speed is 35 to 65+MPH depending on the battery and gearing used. Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct [...] "drop in" [...] replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.|$|E
