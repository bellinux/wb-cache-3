The {{principal}} {{incident of}} the foregoing [...] Chapter was suggested by an occurrence of a similar kind, told me by [...] a gentleman, now deceased, who held an important situation in the [...] Excise, {{to which he had}} been raised by active and resolute exertions [...] in an inferior department. When employed as a supervisor on the [...] coast of Galloway, {{at a time when the}} immunities of the Isle of Man [...] rendered smuggling almost universal in that district, this gentleman [...] had the fortune to offend highly several of the leaders in the [...] contraband trade, by his zeal in serving the revenue.|$|E
6000|$|<b>NOTE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>CHAPTER</b> VII. I DO {{not know}} that any attempt has yet been made in English fiction to draw the {{character}} of a [...] "Deaf Mute," [...] simply and exactly after nature--or, in other words, to exhibit the peculiar effects produced by the loss of the senses of hearing and speaking on the disposition of the person so afflicted. The famous Fenella, in Scott's [...] "Peveril of the Peak," [...] only assumes deafness and dumbness; and the whole family of dumb people on the stage have the remarkable faculty--so far as my experience goes--of always being able to hear what is said to them. When the idea first occurred to me of representing {{the character of a}} [...] "Deaf Mute" [...] as literally as possible according to nature, I found the difficulty of getting at tangible and reliable materials to work from, much greater than I had anticipated; so much greater, indeed, that I believe my design must have been abandoned, if a lucky chance had not thrown in my way Dr. Kitto's delightful little book, [...] "The Lost Senses." [...] In the first division of that work, which contains the author's interesting and touching narrative of his own sensations under the total loss of the sense of hearing, and its consequent effect on the faculties of speech, will be found my authority for most of those traits in Madonna's character which are especially and immediately connected with the deprivation from which she is represented as suffering. The moral purpose to be answered by the introduction of such a personage as this, and of the kindred character of the Painter's Wife, lies, I would fain hope, so plainly on the surface, that it can be hardly necessary for me to indicate it even to the most careless reader. I know of nothing which more firmly supports our faith in the better parts of human nature, than to see--as we all may--with what patience and cheerfulness the heavier bodily afflictions of humanity are borne, for the most part, by those afflicted; and also to note what elements of kindness and gentleness the spectacle of these afflictions constantly develops in the persons of the little circle by which the sufferer is surrounded. Here is the ever bright side, the ever noble and consoling aspect of all human calamity and the object of presenting this to the view of others, as truly and as tenderly as in him lies, {{seems to me to be}} a fit object for any writer who desires to address himself to the best sympathies of his readers.|$|E

40|$|When Joan Digby first {{proposed}} taking collegiate honors students into our national parks, I {{jumped at the}} chance. Within minutes of reading her email, I not only responded with an enthusiastic “Yes!” but {{went so far as}} to volunteer the resources of the Southern Utah University Honors Program to get things started. Nestled among 5 national parks in southwestern Utah, I felt our campus would be a natural focal point for the kind of program Joan envisioned. Within weeks we had laid the groundwork for a proof-of-concept pilot project at nearby Bryce Canyon National Park. Little did I know at the time, but I was taking the first steps on a nationwide journey that would introduce me to 11 amazing national parks, some 47 park rangers, and over 100 outstanding college students—with the prospect of these numbers growing annually. The aim of Partners in the Parks (PITP) from its inception has been to introduce, or reintroduce, collegiate honors students to this country: not the transformed environment that we have constructed on its surface but the bedrock world upon which it rests. Like de Toqueville, Jefferson, Thoreau, Emerson, and so many others, we recognized that the unique place that is America cannot be separated from the land upon which it was built. One valuable way to study and understand it, then, is to visit places where the bones of America lie exposed, often without the veneer of civilization, cultivation, or modernization: places protected by the people to preserve for this and future generations, original American landscapes, and important historical landmarks that illustrate and define what America was, is, and can be. PITP takes students deep into America’s national parks. PITP is a see-America-first program. While we recognize the importance of a global perspective in an overall honors education, our goal is to help students see and understand America before or in addition to going abroad. Indeed, for students without the desire or resources to leave the country, PITP offers many of the same kinds of personal development that make study abroad so valuable. In the Field <b>Notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Chapter</b> 2, “Growing from Within,” Bill Atwill and Kathleen King, share their experience in Acadia National Park, observing how their students demonstrated valuable growth in the same four key areas that researchers of study abroad programs have identified in their alumni: personal discovery, academic commitment, cultural development, and career development. The student writings in this volume, such as Andy Grube’s “soul expanding” talk with Juste Gatari on the rocky coast of Mount Desert Island, aptly illustrate this important facet of the PITP experience.

40|$|The {{second edition}} of Religious Liberty in a Pluralistic Society offers the same {{structure}} and thorough {{coverage of the}} law of religious liberty as the first edition, along with a new conceptual framework for approaching the religious liberty jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. The first four chapters offer a history of law and religion in the United States that extends from the framing of the Constitution to the early 1920 s. Chapters Six through Thirteen examine the statute and case law governing religious liberty {{in a variety of settings}} and areas of law, including education, the workplace, tax, the courtroom, property, and the corporate boardroom. The few pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court in each of these areas serve as the anchors for thorough examination {{of the law of}} religious liberty in the state and lower federal courts. Ariens and Destro have reorganized Chapter Five, which examines the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to craft a constitutional law of religious liberty since the 1940 s.

In his later works List combined the cyclical concept of time with the [...] "dualistic and linear time scheme" [...] of western apocalyptic which counterposes a pessimism about the present world with an ultimate optimism regarding the future one. In Das Geheimnis der Runen, List addresses the seeming contradiction by explaining the final redemption of the linear time frame as an exoteric parable which stands for the esoteric truth of renewal in many future cycles and incarnations. However, in the original Norse myths and Hinduism, the cycle of destruction and creation is repeated indefinitely, thus offering no possibility of ultimate salvation (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 79; 239, <b>note</b> 14 <b>to</b> <b>Chapter</b> 9).|$|R

60|$|In the {{beginning}} of the last chapter I stated the principles on which the map is coloured. There only remains to be said, that it is an exact copy of one by M. C. Gressier, published by the Depot General de la Marine, in 1835. The names have been altered into English, and the longitude has been reduced to that of Greenwich. The colours were first laid down on accurate charts, on a large scale. The data, on which the volcanoes historically known to have been in action, have been marked with vermillion, were given in a <b>note</b> <b>to</b> the last <b>chapter.</b> I will commence my description on {{the eastern side of the}} map, and will describe each group of islands consecutively, proceeding westward across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but ending with the West Indies.|$|R
40|$|When {{we begin}} {{the task of}} telling time in the Fourth Gospel, we bring {{something}} not found in any previous study, namely, a model of time articulated by cross- ultural anthropologists (Bordieu, in Pitt-Rivers 1963 : 55 - 72, Ayoade, in Wright 1984 : 71 - 89). As much as we admire Davies’ study, she has no <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> her <b>chapter</b> on time nor any citations in her bibliography to indicate that she has any conversation partners, much less cultural experts, a deficit to be filled in this study. Learning to tell time entails three theoretical considerations: a definition of time, key classifications of it, and special attention to what the ancients meant by past, present and future. With these lenses {{we are prepared to}} do as thorough a study as we can on telling time in the Fourth Gospel. As we consider each classification, we will suggest a brief meaning of it from the experts on time, then present a body of Greco-Roman materials illustrative of the classification, and finally use it to gather and interpret data in John. Proving the native existence of these classifications for telling time in antiquity is essential for readers to have a background against which to compare their usage with that of the Fourth Gospel...|$|R
40|$|I {{apologize}} to the mathematical community that {{it took so long}} until this book is made available to a greater audience. Originally I planned to extend the material and present, jointly with Jochen Brüning, a larger treatise on geometric analysis. Although this idea is not given up completely, it is a long term project and so I decided to publish this Habilitationsschrift more or less as it is. I made some minor changes due to the suggestions of the referees, I tried to smooth a bit the terrible first English version (in summer 1993 I had to translate the original German manuscript within a few weeks), and I added a summary and some bibliographic <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> each <b>chapter.</b> Still, the reader can hardly overlook that English is not my mother tongue and I apologize in advance for the certainly remaining lingual errors. The reader should be familiar with basic functional analysis and the analysis of elliptic operators on compact manifolds. I also assume some familiarity with the asymptotic analysis of the heat trace. The book consists of five chapters. Although the chapters are not completely independent and I suggest to read the book linearly, the book can be divided into tw...|$|R

To the {{thousand}} islands, {{or how many}} soever they may be, we shall allow ourselves to be wafted with all willingness, but not in Lord Lindsay's three-masted vessel, with its balancing topmasts of Sense, Intellect, and Spirit. We are utterly tired of the triplicity; and we are mistaken if its application here be not as inconsistent as it is arbitrary. Turning back to the introduction, which we have quoted, the reader will find that while Architecture is there taken for the exponent of Sense, Painting is chosen as the peculiar expression of Spirit. [...] "The painting of Christendom is that of an immortal spirit conversing with its God."

Moreover, as a researcher of undergraduate writing, a postgraduate writer, and a teacher of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) this book ticks all boxes for me. I imagine that every reader of this journal will have some interest in academic writing, even if only as a reader and writer of research articles. This comprehensive volume covers a range of disciplines (e. g. Biology, Economics, History), examines highly specific genres (e. g. the PhD literature review, undergraduate discursive essays) and expands our knowledge of specific features of writing (e. g. restrictive adverbs, engagement features, conjunctive ties) ...|$|R
