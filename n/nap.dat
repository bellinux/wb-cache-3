5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (<b>NAP),</b> British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and <b>NAP.</b> Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than <b>NAP.</b>|$|E

Thirty B-52Gs were further modified to carry up to 12 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles each, while 12 B-52Gs were fitted to carry the AGM-142 Have <b>Nap</b> stand-off air-to-ground missile.

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} a gradual decline in {{participation}} in the nutrition assistance program.

40|$|Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Background: The {{relationships}} among <b>napping</b> and sleep quality, fatigue, {{and quality of}} life (QOL) in cancer patients are not clearly understood. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether daytime <b>napping</b> is associated with nighttime sleep, fatigue, and QOL in cancer patients. Methods: In total, 187 cancer patients were recruited. Daytime <b>napping,</b> nighttime self-reported sleep, fatigue, and QOL were assessed using a questionnaire. Objective sleep parameters were collected using a wrist actigraph. Results: According to waking-after-sleep-onset measurements, patients who <b>napped</b> during the day experienced poorer nighttime sleep than did patients who did not (t = - 2. 44, P =. 02). Daytime <b>napping</b> duration was significantly negatively correlated with QOL. Patients who <b>napped</b> after 4 PM had poorer sleep quality (t = - 1. 93, P =. 05) and a poorer Short-Form Health Survey mental component score (t = 2. 06, P =. 04) than did patients who did not. Fatigue, daytime <b>napping</b> duration, and sleep quality were significant predictors of the mental component score and physical component score, accounting for 45. 7 % and 39. 3 % of the variance, respectively. Conclusions: Daytime <b>napping</b> duration was negatively associated with QOL. <b>Napping</b> should be avoided after 4 PM. Implications for Practice: Daytime <b>napping</b> affects the QOL of cancer patients. Future research can determine the role of <b>napping</b> in the sleep hygiene of cancer patients.

40|$|Purpose: Short nocturnal sleep {{leads to}} more <b>napping</b> in adolescents, and more <b>napping</b> leads to short nocturnal sleep.

40|$|Upon {{completion}} of mitosis, daughter nuclei assemble {{all of the}} organelles necessary {{for the implementation of}} nuclear functions. We found that upon entry into daughter nuclei, snRNPs and SR proteins do not immediately colocalize in nuclear speckles. SR proteins accumulated in patches around active nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) that we refer to as NOR-associated patches (<b>NAPs),</b> whereas snRNPs were enriched at other nuclear regions. <b>NAPs</b> formed transiently, persisting for 15 - 20 min before dissipating as nuclear speckles began to form in G 1. In the absence of RNA polymerase II transcription, <b>NAPs</b> increased in size and persisted for at least 2 h, with delayed localization of SR proteins to nuclear speckles. In addition, SR proteins in <b>NAPs</b> are hypophosphorylated, and the SR protein kinase Clk/STY colocalizes with SR proteins in <b>NAPs,</b> suggesting that phosphorylation releases SR proteins from <b>NAPs</b> and their initial target is transcription sites.
