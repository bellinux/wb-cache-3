There are less than 9 dorsal crossbands and the legs are heavily spotted with turquoise ocelli. There are 85-100003 scale rows at midbody. A single distinct blue scale row stretches from the lower angle of the eye to the upper edge of the ear. Its throat is light with dark spots forming a reticulated pattern. Like all members of the prasinus-group, with 22-23 more or less symmetrical blue rings, the tail is prehensile and about 1.95 times as long as the snout-vent length (SVL). Male blue-spotted monitors reach a larger maximum size than female blue-spotted monitors, and they can be distinguished by the comparatively broader temporal region and distinct hemipenal bulges posterolateral to the cloaca. Adult male blue-spotted monitors may reach 3.5 ft in total length, and female blue-spotted monitors are about 4 in shorter than the male blue-spotted monitors, making V. macraei the largest known species of the V. prasinus complex.|$|E

During the breeding season, the male has a white forehead, a blackish bar followed by a narrow white bar on the forecrown, whereas {{the rest of the}} crown is brown with sandy tips to the feathers. A black stripe - separated from the crown by a white supercillary stripe - runs from the bill through the eye and extends {{to the side of the}} <b>neck</b> <b>forming</b> a collar across the upper mantle. The mantle is dark grey-brown, the other upperparts are sooty brown with feathers having sandy rufous margins. The face, the chin and the upper throat are white and the rest of the underparts are yellowish, the belly is pale. Kittlitz’s Plover has blackish central tail feathers that get continuously lighter towards the side of the tail; the outer one or two pairs are completely white. The female plumage is similar to the male’s, only the black band across the forecrown is narrower. The non-breeding plumage does not differ much from the breeding one, the eye stripe is browner, the frontal bar is missing and the underparts are a lot paler. In general, adult wing length lies between 100-110 mm, adult bill length between 15-23 mm and adult tarsus length between 26-33 mm. Juvenile Kittlitz’s plovers appear similar to adults, however the black face marks are lacking, the upperparts are brown, the hindneck collar is buff and the underparts are white.|$|E
40|$|Clathrin-mediated vesicle {{recycling}} in synapses {{is maintained}} by a {{unique set of}} endocytic proteins and interactions. We show that endophilin localizes in the vesicle pool at rest and in spirals at the necks of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) during activity in lamprey synapses. Endophilin and dynamin colocalize {{at the base of the}} clathrin coat. Protein spirals composed of these proteins on lipid tubes in vitro have a pitch similar to the one observed at necks of CCPs in living synapses, and lipid tubules are thinner than those formed by dynamin alone. Tubulation efficiency and the amount of dynamin recruited to lipid tubes are dramatically increased in the presence of endophilin. Blocking the interactions of the endophilin SH 3 domain in situ reduces dynamin accumulation at the neck and prevents the formation of elongated necks observed in the presence of GTPγS. Therefore, endophilin recruits dynamin to a restricted part of the CCP <b>neck,</b> <b>forming</b> a complex, which promotes budding of new synaptic vesicles...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model to {{describe}} the sintering kinetics of polydispersed glass particles, having no adjustable pa-rameter. The model is based on three sintering stages: a pure ‘Frenkel ’ (F) first step, a mixed ‘Frenkel/Mackenzie– Shuttleworth ’ stage, and a third, pure ‘Mackenzie–Shuttleworth ’ (MS) step. The model considers sample shrinkage as {{the sum of the}} partial shrinkage of several clusters, each consisting of equally sized particles and each showing inde-pendent F or MS behavior. The overall set of clusters mimics the specimen’s real particle size distribution. We then introduce the concept of <b>neck</b> <b>forming</b> ability – nr, which allows the formation of necks among particles of dierent sizes, relaxing the clustering condition. Using experimental physical parameters: particle size distribution, viscosity, surface energy, and the theoretical nr, the model describes well the sintering kinetics of an alumino-borosilicate glass powder having polydispersed, irregular shaped particles in a variety of temperatures. The sintering kinetics of the real powder is slower, but not far from the calculated kinetics of a monodispersed distribution containing only particles of average size. Thus the model provides a tool for estimating the sintering kinetics of real glass powders, for any siz...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{deposition}} of the polysaccharide chitin in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall is temporally and spatially regulated. Chitin synthase III (Chs 3 p) synthesizes {{a ring of}} chitin {{at the onset of}} bud emergence, marking the base of the incipient bud. At the end of mitosis, chitin synthase II (Chs 2 p) deposits a disk of chitin in the mother-bud <b>neck,</b> <b>forming</b> the primary division septum. Using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, we have found that these two integral membrane proteins localize to the mother-bud neck at distinct times during the cell cycle. Chs 2 p is found at the neck at the end of mitosis, whereas Chs 3 p localizes to a ring on the surface of cells about to undergo bud emergence and in the mother-bud neck of small-budded cells. Cell synchronization and pulsechase experiments suggest that the timing of Chs 2 p localization results from cell cycle-specific synthesis coupled to rapid degradation. Chs 2 p degradation depends on the vacuolar protease encoded by PEP 4, indicating that Chs 2 p is destroyed in the vacuole. Temperature-sensitive mutations that block either the late secretory pathway (secl- 1) or the internalization step of endocytosis (end 4 - 1) also prevent Chs 2 p degradation. In contrast, Chs 3 p is synthesized constitutively and is metabolically stable, indicating that Chs 2 p and Chs 3 p are subject to different modes of regulation. Differential centrifugation experiments show that a significant proportion of Chs 3 p resides in an internal compartment that may correspond to a vesicular species calle...|$|E
40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión pre-print. Yeast cells {{normally}} grow by budding, {{but under}} certain specific conditions {{they are also}} able to grow in hyperpolarized forms reminiscent of hyphal growth. During vegetative growth, the synthesis of the septum that physically separates yeast cells during cytokinesis depends on the correct assembly of the septin ring. Septins and actin patches are assembled at the <b>neck,</b> <b>forming</b> two concentric rings where the actin patch ring occupies the external-most part. This specific positioning defines a plasma membrane region at the neck from which other lateral membrane compartments are excluded. In this scenario, correct assembly of the chitin ring {{is dependent on the}} anchoring of Chs 3 to the septin ring through Chs 4. The anchoring of Chs 3 to septins through Chs 4 prevents the arrival of this protein at endocytic sites, thus reducing the endocytosis of Chs 3. This allows an equilibrium to be set up between the antero- and retrograde transport of Chs 3, facilitating the synthesis of the chitin ring at the neck. In contrast, hyperpolarized growth is characterized by a reduced endocytic turnover of Chs 3, which in turn lead to the accumulation of Chs 3 at the plasma membrane and a concomitant increase in chitin synthesis. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: The {{island of}} Stromboli {{represents}} he emergent {{part of a}} 2. 6 km high composite volcano. The evolution ofthis summit zone is characterized bya complex dyke pattern and repeated collapses. Three summit collapses and one southeastward minor lateral collapse occurred between 85 and 21 kaBP. From 13 ka to a few thousand years ago, three large lateral collapses occurred northwestwards. During the last 100 ka of volcanic history, which is reconstructed {{on the basis of}} data derived from the emergent part of the cone, the majority of dykes have been injected along a NE-SW zone of weakness which cuts the summit of the volcano. In {{the southern part of the}} island a N-S dyke zone connected, for a short period, the main Stromboli conduit to an off-shore crater. Another dyke zone developed after 13 ka BP along the walls of the earliest lateral collapse which occurred towards the NW at around this time. Dykes are vertical, especially ong the NE-trending weak zone, whereas theother more external dykes tend to parallel the cone slopes and the collapse depression. Cumulative dyke thicknesses have a NW-SE horizontal maximum. Dyking along the NE-SW weak zone may have exerted a geometric control and provided a trigger for the NW-SE lateral collapse event. In turn the more external dyking was extremely sensitive o the local ~r 3 induced by debuttressing, in the case of injection planes parallel to the lateral collapse escarpments, andby the gross volcano morphology, in the case of dykes which parallel the cone slopes. The island of Stromboli and two other volcanic centres constitute a large, 2. 6 km high, volcanic complex at the NE tip of the Aeolian archipe-lago (Fig. 1). The Stromboli volcano constitutes the island of that name; Strombolicchio is a volcanic <b>neck</b> <b>forming</b> a small island to the north east; and Cavoni is a submerged centre identified on the basis of marine geophysical data (Gabbianelli et al. 1993) to the south.
