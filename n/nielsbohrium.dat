5|$|There was {{an element}} naming {{controversy}} {{as to what}} the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the IUPAC adopted unnilseptium (symbol Uns) as a temporary, systematic element name for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium, not <b>nielsbohrium,</b> since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions, bohrate and borate. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name bohrium, and thus the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. It was subsequently decided that oxyanions of bohrium should be called bohriates to avoid confusion.|$|E

(The name <b>nielsbohrium</b> for element 107 was transformed to bohrium to conform with the practice set by all then-named elements.) This recommendation paper was generally met with criticism from the American scientists: their recommendations were scrambled (the names rutherfordium and hahnium, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were used for elements 106 and 108, respectively); both elements 104 and 105 were given names suggested by the Russian team despite earlier recognition of the Berkeley team as of an equal co-discoverer; and especially because the name seaborgium for element 106 was rejected for honoring a living person, a rule that had only just been approved.

After a short description of the structure of these nuclei with the conclusion that they decay mainly by #alpha#-decay and spontaneous fission is suppressed, the experimental techniques for studying heavy ion fusion reactions by means of the SHIP spectrometer at the GSI Darmstadt are described. Finally the search for the element 110 is briefly considered.
