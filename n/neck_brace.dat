5000|$|Protective gear cannot provide {{immunity}} against injuries. For example, concussions {{can still}} occur despite {{the use of}} helmets, and spinal injuries can still occur {{with the use of}} spinal padding and <b>neck</b> <b>braces.</b> [...] The use of high-tech protective gear can result in a revenge effect, whereupon some cyclists feel safe taking dangerous risks. Because the key determinant of injury risk is kinetic energy, and because kinetic energy increases with the square of speed, effectively each doubling of speed quadruples the injury risk. Higher speeds of travel also add danger due to reaction time. Because higher speeds mean that the rider travels further during his/her reaction time, this leaves less travel distance within which to react safely. This, in turn, further multiplies the risk of an injurious crash.|$|R

40|$|Background: Rugby Union is {{a popular}} contact sport played worldwide. The {{physical}} demands of the game are characterized by short duration, high intensity bouts of activity, with collisions between players, often while running fast. The head, neck, upper limb and lower limb are common sites for injury. Although catastrophic injuries are rare in rugby, they do occur. Immediate action (4 -hour window) must occur after the injury to minimise the damage incurred from a catastrophic injury. This infers that a well-functioning medical infrastructure {{should be available to}} anticipate injuries of this nature and provide treatment for the best possible outcome. Currently there is no system information/map in South Africa describing the medical infrastructure in relation to places where clubs and schools practice and play matches. Such a system may assist providing early and immediate transfer of injured players to the appropriate treatment facility. This would minimise the damaging effects caused by delays in medical treatment. Therefore the aim of this study was to; (i) investigate and report on the location, distance and travel time from rugby playing/training venues in the Eastern Cape to the nearest specialist hospital where a player may be able to receive adequate treatment for a catastrophic injury, and ii) report on safety equipment available at these playing venues to facilitate this transport in a safe manner. Methods: All the clubs (n= 403) and schools (n = 264) that played rugby in the Eastern Cape were accounted for in the study. However, only 15 clubs and 35 schools were included in the analysis as they had their own facilities for training and playing matches. Distances between clubs/schools and the nearest public, private and specialized hospital (able to treat catastrophic injuries) were measured. In addition driving time was also estimated between the clubs/schools and nearest specialized hospital to determine if an injured player could be transported within four hours to receive medical treatment for a catastrophic injury. In addition medical safety equipment was audited (according to information provided by SA RUGBY)) for each club and school to identify if they were meeting the minimum safety standards as set by SA RUGBY. Results: Twenty schools were identified as being less than one hour away from the nearest hospital equipped to deal with catastrophic rugby injuries; nine schools were between 1 - 2 hours away and six schools were between 2 - 3 hours away. All schools were within 100 km driving distance of the nearest public hospital; 28 schools were within 100 km driving distance to the nearest private hospital. For seven schools, the nearest private hospital was between 100 and 150 km away. Fourteen schools had spinal boards, eleven had <b>neck</b> <b>braces,</b> ten had harnesses, nine had change rooms, five had floodlights, and twenty-two had trained first aiders. Six schools were located 2 - 3 hours away and were at higher risk {{due to a lack of}} first aid equipment. Ten clubs were less than an hour away from the nearest hospital equipped to treat catastrophic injuries; two clubs were between 1 - 2 hours away, two were between 2 - 3 hours away and one was between 3 - 4 hours away. All clubs were within 100 km driving distance of the nearest public hospital. Nine clubs were within 100 km driving distance to the nearest private hospital, three clubs were based between 100 and 150 km from the nearest private hospital and three were based over 150 km away from the nearest private hospital. Twelve clubs had a spinal board, eleven clubs had <b>neck</b> <b>braces,</b> ten clubs had harnesses, ten clubs had change rooms, seven clubs had floodlights and twelve clubs had first aid trainers. One club was classified as high risk as it was located 2 - 3 hours away from the nearest hospital equipped to manage a catastrophic injury and had no first aid equipment. Discussion/Conclusion: No clubs or schools included in the study were more than four hours away from a hospital that was equipped to deal with a catastrophic rugby injury. Therefore, any player who suffers a catastrophic injury should be able to get to treatment within the 4 -hour window period. Another finding was that not all clubs or schools possessed the minimum equipment required to host training or a rugby match. SA RUGBY can take appropriate action towards these clubs and schools to ensure that they maintain the safest possible practice to not put their own players at increased risk...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), became concerned that some suppliers were improperly billing Medicare for items that attach to wheelchairs and other equipment. Some suppliers were billing for such items using codes for orthodic devices, including arm, back, and <b>neck</b> <b>braces</b> that provide support for or immobilize weak or injured limbs, while others were billing using codes for durable medical equipment, which includes equipment such as wheelchairs and crutches that can withstand repeated use and is appropriate for home use. Whether an item is billed as an orthotic or DME device can affect whether such claims are paid. To clarify Medicare's payment policy on orthotics, HCFA issued a ruling stating that Medicare considered such items to be durable medical equipment rather than orthotics. HCFA issued Ruling 96 - 1 to clarify {{the circumstances under which}} certain items would be classified as orthotics or as DME for Medicare part B payment purposes. A federal appellate court found that HFCA had followed appropriate procedures to issue the rule as an interpretation of Medicare policy, the interpretation in the ruling was wholly supportable, and the treating of seating systems as DME was consistent with congressional intent. HCFA's ruling that attached bracing devices were in the DME benefits category and could no longer be billed as orthotics affects beneficiaries residing in Medicare-certified skilled nursing facilities and other institutions primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care (SNF). Because Medicare part B does not cover DME in SNFs and other institutions primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care, claims for such items are no longer paid for residents in nursing homes. This ruling affects residents of all nursing homes, not just SNFs. If HCFA's ruling were rescinded and Medicare's policy changed so that attached bracing devices were classified as orthotics, how much Medicare and Medicaid would spend for orthotics is uncertain. The increase in Medicare spending would depend on how extensively attached bracing devices would be provided to nursing home residents following the ruling's recission. The distinction between DME and orthotics would become less clear, which could lead to inappropriate billing. Therefore, if the ruling were rescinded, additional controls, such as closely monitoring billing and reviewing medical justification for customized items prior to payment, would be vital to help curb potentially inappropriate billing. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This article aims {{to review}} {{regulation}} governing outpatient orthotic <b>braces</b> (<b>neck,</b> wrist and knee braces) in France, the Netherlands and Sweden {{with a view}} to reforming the Belgian market. Methods Information about the regulatory framework was derived from an analysis of legal texts and a survey completed by national experts. Results Strategies to keep down prices include public procurement in Sweden, maximum prices in France, and exclusion of expensive braces from reimbursement in the Netherlands. Reimbursement is linked to a medical indication or a chronic condition in France, the Netherlands and Sweden. To gain reimbursement, the cost-effectiveness of orthotic braces needs to be demonstrated in France and the Netherlands. Orthotic braces tend to be initially prescribed by a specialist physician and distributed by orthotists, medical equipment shops and/or community pharmacies. Conclusions Extensive government intervention exists in the outpatient orthotic brace market in the countries studied. Our recommendations to reform the Belgian market for prefabricated orthotic braces are to separate reimbursement for service provision from reimbursement for braces; to set prices by means of a tendering process or an international price comparison; and to make reimbursement conditional on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of braces. ...|$|R
40|$|The Milwaukee Brace was {{developed}} by Dr Walter Blount of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the mid 1940 's as a removable postoperative immobilization device {{for the treatment of}} neuromuscular scoliosis patients. This was quickly adopted as a nonoperative treatment device for idiopathic scoliosis. The first report of its use for this purpose came in 1958 (JBJS 40 A: 511 - 525, 1958). The principle of the brace (cervicothoracic-lumbosacral orthosis, CTLSO) was to apply longitudinal correction between the pelvic girdle (originally made of leather and later thermoplastics) and the neck ring and lateral corrective forces applied to the curve apex via pads attached to a metal superstructure that connected the pelvic girdle to the <b>neck</b> ring. The <b>brace</b> was constructed to flatten the lumbar lordosis and in theory increase the effectiveness of the appropriately place pads. Correction was thought to occur by passive pad pressure on the apex (in the thoracic spine via pressure on the apical ribs) of the curves and actively by the muscles pulling away from the pads. The orthotic was used 23 hours a day and often combined with an exercise program. The main problem with the brace was adherence to treatment. Gradually the Milwaukee brace gave way to underarm braces (TLSO's) which were thought to have better patient acceptance. The question of brace efficacy is currently being addressed by the University of Iowa Department of Orthopaedic Surgery led NIH Trial (Braist [URL]...|$|R
5|$|Former Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara was {{appointed}} as Wilcox's successor, with Simon Donnelly joining as his assistant. McNamara's first match in charge was a 3–2 away {{defeat in the}} FA Cup first round to Accrington Stanley, who took the lead on 29 minutes through Sean McConville, before Oliver equalised for York five minutes later with a close-range finish. Matt Crooks put Accrington back in front two minutes later and Josh Windass scored a penalty early into the second half, before Coulson scored a consolation goal for York with a stoppage time header. York were eliminated from the Football League Trophy after being beaten 2–1 away by Barnsley in the Northern section quarter-final.
