40|$|On 20 August 2010 an {{energetic}} disturbance triggered large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations {{in a nearby}} filament. The triggering mechanism appears to be episodic jets connecting the energetic event with the filament threads. In the present work we analyze this periodic motion in a large fraction of the filament to characterize the underlying physics of the oscillation {{as well as the}} filament properties. The results support our previous theoretical conclusions that the restoring force of large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations is solar gravity, and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Based on our previous work, we used the fitted parameters to determine the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic field along the filament, as well as the mass accretion rate onto the filament threads. These derived properties are nearly uniform along the filament, indicating a remarkable degree of cohesiveness throughout the filament channel. Moreover, the estimated mass accretion rate implies that the footpoint heating responsible for the thread formation, according to the thermal nonequilibrium model, agrees with previous coronal heating estimates. We estimate the magnitude of the energy released in the <b>nearby</b> <b>event</b> by studying the dynamic response of the filament threads, and discuss the implications of our study for filament structure and heating.

It addresses tectonic processes and related variability of seismicity in space and time, earthquake forecasting and observation of possible short-term precursors, and modelling and observation of weak and strong ground motion {{as a result of}} complex source and path effects. In soils and rock, we study non-linear wave propagation phenomena and liquefaction, the long-term impacts of repeated earthquakes on slope stability through rock mass strength degradation, and the triggering of landslides; the potential of earthquake-induced snow avalanches is also be estimated. Our focus is on the physics of non-linear processes in relation to topography, geological disposition, water saturation and slope stability. The consequences of earthquakes will be evaluated through scenarios of direct seismic hazard and assessment of susceptibility to induced (secondary) effects.
