5|$|A {{battleship}} {{is a large}} armored warship with a {{main battery}} consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was considered vital for any <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> desired to maintain command of the sea.|$|E
5|$|The day {{started with}} a speech from Lord Rowe-Beddoe, {{chairman}} of Wales Millennium Centre, who declared to the crowd that the proceedings were under way.

5|$|A race riot {{took place}} in Harlem, New York City, on August 1 and 2 of 1943, after a white police officer, James Collins, shot and wounded Robert Bandy, an African-American soldier; and rumors {{circulated}} that the soldier had been killed. The riot was chiefly directed by black residents against white-owned property in Harlem. It was one of six riots in the <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> year related to black and white tensions during World War II. The others {{took place in}} Detroit, Michigan, Beaumont, Texas, Mobile, Alabama, Los Angeles, California. In Beaumont and Mobile, the riots were white defense industry workers attacking blacks.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Nixon {{undertook}} {{another major}} foreign trip, {{this time to}} Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did. Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1966, Dalek creator Terry Nation {{pitched a}} {{spin-off}} series The Daleks to the BBC, writing a 30-minute teleplay entitled The Destroyers {{as a possible}} pilot episode for an American co-production. The Daleks was to {{have focused on the}} adventures of the SSS. Lead characters included agents Captain Jack Corey, David Kingdom, his sister Sara Kingdom, and an android named Mark Seven. On 22 November 1966, the BBC informed <b>Nation</b> <b>that</b> they were no longer interested in the project. It was later adapted by Nicholas Briggs & John Dorney for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in December 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Many schemes {{have been}} {{proposed}} to apply objective criteria to the designation of pariah status. Lawal has summarized four primary categories often used for qualification as pariah states: 1) <b>nations</b> <b>that</b> possess or use {{weapons of mass destruction}} in contravention of existing treaties, 2) <b>nations</b> <b>that</b> support terrorism, 3) nations lacking democracy, and 4) nations with a record of human rights violations. To these four criteria, Geldenhuys adds another two: 5) <b>nations</b> <b>that</b> promote radical ideologies at home or even abroad (clarified as [...] "exporting revolution"), and 6) <b>nations</b> <b>that</b> commit acts of military aggression abroad. In addition to these six categories of state conduct that can result in objective designation as a pariah state, Geldenhuys suggests a seventh category that might gain international consensus: <b>nations</b> <b>that</b> are involved in international drug trafficking.|$|R

5|$|On defense, Virginia Tech's Jayron Hosley {{tied the}} school record for interceptions (9) {{and had the}} most in the <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> season when he caught an Andrew Luck pass in the first half.

The Hokies' leading tackler was Eddie Whitley, who had seven stops, while Stanford's leading defensive performer was Shayne Skov, who had 12 tackles, including 3 quarterback sacks.|$|E
5|$|Oslo had unsuccessfully bid to {{host the}} 1936 Winter Olympics, losing to Germany, which had hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics. At that time, the <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> hosted the Summer Olympics also hosted the Winter Olympics. After the 1936 Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to award the Winter and Summer Games to {{different}} countries, but the Games were suspended during World War II. London hosted the first post-war Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, and recommended Oslo as the host city for the 1948 Winter Games, but the city council declined. Instead, the 1948 Winter Olympics were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> had fallen behind {{in the race for the}} North Pole.|$|E

5|$|The Mariotes worshiped both Semitic and Sumerian deities and {{established}} their {{city as a}} center of old trade. However, although the pre-Amorite periods were characterized by heavy Sumerian cultural influence, Mari was not a city of Sumerian immigrants but rather a Semitic speaking <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> used a dialect similar to Eblaite. The Amorites were West-Semites who began to settle the area before the 21st century BC; by the Lim dynasty's era (c. 1830 BC), they became the dominant population in the Fertile Crescent.|$|E
5|$|The Referendum Party was a Eurosceptic, single-issue {{political}} party that {{was active in}} the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party's sole objective was for a referendum to be held {{on the nature of the}} UK's membership of the European Union (EU). Specifically, it called for a referendum on whether the British people wanted to either be part of a federal European state or revert to being a sovereign <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> was part of a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.|$|E
5|$|The closing ceremonies {{took place}} on Sunday, 5 February in the Olympic Ice Stadium. They were preceded by a figure skating {{exhibition}} performed by the men's, women's, and pairs figure skating champions. The flag bearers of each nation then entered the stadium followed by the flags of Greece and the United States. These two flags were raised to honor the <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> founded the Olympics and the next country to host the Winter Games. Avery Brundage, President of the International Olympic Committee, declared the Olympics closed, and a fireworks display concluded the Games.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.|$|E
5|$|This {{was the end}} of U.S. air support, {{the last}} American {{aircraft}} departing Cambodian airspace on 15 August. From the beginning of Operation Breakfast the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia, 257,465 tons of which had been dropped during the last six months of the operation. During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> had once been the best fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's eucharistic views, {{which had}} already moved away from {{official}} Catholic doctrine, received another push from Continental reformers. Cranmer had {{been in contact with}} Martin Bucer since the time when initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League. However, Cranmer and Bucer's relationship became ever closer due to Charles V's victory over the League at Mühlberg, which left England as the sole major <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers. Cranmer wrote a letter to Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology. In Bucer's reply dated 28 November 1547, he denied the corporeal real presence and condemned transubstantiation and the adoration of the elements. The letter was delivered to Cranmer by two Italian reformed theologians, Peter Martyr and Bernardino Ochino who were invited to take refuge in England. Martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by John Chrysostom (now regarded as a forgery), Ad Caesarium Monachum, which appeared to provide patristic support against the corporeal real presence. These documents were to influence Cranmer's thoughts on the eucharist.|$|E
5|$|From 1872 until 1879, the nationalities {{forming the}} bulk of the new {{settlers}} were composed of Portuguese (31.2%), Italians (25.8%), Germans (8.1%) and Spanish (1.9%). In the 1880s, Italians would surpass the Portuguese (61.8% to 23.3% respectively), and the Spanish would displace the Germans (6.7% to 4.2% respectively). Other, smaller groups also arrived, including Russians, Poles and Hungarians. Since nearly all European immigrants settled in the southeastern and southern areas of the Empire, ethnic distribution, already unequal before the mass immigration, became even more divergent between regions. For a <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> had a small, widely scattered population (4,000,000 in 1823 and 14,333,915 in 1890), the immigration of more than 1,380,000 Europeans had a tremendous effect upon the country's ethnic composition. In 1872, the year of the first reliable national census, white Brazilians represented just over a third (38.1%) of the total population; in 1890, they had increased to a little under half (44.0%) of all Brazilians.|$|E
