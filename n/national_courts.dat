5|$|Nearly razed to {{the ground}} in 1960 along with other {{buildings}} on Lafayette Square, successful lobbying and support from the newly elected Kennedy administration in 1961 led to the original proposals to gut the building being dropped. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was instrumental in persuading architect John Carl Warnecke, a friend of her husband, to create a design that would incorporate the new buildings with the old, based on the architectural theory of contextualism. The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and a courtyard built between them and the <b>National</b> <b>Courts</b> building. The building has remained part of the <b>National</b> <b>Courts</b> Building complex ever since, and is now protected by the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

Meanwhile, some of those who were responsible for the 1942 massacres in southern Bačka were captured in, and extradited from, the newly formed People's Republic of Hungary. In his book Mađari u Vojvodini: 1941–1946 ("Hungarians in Vojvodina: 1941–1946"; Novi Sad, 1996), Professor Sándor Kaszás from the University of Novi Sad listed a total of 1,686 executed war criminals by name, of whom around 1,000 were Hungarian.|$|E

5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

5000|$|The {{judicial}} system consists of village magistrates courts, which remain the only court remaining the administrative {{responsibility of the}} executive branch, district courts in urban centres presided over by stipendiary magistrates, the <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> which is the superior trial court and the Supreme Court which is functionally an appellate division of the National Court: it is not separately constituted, its Chief Justice is also the Chief Justice of the <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> and its bench consists of <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> judges sitting as an ad hoc appellate tribunal. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal: an appeal lay from the pre-independence Supreme Court to the High Court of Australia (but not directly to the Privy Council); this was abolished at independence. The Supreme Court also has jurisdiction under the Constitution to give advisory opinions, called [...] "references," [...] on the constitutionality of legislation. In addition to its function as a trial <b>court,</b> the <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> also functions as a court of disputed returns hearing [...] "Electoral Petitions" [...] by unsuccessful candidates for Parliament; Leadership Tribunals hearing cases of alleged misconduct in office referred by the Ombudsman Commission consist of one <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> judge and two District Court magistrates.|$|R
25|$|<b>National</b> <b>courts</b> {{are thus}} by their nature the first guarantors of Union law. To ensure the {{effective}} and uniform application of Union legislation {{and to prevent}} divergent interpretations, <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> may, and sometimes must, turn to the Court of Justice and ask that it clarify a point concerning the interpretation of Union law, in order, for example, to ascertain whether their national legislation complies with that law. Petitions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling are described in Article 267 (ex Article 234) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.|$|E
