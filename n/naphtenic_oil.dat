40|$|A Lubnor Ã uma refinaria de pequeno porte da Petrobras instalada dentro da cidade de Fortaleza-CE, que processa petrÃleos do tipo naftÃnico, pouco disponÃveis na natureza. A refinaria dispÃe hoje de trÃs opÃÃes desses Ãleos para processamento e produz basicamente asfaltos e lubrificantes naftÃnicos, sendo a Ãnica produtora nacional destes Ãltimos. O planejamento de processamento de matÃria-prima e produÃÃo dessa unidade {{industrial}} Ã realizado de forma centralizada pela sede da organizaÃÃo, que busca os melhores resultados para o todo, mesmo que isso penalize uma unidade especÃfica. Este trabalho temcomo objetivos planejar as operaÃÃes logÃsticas em uma refinaria de petrÃleo para maximizar seus resultados e mostrar que sincronizando a demanda por produtos acabados e a chegada de matÃria-prima, a refinaria pode aumentar a capacidade de processamento reduzindo os estoques em processo. Para esse fim, foi adotada a estratÃgia de pesquisa bibliogrÃfica e exploratÃria aplicada a um estudo de caso. Os referenciais teÃricos estÃo suportados na previsÃo de demanda, gestÃo de estoques e nos sistemas de apoio Ã decisÃo. Os resultados apontam que entre seis configuraÃÃes possÃveis de processamento pela refinaria, duas apresentam melhor rentabilidade, duas apresentam um resultado um pouco inferior e as duas outras sÃo inviÃveis. A demonstraÃÃo de que Ã possÃvel aumentar a produÃÃo com a reduÃÃo dos estoques em processo Ã realizada atravÃs de uma planilha do Microsoft Excel, que tem como variÃvel a carga da unidade. Aumentando-se a carga em 50 % e 100 %, os estoques em processo caem a nÃveis inferiores aos existentes hoje na refinaria. Ao final deste trabalho sÃo apontadas recomendaÃÃes para a soluÃÃo de problemas especÃficos que reduzem a rentabilidade da refinaria e o nÃvel de serviÃo desejadoLubnor {{is a small}} tonnage Petrobrasâ refinery {{located in}} Fortaleza, CearÃ, Brazil. It refines <b>naphtenic</b> crude <b>oils,</b> which {{are not easy to}} find in nature. There are three kinds of Brazilian <b>naphtenics</b> <b>oils</b> currently available to be processed in Lubnor. The refinery produces basically asphalts and naphtenic lubricants, and it is the only Brazilian producer of these kinds of lubricants. The kinds of petroleum to process and the production planning of the refinery are made by the headquarters of the organization, which looks for the best results for the whole Company, although it means losses for one of the refineries. This work has the following objectives: to plan the logistic operations of a petroleum refinery in order to maximize its profits and to show that the refinery can improve its processing capacity reducing its in process inventory by synchronizing or balancing the output of final products and the input of crude oils. To reach these objectives, it was adopted the strategy of a literature research applicable to a case study. The theoretical references concern demand forecasting, inventory management and decision support systems. The results show that among the six possible configurations of oil refining, two are profitable, other two have a little gain and the last two are unfeasible. The demonstration {{that it is possible to}} increase the production reducing the in process inventory is made by using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with one variable: the diary flow of crude oil in the distillation unit. Increasing the flow in 50 % and 100 %, the in process inventory decreases to a lower level when compared with the current inventory at the refinery. At the end of this work, there are recommendations to solve specific problems which are reducing the refinery profitability and the service leve...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} {{dielectric}} strength, viscosity and oxidation stability, mineral oils {{have been used}} for more than one hundred years ago as insulation liquid in high voltage equipment. However, mineral oils are non-renewable materials and have a low level biodegradability; their level of biodegradability is not more than 30 %. For that purpose, the development of vegetable oils is being continuously performed by many researchers and industries to replace mineral oils. These natural products present a high biodegradability, non-toxicity and higher fire safety guarantee. In general, vegetable oils which have been used today are derived from food material such as soybeans, palm, corn, sunflower and others. In this paper, we first introduce a new vegetable oil derived from a non-food material we called “JMEO (jatropha curcas methyl ester oil) ”. JMEO is produced by alkaline esterification process of jatropha curcas oil which comes from the pressing of jatropha fruits. Jatropha curcas are non-edible crop that can grow in all types of soil in tropical and subtropical regions and even in barren soils with low rainfall. Moreover, these plants do not need much fertilizer. Then we present the results of a comparison of statistical AC breakdown voltage in JMEO and mineral <b>oil</b> (<b>naphtenic</b> type). Breakdown voltage (BDV) measurements have been performed on series of 40 tests basing on IEC 60156 Standard. Hypothesis test of conformity to normal distribution of BDV is carried out by applying Shapiro-Wilk tests to calculate W-value and P-value and skewness and kurtosis test. We mainly analyze histogram, probability of oil samples, mean and standard deviation. It appears from the obtained results that the BDV of JMEO is better than that of mineral oil. Thus, JMEO (jatropha curcas methyl ester oil) constitutes a potential liquid for replacing mineral oil in high voltage equipment and especially in high voltage power transformer...|$|R
40|$|Nynas AB is {{a company}} that refines oil  for {{different}} applications such as insulating oils  for the electrical industry and base oils for both the lubricant and chemical industry. Different types of base oils are produced for the lubricant industry in order to provide required properties such as good viscosity, solvency, volatility, etc. But sometimes, the oils produced in the refineries (known as “straight cut” oils) do not have the all properties required by a customer, and a way for achieving those properties is to blend different straight cut base oils. To save money and time, empirical correlations are used to facilitate the prediction of the properties of those blends. Those correlations are adapted to products from a single site produced from certain crude oils. The company has recently decided to introduce a new stream of products with different characteristics, which means that the new properties of the products and blends can not be predicted by using the existing empirical correlations. The objective of this project was to analyze blends containing these new products and find the new correlations. The names of the oils are classified information and were renamed in the report and also number of the tables with result in appendices has been reduced to protect Nynas AB.   The correlations were surprisingly good for most of the blends. The differences between the values obtained by the blending program (which was calculating the properties) and the experimental values were very small. But the calculated values for properties such as flash point and pour point, were quite different from the experimental ones for some of the samples. Finally, there was one type of blends, between the Naphthenic oil 2 (N 2) and Paraffinic oil B (P (B)), were {{it was not possible to}} get any results with the blending program, because the viscosities at 40 °C of those oils (N 2 and P(B)) were too similar. As mentioned before, the property that was most difficult to predict was the pour point, specially for blends containing paraffinic oil blend with a <b>naphtenic</b> <b>oil.</b> However, suggestions were made based on the experimental values of how to get correlations based on. Anyhow, empirical correlations were developed based on the experimental data. ...|$|E
