Limited financial support and low background knowledge in Information and Communications Technology are two more suspending factors. At the same time rapid technological progress has lead to the implementation of Internet applications which offer e-learning. This paper proposes a framework for applying e-learning to agriculture. It may be applied to three different stages of educational process: (i) platform development, (ii) courses development and delivery, (iii) platform and courses evaluation. The <b>Nielsen</b> <b>Heuristics</b> for system usability, the Technology Acceptance Model for evaluation, and indexes and metrics for system log file analysis are used. The expected benefits of the framework application are the qualitative presentation of educational material, the overcoming of spatial and time restrictions and the continuous evaluation of courses...|$|R
40|$|Selecting {{usability}} evaluation methods (UEMs) {{to expose}} usability problems in e-learning programs {{is influenced by}} time, cost, ease of application, and efficiency. Heuristic evaluation has become a widely accepted method of usability evaluation in software development. This paper introduces Heuristic Evaluation for Child E-learning applications (HECE), a comprehensive set of heuristics for child e-learning along with a detailed explanation for the usability experts on how to apply them. These sets of heuristics are based on Nielsenâ€™s original ten heuristics developed for software. <b>Nielsen</b> <b>heuristics</b> are basically generic, and might not encompass usability attributes specific to children or e-learning. The new HECE set would overcome these shortcomings. The validity and effectiveness of these heuristics were evaluated against two developed e-learning programs designed by ReDSOFT for KG- 2 and special need students. The results indicated that HECE identified qualitative similarities and differences with user testing, and that HECE is best suited for evaluating general and child usability. Combined with user testing, HECE offers a new track that can assist in guiding the child e-learning industry to design applications that are both educational and pleasurable for children. </p...|$|R

This is why there is a necessity for tools that can automate the processes. There are some tools that cover some of the technical aspects, but no tools have been identified that can tackle the process as a whole. For these reasons the Aragonese Usability Laboratory decided to develop WebA (Web Analysis), with the objective to have a complete application. This application is designed through modules {{with the objective of}} covering all of the evaluation and analysis phases, and it concludes with a process management module. For the analysis phase a Card Sorting module (open & closed) has been developed that uses the hierarchical and multidimensional cluster analysis, which allows a better information architecture. For the evaluation phases, modules have been developed that allow the semiautomatic evaluation of usability through user satisfaction tests based on <b>Nielsen</b> <b>heuristics</b> and ISO standards, the evaluation of accessibility through the verification of WCAG 1. 0 guidelines. The application concludes with a process design and evaluation management module, and modules that automatically generate the reports of the analysis carried out...|$|R

In this way, service providers know {{what they need to}} do in order to improve web services quality. Currently, information systems and technologies are used in the evaluation of complex assessment methods, such as COBIT, ITIL, CMMI, etc [...] These methods assess inside the organization's available information systems, technology and related processes. Such audits are performed periodically, and the period chosen by the organization itself. Web services audit should be continuous and in the web service assessment process should participate all web service consumers. Potential users of such services are all persons using the Internet. A new web service assessment methodology assess web services in two aspects. Usability of the web service assess consumers when they fill questionnaires that have been made on the basis of Jakob <b>Nielsen</b> <b>heuristics.</b> Web service characteristics recorded by the monitoring software. Done methodology tested by creating a prototype of the web service audit, in which consumers before using the web services can see usability, monitoring and overall evaluation.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of many web publishing tools is the flexibility for {{the user to}} arrange the available widgets and modules. Nevertheless, the freedom to insert and arrange components {{in the creation of}} web pages sometimes leads the designer to make usability and/or accessibility mistakes that emerge only after the interface has been built and subjected to automatic, semi-automatic or manual evaluation processes. Several systems include features to perform accessibility controls of the web sites implemented, analyzing syntactic properties rather that provide guidelines to control the usability metrics. In this work, we propose a methodology to develop web interfaces that integrates the advantages of a top-down approach to implement HTML pages with functionalities to perform usability controls analyzing an abstraction level of formal specification based upon Symbol- Relation Action grammars (SR-Action grammars, for short) [1]. In particular, the visual models adopted to develop both the static characteristics and the interactive tasks of the web application, makes more intuitive the design and the development. Again, a SR-Action grammar defining the scenes of the implemented site is used to control a subset of the <b>Nielsen</b> <b>heuristics</b> at abstraction level: completeness, correctness, aesthetic and minimalist design, user control, consistency, and metrics desirable in an interactive visual interface. The analysis at formal level and the report of the usability controls allow the designer to run feedback reviews of the visual environment under consideration and to perform usability evaluation before of the canonical testing techniques. Then, we describe an implementation prototype of the development environment born of the integration of two systems previously realized: TAGIVE [2] and VALUTA [1]...|$|R
40|$|The Website Developmental Model for the Healthcare Consumer (WDMHC) is an {{extensive}} and successfully evaluated framework that incorporates user-centered design principles. However, {{due to its}} extensiveness its application is limited. In the current study we apply {{a subset of the}} WDMHC framework in a case study concerning the development and evaluation of a website aimed at childhood cancer survivors (CCS). To assess whether the implementation of a limited subset of the WDMHC-framework is sufficient to deliver a high-quality website with few usability problems, aimed at a specific patient population. The website was developed using a six-step approach divided into three phases derived from the WDMHC: 1) information needs analysis, mock-up creation and focus group discussion; 2) website prototype development; and 3) heuristic evaluation (HE) and think aloud analysis (TA). The HE was performed by three double experts (knowledgeable both in usability engineering and childhood cancer survivorship), who assessed the site using the <b>Nielsen</b> <b>heuristics.</b> Eight end-users were invited to complete three scenarios covering all functionality of the website by TA. The HE and TA were performed concurrently on the website prototype. The HE resulted in 29 unique usability issues; the end-users performing the TA encountered eleven unique problems. Four issues specifically revealed by HE concerned cosmetic design flaws, whereas two problems revealed by TA were related to website content. Based on the subset of the WDMHC framework we were able to deliver a website that closely matched the expectancy of the end-users and resulted in relatively few usability problems during end-user testing. With the successful application of this subset of the WDMHC, we provide developers with a clear and easily applicable framework for the development of healthcare websites with high usability aimed at specific medical population...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} {{for evaluating the}} usability and e#ectiveness of ambient displays. Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic peripheral displays portraying non-critical information {{on the periphery of}} a user's attention. Although many innovative displays have been published, little existing work has focused on their evaluation, in part because evaluation of ambient displays is di#cult and costly. We adapted a low-cost evaluation technique, heuristic evaluation, for use with ambient displays. With the help of ambient display designers, we defined a modified set of heuristics. We compared the performance of Nielsen's heuristics and our heuristics on two ambient displays. Evaluators using our heuristics found more, severe problems than evaluators using <b>Nielsen</b> 's <b>heuristics.</b> Additionally, when using our heuristics, 3 - 5 evaluators were able to identify 40 - 60 % of known usability issues. This implies that heuristic evaluation is an e#ective technique for identifying usability issues with ambient displays...|$|R
40|$|Today, web, Internet, {{mobile and}} other ambient {{technologies}} engage in persuasive interaction with people. The technology designed to reinforce and change userâ€™s attitude or behaviors or both through persuasion and social influence are persuasive technologies. Recently, persuasive systems {{and services are}} becoming increasingly abundant and ubiquitous. Evaluation of these systems is a challenging endeavor and typically requires a simple and efficient method. <b>Nielsen</b> suggests <b>heuristic</b> evaluation as a method for intuitive, inexpensive and easy evaluation of a user interface design. The purpose of this thesis is to examine heuristic evaluation as a method to evaluate the persuasive potential of software programs. The Heuristics used were operationalized version of Foggâ€™s persuasive design principles. Software programs MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Counter-Strike, The Sims, Stone and Plan Eat Smile were chosen {{with the goal of}} measuring their ability to change behavior or attitude of users. The Evaluation was performed on the software programs using three evaluators and the test results indicated that they possess significant persuasive potential.

40|$|Websites {{today only}} offer simpler form of {{technical}} analysis {{and are not}} fun to use, therefore student decided to build a website that makes technical analysis a bit more fun by giving user possibility to experiment with settings for technical indicators and also see clear visible results from analysis. Student decided to build website in ASP. NET. Technical indicators for this project only consist of those who give buy and sell-signals via cross-over, no divergence or pattern finding. This project has three questions that define this project. Itâ€™s important that there is good functionality so that performing an analysis is perceived as simple, one question is therefore; what functionality for website is needed in order for analysis {{to be perceived as}} more simple?Technical analysis is a pretty complex subject and demands an interface that is perceived as easy to understand and easy to use, itâ€™s therefore important that the interface is well designed, second question is therefore; how should the interface be designed to be user-friendly?When systems grow large they often become hard to develop and later on unmaintainable because of the accumulated complexity and dependency between classes, the code is a mess, the last question is therefore; how can the systems complexity be eased with object-oriented design principles?Jakob <b>Nielsens</b> ten <b>heuristics</b> for User Interface Design were used as inspiration for designing the interface for the website. The system design follows SOLID principles, some pattern-design were also used because pattern-design often fulfills SOLID principles or makes for pretty good solutions in regular code-problems. At the beginning of the project the student did a small research {{to find out what was}} needed in order to complete project. Work-method for project follows agile development where decisions were made on a weekly basis. The project was divided into three phases where each phase was strongly coupled to a specific area of responsibility. Prototypes for interface were made and used as a basis for the resulting interface. The project led to a working website with good functionality. Filter was considered as important in order to ease shaping of analysis because the user could more easily sort and pick stock. The student assumed that the user would want fast and easy access to their stock so portfolio management were implemented so that user could more easily get to stock that was considered as favorites. The interface follows to a big extent Jakob <b>Nielsens</b> ten <b>heuristics</b> for User Interface Design and is proven by comparing interface with principles. The same goes for design of the system, design is proven by comparing with principles, still to this day system is considered easy to continue development. Student made the conclusion that SOLID principles were very important in order for the system to maintain its health and took experience from these principles. Student became happy with the interface but more focus couldâ€™ve been given for a more interactive interface because it mightâ€™ve been perceived as more intuitive...|$|R

The next section is the literature review on current Web evaluation studies, and motivational and job satisfaction theories in organizational behavior. The following section describes the empirical study methodology including Phase I for identifying design factors, and Phase II for identifying the hygiene and motivator {{characteristics of the}} factors. Finally, the researchers discuss {{the implications of the}} findings, some limitations, and directions for future research. Among the handful of empirical studies, Wilkinson, Ben- nett, and Oliver (t 997) first took a bottom-up approach by compiling Internet evaluation criteria from different sources. Then they asked 30 Web evaluation experts to judge the importance of the criteria and whether a particular indicator rated for information quality or Website quality. The results of the survey showed that 71 information quality indicators and 67 Website quality indicators can be used to evaluate the quality of Internet information sources. With a similar focus on Internet information resource quality, Borges, Morales, and Rodriguez (1998) staffed from <b>Nielsen</b> 's (1993) <b>heuristics</b> guidelines to evaluate 10 Websites for universities and colleges. Next, they did user testing of the guidelines by redesigning and retesting the university Websites, and then tested commercial Websites using the guidelines. Revised guidelines eventually were generated for designing usable Web pages. Spool et al. (1999) focused on information retrieval tasks and conducted usability studies on several large companies' Websites. Despite these studies in Web-user interface design and evaluation, the testing or use of theoretical models is still rare.

40|$|Designers instinctively {{design for}} able-bodied users and are either {{unaware of the}} needs of users with {{different}} capabilities, or {{do not know how to}} accommodate their needs into the design cycle. Hence, there is an urgent need for design methods, based on a better understanding of age and ability related factors, which will lead to a minimising of the impact of impairments and thereby extend quality life. The aim of this paper is to present a methodological design approach for implementing inclusive design. A summary of the principal methods for designing for users with different capabilities is given along with a description of a model, the Inclusive Design Cube, that displays how the different approaches are complementary and can provide complete population coverage. Building on the concept of the user pyramid design approach (Benktzon, 1993), the authors have developed a model that relates capability level, population profile and suitable design approach in a simple graphical format. The resultant model is the inclusive design cube (IDC) (Keates and Clarkson, 1999). Each axis on the cube represents user capability and the enclosed volumes reflect population coverage. The IDC is a very potent visualisation tool and communicates the needs of different sections of the population. However, for practical implementation of inclusive design practices, it is necessary to have an accompanying rigorous methodology. Developing a usable product interface for wider user capabilities involves understanding the fundamental nature of the interaction. Typical interaction with an interface consists of the user perceiving the output from the product (perception), deciding a course of action (cognition) and the implementing the response (motor function) (Card et al., 1983). These steps relate directly to the userâ€™s sensory, cognitive and motor capabilities respectively. Building on this and Nielsenâ€™s usability <b>heuristics</b> (<b>Nielsen</b> and Mack, 1993), a design approach has been developed, where each level is accompanied by user trial evaluations before progression to the next level. The 7 -level approach has been successfully applied to the design of a software interface for the control of an interactive, assistive technology robot (Clarkson et al, 1999) and the evaluation of an information point for use in post offices. The latter shall be presented as a case study to demonstrate how application of the 7 -level approach would have affected its overall usability. Using the 7 -level approach and the Inclusive Design Cube, serious usability and accessibility shortfalls were identified that are being addressed in the information point re-design...|$|R
