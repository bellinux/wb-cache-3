Paterson This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Targeted Disruption of Gene Function in Drosophila by RNA Interference,” Chapter 19, in [*Drosophila Protocols*]([URL] (eds. Sullivan et al.). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2000. Please note that {{this version of the}} protocol is a 2007 revision. ### INTRODUCTION RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for determining the role of specific genes during *Drosophila* embryogenesis. This protocol describes a technique by which *Drosophila* embryos can be injected with dsRNA in order to disrupt targeted gene function. The approach is straightforward, utilizing improved methods for injecting the dsRNA directly through the chorion of the embryo. This strategy minimizes problems normally associated with desiccation of the dechorionated embryo and facilitates post-injection analysis of gene expression. ### RELATED INFORMATION The double-stranded RNA needed for RNAi is prepared as in [Preparation of Double-Stranded RNA for *Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi). ]([URL] Embryos are collected shortly before injection (typically, 30 - 60 min prior; see Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi)). This injection technique can also be used for generating transgenic *Drosophila* lines, as in [*Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi) Using a Gal- 4 Inducible Transgene Vector]([URL] (Misquitta et al. 2008). These procedures assume that the investigator has access to a working fly facility and is familiar with basic methods for injection of embryos and the analysis of gene expression in Drosophila embryos. If not, details for these procedures can be found elsewhere; see Ashburner (1989 a,b); for microinjection procedures, see Kiehart et al. (2000). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye, from Step 15 of [Preparation of Double-Stranded RNA for *Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] - Embryos arrayed and dried onto glass slides, from [Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] ### Equipment 1. Capillaries (glass; Frederick Haer and Co.) - *These capillaries are fiber-filled, which helps in fluid movement within the needle*. - Clay (modeling) - Collection basket (nylon mesh; see [Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] for details of construction) - Incubator preset to 18 ºC- 22 ºC - Microcentrifuge tubes - Microinjector - *The {{protocol was}} developed using the Eppendorf Transjector Model 5246 (see Discussion), which has been replaced by the InjectMan NI 2 *. - Micromanipulator (Narishige model MN- 153) - Microscope for injection (Olympus CH- 2 or equivalent) - Moist chamber - *A humidified chamber for storage of the embryos during development can be constructed from a 150 -mL agar collection plate with lid. Five slides can be placed conveniently in the chamber*. - <b>Needle</b> <b>puller</b> (Model 730; David Kopf Instruments). - Petri dish (plastic, 150 -mm) - Pipette (e. g., Eppendorf P 10) - Pipette microtips (e. g., Eppendorf Microloader tips) - Table (stone, for microscope and injection apparatus) ### METHOD **Preparing the Needles** 1. To pull the glass capillaries into needles: - i. Set heat at 12. 5 - 13. 0 and set the solenoid at 4 on the <b>needle</b> <b>puller.</b> - ii. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for pulling the needles. - iii. Store freshly-pulled needles horizontally, embedded lightly on a flattened narrow strip of modeling clay placed on the bottom of a 150 -mm covered plastic Petri dish. - Use a pipette (e. g., Eppendorf P 10) fitted with a microtip (e. g., Eppendorf Microloader tips) to back-load the injection needles with 0. 5 - 1. 0 μL of dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye. **Calibrating the Transjector** 3. Set the Transjector to automatic injection. 4. Set the injection pressure (Po) to 450. 5. Set the compensation pressure (Pc) to 570. 6. Set the time of injections to 0. 1 sec. - *If using a different model injector, calibrate the injector according to the manufacturer’s instructions*. **Injecting Embryos** *Based on the volume loaded into the needle (0. 5 - 1. 0 μL), each embryo receives up to 100 - 200 pL of dsRNA. A typical loading, if the needle remains unbroken and unblocked, is good for the injection of approximately 1000 embryos or more*. *Inject the embryos in the posterior end, slightly off-center, because the posterior tip of the chorion is very hard and needles often break in this position. Keep the injection room at 18 °C to slow development*. 7. Break the filled needle against the edge of the slide containing the embryos to create a sharp point, as follows: - i. Move the slide slowly toward the needle tip while simultaneously depressing the “clean” button on the Transjector. - ii. The moment that the slide lightly taps the tip and the tip breaks, a small amount of the dye will leak from the needle tip. Release the “clean” button. - *Dye flow should stop when the “clean” button is no longer depressed. The sample is now ready for injection*. - *If the tip is too large after breakage, the needle will continue to drip dye when the “clean” button is not depressed. Such tips will destroy the embryos during injection*. 8. Bring the needle tip and the posterior tip of the embryo into the same focal plane. Make sure that the needle is positioned off-center with respect to the posterior tip of the embryo (see Fig. 1). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Correct injection position for the embryos. (A) Do not inject the embryos directly in the posterior center of the chorion, as the needles often break at this site due to the apparent increased hardness of the chorion. (B) Embryos are injected in the posterior end, slightly off-center, with much less needle breakage or blockage. *For best results, inject the embryos with the needle at an angle slightly greater than 45 ° relative to the embryo surface in the posterior quarter of the embryo*. 9. Insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. 10. Inject the RNA into the embryo. A small amount of food dye will appear as a small dot in the posterior end of the embryo. It takes ~ 1 - 5 sec to inject each embryo. 11. After all the embryos on a slide have been injected, place the slide in a covered moist chamber at 18 ºC- 22 ºC until embryogenesis is complete (~ 48 h) or until the desired stage of development is reached. **Collecting Injected Embryos for Analysis** 12. Wash the embryos off the slide into a nylon-mesh collection basket. 13. Transfer the embryos to a microcentrifuge tube. 14. Fix the embryos and stain them using standard protocols; see Ashburner (1989 a,b). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The injection needle becomes blocked. **[Step 10]** - **Solution**: To minimize capillary backflow and blockage, do not push the needle too far into the embryo; insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. If blockage should occur on the Transjector, immerse the needle tip in a drop of coverslip oil and hold down the “clean” button. When the needle clears, the food coloring will be visible in the oil. If blockage persists, change the needles. - **Problem**: Embryos fail to develop normally. **[Step 11]** -** Solution**: Keep the embryos moist after injection. Punctured embryos need a humid environment or they tend to shrink and dry up. Note that excessive moisture (e. g., embryos floating in water) will also kill the embryos. ### DISCUSSION The microinjector we use is the Eppendorf Transjector. Although primarily used for the injection of cultured cells, the Transjector is easily adapted for the injection of *Drosophila* embryos directly through the chorion. Highly reproducible injection conditions can be defined with regard to the volume of material injected, while preventing backflow of material into the needle, which results in needle blockage. This is accomplished by varying the injection pressure, compensation pressure, and the time of injection. The Transjector was a key factor in being able to routinely inject approximately 500 embryos for each analysis. It also has a useful “clean button” that uses a burst of high-pressure air to clean the needle tip in case of blockage. This greatly reduces the number of times needles need to be changed. In our studies, typical efficiencies for generation of the mutant phenotype in the embryo ranged from 72 % to 86 %, but penetration of the *white* mutation to the adult eye was < 3 % (Misquitta and Paterson 1999). RNAi has also been used in dechorionated embryos to demonstrate that both *frizzled* and *frizzled 2 * were in the *wingless* pathway (Kennerdell and Carthew 1998). However, dechorionated embryos have a much lower survival rate and injection artifacts are more pronounced. To rescue injected transgenic lines, apply a small amount of yeast paste to the slide and transfer the embryos from the paste to food vials. Recent experience has shown that using < 1 mg/mL of dsRNA for dsRNAs longer than 1 kb minimizes needle blockage while 1 mg/mL is suitable for dsRNAs shorter than 1 Kb in length. ### REFERENCES 1.

5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the <b>needle</b> <b>pulls</b> through the jewellery is left behind.|$|R

Methods: A 67 -year-old woman had no history of trauma, but had zonular deficiency and inferonasal iris defects in both eyes. An extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) scleral fixation was performed in the left eye. A CTR was implanted in the right eye through a sclerocorneal incision. After the IOL was placed centrally in the capsular bag, two paracenteses were made at the limbus (5 o’clock and 7 o’clock). A long, straight needle was passed through the 7 o’clock paracentesis site into a angled, blunt tipped 27 gauge needle inserted from the 5 o’clock paracentesis. The two <b>needles</b> were <b>pulled</b> out at 5 o’clock. After inserting the long needle into the blunt tipped needle at 7 o’clock, both were passed back through the 7 o’clock paracentesis site. The <b>needles</b> were <b>pulled</b> out again at the 5 o’clock paracentesis site tied. Equal tension was used to tie both sides. Results: Visual acuity improved to 20 / 20 in the right eye. Conclusions: Both capsular tension ring implantation and iris repair was successfully performed {{at the time of}} cataract surgery in a coloboma patient, which resulted in improvements in visual function and cosmesis...|$|R

Once the jewelry is placed correctly in your ear, the piercer will repeat the process again, except this time they will not insert a new captive ring. Using the second hole that was just made, the piercer will take the bead ring in the first hole and place it through the second hole. They then close the ring until there is very little space left for the bead to fit in the ring. Once the bead is placed and secured in the ring, the piercing is completed.|$|R
30|$|It can {{be argued}} that the muscle layer is thick and the pre-peritoneal space can be more easily insufflated than at the umbilicus.

This reduces the chance of pre-peritoneal insufflation, as the sub-costal region provides a larger fixed area to manoeuvre. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, history of previous gastric or splenic surgery or palpable gastro-pancreatic mass should be regarded as a contraindication to left upper quadrant Veress needle placement.|$|R

The MVOCs were collected onto the fibre for 12  h in this case. After finishing the sorption, the fibre was placed in the injector of the chromatograph, and the analysis was started. The measurements were repeated three times for the sample of historical wool with and without mould. It should be noted that in this case the analysis of MVOCs was carried out for a mould growing on actual historic wool sample without medium, sorption of the microbial volatiles was carried out in a shorter time than for the samples in vials, and additionally, the sorption was performed in the open system. Results of this experiment were to provide information whether it is possible to carry out measurements of MVOCs emitted by moulds developing on actual historic or artwork objects (without microbial medium), in situ, i.e. in the museum, library or archive, in the open system, in which concentration of MVOCs in the air decreases with the increase of the distance {{from the surface of the}} mould, due to diffusion.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesTechniques of {{peripheral}} nerve block have gained popularity {{over the last}} two decades becoming a growing anesthetic option for limb surgeries. This study proposes a technical approach of the tibial and common fibular nerves in the popliteal fossa with single puncture using percutaneous nerve stimulator, considering the correlation with an anatomical and ultrasound study. MethodsThis prospective, observational, randomized study was performed with 28 patients scheduled for foot surgeries. After localizing the tibial and common fibular nerves through percutaneous stimulation, the puncture was performed at the point of tibial nerve stimulation with a 5 -cm needle (B. Braun, Stimuplex 50), and 10 mL of levobupivacaine were injected. The <b>needle</b> was <b>pulled</b> back and redirected to the point of common fibular nerve stimulation looking for the corresponding motor response, and 10 mL of the local anesthetic were injected. Imaging study of the popliteal region was performed by ultrasound to correlate the anatomy with the technique used. ResultsAdequate anesthesia was obtained in all cases. The mean time to localize the tibial and common fibular nerves suing the percutaneous stimulator was 57. 1 and 32. 8 seconds, respectively, and with the nerve stimulator it was 2. 22 and 1. 79 minutes, respectively. The mean depth of the needle into the tibial nerve was 10. 7 mm. ConclusionsThe approach for tibial and common fibular nerves with single puncture in the popliteal fossa using {{peripheral nerve}} stimulator is a good option for anesthesia and analgesia for foot surgeries...|$|R

The time-frequency analysis of the generated dispersive waves was performed using the Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) that effectively decomposed the digitized waveguide mode enabling identification of defect characteristic frequency tendencies. Three different bond defects were evaluated: tensile <b>pull,</b> <b>needle</b> puncture, and crease. These induced flaws represent possible manufacturing defects such as de-bond, potential leak sources, and geometry irregularities. The frequency tendencies were found to uniquely identify each bond defect. Frequency tendencies were also found to uniquely identify localized stiffening due to an attached wire stent proving that this technique can unambiguously identify propagation modes from among non-propagation modes or vibrations. These findings demonstrate the utility of TAP-NDE and the GWT for quality inspection of small diameter polymeric medical tubing.

40|$|Background: Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) is a {{challenging}} technique that {{is associated with}} a steep learning curve. We describe a novel technique to develop bladder neck traction using a Foley catheter during extraperitoneal LRP to enhance bladder neck dissection, thereby improving patient and procedural outcomes. Materials and methods: The novel technique employed a four-trocar approach to prostatectomy, which involved the introduction of a 1 - 0 Vicryl suture into the extraperitoneal space using an Endo Close <b>needle</b> to <b>pull</b> up the Foley catheter tip and make the bladder neck prominent. From June 2006 to November 2012, clinicopathological data of 71 patients who underwent four-port extraperitoneal LRP (modified extraperitoneal LRP, Group 1) were assessed and compared with those from 22 patients who underwent transperitoneal LRP (Group 2) retrospectively. Results: The two groups were comparable in terms of pathological staging and Gleason score. The operative time was significantly shorter (p <  0. 05) and the total blood loss was less in Group 1 patients (p <  0. 05). No patient in either group underwent early reintervention for bleeding or blood transfusion. Bilateral or unilateral nerve sparing surgery was performed in 80. 3 % and 45. 5 % of Group 1 and Group 2 patients, respectively. The immediate, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year continence rates were, respectively, 19. 7 %, 38 %, 69 %, 91. 5 %, and 100 % in Group 1 and 18. 2 %, 50. 0 %, 77. 3 %, 86. 4 %, and 95. 5 % in Group 2. In Group 1, 100 % of patients were continent 12 months postprocedure. The potency rate was 71. 4 % in both groups. Conclusion: Improved bladder neck enhancement provides a clearer vision during bladder neck dissection. Similar functional results and cancer control rates were also encountered during modified extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy. This novel technique is a feasible method for performing endoscopic radical prostatectomy using four ports instead of five...|$|R

60|$|But if {{the child}} thus seeks the mother, does it then know the mother alone? To an infant the mother is the whole universe. Yet the child needs more than the mother. It needs as well the {{presence}} of men, the vibration from the present body of the man. There may not be any actual, palpable connection. But from the great voluntary center in the man pass unknowable communications and unreliable nourishment of the stream of manly blood, rays which we cannot see, and which {{so far we have}} refused to know, but none the less essential, quickening dark rays which pass from the great dark abdominal life-center in the father to the corresponding center in the child. And these rays, these vibrations, are not like the mother-vibrations. Far, far from it. They do not need the actual contact, the handling and the caressing. On the contrary, the true male instinct is to avoid physical contact with a baby. It may not need even actual presence. But present or absent, there should be between the baby and the father that strange, intangible communication, that strange pull and circuit such as the magnetic pole exercises upon a <b>needle,</b> a vitalistic <b>pull</b> and flow which lays all the life-plasm of the baby into the line of vital quickening, strength, knowing. And any lack of this vital circuit, this vital interchange between father and child, man and child, means an inevitable impoverishment to the infant.|$|R
30|$|The median {{colpotomy}} incision {{is carried}} out in the anterior vaginal wall starting 2 centimetres from the external urethral meatus and extending to the uterine cervix or to the vaginal apex in women who have had a hysterectomy. The urinary bladder is dissected {{all the way to the}} ischial spine. Two small skin incisions are made; one on each side of the linea alba one centimetre cranially and one centimetre laterally from the upper edge of the pubic bone. Additional two small skin-incisions are made in the posterior area of the obturator foramen;one on each side. The anterior/ pre- pubic needle is introduced laterally to the urethra behind the tendons of the bulbospongiosus and ischio-cavenosus muscles to the pubic bone (between the periosteum and tendon) and guided pre pubically along the major labia to the previously made suprapubic incisions. The anterior arms of the mesh are connected bilaterally to the tip of the <b>needle</b> and <b>pulled</b> to the suprapubic incisions. The posterior arms of the mesh are brought around the arcus tendineus of the levator ani muscles close to the ischial spine and connected to the transobtoratory introduced helix tip. The helix is gently pulled Backwards. It is most important to make sure that the sub-urethral segment of the mesh remains tension free, while the anterior mesh arms are fixed to the pre-pubic tendon. The posterior arms are brought around the arcus tendineus of the levator ani muscles. To reinforce the vaginal apex and the paracolpium, the posterior segment of the mesh is fixed bilaterally to the sacro-uterine ligaments with permanent stitches. The vaginal wall is closed using overlapping sutures. A vaginal pack is inserted for 48 hours.A total of 50 women with symptomatic, advanced POP and SUI were assessed. Their Mean age was 65, 3  years (36 – 84  years). The Follow up period was 24, 9  months. Examination schedule: All women were examined one week, 6  weeks, 8  months and 24  months and later after surgery. Nine women (18 %) had recurrence from previous treatments, seven of whom (14 %) after traditional prolapse operation and 2 (4 %) after biomesh implantation. Forty one women(82 %) were treated with Nazca TC primarily. Thirty women (60 %) suffered urinary stress incontinence, twenty nine (58 %) were sexually active. Sixteen women (32 %) had stage IV cystocele whereas 21 (42 %) had stage III cystocele and 13 (26 %) had stage II cystocele. Seven patients out of fifty (14 %) had uterus prolapse stage IV, 18 women (36 %) stage III., 12 (24 %) stage II, and 13 (26 %) had no uterine prolapse.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine whether the thrombosed portal vein can be recanalized via transjugular vein. 14 {{patients}} (age 51, 8 " 15, 8 years, 8 male, 6 female) were treated due to portal vein thrombosis. After transjugular puncture of an intrahepatic portal vein branch in the right liver lobe, we tried to introduce the guide wire in medial direction to the portal vein. When the wire deviated to lateral direction, the puncture <b>needle</b> was <b>pulled</b> and a Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire. The catheter tip was placed at the puncture site of the portal vein branch and directed to medial direction. The guide wire was then introduced to medial direction. The whole transhepatic puncture tract and the thrombosed part of the portal vein was dilated. If the thrombus involved the confluens of the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein, this vein was laso dilated. Then self expandable stents with diameter of 10 mm and length of 4 to 6 cm were implanted. In 12 of the 14 patients guide wire was successfully introduced into the superior mesenteric of splenic vein. Thus, the rate of successful access with the guide wire beyond the thrombosed portal vein was 86 % (12 of 14). The rate of technically successful TIPS implantation was 85 %. 9 of the 14 patients showed an occluded right portal vein. Transjugular access beyond the portal vein was achieved in 78 % of the patients (7 of 9). 5 showed partially thrombosed right portal vein. Transjugular access beyond the portal vein was achieved in 100 % of the patients (5 of 5) According to Chi square test the difference between occluded and partially thrmbosed portal vein was not significant with regard to the accessibility of the portal vein (p> 0, 05). In all patients in whom the guide wire could be introduced into the right portal vein, the portal vein could be accessed with the guide wire and the guide wire could be introduced beyond the thrombosed portal vein. 54. 5 % of the patients survived less than 6 months after recanalization and TIPS implantation. Leaving out the patients with malignant disease there were only 28. 6 % whon died within the first 6 months. 30 % of the patients needed a revision within the first year and 14. 3 % within the second year. We concluded that partially thrombosed portal vein is not a mechanical barrier or contraindication against TIPS implantation. In case of occluded portal vein with or without cavernous transformation recanalization should be attempted when there is a clinical indication. The rate of reintervention is not greater than in patientes without portal vein thrombosis. In patients without malignant tumor in the liver survival rate within the first 6 months after recanalization and TIPS implantation seems to be similar with the survival rate of patients without portal vein thrmobosis after TIPS implantation...|$|R
