40|$|Summary We {{measured}} xylem pressure potentials, soil os-motic potentials, {{hydraulic conductivity}} and percent loss of conductivity (PLC) due to embolism, and made microscopic observations of perfused dye {{in the white}} mangrove tree, Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f., (1) to determine its vul-nerability to air embolism compared with published results for the highly salt-tolerant red mangrove tree, Rhizophora man-gle L., and (2) to identify possible relationships between air embolism, permanent blockage of vessels and stem diameter. Laguncularia racemosa was more vulnerable to embolism than reported for R. mangle, with 50 PLC at – 3. 4 MPa. <b>Narrow</b> <b>stems</b> (5 -mm diameter) had higher PLC than larger stems (8. 4 -or 14 -mm diameter) of the same plants. Basic fuchsin dye indi-cated that up to 89 % of the vessels, especially in the <b>narrow</b> <b>stems,</b> had permanent blockage {{that could not be}} reversed by high pressure perfusion. Air embolism could lead to permanent vessel blockage and eventual stem mortality. Such vulnerabil-ity to embolism may restrict the growth of L. racemosa and limit its distribution to less salty areas of mangrove communi-ties...|$|R
50|$|Sisyrinchium elmeri is rhizomatous {{perennial}} herb takes a clumpy form, its <b>narrow</b> <b>stems</b> {{growing up}} to about 20 to 30 centimeters tall. It is medium green and nonwaxy, and it dries to a dark green or brownish color, but does not turn black. The flat, narrow leaves are grasslike. The flower has six tepals measuring roughly a centimeter long. They are yellow to yellow-orange with dark brown veining. The fruit is a dark brown capsule.|$|R
50|$|Concrete beams {{are often}} poured {{integrally}} with the slab, forming {{a much stronger}} “T” - shaped beam. These beams are very efficient because the slab portion carries the compressive loads and the reinforcing bars placed {{at the bottom of}} the stem carry the tension. A T-beam typically has a <b>narrower</b> <b>stem</b> than an ordinary rectangular beam. These stems are typically spaced from 4’-0” apart to more than12’-0”. The slab portion above the stem is designed as a one-way slab spanning between stems.|$|R
50|$|Carex occidentalis is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common name western sedge. It is native to the southwestern United States {{and parts of the}} west as far north as Montana. It grows mainly in dry habitat such as {{woodland}} and grassland. The plant produces very <b>narrow</b> <b>stems</b> up to about 90 centimeters in maximum height, sometimes with rhizomes. The inflorescence produces a cluster of several rounded flower spikes. The pistillate flowers are covered in scales which are brown with green, three-veined centers.|$|R
50|$|Pale flax grows as a {{biennial}} or perennial {{plant in}} dry, sunny calcareous or neutral grasslands from sea level up to 1000 m. It has long, <b>narrow</b> <b>stems</b> to 60 cm tall and slender leaves 1.5-2.5 cm long. The flowers have five petals about 1 cm long and nearly round; they are pale blue but streaked with darker colour. It flowers {{in late spring}} and, at least in more temperate regions, through the summer. The flowers are monoecious and are pollinated by bees and wasps.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Wood {{structure}} and function was investigated in different growth forms of temperate honeysuckles (Lon-icera spp.). All three species had many narrow vessels and relatively few wide ones, with the measured Kh (flow rate/pressure gradient) approximately 24 - 55 % of the theoretical Kh predicted by Poiseuille's law. Only the twiner, Lonicera japonica, had some vessels greater than 50 ~tm in diameter. The twiner also had the <b>narrowest</b> <b>stem</b> xylem diameters, uggesting the greater maximum vessel diameter hydraulically compensated for <b>narrow</b> <b>stems.</b> Conversely, the free-standing shrub, L. maackii, had the greatest annual increments of xylem but the least percent conductive xylem implying that a great portion of the wood was involved with mechanical support. The scrambler, L, sempervirens had low maximum vessel diameter, high Huber values (= xylem area/leaf area), and low specific conductivities (= measured Kh/xylem area), much like the shrub. The greatest vessel frequency occurred in the scram-bler (901 vessels, mm- 2), the highest hus far recorded in vines. The lowest Huber value and highest specific con-ductivity occurred in the twiner, suggesting little self-sup-port but relatively efficient water conduction. LSC (= mea-sured Kh/leaf area) and maximum vessel diameter of Lon-icera vines were near {{the low end of}} the range for vines in general...|$|R
5000|$|Ulmus davidiana is {{only rarely}} {{cultivated}} in the West, being unsuited {{to all but}} very sheltered, humid conditions, and is intolerant of ponding. In trials conducted by Butterfly Conservation at Great Fontley Farm, Fareham, England, specimens often grew too rapidly in the comparatively benign conditions, the <b>narrow</b> <b>stem</b> unable to bear {{the weight of the}} burgeoning crown, leaving the tree arching to the ground [...] ("Pruning can help the plant result in a more structurally stable branching pattern" [...] ). The same trees commenced flowering when aged nine years, in mid-March.|$|R
50|$|This {{perennial}} grass {{grows in}} tufts of <b>narrow,</b> erect <b>stems</b> {{up to about}} 80 centimeters tall. It grows from a rhizome, resprouting to form new tufts. It also reproduces by seed.|$|R
25|$|M. drewseni nests {{typically}} have one main comb {{and tend to}} be, on average, 14 cells in diameter. Each cell is hexagonal and about 4.75mm in diameter. These cells can be built by members of any caste within the colony, {{and all of the}} cells look alike. These single combs can be suspended by a <b>narrow</b> <b>stem,</b> which is typically 10mm in diameter. Usually, nests are constructed out of woody plant fiber. Pulp is utilized, as well, and can come from fence rails, planks, and dried cortex from stems from Verbenaceae, an herb plant. Sometimes, dried bark can be used.|$|R
50|$|Eremophila annosocaulis {{is a low}} shrub which {{grows to}} a height of about 0.8 m. Older {{specimens}} are weathered looking, twisted with a deeply grooved trunk is about 200 mm long, giving {{the appearance of a}} number of <b>narrower</b> <b>stems.</b> At the top of the trunk a number of branches separate, each very rough due to the remains of the leaf bases and is densely covered with many glandular hairs. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral near the ends of the branches and are 4-11 mm long and 0.7-1 mm wide. They are linear in shape, almost circular in cross section and are covered with many glandular hairs.|$|R
50|$|Horkelia clevelandii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the rose family known by the common name Cleveland's horkelia. It is native to the Peninsular Ranges of southern California and northern Baja California. This is a perennial herb forming clumps of long, fernlike leaves and erect stems. The leaves are up to 18 centimeters long and {{are made up of}} triangular to rounded leaflets, each toothed or lobed and covered in thin hairs. The <b>narrow</b> <b>stems</b> reach 10 to 50 centimeters in height and bear inflorescences of several flowers. Each flower has hairy, lance-shaped bractlets and pointed sepals.

25|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} shape, likened to a wineglass, the building stands {{out from the}} rest of the Admiralty waterfront buildings. Architects attribute the shape of the building to passive protection, its <b>narrow</b> <b>stem</b> with the protruding upper storeys, supposedly makes it difficult to climb or attack. It is also informally known as 'the upside-down Gin bottle due to its shape resembling a bottle of Gordon's Gin. The corner of the building at the podium level which faces east (towards Admiralty MTR station) used to be a chapel under British use of the barracks. There used to be a crucifix visible on the exterior—however, during external refurbishment (including replacing the 'Prince of Wales Building' inscription in English with its current name in Chinese), the cross was removed.|$|R
5000|$|Astragalus lentiformis {{is a small}} {{perennial}} herb {{forming a}} patch of spreading stems 10 to 20 centimeters long.

5000|$|A slender species, about 1 foot high. Leaf linear, hardly 5 inches. Bracts very <b>narrow,</b> <b>stems</b> clasping. Flowers one or two, bright red. Petals and sepals ovate-acute, about 5 lines. Column about 3 lines, {{produced}} {{above and}} behind the anther, but not hooded, slightly denticulate between the lateral appendages. Lateral appendages lanceolate, produced horizontally beyond the anther almost to a point, not ciliate, but covered on both sides densely with rugose glands. Anther obtuse, continuing to enclose the pollen masses behind the stigma, but produced over it. (This species {{is closely related to}} T. carnea, but the flowers are much larger and of a brighter colour. It opens constantly, is evidently not so absolutely self-fertilising, and is easily distinguished by the large and rugose lateral appendages of the column.) South Australia.|$|R

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} {{qualified}} students interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) {{has created a}} push for greater and more authentic exposure to STEM topics among K- 12 students. University science partnerships {{have been shown to}} be effective at increasing high school students’ interest and confidence in STEM fields. However, little research to date has explored the effects of these partnerships on students beyond the initial program. This study explored STEM interest and confidence in 322 middle school students involved in a GK- 12 program before and immediately after the program, then followed up with the students again in high school. Results indicated that students experienced slight losses in areas of STEM interest and confidence during the program, but greater, significant losses occurred after middle school. Male and female students, however, demonstrated a <b>narrowing</b> <b>STEM</b> aspiration gender gap by high school. Implications for university partnership programs are discussed...|$|R
