The institute is the largest centre for research and postgraduate education in psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience in Europe.

5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of <b>new</b> <b>treatments</b> for the disease.|$|E

40|$|Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) is an {{effective}} topical immunotherapy for recalcitrant alopecia areata (AA), which sometimes requires prolonged treatment. We developed a <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> protocol to shorten the duration of therapy. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> protocol with the standard treatment protocol {{in the treatment of}} recalcitrant AA. We conducted a 6 -year retrospective comparative study of patients with AA who received one of the DPCP treatment protocols at our institute. Patients’ information was collected and subsequent statistically analyzed. Thirtynine patients (16 in the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> group and 23 in the standard treatment group) were included. There were no statistically significant differences in area of hair regrowth. Mean duration to initial hair regrowth and mean duration to significant hair regrowth in the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> group were significantly shorter than in the standard treatment group (P= 0. 002 and 0. 01, respectively). Adverse effects were slightly higher in the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> group. The present study reveals the effectiveness and safety of the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> protocol, which shortens the duration of DPCP treatment and could represent an alternative regimen...|$|R

5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test <b>new</b> <b>treatments.</b> The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{assisted}} the Iraqi government through {{the supply of}} drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many <b>new</b> <b>treatments</b> were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} a complex {{contrast}} would be comparing 5 standard <b>treatments</b> to a <b>new</b> <b>treatment,</b> hence giving each old treatment mean a weight of 1/5, and the <b>new</b> sixth <b>treatment</b> mean a weight of &minus;1 (using the equation above). If this new linear combination has a mean zero, this will mean that the old treatments are not different from the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> on average. If {{the sum of the}} new linear combination is positive, this will mean that the combined mean of the 5 standard treatments is higher than the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> mean. If the sum of the new linear combination is negative, this will mean the combined mean of the 5 standard treatments is lower than the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> mean.

5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into <b>new</b> <b>treatments</b> for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

Options include interleukin-2 which is a standard therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma. From 2007 to 2013, seven <b>new</b> <b>treatments</b> have been approved specifically for mRCC (sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, sorafenib, everolimus, pazopanib and axitinib). These <b>new</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are based on the}} fact that renal cell carcinomas are very vascular tumors – they contain a large number of blood vessels. The drugs aim to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the tumors, hence slowing growth and in some cases reducing the size of the tumors.|$|E

50|$|A {{patient has}} a {{life-threatening}} condition {{and is expected}} to live on average for 1 year receiving the current best treatment which costs the NHS £3,000. A new drug becomes available that will extend the life of the patient by three months and improve his or her quality of life, but the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> will cost the NHS more than three times as much at £10,000. Patients score their perceived quality of life on a scale from 0 to 1 with 0 being worst possible health and 1 being best possible health. On the standard treatment, quality of life is rated with a score of 0.4 but it improves to 0.6 with the <b>new</b> <b>treatment.</b> Patients on the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> on average live an extra 3 months, so 1.25 years in total. The quality of life gained is the product of life span and quality rating with the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> less the same calculation for the old treatment, i.e. (1.25 x 0.6) less (1.0 x 0.4) = 0.35 QALY. The marginal cost of the <b>new</b> <b>treatment</b> to deliver this extra gain is £7,000 so the cost per quality life year gained is £7000/0.35 or £20,000. This is within the £20,000-£30,000 that is suggested by NICE to be the limit for drugs to be cost-effective.|$|R
