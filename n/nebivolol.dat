50|$|Beta {{blockers}} play {{a rather}} obscure role in HFpEF treatment but appear {{to play a}} beneficial role in patient management.

Additionally, because of the chronotropic perturbation and diminished LV filling seen in HFpEF the bradycardic effect of beta blockers may enable improved filling, reduced myocardial oxygen demand and lowered blood pressure.

Although there are four stereocentres, which could give 16 structures, there is a plane of symmetry running through the centre of the diester bridge, and so 6 meso structures (structures that can be superimposed by having the opposite configuration then 180° rotation) are formed. This reduces the number from sixteen to ten. There are three cis-cis isomers (an enantiomeric pair and a meso structure), four cis-trans isomers (two enantiomeric pairs), and three trans-trans isomers (an enantiomeric pair and a meso structure). The proportions of cis−cis, cis−trans, and trans−trans isomers are in the ratio of 10.5 :6.2 :1. isomers ≈ 58% cis-trans isomers ≈ 36% trans-trans isomers ≈ 6%.

40|$|<b>Nebivolol</b> is a beta 1 -adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonist {{that also}} reduces blood pressure by evoking endothelial NO production and vasodilation. We aimed at assessing whether <b>nebivolol</b> induces NO production {{also in the}} heart and delineating the molecular mechanisms involved. Using the fluorescent probe diaminofluorescein, we found that <b>nebivolol</b> induces a dose-dependent NO production in the heart, statistically significant already at 10 (- 7) mol/L. It is not an effect because of the blockade of beta 1 -adrenergic receptor, because this effect is not shared by another drug of the same class, atenolol. Because <b>nebivolol</b> {{has been reported to}} act as an agonist on other beta-adrenergic receptors, we tested NO production in the presence of receptor antagonists. <b>Nebivolol</b> was not able to induce NO production in presence of the beta 3 -antagonist SR 59230 A, indicating a fundamental role for beta 3 -adrenergic receptors in cardiac NO production by <b>nebivolol.</b> Moreover, inducible NO synthase inhibition abolishes NO release in the heart, indicating that <b>nebivolol</b> induces NO production by acting on the inducible isoform of the enzyme. The action of <b>nebivolol</b> on inducible NO synthase was confirmed by real-time PCR experiments, showing cardiac overexpression of inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase or endothelial NO synthase, after 5 hours of treatment with <b>nebivolol.</b> In conclusion, our study demonstrates that <b>nebivolol</b> also stimulates NO production in the heart. This action of <b>nebivolol</b> is exerted via a signaling pathway starting from the activation of beta 3 -adrenergic receptors and leading to overexpression of inducible NO synthase.

However, {{it is not known}} whether <b>nebivolol</b> administration plays a cardioprotective effect against myocardial infarction (MI) injury. Therefore, the present study was designed to clarify the effects of <b>nebivolol</b> on MI injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. MI model was constructed by left anterior descending (LAD) artery ligation. <b>Nebivolol,</b> b 3 -AR antagonist (SR 59230 A), Nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) or vehicle was administered for 4 weeks after MI operation.

Conversely, the cardiac protective effects of <b>nebivolol</b> were abolished by SR and L-NAME. These results indicate that <b>nebivolol</b> protects against MI injury.

We studied the effect of <b>Nebivolol</b> (200 mu M) on actin filaments remodeling and its impact on NO production and eNOS activation. Results showed that <b>Nebivolol</b> perturbs actin filaments polymerization, increases NO production and eNOS activity between 30 minutes and 1 h.

A NO-potentiating agent such as <b>nebivolol</b> may have an important role in hypertensive populations with reduced endothelial function such as diabetics, African-Americans and those with vascular disease. <b>Nebivolol</b> is a racemic mixture with beta-blocker activity residing in the d-isomer; in contrast, l-nebivolol is far more potent in facilitating NO release. <b>Nebivolol</b> is unique among betablockers in that, at doses < 10 mg, it does not inhibit the increase in heart rate normally seen with exercise.

40|$|<b>Nebivolol</b> is {{a third-generation}} beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonist (beta-blocker) with high selectivity for beta(1) -adrenergic receptors. In addition, it causes vasodilatation via {{interaction with the}} endothelial L-arginine/nitric oxide (NO) pathway. This dual mechanism of action underlies many of the haemodynamic properties of <b>nebivolol,</b> which include reductions in heart rate and blood pressure (BP), and improvements in systolic and diastolic function. With respect to BP lowering, the NO-mediated effects cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance {{and an increase in}} stroke volume with preservation of cardiac output. Flow-mediated dilatation and coronary flow reserve are also increased during <b>nebivolol</b> administration. Other haemodynamic effects include beneficial effects on pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, exercise capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, <b>nebivolol</b> {{does not appear to have}} adverse effects on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity like traditional beta-blockers. The documented beneficial haemodynamic effects of <b>nebivolol</b> are translated into improved clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension or heart failure. In patients with hypertension, the incidence of bradycardia with <b>nebivolol</b> is often lower than that with other currently available beta-blockers. This, along with peripheral vasodilatation and NO-induced benefits such as antioxidant activity and reversal of endothelial dysfunction, should facilitate better protection from cardiovascular events. In addition, <b>nebivolol</b> has shown an improved tolerability profile, particularly with respect to events commonly associated with beta-blockers, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Data from SENIORS (Study of the Effects of <b>Nebivolol</b> Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalization in Seniors with Heart Failure) showed that significantly fewer <b>nebivolol</b> versus placebo recipients experienced the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. The benefits of <b>nebivolol</b> therapy were shown to be cost effective.

Moreover, in both cell types, <b>nebivolol</b> induced rapid internalization of β-ARs indicating that <b>nebivolol</b> is also not a classical β-blocker.
