For this purpose, a series of tensile tests was performed using several types of specimens with different stress state under tension, including smooth bars, notched round bars and grooved plates. In addition, finite element (FE) simulations were performed for all tests, and its results were compared to the test results. From the comparisons, the equivalent stress and strain corresponding to maximum load and final failure of the notched round bar specimens were proposed as the local failure criterion which is a function of stress triaxiality at <b>notched</b> <b>area.</b> The criteria were verified by employing them to the estimation of maximum load and final failure of grooved plate specimen tests...|$|R

40|$|For the {{application}} of the notch stress approach, local stresses at the notch root have to be calculated.

This paper contains the detailed investigation of the required finite element mesh in the <b>notch</b> <b>area</b> for application of the notch stress approach. Based on small-scale specimens, various meshing rules are applied and compared to each other. As the most important factor for the efficiency of a finite element mesh, the element shape in the notch root was identified. It should be chosen according to the stress gradients: The higher the stress gradients are, the smaller the element edge length should be modeled. The shape of the subsequent elements inside the volume has no major influence on the accuracy of the calculation. Recommendations for practical use are given for various element types, including commonly used tetrahedron and hexahedron element with linear and quadratic shape function.

40|$|Reports of {{cardiovascular}} diseases in ancient time are very rare since the material mainly consists of skeletal remains; therefore, these diagnoses {{can only be}} carried out indirectly, through the marks left on bones. Here we show a case of {{coarctation of the aorta}} diagnosed on bones. Aortic coarctation is a congenital disorder in which a portion of the aorta is narrowed to various extent. A collateral circulation system is enrolled to allow adequate compensation of the blood flow. Collateral vessels may become enlarged, producing a distinctive notching on the pleural surface of the ribs and on adjacent bones. Excavation of a sixth to fifth century B. C. Etruscan tomb revealed three funerary chambers (celle) housing 14 skeletal remains of adults. The ribs of one of the male skeleton showed “nail stroke” indentations. Detailed macroscopic examination enabled us to identify them as notching and led to the diagnosis of postductal aortic coarctation.

For such a complex problem (three different panels, made of different materials, each one with a variable thickness and connected by numerous rivets), experimental crack propagation data were available for the numerical-experimental comparison.
