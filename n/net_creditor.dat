40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} for the neutrality of money under flexible exchange rates in an extended real-wage Mundell-Fleming model, with special emphasis on the specification of the behavior functions to correspond to their foundations in closed-economy macrotheory. It is shown that monetary expansion causes output first to decline, to eventually rise above its original level. However, if interest earnings on foreign securities dominate the trade balance in the expression for the exchange rate, monetary expansion leads to {{an appreciation of the}} exchange rate, while having an expansionary output effect. Money is neutral in the long run if either the wealth effect or foreign interest payments are abstracted from; if both are abstracted from, it is neutral also in the short run. Short and long-run neutrality results also if wealth consists only of foreign securities. The above responses hold both for <b>net</b> <b>creditors</b> and - with a minor qualification - debtors.

40|$|This {{research}} {{brings together}} the first estimates of capital flight in the MENA countries from 1970 to 2002. In addition, it explains the nature, volume, determinants and growth impact of capital flight in the resource-based and the resource-poor {{economies of the}} MENA region {{on the basis of}} their respective structural and institutional characteristics. Our findings suggest that cap-ital flight follows a systematic pattern depending on whether a MENA country is resource-based. The resource-based economies are found to be <b>net</b> <b>creditors</b> to the world economy and have ex-perienced more than 273 billion of 1995 USD in capital flight (average of 9. 42 percent of GDP). In these economies, capital flight is assisted by natural resource exporting rents, the outward ori-entation of most economies and the monarchial character of most of their political systems. In assessing the welfare impact, capital flight is shown to negatively and significantly affect eco-nomic growth in the resource-based economies. In contrast, the nonresource economies are shown to have experienced a net inflow of an unrecorded foreign exchange of $ 215 billion in 1995 USD (average of 9. 38 percent of GDP). These inflows are mainly reflected in smuggling of imported goods to avoid trade taxes and regulations and are assisted by the inward-looking strategies, one...|$|R

Our empirical task is to analyse {{the dynamics of the}} financial wealth of the institutional sectors in Bulgaria in the period 1998 - 2005 and to identify the major <b>net</b> <b>creditors</b> and <b>net</b> debtors. The empirical data used for the purpose are based on adapted methodology for the financial account of the Bulgarian economy according to the requirements of the System of National Accounts (SNA). Econometric simulations have been carried out of the major factors conditioning the change in the sectoral financial wealth. The empirical investigations are given in Part 3.

40|$|A perfect {{foresight}} OLG {{model is}} set up to study the dynamic response of a small open economy to a temporary fiscal impetus (bond-financed government deficit) anticipated to be closed by a mix of taxes, money finance and grant aid. The model is solved for the general mixed tax-money-aid finance case {{with a focus on}} the conclusions for the full-grant finance case in the hope to inform the ongoing debate on debt sustainability in post-HIPC Africa and to some extent crisis-prone emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina. The conclusions emanating from the model are that anticipated aid (or debt forgiveness) works like a ?proborrowing policy? inducing the economy to consume more, save less and hence run bigger current account deficits; the size of the immediate responses to the impetus as well as the long-term trajectory of the economy depends critically on whether domestic agents start off as net debtors or <b>net</b> <b>creditors,</b> outcomes being much less desirable in the former case; if future aid expects to replace taxes, consumption and the current account jump more when the real interest rate is low, consumption less important in the utility function relative to real balances, the instantaneous probability of death higher, and the bond-financed deficit regime of longer duration. To the extent that these conditions hold in the current HIPC context, and given the earlier results, the paper reinforces existing doubts over about the prospects of attaining longterm debt sustainability in Africa.

40|$|Our paper {{investigates the}} {{unexplored}} impact of education on inflation and {{of this relationship}} on economic growth. By using a sample of 102 countries observed on non-overlapping five-year data spells over the period 1963 - 2001, we find that average schooling years of the working population have a significant negative impact on inflation rates after controlling {{for the effects of}} the stance of domestic monetary policy. We also show that the negative impact of inflation on growth in conditional convergence estimates is significantly increased when the former is instrumented by educational variables. Our findings outline a third potential role of human capital on conditional convergence. They show that education is not only a production factor or a variable which may reduce demographic pressures, but also an important antidote against inflationary pressures which, in turn, negatively affect economic growth and conditional convergence. We interpret our findings by identifying three potential rationales for the education-inflation nexus: (i) education raises consumers 2 ̆ 019 awareness of their power in contrasting producers 2 ̆ 019 inflationary pressures; (ii) more educated individuals have lower inflationary expectations when they are also wealthier and their consumption bundle is relatively less (more) intensive in inferior (superior) goods with higher (lower) inflation potential; (iii) more (less) educated and wealthier (less wealthy) individuals tend to be <b>net</b> <b>creditors</b> (debtors) in their maturity, thereby contributing to increase (reduce) the power of anti-inflationary lobbies...|$|R

The warring nations had imposed severe limitations on trade between each other, as a neutral country, Sweden was not affected by these restrictions. The warring nations, such as the UK, to a large extent used the printing of new money as a means of financing the war, leading to inflation and thus causing the prices for Swedish exports to rise rapidly.
