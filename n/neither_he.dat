5|$|Even though Steuart {{had fought}} bravely under {{extremely}} difficult conditions, <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> {{nor any other}} officer was cited by Johnson in his report.

5|$|All {{remaining}} {{competitors in}} the tournament besides Volador Jr. and Doug Williams did not compete in TNA again for some time. Williams and Volador Jr both returned to TNA at their Turning Point PPV event on November9, competing in a Ten Man X Division Elimination Rankings match. Volador Jr. competed as Volador in the contest but <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor Williams were successful in winning the bout.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor his brother would take vengeance {{on those who}} had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, {{even if they did}} not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E

5|$|Yamashiro {{increased}} speed, but she {{had been}} hit by two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Bruce gave up {{his medical}} studies at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Dundee Whaling Expedition to Antarctica as a {{scientific}} assistant. This was followed by Arctic voyages to Novaya Zemlya, Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land. In 1899 Bruce, by then Britain's most experienced polar scientist, applied for a post on Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition, but delays over this appointment and clashes with Royal Geographical Society (RGS) president Sir Clements Markham led him instead to organise his own expedition, and earned him the permanent enmity of the British geographical establishment. Although Bruce received various awards for his polar work, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen, <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor any of his SNAE colleagues were recommended by the RGS for the prestigious Polar Medal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor TTS had the master tapes in their inventory and feared {{that they had}} been lost. He discovered the Denver City Council possessed the tapes among an inventory of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing the tapes and intended to dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of the tapes. Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return the tapes to Wurpel and U2.|$|E

5|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>he</b> nor Greenfield had {{run as a}} {{candidate}} in the election, and neither {{was a member of}} the legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became available when incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1864, {{before the}} siege of Paysandú, the Paraguayan {{dictator}} Solano López seized the Brazilian steamer Marquês de Olinda, beginning the Paraguayan War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay heading toward Paysandú, Brazil's government sent José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on 2 December {{and a few days}} later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor his government had any role in Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, laying waste to towns and the countryside.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man {{climbed over}} safety fences and {{accessed}} the underground ride area.

He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{is deeply}} troubled by Pfaster's crimes, and has unsettling dreams and {{hallucinations}} about the case. In Washington, {{she has a}} counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her anxiety about the investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota had called for her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor Bocks made the call. Tracing a fingerprint to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's fingers in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor his student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed {{on top of another}} on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga traveled to the Crimea by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister Grand Duchess Xenia. They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12miles (19km) from Yalta, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces. On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment. He was named after Tikhon of Zadonsk, the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino. Although Tikhon was the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor his younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he was}} not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The first {{event in}} which the team participated in 2009 was the Tour Down Under. As it was Armstrong's first event back {{after four years of}} retirement, he made lots of {{headlines}} and was even specially promoted on the event's webpage, though <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor the team were especially competitive in the event. Armstrong finished 29th overall, with the same time as Jesús Hernández in 28th as the best-placed Astana riders. The team did not finish in the top ten in any stage. In February, the team competed in the Tour of California, where Leipheimer won the individual time trial in Solvang and the Tour itself for the third straight year. The team also won the teams classification. While the Tour of California was ongoing, the team sent another eight-man squad including Contador and Andreas Klöden to the Volta ao Algarve. Contador and Klöden were first and third, respectively, in the time trial in Stage 4, giving Contador the overall lead which he retained through the conclusion of the race the next day.|$|E
5|$|This {{desertion}} further discouraged Bardanes, and, {{reluctant to}} face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the hegumenos of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch Tarasios and several leading senators which guaranteed that <b>neither</b> <b>he</b> nor his subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. As a further guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter. Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through Nicaea, sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at Cius. From there, he embarked on a ship that {{took him to the}} island of Prote. Taking the monastic name Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past.|$|E
