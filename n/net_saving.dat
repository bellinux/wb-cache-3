40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Through four rounds of base closures and realignments between 1988 and 1995, the Department of Defense (DOD) expected to reduce its domestic infrastructure and provide needed dollars for high priority programs, such as weapons modernization. Although DOD projects it will realize significant recurring savings from the closures and realignments, Congress continues to raise questions about how much, if any, money has been saved through the base closure process. Two GAO reports issued in late 1998 concluded that <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> from the four closure rounds were substantial but that the cost and savings estimates {{used to calculate the}} <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> were imprecise. This report reviews (1) the basis for DOD's recent increase in <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> projected to be realized from the closure process and (2) GAO's previous observations on the basis for savings from base closure and realignment actions and the precision of the cost and savings estimates. DOD's fiscal year 2001 budget request and documentation show that it now expects <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> of about $ 15. 5 billion through fiscal year 2001 and about $ 6. 1 billion in annual recurring savings thereafter, an increase from the $ 14. 2 billion and about $ 5. 6 billion, respectively, DOD reported in fiscal year 1999. GAO's analysis of the data showed that the <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> increase through fiscal year 2001 was due primarily to an overall reduction of about $ 723 million in reported costs and an increase of about $ 610 million in expected savings resulting from the closures. The <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> for the four rounds of base closures and realignments are substantial and are related to decreased funding requirements in specific operational areas. Reviews by the Congressional Budget Office, the DOD Inspector General, and the Army Audit Agency have affirmed that <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> are substantial after initial investment costs are recouped. However, those same reviews also showed that the estimates are imprecise and should be viewed as a rough approximation of the likely savings. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{interpretation}} of these equations is as follows. Given the savings-coefficients and the capital-gains-coefficient, {{there will be}} a certain valuation ratio which will secure just enough savings by the personal sector to take up the new securities issued by corporations. Hence the <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> of the personal sector (available for investment by the business sector) will depend, not only on the savings propensities of individuals, but on the policies of corporations towards new issues. In the absence of new issues the level of security prices will be established at {{the point at which the}} purchases of securities by the savers will be balanced by the sale of securities of the dis-savers, making the <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> of the personal sector zero. The issue of new securities by corporations will depress security prices (i.e. the valuation ratio v) just enough to reduce the sale of securities by the dis-savers sufficiently to induce the <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> required to take up the new issues. If i were negative and the corporations were net purchasers of securities from the personal sector (which they could be through the redemption of past securities, or purchasing shares from the personal sector for the acquisition of subsidiaries) the valuation ratio v would be driven up to the point at which <b>net</b> personal <b>savings</b> would be negative top the extent necessary to match the sale of securities by the personal sector.|$|R

40|$|The {{adjusted}} <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate, initially {{known as}} the genuine saving rate, was first published by the World Bank in the late 1990 s as a more comprehensive measure of national saving and one more indicative of sustainable development. The adjusted <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate incorporated not just physical capital depreciation, but natural capital depletion and environmental damage, as well as including some human capital formation. In this paper, using a cross‐section of developing economies for 2001 – 2006, determinants of the adjusted <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate are estimated. For comparison, the same determinants for the gross national saving rate are estimated. Also, a basic Solow growth model is extended to incorporate natural resources and to justify a more comprehensive measure of savings, such as the adjusted <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate, for modeling economic growth. The two measures of savings are then compared as determinants in estimations of economic growth.

40|$|The U. S. {{non-financial}} {{corporate sector}} became a net lender {{in the early}} 2000 s. In this paper we seek to understand why firms simultaneously carry <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> yet rely on equity financing. We first document the rise in corporate savings since 1970 s, and provide an account of which firms have become net savers. We develop a theoretical framework that rationalizes these observations. Debt is fiscally advantageous but subject to a no-default borrowing constraint. On the other hand, equity allows to suspend distributions to shareholders {{in response to a}} negative shock. As a result equity is valued to hedge investment risk, and since firms can achieve only partial insurance with equity, they also accumulate savings for precautionary reasons. We show that our model can match the large fraction of firms with positive <b>net</b> <b>savings,</b> and correctly predicts a number of additional cross-sectional moments. We then use the model to understand the factors behind the rise of corporate <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> in the U.

The latter is primarily due to a decline in dividend taxes in the 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|R
