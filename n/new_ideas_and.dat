5|$|The Latin American Boom was {{a flourishing}} of literature, poetry and {{criticism}} in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> came to international renown {{in a way}} that had not happened previously. Major figures of the boom include Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> methods of looking at the world.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2009, {{the series}} {{remained}} largely unmentioned, with the rights still fully belonging to Take-Two. In 2006, German-based Yager Development pitched a cover-based shooter to publisher 2K Games, who rejected the original concept of futuristic soldiers without Dubai as a setting. However, 2K offered {{them a chance}} to develop a reboot for the Spec Ops series, promising that they would have a lot of creative freedom. Development began in early 2007, with most other fundamentals of the initial game intact. While the game is an installment in the Spec Ops series, the team chose to use <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> intentionally avoided using existing elements of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, <b>new</b> <b>ideas,</b> <b>and</b> new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E

30|$|Here, Amabile et al. (1996) {{highlight}} {{both the}} ideation of the <b>new</b> creative <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> {{the ability to}} implement it successfully. This means using both the <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> <b>and</b> an organisational learning approach to execute collective successful implementation. The approach requires a variety of knowledge resources, from the <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> to learning how to apply and control resources for economic benefit on the <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> in a BMI, as highlighted by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) and Zott et al. (2011).|$|R
5|$|The architect, Mateus Vicente de Oliveira, {{had trained}} under Ludovice of Ratisbon and Jean Baptiste Robillon during the {{construction}} of the royal palace and convent of Mafra. The more sombre and massive classical palace at Mafra {{does not appear to have}} influenced the design for Queluz, which is in a lighter, more airy style. Work began in 1747 and continued rapidly until 1755, when it was interrupted by the Great earthquake of 1755, after which the labourers were more urgently required for the reconstruction of the city. The earthquake proved to be a catalyst, because the urban rebuilding process stimulated the development of the arts in Portugal. The subsequent architecture of Queluz was influenced by <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> concepts. When work recommenced in 1758, the design was adapted for fear of another earthquake. Thus the later works take the form of low, long buildings, more structurally stable than a single high block: as a result, viewed from a distance the palace resembles long enfilades linked by higher pavilions rather than one single construction.|$|E

25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, creativity {{may be a}} result of the outcome of years of generating ideas.

25|$|From the {{earliest}} days, the Umayyads {{wanted to be}} seen as intellectual rivals to the Abbasids, and for Córdoba to have libraries and educational institutions to rival Baghdad's.

25|$|During the 18th and {{the early}} 19th centuries, the Borgo kept its characteristics. The bourgeoises {{abandoned}} the rione for the new settlements in Campo Marzio, and Borgo became a quarter inhabited by simple people (artisans or workers at the Vatican), very devoted yet always open to <b>new</b> <b>ideas,</b> <b>and</b> men of the church, who appreciated the vicinity to the Holy See.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} {{researchers}} at experiment {{stations of the}} land-grant universities and USDA saw that adults in the farming community did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.|$|E
