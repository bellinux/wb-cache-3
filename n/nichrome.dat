25|$|The active {{medium of}} the heater {{depicted}} {{in this section}} is a coil of <b>nichrome</b> resistance wire inside a fused silica tube, open to the atmosphere at the ends, although models exist where the fused silica is sealed at the ends and the resistance alloy is not <b>nichrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mirror is}} {{aluminized}} by {{placing it in}} a vacuum chamber with electrically heated tungsten or <b>nichrome</b> coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. When they hit {{the surface of the}} mirror, they cool and stick. Some mirror coating shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.|$|E

Hook in clockwise direction represents 'r' after the stroke (tray, <b>Nichrome,</b> bigger). Hook in counter-clockwise direction represents 'l' after the stroke (ply, amplify, angle). For curved strokes eff, vee, ith, thee, ish, zhee, em, en, ing the hook is written in before the stroke is written and it represents 'r' after the stroke (other, measure, manner, every).|$|E
25|$|The fuse {{elements}} may {{be shaped}} to increase heating effect. In large fuses, current may be divided between multiple strips of metal. A dual-element fuse may contain a metal strip that melts instantly on a short-circuit, and also contain a low-melting solder joint that responds to long-term overload of low values {{compared to a}} short-circuit. Fuse elements may be supported by steel or <b>nichrome</b> wires, so that no strain {{is placed on the}} element, but a spring may be included to increase the speed of parting of the element fragments.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} {{image intensifiers}} {{use the same}} multialkali photocathode that the first generation tubes used, however by using thicker layers of the same materials, the S25 photocathode was developed, which provides extended red response and reduced blue response, making it more suitable for military applications. It has a typical sensitivity of around 230 µA/lm and a higher quantum efficiency than S20 photocathode material. Oxidation of the cesium to cesium oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity {{in a similar way}} to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a <b>Nichrome</b> electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.|$|E
2500|$|Electric heating is {{a process}} in which {{electrical}} energy is converted to heat. Common applications include space heating, cooking, water heating and industrial processes. An electric heater is an electrical device that converts electric current to heat. The heating element inside every electric heater is an electrical resistor, and works on the principle of Joule heating: an electric current passing through a resistor will convert that electrical energy into heat energy. Most modern electric heating devices use <b>nichrome</b> wire as the active element; the heating element, depicted on the right, [...] uses <b>nichrome</b> wire supported by ceramic insulators.|$|E
2500|$|Metal packing types {{can extend}} to wire {{packings}} of <b>nichrome</b> and inconel (akin to Podbielniak columns), to stainless steel gauze (Dixon rings), and indeed {{to any of}} the various special packing methods used in distillation (e.g., Hempel, Todd, and Stedman packing methods); for instance, wire-packed columns of the Podbielniak type function by providing large surface areas for vapor-liquid interaction with capillary-like spaces that very evenly spread the condensed liquid, such that [...] "channeling and flooding" [...] in the column [...] "are minimized", and giving, in one specific example, added theoretical plate counts of 1–2 per 5cm of packed length.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963 Fairchild's analog IC lineup, {{designed}} to military specifications, {{consisted of three}} amplifier circuits. Fairchild engineers before Widlar designed analog ICs like conventional circuits built with discrete devices. They had already realized the severe limitations of early planar process, which made this approach impractical, but had not proposed working alternatives (active loads and active current sources {{had yet to be}} invented). When the original schematic required resistor values that were too low or too high for planar process, the designers employed external <b>nichrome</b> thin film resistors. The resulting hybrid ICs performed poorly and were prohibitively expensive. Fairchild's R chief Gordon Moore directed the company to favor digital integrated circuits, which were relatively robust and promised high production volumes. Widlar opposed this strategy and held digital electronics in low esteem: [...] "every idiot can count to one". Talbert shared Widlar's belief and became his closest ally in the company.|$|E
2500|$|Wirewound {{resistors}} {{are commonly}} made by winding a metal wire, usually <b>nichrome,</b> around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The {{ends of the}} wire are soldered or welded to two caps or rings, attached {{to the ends of}} the core. The assembly is protected with a layer of paint, molded plastic, or an enamel coating baked at high temperature. These resistors are designed to withstand unusually high temperatures of up to 450°C. Wire leads in low power wirewound resistors are usually between 0.6 and 0.8mm in diameter and tinned for ease of soldering. For higher power wirewound resistors, either a ceramic outer case or an aluminum outer case on top of an insulating layer is used – if the outer case is ceramic, such resistors are sometimes described as [...] "cement" [...] resistors, though they do not actually contain any traditional cement. The aluminum-cased types are designed to be attached to a heat sink to dissipate the heat; the rated power is dependent on being used with a suitable heat sink, e.g., a 50 W power rated resistor overheats at a fraction of the power dissipation if not used with a heat sink. Large wirewound resistors may be rated for 1,000 watts or more.|$|E
2500|$|Gas flow {{proportional}} counters {{are used}} mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where {{there are multiple}} detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or <b>nichrome</b> of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to {{the ratio of the}} detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, aluminised PET film and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by [...] "pulse height selection" [...] in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.|$|E
50|$|Patented in 1905, <b>Nichrome</b> is {{the oldest}} {{documented}} form of resistance heating alloy. A common <b>Nichrome</b> alloy is 80% nickel and 20% chromium, by mass, {{but there are many}} other combinations of metals for various applications. <b>Nichrome</b> is consistently silvery-grey in colour, is corrosion-resistant, and has a high melting point of about 1400 C. Due to its low cost of manufacture, strength, ductility, resistance to oxidation and stability at high temperatures, as well as its resistance to the flow of electrons, <b>Nichrome</b> is widely used in electric heating elements such as in hair dryers and heat guns. Typically, <b>nichrome</b> is wound in coils to a certain electrical resistance, and when current is passed through it the joule heating produces heat.|$|E
50|$|The active {{medium of}} the heater {{depicted}} {{at the right}} is a coil of <b>nichrome</b> resistance wire inside a fused silica tube, open to the atmosphere at the ends, although models exist where the fused silica is sealed at the ends and the resistance alloy is not <b>nichrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Nichrome</b> wire is {{commonly}} used in ceramic as an internal support structure to help some elements of clay sculptures hold their shape while they are still soft. <b>Nichrome</b> wire is used {{for its ability to}} withstand the high temperatures that occur when clay work is fired in a kiln.|$|E
50|$|The {{heating coil}} {{is the actual}} {{resistance}} {{which is where the}} electrical load occurs. The most common type of metal alloy used for this purpose is a Nickel-Chromium mixture, also known as <b>Nichrome.</b> the <b>Nichrome</b> wire is wound around a ceramic core, and the number of spirals per inch vary according to the requested watt density. Potential from an alternating current source, which can either be 2 phase or 3 phase, flows through the coiled <b>Nichrome</b> wire, heating up the wire, which in turn, heats the cartridge heater sheath.|$|E

5000|$|Nichrome: Most heating {{elements}} use <b>nichrome</b> 80/20 (80% nickel, 20% chromium) wire, ribbon, or strip. <b>Nichrome</b> 80/20 {{is an ideal}} material, because it has relatively high resistance and forms an adherent layer of chromium oxide when it is heated for the first time. Material beneath this layer will not oxidize, preventing the wire from breaking or burning out.|$|E
50|$|Most hair dryers {{consist of}} {{electric}} heating coils and a fan (usually {{powered by a}} universal motor). The heating element in most dryers is a bare, coiled <b>nichrome</b> wire that is wrapped around mica insulators. <b>Nichrome</b> wire is used in heating elements because of two important properties: It is a poor conductor of electricity {{and it does not}} oxidize when heated.|$|E

50|$|To {{control the}} {{temperature}} of the interior of robosquirrel’s body, a coiled <b>Nichrome</b> 80 resistance wire was inserted and a cartridge heater was inserted into its tail. The temperature of the <b>Nichrome</b> wire and the cartridge heater were controlled by thermostats wired with thermocouples that were placed inside its body and tail. Power to the two heaters was regulated via the thermostats by using a proportional-integral differential (PID) control loop to regulate the duty cycle of the power relays.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nichrome</b> {{is used in}} the {{explosives}} and fireworks industry as a bridgewire in electric ignition systems, such as electric matches and model rocket igniters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nichrome,</b> a {{non-magnetic}} 80/20 alloy {{of nickel}} and chromium, {{is the most}} common resistance wire for heating purposes because it has a high resistivity and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures. When used as a heating element, resistance wire is usually wound into coils. One difficulty in using <b>nichrome</b> wire is that common tin-based electrical solder will not bond with it, so the connections to the electrical power must be made using other methods such as crimp connectors or screw terminals.|$|E
