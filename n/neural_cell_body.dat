HMSN are characterised by atypical neural development and degradation of neural tissue. The two common forms of HMSN are either hypertrophic demyelinated nerves or complete atrophy of neural tissue. Hypertrophic condition causes neural stiffness and a demyelination of nerves in the peripheral nervous system, and atrophy causes the breakdown of axons and <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> In these disorders, a patient experiences progressive muscle atrophy and sensory neuropathy of the extremities.|$|R

50|$|In neuroscience, a {{population}} spike (PS) is {{the shift in}} electrical potential {{as a consequence of}} the movement of ions involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials. Population spikes often reflect synaptically induced firing and therefore, they can be classified as a type of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In some areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, neurons are arranged in such a way that they all receive synaptic inputs in the same area. Because these neurons are in the same orientation, the extracellular signals from the generation of action potentials don't cancel out, but rather add up to give a signal that can easily be recorded with a field electrode.The PS is usually recorded with an extracellular electrode placed close to <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> or axons.The first interpretations of hippocampal field potentials were developed by Per Andersen.|$|R

Here, seven UFS kindreds with HPSE 2 mutations are presented, including one with deleted asparagine 254, suggesting a role for this amino acid, which is conserved in vertebrate orthologs. HPSE 2 mutations were absent in 23 non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder probands and, of 439 families with nonsyndromic vesicoureteric reflux, only one carried a putative pathogenic HPSE 2 variant. Homozygous Hpse 2 mutant mouse bladders contained urine more often than did wild-type organs, phenocopying human UFS.

The unlabeled peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex immunohistochemical technique was used. Controls of specificity for various peptides were studied with solid-phase absorption. Colchicine treatment {{was necessary to}} obtain positivity in many neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> In addition to their already known distribution, gastrin-cholecystokinins containing <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and fibers were present in olfactory structures, in various preoptic and hypothalamic nuclei (except in mamillary bodies), in mesencephalic nucleus linearis rostralis, and in A- 10, A- 9, and A- 8 regions of Dahlström and Fuxe, which include substantia nigra. From previous investigations and the present distribution study, it can be inferred that, {{although most of the}} brain material consists of cholecystokinin, gastrins may also be present in hypothalamo-posthypophyseal magnocellular cells, in nucleus tractus solitarii, and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The {{distribution of}} positive <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> in the peripheral part of the paraventricular nucleus and in the dorsal part of the supraoptic nuclei in the hypothalamus {{is similar to that of}} oxytocin neurons.

In the mouse, several kinesin motors have been characterized and are suggested to play roles in axonal and/or dendritic transport. One such kinesin is KifC 2. Sequence and secondary structure analysis revealed that KifC 2 {{is a member of}} the C-terminal motor family. Northern and Western blot analyses indicated that KifC 2 is specifically expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The cellular locations of the KifC 2 proteins were found to be mainly in <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and dendrites but also in axons. To understand the in vivo function of the KifC 2 gene, we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to construct knockout mouse strains for the KifC 2 gene.

40|$|Abstract. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{is present}} within neurons of the nervus terminalis, the zeroeth cranial nerve. In all {{vertebrate}} species, except in sharks {{where it is}} a separate nerve, the nervus terminalis consists of a chain of neurons embedded within olfactory or vomeronasal nerves in the nasal cavity. The function of the GnRH component of the nervus terminalis {{is thought to be}} neuromodulatory. Our research on GnRH effects on olfaction con®rms this hypothesis. The processes of GnRH <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> located within chemosensory nerves project centrally into the ventral forebrain and peripherally into the lamina propria of the nasal chemosensory mucosa. GnRH receptors are expressed by chemosensory neurons as shown by RT-PCR/Southern blotting and GnRH agonist binding studies. Patch-clamp studies have shown that GnRH alters the responses of isolated chemosensory neurons to natural or electrophysiological stimulation through the modulation of voltage-gated and receptor-gated channels. Behavioral experiments demonstrate that interfering with the nasal GnRH system leads to de®cits in mating behavior. These studies suggest that the function of the intranasal GnRH system is to modify olfactory information, perhaps at reproductively auspicious times. We speculate that the purpose of this altered olfactory sense is to make pheromones more detectabl...|$|R

Exactly 100 peptides, belonging to 18 genes, were demonstrated by MS. In a follow-up study we dissected and analysed separately all the ganglia of the CNS. The result is a mass spectrometric mapping of 20 neuropeptide precursors presented by not les than 66 peptides. We show the expression of one additional but already predicted neuropeptide.

NOS-immunoreactive (IR) <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> were more abundant than those positive for VIP-IR. The majority of myenteric neurones containing VIP coexpressed NADPH-diaphorase. Electrical stimulation of fundus strips caused frequency-dependent NANC relaxations. NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG: 300 [*]μM) enhanced the basal tone, abolished relaxations to 0. 3 – 3 [*]Hz (5 [*]s) and those to 1 [*]Hz (5 [*]min), markedly reduced (∼ 50 %) those elicited by 10 – 50 [*]Hz, and unmasked or potentiated excitatory cholinergic responses at frequencies ⩾ 1 [*]Hz. L-NOARG-resistant relaxations were virtually abolished by VIP (100 [*]nM) desensitization at all frequencies. Relaxations to graded low mechanical distension (⩽ 1 [*]g) were insensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX: 1 [*]μM) and L-NOARG (300 [*]μM), while those to higher distensions (2 [*]g) were slightly inhibited by both agents to the same extent (∼ 25 %). In the human gastric fundus, NOS- and VIP immunoreactivities are colocalized in the majority of myenteric neurones. NO and VIP mediate electrically evoked relaxations: low frequency stimulation, irrespective of the duration, caused NO release only, whereas shortlasting stimulation at high frequencies induced NO and VIP release. Relaxations to graded mechanical distension were mostly due to passive viscoelastic properties, with a slight NO-mediated neurogenic component at 2 [*]g distension. The difference between NO and VIP release suggests that in human fundus accommodation is initiated by NO...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} neuron {{substrate}} adhesion has been always {{a challenge for}} fabricating neuron-based cell chips and in particular for multielectrode array (MEA) devices, which warrants {{the investigation of the}} electrophysiological activity of neuronal networks. The recent introduction of high density chips based on the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, integrating thousands of electrodes, improved the possibility to sense large networks and raised the challenge to develop newly adapted functionalization techniques to further increase neuron electrode localization to avoid the positioning of cells out of the recording area. Here, we present a simple and straightforward chemical functionalization method that leads to the precise and exclusive positioning of the <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> onto modified electrodes and inhibits, at the same time, cellular adhesion in the surrounding insulator areas. Different from other approaches, this technique does not require any adhesion molecule as well as complex patterning technique such as,u-contact printing. The functionalization was first optimized on gold (Au) and silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) -patterned surfaces. The procedure consisted of the introduction of a passivating layer of hydrophobic silane molecules (propyltriethoxysilane [PTES]) followed by a treatment of the Au surface using 11 -amino-lundecanethiol hydrochloride (AT). On model substrates, well-ordered neural networks and an optimal coupling between a single neuron and single micrometric functionalized Au surface were achieved. In addition, we presented the preliminary results of this functionalization method directly applied on a CMOS-MEA: the electrical spontaneous spiking and bursting activities of the network recorded for up to 4 weeks demonstrate an excellent and stable neural adhesion and functional behavior comparable with what expected using a standard adhesion factor, such as polylysine or laminin, thus demonstrating that this procedure can be considered a good starting point to develop alternatives to the traditional chip coatings to provide selective and specific neuron substrate adhesion...|$|R

40|$|Mapping neural {{circuits}} can {{be accomplished}} by labeling a small number of neural structures per brain, and then combining these structures across multiple brains. This sparse labeling method has been particularly effective in Drosophila melanogaster, where clonally related clusters of neurons derived from the same <b>neural</b> stem <b>cell</b> (neuroblast clones) are functionally related and morphologically highly stereotyped across animals. However identifying these neuroblast clones (approximately 180 per central brain hemisphere) manually remains challenging and time consuming. Here, we take advantage of the stereotyped nature of neural circuits in Drosophila to automatically identify clones, requiring manual annotation of only an initial, smaller set of images. Our procedure starts by filtering the images to accentuate <b>neural</b> projections and <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> and then skeletonises the projections with a dimension reduction algorithm. Images are then registered onto a common template brain, allowing us to determine which projections and <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> are shared across different brains. We then determine whether the presence of a <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> or projection is associated with the presence of a clone, allowing us identify the neural structures that can reliably indicate whether a brain contains a specific clone. This enables us to detect the presence of clones in novel images by mapping their <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and projections and matching them against these informative neural structures. The approach is not limited to a specific labeling strategy and can be used to identify partial (e. g. individual neurons) as well as complete matches. Furthermore this approach could be generalised to studies of neural circuits in other organisms...|$|R

Dynamic changes were observed in astrocytes around GnRH perikarya in the mPOA as well as ME regions of the hypothalamus and also increase in the expression of NCAM and PSA-NCAM was observed after EBP induced gonadotropin surge in ovariectomised rat model.

To investigate the neural crest EMT, we performed live cell confocal time-lapse imaging to determine the sequence of cellular events {{and the role of}} cell division in the EMT. It was observed that in most EMTs, the apical cell tail is retracted cleanly from the lumen of the neuroepithelium, followed by movement of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> out of the neural tube. However, exceptions to this sequence include the rupture of the <b>neural</b> crest <b>cell</b> tail during retraction (junctional complexes not completely downregulated), or translocation of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> away from the apical surface while morphologically rounded up in M phase (no cell tail retraction event).

Nocodazole treatment blocked <b>neural</b> crest <b>cell</b> EMT and the resumption was dose-dependent. Latrunculin-A caused cell death at a very low concentration.

Actin crosslinkers such as &# 945;-actinin and actin-associated proteins like palladin also participate in pathways affected by these cytoskeletal inhibitors through their regulation of focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal organization, thereby modulating cell stiffness and migration.

40|$|Human dental {{follicle}} cells (DFCs) {{derived from}} wisdom teeth are precursor cells for cementoblasts. In this study, we recognized that naive DFCs express constitutively the early <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> marker b-IIItubulin. Interestingly, DFCs formed b-III-tubulin-positive neurosphere-like cell clusters (NLCCs) on lowattachment cell culture dishes in serum-replacement medium (SRM). For a detailed {{examination of the}} neural differentiation potential, DFCs were cultivated in different compositions of SRM containing supplements such as N 2, B 27, G 5 and the <b>neural</b> stem <b>cell</b> supplement. Moreover, these cell culture media were combined with different cell culture substrates such as gelatin, laminin, poly-L-ornithine or poly-L-lysine. After cultivation in SRM, DFCs differentiated into cells with small <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and long cellular extrusions. The expression of nestin, b-III-tubulin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neurofilament was up-regulated in SRM supplemented with G 5, a cell culture supplement for glial <b>cells,</b> and the <b>neural</b> stem <b>cell</b> supplement. DFCs formed NLCCs and demonstrated an increased gene expression of <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> markers b-III-tubulin, NSE, nestin and for small neuron markers such as neuropeptides galanin (GAL) and tachykinin (TAC 1) after cultivation on poly-L-lysine. For a further <b>neural</b> differentiation NLCC-derived <b>cells</b> were sub-cultivated on laminin and poly-L-ornithine cell culture substrate. After 2 weeks of differentiation, DFCs exposed neural-like cell morphology with small neurite-like cell extrusions.

In conclusion, we demonstrated the differentiation of human DFCs into neuron-like cells after a two-step strategy for neuronal differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of neurons from <b>neural</b> progenitor <b>cells,</b> {{the growth of}} axons and dendrites and the formation and reorganization of synapses are examples of neuroplasticity. These processes are regulated by cell-autonomous and intercellular (paracrine and endocrine) programs that mediate responses of <b>neural</b> <b>cells</b> to environmental input. Mitochondria are highly mobile and move within and between subcellular compartments involved in neuroplasticity (synaptic terminals, dendrites, <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and the axon). By generating energy (ATP and NAD +), and regulating subcellular Ca 2 + and redox homoeostasis, mitochondria may play important roles in controlling fundamental processes in neuroplasticity, including neural differentiation, neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter release and dendritic remodelling. Particularly intriguing is emerging data suggesting that mitochondria emit molecular signals (e. g. reactive oxygen species, proteins and lipid mediators) that can act locally or travel to distant targets including the nucleus. Disturbances in mitochondrial functions and signalling may play roles in impaired neuroplasticity and neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, psychiatric disorders and stroke.

40|$|The {{differential}} {{expression of}} the mRNA for the <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule (N-CAM) has been studied by in situ hybridization and compared with protein localization analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The distribution of mRNA during chicken embryonic development was analyzed in neural and nonneural tissues by using an RNA probe that detects all N-CAM mRNAs and a probe specific for the mRNA of the large cytoplasmic domain (ld) of N-CAM. The results provide {{a detailed description of}} the mRNA distribution for N-CAM. The distribution of mRNA for total N-CAM generally corresponded to that of protein but differed at a more detailed level of analysis. For example, the mRNA was localized only within the <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> of neurons, whereas the protein was also in neuronal processes; this differential localization was most clearly seen in the alternating layers of <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and fibers in the optic tectum and cerebellum. N-CAM ld mRNA, which arises from alternative RNA splicing, was expressed only in neural tissues, confirming previous biochemical and histological studies. Differential {{expression of the}} ld mRNA was detected in specific <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> types: N-CAM mRNA was present in the ependymal cells of the spinal cord and optic tectum, but mRNA for the ld form was absent. In contrast, the ld mRNA was among the N-CAM mRNAs found in the Purkinje cells and internal granule cells in the cerebellum. The differential expression of mRNAs for the N-CAM forms emphasizes the potential importance of alternative mRNA splicing in modulating adhesive events during embryonic development, particularly in the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProtein kinase (PK) inhibitors like {{staurosporine}} induce precocious epitheliomesenchymal transformation (EMT) of quail embryo neuralanlagencultured on the {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM) molecule fibronectin (Newgreen and Minichiello,Dev. Biol. 170, 91 – 101; 1995). We show here that this also occurs on laminin, vitronectin, and collagen type I and type IV, {{but not on}} polylysine or BSA. In the absence of cell–ECM adhesion, staurosporine produced a rapid increase in, rather than a loss of, cohesion in isolated neuralanlagenand increased the rate of reaggregation of dissociated <b>neural</b> <b>cells.</b> In the absence of cell–cell adhesions (i. e., with dissociated <b>cells),</b> almost all <b>neural</b> <b>cells</b> rapidly adhered to fibronectinin vitroand staurosporine made only a marginal difference to this. Almost no <b>neural</b> <b>cells</b> spread on fibronectin in control conditions but staurosporine stimulated spreading by almost all cells. When cell–cell adhesions were present, neuralanlageexplants were more difficult to dislodge by controlled shear from fibronectin substrates {{in the presence of}} staurosporine than under control conditions, but in both experiments and controls dislodgment was due to the <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> breaking proximal to the cell–fibronectin adhesion sites. EMT in <b>neural</b> <b>cells</b> in culture, both spontaneous and induced by staurosporine, involved rapid reduction in circumferential F-actin fibers and an increase in pancytoplasmic G-actin, as shown by fluorescent phalloidin and DNase I labeling. Loss of immunoreactivity for N-cadherin at cell–cell junctions also occurred in both spontaneous and induced EMT. However, in spontaneous EMT the cadherin changes preceded the actin changes, whereas in induced EMT, the reverse occurred. The results suggest that the molecules involved in EMT which are affected by PK inhibitors are cytoskeletal and link elements. These results also suggest that balanced cross-modulation among cell–cell adhesion molecules, cell–ECM adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal molecules can trigger and orchestrate EMT, without direct genetic supervision...|$|R
40|$|The <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> {{adhesion}} molecule (N-CAM) engages in diverse functional roles in <b>neural</b> <b>cell</b> interactions. Its extracellular part consists of five Ig-like domains and two fibronectin type III homologous (type III) repeats. To investigate the functional {{properties of the}} different structural domains of the molecule in cell interactions and signal transduction to the cell interior, we have synthesized, in a bacterial expression system, the individual domains and tandem sets of individual domains as protein fragments. These protein fragments were tested for their capacity to influence adhesion and spreading of neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> promote neurite outgrowth, and influence cellular migration patterns from cerebellar microexplants in vitro. Ig-like domains I and II and the combined type III repeats I-II were most efficient for adhesion of neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> when coated as substrates. Neurite outgrowth was best on the substrate-coated combined type III repeats I- II, followed by the combined Ig-like domains I-V and Ig-like domain I. Spreading of neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> was best on substrate-coated combined type III repeats I-II, followed by Ig-like domain I and the combined Ig- like domains I-V. The cellular migration pattern from cerebellar microexplant cultures plated on a mixture of laminin and poly-L-lysine was modified by Ig-like domains I, III, and IV, while Ig-like domains II and V and the combined type III repeats I-II did not show significant modifications, when added as soluble fragments. Outgrowth of astrocytic processes from the explant core was influenced only by Ig- like domain I. Metabolism of inositol phosphates was strongly increased by Ig-like domain I and less by the Ig-like domains II, III, IV, and V, and not influenced by the combined type III repeats I-II. Intracellular concentrations of Ca 2 + and pH values were increased only by the Ig-like domains I and II. Intracellular levels of cAMP and GMP were not influenced by any protein fragment. These experiments indicate that different domains of N-CAM subserve different functional roles in cell recognition and signal transduction, and are functionally competent without nervous system-derived carbohydrate structures...|$|R
