5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now {{more likely to be}} recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|There was {{significant}} rivalry for frequencies among Pirate stations, fuelled {{by the financial}} rewards that came from promoting raves, and as a consequence, it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> some stations to attack or destroy the transmitters and/or studios of their rivals for airtime.|$|E

5|$|Eva Perón {{spent her}} {{childhood}} in Junín, Buenos Aires province. Her father, Juan Duarte, was descended from French Basque immigrants, meanwhile her mother Juana Ibarguren, was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants. Juan Duarte, a wealthy rancher from nearby Chivilcoy, {{already had a}} wife and family there. At that time in rural Argentina, it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> a wealthy man to have multiple families.|$|E
5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E

5|$|Teams {{have the}} option of trading their picks to other teams in {{exchange}} for different picks, players, money, or a combination thereof. It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. Of the players selected in each draft and throughout its history, East Carolina has had 63 players picked.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E

50|$|It is <b>not</b> {{considered}} <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> {{there to}} be some statistical anomalies during data analysis. Some of the more frequently seen in health-related quality of life analysis are the ceiling effect, the floor effect, and response shift bias.|$|R
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|Tisdale {{testified to}} passing the order by {{telephone}} to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, {{and that it}} was correctly read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash, saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages. Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E

50|$|It would <b>not</b> be <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> the patrician consulars of {{the early}} {{republic}} to intersperse public office with agricultural labour. In Cicero’s words: in agris erant tum senatores, id est senes: ‘In those days senators—that is, seniors—would live on their farms’. This practice was obsolete by the 2nd century.|$|R
50|$|After grinding, any {{surfaces}} {{that require}} tight dimensional control are machined. Many castings are machined in CNC milling centers. The {{reason for this}} is that these processes have better dimensional capability and repeatability than many casting processes. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> today <b>for</b> castings to be used without machining.|$|R
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems and it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often {{turning out to be}} same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E
25|$|In {{a broader}} context, writing sacred {{literature}} was <b>not</b> completely <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> women during this time.

5000|$|Buddhists {{have a long}} {{tradition}} of communal living and there are several Buddhist communities in Japan. Therefore, the idea of communal living was <b>not</b> totally <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> Japanese Christians. The founders of Owa Community wanted to establish communal living modeled after the Buddhist Ittōen (jap. [...] ) commune, but based on Christian principles.|$|R
5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in {{duty-free}} shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>for</b> visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E
