5|$|Animal studies {{indicate}} that administration of bupropion at less than the recommended therapeutic dose may actually enhance the rewarding properties of <b>nicotine,</b> i.e., low doses augment <b>nicotine</b> self-administration and high doses attenuate it.|$|E
5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing <b>nicotine</b> diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for <b>nicotine</b> delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute <b>nicotine</b> and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century the {{practice}} fell into decline, {{when it was}} discovered that the principal active agent in tobacco smoke, <b>nicotine,</b> is poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his role}} as Don Draper {{required}} Hamm to smoke, he stopped smoking when he was 24 years old. On set he did not smoke actual cigarettes, but rather herbal cigarettes that do not contain tobacco or <b>nicotine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include <b>nicotine,</b> rotenone, {{strychnine}} and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, cannabis, opium poppy, and coca yield psychotropic chemicals. Poisons from plants include atropine, ricin, hemlock and curare, {{though many of}} these also have medicinal uses.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} {{substance}} abuse increases with PMS, mostly with addictive substances such as <b>nicotine,</b> tobacco and cocaine. One theory behind this suggests this higher level {{of substance abuse}} is due to decreased self-control {{as a result of}} the higher metabolic demands during the luteal phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of <b>nicotine</b> cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to <b>nicotine</b> replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} dismiss the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman sent him to Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe <b>nicotine</b> poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of <b>nicotine,</b> increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more common than anticipated, but <b>nicotine</b> dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{and smoking}} {{have shown a}} strong {{association}} in studies worldwide. Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily, and additionally smoke cigarettes with high <b>nicotine</b> content. Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{excision}} of aphthous ulcers has been described, {{but it is}} an ineffective and inappropriate treatment. Silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical cauterant. Apart from the mainstream approaches detailed above, there are numerous treatments of unproven effectiveness, ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments, including aloe vera, myrtus communis, Rosa damascena, potassium alum, zinc sulfate, <b>nicotine,</b> polio virus vaccine and prostaglandin E2.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, <b>nicotine,</b> heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include <b>nicotine,</b> caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|North Korea {{has set up}} {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is a}} national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and <b>nicotine</b> replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and <b>nicotine</b> come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and <b>nicotine</b> from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and <b>nicotine</b> shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it is now possible to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of <b>nicotine</b> replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding <b>nicotine,</b> caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. <b>Nicotine</b> is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher <b>nicotine</b> content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, <b>nicotine</b> stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of <b>nicotine</b> replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the <b>nicotine</b> and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained <b>nicotine,</b> a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and <b>nicotine</b> either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.|$|E
25|$|Beyond addiction, both {{short and}} {{long-term}} <b>nicotine</b> exposure have not been established as dangerous to adults, except among certain vulnerable groups. At high-enough doses, <b>nicotine</b> is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. <b>Nicotine</b> {{as a tool for}} quitting smoking has a good safety history. There is inadequate research to show that <b>nicotine</b> itself is associated with cancer in humans. <b>Nicotine</b> in the form of <b>nicotine</b> replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. <b>Nicotine</b> is linked to possible birth defects. During pregnancy, there are risks to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing e-liquid, has raised concerns over <b>nicotine</b> overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nicotine</b> – The {{association}} between ADHD and <b>nicotine</b> intake is well known, and limited {{evidence suggests that}} <b>nicotine</b> may help improve some of the symptoms of ADHD, although the effect is generally small.|$|E
25|$|A <b>nicotine</b> patch is a {{transdermal patch}} that {{releases}} <b>nicotine</b> {{into the body}} through the skin. It is usually used as a method to quit smoking. The <b>nicotine</b> patch was invented in 1988 by Murray Jarvik, Jed Rose and Daniel Rose.|$|E
25|$|Also, the <b>nicotine</b> {{obtained}} from smoking travels through a woman into her breast milk, thus giving <b>nicotine</b> to her child.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>nicotine</b> does {{play a role}} {{in acute}} episodes of some {{diseases}} (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation of adrenaline release, which raises blood pressure, heart and respiration rate, and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has {{led to the development of}} various <b>nicotine</b> delivery systems, such as the <b>nicotine</b> patch or <b>nicotine</b> gum, that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering <b>nicotine</b> without the harmful combustion by-products. This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} evidence to classify <b>nicotine</b> as a carcinogen, {{there is an}} ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. In vitro studies have associated it with cancer, but carcinogenicity has not been demonstrated in vivo. There is inadequate research to demonstrate that <b>nicotine</b> is associated with cancer in humans, but there is evidence indicating possible oral, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer risks. <b>Nicotine</b> {{in the form of}} <b>nicotine</b> replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. <b>Nicotine</b> replacement products have not been shown to be associated with cancer in the real world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nicotine,</b> {{which is}} {{contained}} in cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products, is a stimulant {{and is one of}} the main factors leading to continued tobacco smoking. <b>Nicotine</b> is a highly addictive psychoactive chemical. When tobacco is smoked, most of the <b>nicotine</b> is pyrolyzed; a dose sufficient to cause mild somatic dependency and mild to strong psychological dependency remains. The amount of <b>nicotine</b> absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. There is also a formation of harmane (a MAO inhibitor) from the acetaldehyde in cigarette smoke, which seems to play an important role in <b>nicotine</b> addiction probably by facilitating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to <b>nicotine</b> stimuli. According to studies by Henningfield and Benowitz, <b>nicotine</b> is more addictive than cannabis, caffeine, ethanol, cocaine, and heroin when considering both somatic and psychological dependence. However, due to the stronger withdrawal effects of ethanol, cocaine and heroin, <b>nicotine</b> may have a lower potential for somatic dependence than these substances. About half of Canadians who currently smoke have tried to quit. McGill University health professor Jennifer O'Loughlin stated that <b>nicotine</b> addiction can occur as soon as five months after the start of smoking.|$|E
25|$|The {{carcinogenity}} {{of tobacco}} smoke is not explained by <b>nicotine</b> per se, {{which is not}} carcinogenic or mutagenic, although it is a metabolic precursor for several compounds which are. In addition, it inhibits apoptosis, therefore accelerating existing cancers. Also, NNK, a <b>nicotine</b> derivative converted from <b>nicotine,</b> can be carcinogenic.|$|E
