5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> generation that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce <b>net</b> <b>energy.</b> Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E

5|$|Stars {{generate}} {{energy by}} the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements {{that have an}} atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans. The degeneracy pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter {{the force of gravity}} and prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of energy output creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lithium {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E

Advanced building design, optimal selection and sizing of building components, and energy efficient operation are among the key ways of significantly reducing overall building energy demand. Achieving reduction in energy demand is a key directive of the <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> building concept. Building designs dedicated to meeting <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> building requirements are becoming more commonplace as a path towards reducing the overall emissions from the built environment.

40|$|Developing {{a design}} {{philosophy}} to reduce carbon emissions from {{the built environment}} is a major motivator {{for the formation of}} the <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> concept. For <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> buildings to be widely adopted, {{a deeper understanding of the}} drivers of their success is needed, as well as their comparative differences and similarities to buildings of more conventional design. This thesis investigates the effects of different building design and operation principles in relation to <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> buildings. Simulations of three case study buildings (two of which are designed to be <b>net</b> zero <b>energy)</b> were performed to identify the building design and operation elements which contribute most to energy efficiency. Through development and validation of building models of both net zero and conventional designs in this thesis, it was found that validation of smaller, more energy efficient building models can present challenges less commonly encountered in models of more conventional buildings. An understanding of the sensitivities of <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> buildings to alterations in design and specification were gained. Results show that <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> buildings are more sensitive to changes such as glazing type, and HVAC setpoint based on the case studies presented. This thesis has looked at quantifying the contribution of different building elements and systems to overall energy savings via simulation. The net impact of different glazing types, lighting control methods, window shading schedules, and HVAC set points on overall building energy consumption were examined. This thesis also reports on the <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> balance for one case study building. Results show that the building was net positive for the 12 -month period considered. Both energy imported/exported and energy generated/consumed were considered, as well as the load matching, grid interaction, and some preliminary analysis of power quality factors. These power quality factors and their relationship with <b>net</b> zero <b>energy</b> buildings must be understood before the net zero concept can be widely adopted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} recovering global fields of near-surface <b>net</b> available <b>energy</b> (the sum of the sensible and latent heat flux or {{the difference between the}} net radiation and surface heat accumulation) using satellite visible and infra-red products derived from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and MODIS (MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) platforms. The method focuses on first specifying net surface radiation by considering its various shortwave and longwave components. This was then used in a surface energy balance equation in conjunction with satellite day-night surface temperature difference to derive 12 h discrete time estimates of surface system heat capacity and heat accumulation, leading directly to a retrieval for surface <b>net</b> available <b>energy.</b> Both <b>net</b> radiation and <b>net</b> available <b>energy</b> estimates were evaluated against ground truth data taken from 30 terrestrial tower sites affiliated to the FLUXNET network covering 7 different biome classes. This revealed a relatively good agreement between the satellite and tower data, with a pooled root mean square deviation of 98 and 72 W m − 2 for net radiation and <b>net</b> available <b>energy,</b> respectively, with little bias particularly for the <b>net</b> available <b>energy...</b>|$|R
