5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album. Butler said that their writing {{approach}} changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way {{they looked at the}} songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, who was in a soul band.|$|E

Lana develops a sexual attraction to Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) and reveals {{to her that}} she knows of an escape route: the secret tunnel she first entered the asylum through. Grace agrees to assist her on the sole condition that Kit (Evan Peters) be taken with them, which Lana refuses, stating that she cannot allow a serial murderer like Kit to go free.|$|E

She later married the baby's father, José Trinidad Marín, and they had two more children: Jacqueline (born 1989) and Michael (born 1991), but she ended the {{marriage}} in 1992 citing physical and emotional abuse. In 1997 her younger sister Rosie confessed that Jenni's ex-husband (Marín) used to sexually molest her, and was <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> the same to Chiquis, physical examination showed he'd done the same with Jacqie. The molestation case was opened in 1997 and Marín spent 9 years as a fugitive before he was apprehended in April 2006, convicted of sexual assault and rape and sentenced to more than 31 years in prison without parole.|$|E

25|$|As of {{his final}} season in 2016, Scully called {{approximately}} 100 games per season (all home games and select road games in San Francisco, San Diego, and Anaheim) for both flagship radio station KLAC and television outlet SportsNet LA. Scully was simulcast {{for the first three}} innings of each of his appearances, then announced the remaining innings only for the TV audience. If Scully was calling the game, Charley Steiner took over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Rick Monday as color commentator. If Scully was not calling the game, either Joe Davis or Steiner would call the entire game on television with Orel Hershiser and Nomar Garciaparra on color commentary. while Monday, <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> play-play, joined Kevin Kennedy on radio. Through 2014, in the event the Dodgers were in postseason play, Scully called the first three and last three innings of each radio broadcast alone, with Steiner and Monday handling the middle innings.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{adventure}} tour sites is boating upward on the Chay River into primitive forests, as the river becomes sinuous with several waterfalls and whirlpools until tourists arrive at Tro Mong. This tour sites have been surveyed and included in local travel agents besides cave exploration tour. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park, {{there is a}} 50 m-high waterfall, Chai Waterfall. There is a bull field called Ran Bo (Bull Field) because wild bulls usually comes and reproduce in mating season. There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nước Ngang ("Horizontal Spring"), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; Ðá Nằm (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Thớt (Chopping Board), a chopping-board-shaped stone. But above all, the most spectacular scene is this area is Nước Trồi (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground. Several streams here run for a long distance, then disappear under the ground. The provincial Centre for Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng's Ecotourism and Culture currently has 248 boats, creating jobs for 500 locals. Every boat has two trained boatmen earning VND70,000 per day. This income is relatively high for peasants in this province. This centre also launched a programme in 2000 to train former loggers to work as photographers taking pictures for tourists and about 300 former loggers are <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> this.|$|E
25|$|Jackson's {{orders from}} Johnston were to prevent Banks's force from leaving the Valley, which it {{appeared}} they were <b>now</b> <b>doing.</b> Jackson turned his men around and, {{in one of}} the more grueling forced marches of the war, moved northeast 25 miles on March 22 and another 15 to Kernstown on the morning of March 23. His cavalry, under Col. Turner Ashby, skirmished with the Federals on March 22, during which engagement Shields was wounded with a broken arm from an artillery shell fragment. Despite his injury, Shields sent part of his division south of Winchester and one brigade marching to the north, seemingly abandoning the area, but in fact halting nearby to remain in reserve. He then turned over tactical command of his division to Col. Nathan Kimball, although throughout the battle to come, he sent numerous messages and orders to Kimball. Confederate loyalists in Winchester mistakenly informed Turner Ashby that Shields had left only four regiments and a few guns (about 3,000 men) and that these remaining troops had orders to march for Harpers Ferry in the morning. Ashby, who normally had a reputation as a reliable cavalry scout, inexplicably did not verify the civilian reports and passed them on to Jackson. Jackson marched aggressively north with his 3,000-man division, reduced from its peak as stragglers fell out of the column, unaware that he was soon to be attacking almost 9,000 men.|$|E

500|$|In April 1850, the Ohio Women's Convention met in Salem, Ohio a {{few weeks}} before a state {{convention}} met to revise the Ohio state constitution. The women's convention sent a communication to the constitutional convention requesting that the new constitution secure the same political and legal rights for women that were guaranteed to men. [...] Stone sent a letter praising their initiative and said, “Massachusetts ought to have taken the lead in the work you are <b>now</b> <b>doing,</b> but if she chooses to linger, let her young sisters of the West set her a worthy example; and if the ‘Pilgrim spirit is not dead,’ we’ll pledge Massachusetts to follow her.” ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Stone's {{performance}} and Raimi's directing. [...] "Stone's presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Raimi, the cult filmmaker <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> {{his best to}} reinvent the B movie {{in a spirit of}} self-referential glee." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the film for being overtly cliché, but praised Raimi's direction and Dante Spinotti's cinematography. Critic and Raimi biographer Bill Warren wrote that the film [...] "is a very conscious (though not self-conscious) attempt to recreate some of the themes, style and appeal of Sergio Leone's majestically operatic Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s, especially the Man with No Name trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. It's brisker, more romantic and somehow more American than Leone's movies." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My Man" [...] is a pop and R {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. described by Nick Levine of Digital Spy as a [...] "sassy R club banger". The song is notably different from her previous ballad, [...] "It's My Time", featuring a more contemporary R sound than the latter. Speaking upon {{the change in}} musical direction, Ewen clarified: [...] "What I'm <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> now is really me, [...] so if people don't like it I'm {{going to take it}} more personally." [...] "My Man" [...] opens with electro and bass-driven R beats, synthesizers that are reminiscent of those featured in [...] "Yeah!" [...] by Usher, and later develops into [...] "a pop/R stormer". The lyrical content of [...] "My Man" [...] is about a woman who [...] "pledges devotion to a man who sounds almost too good to be true". Ewen stated that the lyrics were not directed at any man in particular.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} toward Tom's cameo {{appearance was}} met with generally positive reviews. Christopher Hootan of Metro opined [...] "the return of Tom Quinn as a hired assassin in the final few seconds was a nice nod to early series of show." [...] Rob McLaughlin of Den of Geek noted that Tom's return among the final few minutes of the show was [...] "a welcome return from an old friend," [...] while Dork Adore reviewer Nick Bryan called it [...] "a nice touch," [...] also reflecting that it [...] "nailed home the central moral: no-one ever escapes from the horror. (Especially since that guy was written out of the show due to an attack of conscience, yet is <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> Harry’s dirty work.)" [...] Vicky Frost of The Guardian meanwhile, felt the cameo [...] "made no sense at all. Obviously it was super cheesy," [...] but she [...] "obviously" [...] "completely loved it – despite knowing it was coming." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron Swanson {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, where he repeatedly denies Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park {{because he does not}} believe the parks department should build parks at all. He agrees to green-light the project only when city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) secretly cashes in an unspecified favor in exchange for the approval. In a deleted scene from the episode [...] "Canvassing," [...] Ron tries to leave government employment for a previously offered job at an Internet flower company. However, when he finds that business is <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> extremely poorly, Ron sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In the episode [...] "Boys' Club," [...] Ron attends a disciplinary hearing with Leslie after she gets in trouble when the underage April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) is seen drinking alcohol on a video on the Pawnee website. Ron interrupts half-way through the review, defends Leslie and angrily berates the panel for aggressively questioning her. Although Ron claims he did it only due to his hatred for bureaucratic procedures, it is implied that he really did so out of respect for Leslie.|$|E
500|$|Once there, Percy {{seeks out}} Nereus and learns that the monster Artemis was hunting is Bessie, the monster he saved, {{who is an}} ophiotaurus. After a final {{encounter}} with Dr. Thorn in which Percy pleads with Mr. D to help him defeat the manticore, Grover heads back to Camp Half-Blood with the ophiotaurus. Zoë, Percy, and Thalia go to find Frederick Chase {{in the hope that}} he will help them reach their final destination: Mount Tamalpais, which is the modern location of the Titans' fortress on Mount Othrys. With Mr. Chase's car, they travel to the Garden of Hesperides. Zoë is wounded by the dragon Ladon while they pass through. From the place where Atlas once held up the sky, they see Artemis <b>now</b> <b>doing</b> his job. Seeing Annabeth tied up and held hostage by Luke and learning that [...] "the General" [...] is Zoë's father, the Titan Atlas, Percy takes the sky from Artemis so she can fight the Titan's advance guard. Artemis engages Atlas and is able to trap him under the sky again, but not before he seriously wounds Zoë by pushing her off of a cliff. Thalia battles Luke, and he falls from a cliff, apparently dead. With the help of Mr. Chase, who arrives in a biplane he has fitted with machine guns with Celestial bronze bullets, they escape and travel to a nearby airfield in Artemis' silver chariot. Zoë dies shortly after landing and Artemis makes a constellation in her honor. The rest of the group then heads for Olympus.|$|E

Thompson also asked Vanzetti to swear to his and Sacco's innocence one last time, and Vanzetti did. Celestino Madeiros, whose execution had been delayed in case his testimony was required at another trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, was executed first. Sacco was next and walked quietly to the electric chair, then shouted [...] "Farewell, mother."

I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain.
