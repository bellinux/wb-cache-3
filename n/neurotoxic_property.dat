40|$|Jungherr (1), in 1949, {{noted the}} {{occurrence}} of encephalitis during several outbreaks of the chronic respiratory disease (CRD) of turkeys, then {{considered to be a}} virus disease, and demonstrated necrotizing and inflammatory lesions of the cerebral arteries in affected birds. Adler et al. (2), in 1954, cultivated a mycoplasma, now designated Mycoplasma gallisepticum, from the tissues of turkeys with CRD, and established the capacity of this organism to reproduce the sinusitis and aerocystitis characteristic of the natural disease. A neurotropic strain of M. gallisepticura was recovered by Zander in 1954 from the brain of a turkey with torticollis. This strain was shown by Cordy and Adler (3) to produce a fatal encephalopathy in young turkey poults, with the predominant lesions confined to the arteries of the central nervous system.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Tat protein is a key pathogenic factor {{in a variety of}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -associated disorders. A number of studies have documented the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>property</b> of Tat protein, and Tat has therefore been proposed to contribute to AIDS-associated neurological diseases. Nevertheless, the bulk of these studies are performed in in vitro neuronal cultures without taking into account the intricate cell-cell interaction in the brain, or by injection of recombinant Tat protein into the brain, which may cause secondary stress or damage to the brain. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the roles of Tat protein in HIV- 1 neuropathogenesis, we attempted to establish a transgenic mouse model in which Tat expression was regulated by both the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter and a doxycycline (Dox) -inducible promoter. In the present study, we characterized the phenotypic and neuropathogenic features of these mice. Both in vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that Tat expression occurred exclusively in astrocytes and was Dox-dependent. Tat expression in the brain caused failure to thrive, hunched gesture, tremor, ataxia, and slow cognitive and motor movement, seizures, and premature death. Neuropathologies of these mice were characterized by breakdown of cerebellum and cortex, brain edema, astrocytosis, degeneration of neuronal dendrites, neuronal apoptosis, and increased infiltration of activated monocytes and T lymphocytes. These results together demonstrate that Tat expression in the absence of HIV- 1 infection is sufficient to cause neuropathologies similar to most of those noted in the brain of AIDS patients, and provide the first evidence in the context of a whole organism to support a critical role of Tat protein in HIV- 1 neuropathogenesis. More importantly, our data suggest that the Dox inducible, brain-targeted Tat transgenic mice offer an in vivo model for delineating the molecular mechanisms of Tat neurotoxicity and for developing therapeutic strategies for treating HIV-associated neurological disorders...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of nanostructured materials, especially metallic nanoparticles, has accrued utmost interest {{over the past}} decade owing to their unique properties that make them applicable in different fields of science and technology. The limitation to the use of these nanoparticles is the paucity of an effective method of synthesis that will produce homogeneous size and shape nanoparticles as well as particles with limited or no toxicity to the human health and the environment. The biological method of nanoparticle synthesis is a relatively simple, cheap and environmentally friendly method than the conventional chemical method of synthesis and thus gains an upper hand. The biomineralization of nanoparticles in protein cages is one of such biological approaches used in the generation of nanoparticles. This method of synthesis apart from being a safer method in the production of nanoparticles is also able to control particle morphology. In this study, a comparative biological synthesis, characterization and biomedical effects of metallic nanoparticles of platinum, gold and silver were investigated. Metallic nanoparticles were biologically synthesized using cage-like (apoferritin), barrel-like (GroEL) and non-caged (ribonuclease) proteins. Nanoparticles generated were characterized using common techniques such as UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled optical emission spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and energy dispersion analysis of X-rays (EDAX). Nanoparticles synthesised biologically using apoferritin, GroEL and RNase with exhibited similar chemical and physical properties as thoses nanoparticles generated chemically. In addition, the metallic nanoparticles fabricated within the cage-like and barrel-like cavities of apoferritin and GroEL respectively, resulted in nanoparticles with relatively uniform morphology as opposed to those obtained with the non-caged ribonuclease. The enzymatic (ferroxidase) activity of apoferritin was found to be greatly enhanced with platinum (9 -fold), gold (7 -fold) and silver (54 -fold) nanoparticles. The ATPase activity of GroEL was inhibited by silver nanoparticles (64 %), was moderately activated by gold nanoparticles (47 %) and considerably enhanced by platinum nanoparticles (85 %). The hydrolytic activity of RNase was however, lowered by these metallic nanoparticles (90 % in Ag nanoparticles) and to a higher degree with platinum (95 %) and gold nanoparticles (~ 100 %). The effect of synthesized nanoparticles on the respective enzyme activities of these proteins was also investigated and the potential <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>property</b> of these particles was also determined by an in vitro interaction with acetylcholinesterase. Protein encapsulated nanoparticles with apoferrtin and GroEL showed a decreased inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (50 %). Thus, it can be concluded that the cavities of apoferitin and GroEL acted as nanobiofactories for the synthesis and confinement of {{the size and shape of}} nanoparticles. Furthermore, the interior of these proteins provided a shielding effect for these nanoparticles and thus reduced/prevented their possible neurotoxic effect and confirmed safety in their method of production and application. The findings from this study would prove beneficial in the application of these nanoparticles as a potential drug/drug delivery vehicle for the prevention, treatment/management of diseases associated with these enzymes/proteins. ...|$|E

40|$|Oxidative stress, {{manifested}} by protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation and 3 -nitrotyrosine formation, {{among other}} indices, is observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. Amyloid b-peptide (1 – 42) [Ab(1 – 42) ] may be {{central to the}} pathogenesis of AD. Our laboratory and others have implicated Ab(1 – 42) -induced free radical oxidative stress in the neurodegeneration observed in AD brain. This paper reviews some of these studies from our laboratory. Recently, we showed both in-vitro and in-vivo that methionine residue 35 (Met- 35) of Ab(1 – 42) was critical to its oxidative stress and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>properties.</b> Because the C-terminal region of Ab(1 – 42) is helical, and invoking the i 1 4 rule of helices, we hypothesized that the carboxyl oxygen of lle- 31, known to be within a van der Waals distance of the S atom of Met- 35, would interact with the latter. This interaction could alter the susceptibility for oxidation of Met- 35, i. e. free radical formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, substitution of lle- 31 by the helixbreaking amino acid, proline, completely abrogated the oxidative stress and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of Ab(1 – 42).

Targeting mechanisms of neuronal excitability, whether via channel- or receptor-specific effects, or through modulation of fundamental processes such as neurotransmitter release, has immediate and profound effects on many organisms from diverse phyla.

40|$|Abstract—Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{brain is}} {{characterized}} by excess deposition of the 42 -amino acid amyloid �-peptide [A�(1 – 42) ]. AD brain is under intense oxidative stress, and we have previously suggested that A�(1 – 42) was associated with this increased oxidative stress. In addition, we previously demonstrated that the single methionine residue of A�(1 – 42), residue 35, was critical for the oxidative stress and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of this peptide. Others {{have shown that the}} C-terminal region of A�(1 – 42) is helical in aqueous micellar solutions, including that part of the protein containing Met 35. Importantly, Cu(II) -binding induces �-helicity in A � in aqueous solution. Invoking the i � 4 rule of helices, we hypothesized that the carbonyl oxygen of Ile 31 would interact with the S atom of Met 35 to change the electronic environment of the sulfur such that molecular oxygen could lead to the production of a sulfuramyl free radical on Met 35. If this hypothesis is correct, a prediction would be that breaking the helical interaction of Ile 31 and Met 35 would abrogate the oxidative stress and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of A�(1 – 42). Accordingly, we investigated A�(1 – 42) in which the Ile 31 residue was replaced with the helix-breaking amino acid, proline. The �-helical environment around Met 35 was completely abolished as indicated by circular dichroism (CD) -spectroscopy. As a consequence, the aggregation, oxidative stress, Cu(II) reduction, and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of A�(1 – 42) I 31 P were completely altered compared to native A�(1 – 42).

Data on compounds and contamination was retrieved from a bibliographic review. Where possible, toxicity data was retrieved from databases, otherwise it was calculated from raw data. One hundred and fifty-six SVOCs were selected, 66 of which were prioritized.
