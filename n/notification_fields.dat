Furthermore, cargo shipments {{are at risk of}} being used to transport contraband, potentially resulting in fines to shippers. The Transportation Security Sensor Network (TSSN), which is based on open software systems and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, has been developed to mitigate these risks. Using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, the TSSN is able to detect events and report those relevant to appropriate decision makers. However, field testing is required to validate the system architecture as well as to determine if the system can provide timely event <b>notification.</b> <b>Field</b> experiments were conducted to assess the TSSN’s suitability for monitoring rail-borne cargo.

The proposed scheme {{is simple and}} IP-compatible because it uses two-bit Explicit Congestion <b>Notification</b> (ECN) <b>field</b> and IP identification (IPid) field in the standard IP header for the estimation. Through simulations using real IP packet traces, we show that our scheme indeed works as designed with small estimation errors, and thus enables existing max-min flow control algorithms to serve their purpose without the need of separate out-of-band control packets to carry link prices.

Because of the speed of the Internet, information transfer both among companies and between a company and its customers has become faster, albeit technologically more complex, in the e-commerce era. It has been a challenge for e-companies to develop creative, satisfying ways of communicating with their customers. After all, the Internet is approximately a decade old, and there has not been enough accumulation of knowledge about customer behavior. Unlike in conventional shopping where the customer takes the product with him/her or makes specific delivery arrangements in a specific geographical zone, in e-commerce the customer picks a specific delivery method from literally anywhere in the world at any time. This, of course, brings many logistical challenges for a successful delivery. Dell Computer Corporation, famous for its build-to-order and direct model, {{is one of the biggest}} e-commerce companies in the world and, thus, faces the challenges that any e- commerce company must confront, such as communicating with customers efficiently in a timely manner. Therefore, such logistical challenges that the e-commerce era has brought are not unique to Dell. One such challenge is effective communication with the customer after a shipment is just processed. This thesis focuses on finding best-of-breed technologies and applications in the proactive customer <b>notification</b> <b>field</b> through benchmarking. (cont.)

This scheme makes use of the 1 -bit Explicit Congestion <b>Notification</b> (ECN) <b>field</b> in the Internet Protocol (IP) header. It allows the source to estimate the exact level of congestion at each intermediate queue. By knowing this, the source could take avoiding action either by adapting its sending rate or by using alternate routes. The estimation mechanism makes use of time series analysis both {{to improve the quality}} of the congestion estimation and to predict, ahead of time, the congestion level which subsequent packets will encounter. The proposed protocol is tested in ns- 2 simulator using a background of real Internet traffic traces. Results show that the methods can successfully calculate the congestion at any queue along the path with low error levels. Index Terms—TCP, Congestion Control, ECN, Forecasting. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{addition}} of the two-bit Explicit Congestion <b>Notification</b> (ECN) <b>field</b> to the IP header provides routers with a mechanism for conveying link price information necessary for the successful operation {{of a number of}} congestion control schemes. Two recent proposals for probabilistic packet marking at the routers allow receivers to estimate path price from the fraction of marked packets. In this paper we introduce an alternative deterministic marking scheme for encoding path price. Each router quantizes the price of its outgoing link to a fixed number of bits. Every data packet sent along the path encodes a partial sum of the quantized link prices in its ECN field, allowing the receiver to estimate the path price. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in terms of its error in representing prices, and compare it to probabilistic marking. We show that based on empirical Internet traffic characteristics, our algorithm performs better when estimating time-varying prices and static path price using small blocks of packets...|$|R

Whether this R&D is conducted within companies, cooperatives or public research organizations (both publicly and privately funded R&D) is expected to influence the type of crops and traits that are developed and therefore the effects on society and ecosystems that potentially could follow from the use of GM-crops. This issue is analyzed empirically by statistical analysis of 1323 <b>notifications</b> for <b>field</b> trials with GM-crops that have been submitted under two EU Directives in seven European countries. The results show that the type of R&D organization influences the traits and crops that are developed. Companies are more likely to submit notifications that concern GM-crops that secure the potential for profit than are other types of R&D organizations, while R&D organizations that are purely publicly funded are more likely to submit notifications that only concern biosafety research than are cooperatives and companies. Consideration of the environment, food safety and food security might justify institutional reforms of R&D of GM-crops.

Energy Conservation in IEEE 802. 15. 4 nodes is always {{a concern for the}} designers as the life time of a network depends mainly on minimizing the energy consumption in the nodes. In ZigBee cluster-tree network, the existing literature does not provide combined solution for co-channel interference and power efficient scheduling. In addition, the technique that prevents network collision has not been provided. Delay and reliability issues are not addressed in the QoS-aware routing. Congestion {{is one of the major}} challenges in IEEE 802. 15. 4 Network. This network also has issues in admitting real time flows. The aim of the present research is to overcome the issues mentioned above by designing Energy Efficient Cluster Scheduling and Interference Mitigation, QoS Aware Inter-Cluster Routing Protocol and Adaptive Data Rate Control for Clustered Architecture for IEEE 802. 15. 4 Networks. To overcome the issue of Energy efficiency and network collision energy efficient cluster scheduling and interference mitigation for IEEE 802. 15. 4 Network is proposed. It uses a time division cluster scheduling technique that offers energy efficiency in the cluster-tree network. In addition, an interference mitigation technique is demonstrated which detects and mitigates the channel interference based on packet-error detection and repeated channel-handoff command transmission. For the issues of delay and reliability in cluster network, QoS aware intercluster routing protocol for IEEE 802. 15. 4 Networks is proposed. It consists of some modules like reliability module, packet classifier, hello protocol module, routing service module. Using the Packet classifier, the packets are classified into the data and hello packets. The data packets are classified based on the priority. Neighbour table is constructed to maintain the information of neighbour nodes reliabilities by Hello protocol module. Moreover, routing table is built using the routing service module. The delay in the route is controlled by delay metrics, which is a sum of queuing delay and transmission delay. For the issues of congestion and admit real-time flows an Adaptive data rate control for clustered architecture in IEEE 802. 15. 4 Networks is proposed. A network device is designed to regulate its data rate adaptively using the feedback message i. e. Congestion <b>Notification</b> <b>Field</b> (CNF) in beacon frame received from the receiver side. The network device controls or changes its data rate based on CNF value.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} novel approach to Internet congestion control known as Probabilistic Congestion Notification (PCN). Preliminary research has established the requirements and motivations for a more efficient Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control schemes. Because of the substantial increase in the the number of Internet users and the diversification of online services, {{the dynamics of the}} Internet are changing, making classical congestion control mechanisms inefficient. Traditionally, TCP has relied on packet loss as an indication of congestion. Though packet loss is a typical result of overflowing buffers, it cannot be used to prevent congestion before it occurs. Consequently, a novel protocol is proposed in this thesis, which allows congestion notification and control via packet marking. This new protocol is elegant as it makes use of the existing one-bit Explicit Congestion <b>Notification</b> (ECN) <b>field</b> in the Internet Protocol (IP) header. Each PCN data packet can be marked probabilistically by one router at most. Furthermore, PCN performance has been improved by pre-signalling the number of intervening queues along the path. The level of load factor (congestion measure) at each link is fed back to the PCN source, which then estimates the exact level of congestion at each intermediate queue, one-step ahead of time. By knowing this, the source can take avoiding action either by adjusting its sending rate or by using alternate routes. The estimation mechanism uses Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Time Series Analysis {{to improve the quality of}} the congestion estimate and to predict the level of congestion at each queue along the path. For this purpose, the work presented in this thesis also analyses the suitability and accuracy of such statistical methods in predicting future congestion levels. The new PCN congestion control protocol has been designed and simulated in the network simulator (ns- 2). Moreover, this project evaluates PCN’s performance using real high speed Internet traffic traces. Results show that the methods can successfully predict the congestion level at any queue along the path. The proposed approach has low complexity and it is easy to implement. Furthermore, it can be easily deployed in existing TCP/IP networks as it does not require modifications to existing IP or TCP implementations...|$|R

In the case of model-based development, test construction and test execution can be partially automated. As the application size is constantly growing, the need for automated testing frameworks comes into place, particularly frameworks for automated testing of user interaction and graphical user interface. This document describes an implementation of the GUI test generator framework based on UML models where specific UML activity diagrams are used for test case generation. It is not a usual case to use UML activity diagrams for UI modeling. However the existing stereotypes of activity diagram elements are not suitable for UI modeling. With usual activity diagram it is complicated to define buttons, containers, pages and other UI elements in the diagram and find differences between them. Even more complicated is to model the navigation of the testing application. Using this approach the UI can be defined {{in a set of}} UI elements along with a set of UI navigation elements. This is an optimal and suitable approach in most cases. This document describes an implementation of the automated GUI tests runner framework as well. This framework is able to run the given application in test mode using the previously generated test cases. The framework collects all the information about each test case results and provides it to the tester.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written within the {{contemporary}} classical institutional economics tradition. The intention {{has been to}} provide insight into how different institutions can enable us to avoid harmful effects and generate beneficial effects {{on the environment and}} food security from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is done by analysing how institutions influence perspectives on GMOs, the GMOs that are developed and commercialized, as well as our ability to handle possible uncertain and unknown effects of GMOs. The thesis consists of 4 papers. Paper 1 analyses scientists’ perspectives on the release of GMOs into the environment, and the relationship between their perspectives and the institutional context that they work within, e. g. their place of employment (university or industry), funding of their research (public or industry) and their disciplinary background (ecology, molecular biology or conventional plant breeding). Q-methodology is employed to examine these issues. Two distinct perspectives are identified by interviewing 62 scientists. Perspective 1 is characterised by a moderately negative attitude to GMOs and the uncertainty and ignorance involved are emphasised. Perspective 2 is characterised by a positive attitude to GMOs and it is emphasised that GMOs are useful and do not represent any unique risks compared to conventional crops. The results show a strong association between scientists’ perspective on GMOs and the explanatory variables training, funding and place of employment. Paper 2 analyses how different institutional structures shape the research and development (R&D) of GMOs. Whether this R&D is conducted within companies, cooperatives or public research organisations is expected to influence the type of crops and traits that are developed and therefore the effects on society and ecosystems that potentially could follow from the use of GMOs. This issue is analysed empirically by statistical analysis of 1323 <b>notifications</b> for <b>field</b> trials with GMOs in the EU. The results show that the type of R&D organisation influences strongly the traits and crops that are developed. Paper 3 analyses how the type of regulation for marketing of GMOs influences which GMOs that are commercialised. The EU and Norway have assessed the release of GMOs as commercial products quite differently. Of twenty four notifications approved by the EU, Norway has approved four, rejected ten, and has ten pending. The paper examines whether these differences could be explained by different judgments concerning the effects to be prevented and encouraged, response to uncertainty and and the burden of proof defined. Norwegian rejections are found to be explicable by the combination of no real benefit to society, lack of scientific knowledge, and involved risks. The main explanation for the EU approvals is that they see {{no reason to believe that}} there will be any adverse effects on health and the environment. Paper 4 analyses how capable three different governance regimes are for adequate handling of uncertain and unknown effects of GMOs. GMOs are characterized by strong uncertainty. This implies that procedures for identification, reduction and monitoring of uncertainty, as well as how to treat irreducible uncertainty will be highly incomplete. Governance mechanisms that facilitate cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality (communicate with the intention of reaching agreement exclusively via the force of better arguments) are therefore needed. The three governance regimes compared are: GMOs are produced by private firms and these firms are made liable for harm (GR 1), GMOs are produced by private firms and the government decides whether the crops should be marketed (GR 2), GMOs are produced by public research organisations and the government decides whether the crops should be marketed (GR 3). GR 3 will be stronger in cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality than GR 2. Public research organisations have fewer conflicts of interest with the government than private firms, and academic norms are important as opposed to firms where commercial norms are important. Difficulties in proving harm and identifying the responsible firm will make GR 1 weak in cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality. Based on the results of this thesis it is advised that consideration of the environment and food security justify institutional reforms concerning how we decide which GMOs that should be released into the environment and how we organise the R&D of GMOs. My analysis suggests that it is important to involve scientists from several disciplines in public marketing decisions on new technologies and that information about the contextual background of the scientists is relevant in these decisions. There are strong arguments for changing current practise where those that apply for marketing approval of GMOs also produce the risk assessment prior to marketing and the post marketing monitoring. It is further important to increase public GMO research to secure scientific advices and development of products that are independent from the priorities of the industry and to a greater extent could serve public needs...|$|R
