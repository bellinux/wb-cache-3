40|$|Internet {{interventions}} {{have great}} potential for alleviating emotional distress, promoting mental health, and enhancing well-being. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy {{for a number of}} psychiatric conditions, and interventions delivered via the Internet will likely become a common alternative to face-to-face treatment. Meanwhile, research has paid little attention to the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> associated with treatment, warranting further investigation of the possibility that some patients might deteriorate or encounter adverse events despite receiving best available care. Evidence from research of face-to-face treatment suggests that <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> afflict 5 - 10 % of all patients undergoing treatment in terms of deterioration. However, there is currently a lack of consensus on how to define and measure <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in psychotherapy research in general, leaving researchers without practical guidelines for monitoring and reporting <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in clinical trials. The current paper therefore seeks to provide recommendations that could promote the study of <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in Internet interventions with the aim of increasing the knowledge of its occurrence and characteristics. Ten leading experts in the field of Internet interventions were invited to participate and share their perspective on how to explore <b>negative</b> <b>effects,</b> using the Delphi technique to facilitate a dialog and reach an agreement. The authors discuss the importance of conducting research on <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in order to further the understanding of its incidence and different features. Suggestions on how to classify and measure <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in Internet interventions are proposed, involving methods from both quantitative and qualitative research. Potential mechanisms underlying <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> are also discussed, differentiating common factors shared with face-to-face treatments from those unique to treatments delivered via the Internet. The authors conclude that <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> are to be expected and need to be acknowledged to a greater extent, advising researchers to systematically probe for <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> whenever conducting clinical trials involving Internet interventions, as well as to share their findings in scientific journals.

Data from four large clinical trials (total N = 558) revealed that 9. 3 % of patients encountered some type of <b>negative</b> <b>effects.</b> Qualitative content analysis was used to explore the patientsâ responses to open-ended questions regarding their negative experiences.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} the positive effects of social capital in organizations, whereas the possible <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> have attracted considerably less scholarly attention. To rectify this imbalance, this paper first undertakes a rigorous review of the published scholarly empirical evidence pertaining to the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> of social capital in organizations through a search of Web of Knowledge and Scopus, and then enumerates six potentially <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> arising from increased levels of social capital. The review focuses on <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> arising from bonding social capital and those arising from dense networks and closure, advancing new theory to elucidate the generative mechanisms that give rise to the proposed <b>negative</b> <b>effects.</b> Finally, the authors identify potential moderators of the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> thus theorized. Using the lens of social identification theory, the authors argue that dysfunctional identification processes restrict the processing of information and stimulate over-commitment to established relationships, diluting in turn the dialectical process, and inhibiting individual learning within organizations, culminating in groupthink, the postponement of structural adjustments, the non-rational escalation of commitment, and the blurring of firmsâ boundaries. This review thus furthers the agenda of a more balanced inquiry into the effects of social capital in organizations...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{downward}} sloping demand curve, a retailer can use price promotions to induce store traffic.

This study investigates whether manufacturer advertising can mitigate the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> caused by retailer price promotions. A rational expectation model shows that the relation between advertising and price promotions is not unidirectional. A threshold exists that can ensure whether an increase in advertising expenditures reduces <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> from price promotions. When advertising coverage exceeds this threshold, an increase in advertising expenditures mitigates <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> and makes price promotions {{an effective way to}} build store traffic. Below the threshold, an increase in advertising expenditures might aggravate the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> from price promotions and decrease price sensitivity. Accordingly, marketing practitioners can design product pricing decisions depending on whether advertising information crosses this threshold. ...|$|R

If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment.

This skepticism is due to {{various factors such as}} lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of productsâall of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
