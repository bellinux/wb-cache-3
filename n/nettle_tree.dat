50|$|In the past, the Upper Rock was tree-covered. Most of {{the trees}} were felled for fuel during the Great Siege of Gibraltar between 1779 and 1783.Trees today mostly produce berries that are eaten by birds, who presumably dropped their seeds on the rock.The most common is the olive (Olea europea). Carob (Ceratonia siliqua and <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> (Celtis) are also found.Trees have been planted along the paths, {{including}} the stone pine (Pinus pinea) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis).Both are native to the region, but the Aleppo pine is particularly common in dry, limestone regions.There was a drought in the 1990s when many of the introduced trees died, although the Aleppo pine fared better than others.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is a toxic shrub, it {{also play}} a {{significant}} part in the phenology of a local butterfly, namely the red admiral (Vanessa gonerilla). The leaves of the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is the preferred food and provide protection for the butterfly larvae. When the larvae arrives in the leaves, it will curve the tip of nettle leaf, use the silken threads to make the leaves stick together, and constructs a secure {{place where they can}} eat the food. Due to the caterpillar's activities, the leaves of shrub can fall off. The eggs of butterflies, also including the yellow admiral (Vanessa itea), are laid on the leaves of nettle during the spring and summer. It takes eight to ten days for the eggs to incubate. Beside these butterflies, some mammals also eat the leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle,</b> like the Common brushtail possum, goats and deer. However, because no native non-flying, non-marine mammals existed in New Zealand prior to human arrival in the last one thousand years, the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> would have been without mammalian predators in its evolutionary history until quite recently.|$|R

Some of them also hybridize, as all are wind pollinated. C. occidentalis, of Canadian origin, is distinguishable by the warts on it bark, besides the distinctly larger purple or black fruit of some 1 cm in diameter. C. australis is of Mediterranean origin. Its leaves have a rough upper side, and the fruit resemble those of C. occidentalis. C. sinensis is of oriental origin and has dark, glossy leaves, that are only hairy on the underside. Its fruit are dark orange and about 6 mm in diameter. Its numerous fruit are carried on short and sturdy stalks.|$|R

50|$|Kali Bair {{is an old}} village {{situated}} {{in the suburbs of}} Nankana Sahib city, Punjab province, Pakistan. On the world map the location of the village comes at 31’24’16.19’’N and 73’44’54.62’’E (Google Maps). Kali Bair word refers to a black hackberry tree which is usually not black. Kali means Black and Bair means hackberry or <b>nettle</b> <b>tree.</b> Arabic word for Bair is Sidrah. There was a black hackberry (Bair) tree here which is rare to find in any area. That’s why the place started to be known by that very tree.

Now the village has been announced to be the part of the municipal corporation.|$|E
50|$|With {{effect of}} 1 January 1861, {{the street and}} the {{adjacent}} sites, alleys and fields around were seceded from Tempelhof and incorporated into Berlin, which formed in this new southern quarter of the city's then 16 quarters, namely the Tempelhofer Vorstadt (i.e. Tempelhof-bound Suburb). On 27 November 1864 the Tempelhofer Straße was - in analogy to Belle-Alliance-Platz - renamed Belle-Alliance-Straße, thus spreading southwards the name of the French chief command post La Belle Alliance in the Battle of Waterloo, therefore named Battle of Belle Alliance in Prussian historiography. Following a royal Most-Supreme Cabinet Order (Allerhöchste Cabinets-Ordre) all streets newly laid out right and left of Belle-Alliance-Straße were named after battles won against Napoleon and commanders who distinguished themselves in these battles. In the 1880s, the street became an avenue by planting <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> in the section between Yorckstraße and Dudenstraße, with some of them - such as near Fidicinstraße junction - still standing, meanwhile under nature protection.|$|R
5000|$|In the Māori culture, <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the people’s lives. For example, it can be used in medicine, [...] and food. Māori use the bark of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> and the leaves of kawakawa, boiled together, to make a liquid that can be used internally and externally for eczema and venereal disease. Also, the leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> play a significant part in the treating pains. The decoction of leaves and youth twigs dip in boiled water is said to have a benefit on stomachache and on the treatment of gonorrhea. It is also commonly documented that Urtica ferox was a food source for Māori. The inner stems were sometimes consumed after the leaves and outer bark had been removed, the thin film that makes up the inner bark was also eaten raw and is said to have a sweet taste, it is also documented that stems were cooked after having the leaves removed.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the periods}} of November to March, the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> flowers. Because the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is a {{dioecious}} shrub, it will cross pollinate. The pollen of male flowers can {{transfer to the}} female flowers through wind. These pollen grains can be collected by female dense stigmas. When pollen arrives in the female flowers, the pollination of female flowers will begin. Then in January, the fruit of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> mature. The seed of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is one and half millimeters long and brown color, ovoid shape like. When the seed is planted in the environment which has more light and water, it will take one month to germinate. One {{study found that the}} seeds germinate after one month in soil, the seeds germinate throughout winter and spring of the year they are dropped. In this study cited out of the 5 different Woody seeding species Urtica ferox had the lowest germination rate of 59% compared to >85% of the other similar species, the author surmise that <b>Tree</b> <b>Nettle</b> is capable of building up a large seed bank in the soil which will survive for 5 - 15 years.Seed dispersal is carried out by rolling, wind and in the gut of birds, the seeds are achenes and are surrounded by a persistent perianth which contribute to the long lived seed bank it produces. This is important for the ecological niche that it inhabits, we can surmise that it doesn’t do well competitively with the other species in its environment due to its growth on boundary zones, an adaption for long lived seed banks are therefore advantageous as it must wait for clearing and collapse of the larger dominating species before it can take hold.|$|R
50|$|Various {{rituals and}} names were {{associated}} with the latrine god in different parts of Japan. On Ishigaki Island it was called kamu-taka and was propitiated by the sick with sticks of incense, flowers, rice and rice wine. In Nagano Prefecture's former Minamiazumi District, sufferers from toothache offered lights to the toilet god, which was called takagamisama. The inhabitants of Hiroshima called the toilet god Setchinsan while those of Ōita Prefecture called it Sechinbisan and those of Ehime Prefecture called it Usshimasama. The American anthropologist John Embree recorded in the 1930s that the inhabitants of part of the southernmost Japanese island of Kyūshū would put a branch of willow or Chinese <b>nettle</b> <b>tree,</b> decorated with pieces of mochi (rice cake), into the toilet as an offering to ask the toilet god to protect the house's inhabitants from bladder problems in the coming year.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The study {{presents}} the results of an investigation of regeneration processes, growth, development and survival of young growth by field measurement and three-dimensional visualization of horizontal and vertical structure. The results are based on the ten-year investigation (1998 - 2009) on a permanent experimental plot in a mountain beech forest with dead <b>nettle</b> <b>tree</b> (Lamio orvale - Fagetum sylvaticae Ht. 1938) in conditions of passive protection. Materials and Methods: Basic structural indicators were measured (diameter at breast height and height), structural crown elements (size and shape, ground cover crowns) and the occurrence and survival of young growth as the basic conditions of natural regeneration. Particular emphasis in the investigation was paid to the development of crown structures and the process of natural regeneration during the 10 year period. Results and Conclusions: Investigation indicates the occurrence of young growth regeneration cores arising {{as a result of the}} die-back of one dominant beech tree with horizontal crown projections of 145 m 2 which initiated the possibility of natural regeneration. The greatest change occurred in the beech seedling count, whose numbers increased fourfold from 3556 plants per hectare in 1998 to 12694 plants per hectare in 2009. The share of beech seedlings increased from 8. 7 % to 22. 6 % of all species of young growth and shrubs. Thus beech became dominant among the tree species regeneration. However, the majority of the young plants of beech are of poor quality and thus their further development in conditions of passive protection is questionable. The investigations also showed the possibility of a new approach to the study of the dynamics of crown structures and the process of natural regeneration by methods of three-dimensional visualization of horizontal and vertical structures. The methods presented offer a more graphic illustration of the development of stands and high quality presentation of the obtained results. For a long-term scientifically based plan, with the aim of reaching the most favourable decisions on the future of forest stands in protected areas, particularly in today’s conditions of climatic changes, continuous improvement and expansion of monitoring methods by means of a network of permanent experimental plots in all protected forest areas is necessary...|$|E
50|$|Nettlebed Cave is a {{limestone}} cave {{located in}} the Mount Arthur region of the northwest South Island of New Zealand. The presence of ongaonga (Urtica ferox), an endemic <b>tree</b> <b>nettle,</b> near the bottom entrance gives the cave its name.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is an {{endemic species}} to New Zealand which inhabits sub-tropical and {{temperate}} regions, {{the plant is}} very common in the North Island but limited in the South.

The <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> {{can also be found}} on Stewart Island.The shrub commonly inhabits coastal and lowland areas at altitudes between sea level and 600m above sea level. It can be found on its own or in dense thickets and is often found growing along forest margins. It prefers well lit environments so suits stock damaged bush, in tree fall gaps and on steep and unstable slopes.|$|R
5000|$|Bast fibre (also called phloem fibre or skin fibre) is plant fibre {{collected}} from the phloem (the [...] "inner bark", sometimes called [...] "skin") or bast surrounding the stem of certain dicotyledonous plants. They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance flax, hemp, or ramie, but also bast fibres from wild plants, as stinging <b>nettle,</b> and <b>trees</b> such as lime or linden, wisteria, and mulberry {{have been used in}} the past. Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible. Fibres from monocotyledonous plants, called [...] "leaf fibre", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff.|$|R
50|$|Elements of {{the former}} house garden, and estate {{landscaping}} remain today. These include {{the outline of the}} formal carriage loop north of the house, isolated elements such as mature trees and an avenue of rainforest tree species and palms going north from the house towards the river. More detailed elements such as a pedestal and urn, east of the house on the edge {{of the former}} carriage loop also remain. Tree plantings lining the former carriage loop north of the house include Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis), southern <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> (Celtis australis) and cotton palms (Washingtonia robusta) with their tall, clean trunks to 20m high. An avenue of trees towards the river comprises Bunya Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), Canary Island date palms and swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta). The latter of these may be later plantings. Walkway planting dates to the 1860s-1900, the main period of popularisation and fashionability of these species, and their promotion by such public figures as then Directors of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden. These men provided such species to many public institutions such as hospitals. Cotton and Canary Island date palms were also commonly promoted species in this period. Close to Holker Street and the main entry are large specimens of Hill's fig (Ficus hillii) and Moreton Bay figs, transplanted from estate remnants to the east of the current entry driveway as part of a redevelopment of the main entry. These trees are at least of 1880s vintage but possibly older. Significance trees throughout the site include the extremely rare Schotia afra (Kaffir bean, Boer bean) and the surviving turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which are likely to be indigenous to the site.|$|R
50|$|Though {{plants with}} {{stinging}} hairs can cause pain and acute urticaria, {{only a few}} are seriously harmful. The genus Dendrocnide (stinging trees) has been said to cause the most pain, particularly the Australian Dendrocnide moroides (gympie-gympie). There are reports of dogs and horses being killed, and once of a human death. The researcher Marina Hurley reports being hospitalized after being stung by a dead leaf. Deaths are probably due to heart failure caused by pain and shock. Urtica ferox (<b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> or ongaonga) is endemic to New Zealand. One recorded human death is known: a lightly clad young man died five hours after walking through a dense patch.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> {{requires}} high nutrient levels {{found in}} cycling forest {{systems such as}} beech forest and native New Zealand forest. In these environments an “A type” soil horizon of rich leaf litter and humus between 10 - 80 cm is common. This is significant as the species doesn’t directly compete with other flora, this is achieved through inhabiting the boundary zones between strata, therefore the high soil fertility, like other species in the nettle family, grows well in soils with high nutrient levels, especially high quantities of nitrogen and access to open sunlight and rainwater results in a rapidly growing plant {{able to take advantage}} of natural tree fall and other natural events such as land slides and flooding which clear dominating old growth species.|$|R
50|$|In {{its natural}} habitat the tree depends mainly for success upon its prodigious seed production, the remarkably long {{life of the}} seed, and, after germination, rapid growth. In forest, whau is {{essentially}} a transient, opportunist species. The characteristics which cause it {{to be effective in}} such a role include: its ability to quickly occupy ground where light has been temporarily let into the forest; its tremendous rate of growth; its ability to rapidly produce fruit; its enormous seed production, especially as it is about to die; and the fact that its seeds are capable of germinating as soon as the capsules open. Whau seeds can be stimulated into growth by fire after lying {{on the surface of the}} ground for many years. Having germinated, whau establishes itself with striking rapidity. In a study on Taranga (Hen Island), in favourable conditions whau was often the first new plant to appear, followed by Urtica ferox (<b>tree</b> <b>nettle),</b> Macropiper excelsum (kawakawa), Coprosma macrocarpa (coastal karamu) and Coprosma lucida (shiny karamu); forest-dominating trees were slower to come in - Corynocarpus (karaka) most quickly, followed by Beilschmiedia tawa (tawa).|$|R
5000|$|Urtica ferox, {{commonly}} known as <b>tree</b> <b>nettle,</b> or ongaonga in Māori, is a nettle that is endemic to New Zealand. It is sometimes known as [...] "Taraonga", [...] "Taraongaonga" [...] or [...] "Okaoka". Unlike other herbaceous species in the Urtica genus, ongaonga is a large woody shrub. It has woody stems and unusually large stinging spines that {{can result in a}} painful sting that lasts several days. The shrub can grow to a height of 3 m with the base of the stem reaching 12 cm in thickness. The pale green leaves are very thin like a membrane, the surface of the leaf, stems and stalks are covered in stiff stinging hairs can grow up to 6 mm long. These spines are prominent along the salient mid-vein and leaf margin. The leaves range from 3-5 cm in width and 8-12 cm in length, these are oppositely arranged and there are two stipules per node. The leaf shape is ovulate-triangulate with a serrated leaf margin each bearing a spine of up to 1 m. The spines covering the leaf surface, stem and stalk are generally no larger than 6 mm in length, the spines on the older darker bark are smaller and softer, these don't cause a sting. This nettle is winter deciduous in cold climates, evergreen in mild climates and can lose its leaves in drought conditions if it is growing in shallow soils.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients often consult for {{hay fever}} before {{significant}} counts of grass pollen are recorded, {{and this has}} prompted the question, 'Are symptoms already present or are patients consulting to obtain medication in anticipation?' AIM: The study {{is concerned with the}} relationship between hay fever symptoms and pollens, and also with the impact of the media on patient consulting behaviour. METHOD: Symptom questionnaires were presented to patients consulting with hay fever {{for the first time that}} year in 1994 in four Birmingham practices. The questionnaire concerned the nature and duration of symptoms and the influence of the media on their decision to consult. Incidence data collected over the spring and summer periods (1989 - 1995) in the Weekly Returns Service (WRS) were examined in relation to pollen counts reported by the Midlands Asthma and Allergy Research Association at Derby. Data are presented for oak, birch and grass pollen, but other pollen data including rape, <b>nettle</b> and other <b>trees</b> were also examined. RESULTS: Questionnaire data from 1994 were analysed in two periods starting from 4 April: early (day 1 - 60) and late (day 61 - 124). Out of the 364 subjects, 38 % consulted in the early period and 62 % in the late period. Altogether, 41 % developed symptoms before the start of the grass pollen season. Overall, 91 % of patients first consulting in the early period had already experienced symptoms compared with 99 % late period and were not simply collecting prescriptions in anticipation. The influence of the media on consultation behaviour was very small, except in children, 23 % of whom (or their parents) were reported to be influenced. The new episode data from the WRS examined over 7 years showed an early peak that was coterminous with oak pollen, and a later and higher peak with grass pollen. CONCLUSION: The consistency of the relationship between oak pollen and the early peak of hay fever over the years examined suggests that oak pollen is a major cause of hay fever symptoms...|$|R
