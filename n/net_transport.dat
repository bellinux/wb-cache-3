The result is that each Ca2+ ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO2 molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where {{it is likely to}} stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO2 from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.|$|E

50|$|Detailed kinetic {{analysis}} of monocarboxylate transport in erythrocytes revealed that MCT1 operates through an ordered mechanism. MCT1 has a substrate binding site {{open to the}} extracellular matrix which binds a proton first followed by the lactate anion. The protein then undergoes a conformational change to a new ‘closed’’ conformation that exposes both the proton and lactate to the opposite surface of the membrane where they are released, lactate first and then the proton. For <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> of lactic acid, the rate-limiting step is the return of MCT1 without bound substrate to the open conformation. For this reason, exchange of one monocarboxylate inside the cell with another outside is considerably faster than <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> of a monocarboxylate across the membrane.|$|E

40|$|Tidal {{propagation}} in, {{and division}} of <b>net</b> water <b>transport</b> over different channels in an estuarine network are analyzed using a newly developed idealized model. The water motion {{in this model}} is governed by the cross-sectionally averaged shallow water equations and is forced by tides at the seaward boundaries and by river discharge. Approximate analytical solutions are constructed {{by means of a}} harmonic truncation and a perturbation expansion in a small parameter, being the ratio of tidal amplitude and depth. The <b>net</b> water <b>transport</b> results from an imposed river discharge and from residual water transport generated by nonlinear tidal rectification. Two new drivers are identified that contribute to the <b>net</b> water <b>transport</b> in tidal estuarine networks, viz. the generation of residual water transport due to gradients in dynamic pressure and due to a coupling between the tidally averaged and quarter diurnal currents through the quadratic bottom stress. The model is applied in a case study on the Yangtze Estuary, to investigate tides and division of <b>net</b> water <b>transport</b> over its multiple channels during the wet and dry season, as well as before and after the construction of the Deepwater Navigation Channel. Model results agree fairly well with observations. Process analysis reveals that the decrease in tides from dry to wet season is due to enhanced bottom stress generated by river-tide interactions. Also, the seasonal variations in <b>net</b> water <b>transport</b> are explained. It is furthermore shown and explained that due to the Deepwater Navigation Channel tidal currents have increased and <b>net</b> water <b>transport</b> has decreased in the North Passage. These changes have profound implications for <b>net</b> sediment <b>transport</b> and salinity intrusion...|$|R

Contributions from both the global-scale meridional circulation and the mass variation of the lowermost stratosphere are included. For the northern hemisphere {{the mass of the}} lowermost stratosphere has a distinct annual cycle, whereas for the southern hemisphere, the corresponding variation is weak. The <b>net</b> mass <b>transport</b> across the tropopause in the northern hemisphere has a maximum in late spring and a distinct minimum in autumn.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the <b>net</b> momentum <b>transported</b> by the transient electromagnetic radiation field {{of a long}} transient dipole in free space. In the dipole a current is initiated {{at one end and}} propagates towards the other end where it is absorbed. The results show that the <b>net</b> momentum <b>transported</b> by the radiation is directed along the axis of the dipole where the currents are propagating. In general, the <b>net</b> momentum P <b>transported</b> by the electromagnetic radiation of the dipole is less than the quantity U / c, where U is the total energy radiated by the dipole and c is the speed of light in free space. In the case of a Hertzian dipole, the <b>net</b> momentum <b>transported</b> by the radiation field is zero because of the spatial symmetry of the radiation field. As the effective wavelength of the current decreases with respect to the length of the dipole (or the duration of the current decreases with respect to the travel time of the current along the dipole), the <b>net</b> momentum <b>transported</b> by the radiation field becomes closer and closer to U / c, and for effective wavelengths which are much shorter than the length of the dipole, P ≈ U / c. The results show that when the condition P ≈ U / c is satisfied, the radiated fields satisfy the condition Δ t Δ U ≥ h / 4 π where Δ t is the duration of the radiation, Δ U is the uncertainty in the dissipated energy and h is the Plank constant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWave {{phenomenon}} in ocean often has the {{shape in the}} horizontal and vertical asymmetric waves when propagating in the near-zone with high non-linearity. The orbital velocity due to the wave asymmetriesand nonlinearities could generate the flow patterns that drives cross-shore sediment transport in the near-shore zone. A new calculation method for bottom shear stresses and bed-load sediment transport rate for the horizontal and vertical asymmetries waves proposed by 1, 2 was implemented to model the concentration sediment and suspended sediment transport. The characteristics of the concentration sediment and suspended load induced by the horizontal and vertical asymmetries waves have been examined. The modeling {{results showed that the}} smaller α and the higher Ni indicate more wave skew-ness and more non-linearity of waves causing a higher the bottom shear stress and the <b>net</b> bed load <b>transport</b> while the <b>net</b> suspended load <b>transport</b> decrease with the decreasing of the wave skew-ness.

5000|$|Ekman {{transport}} {{results in}} the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> of surface water 90 degrees {{to the right of}} the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, and 90 degrees to the left of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere. As the wind blows across the surface of the ocean, it [...] "grabs" [...] onto a thin layer of the surface water. In turn, that thin sheet of water transfers motion energy to the thin layer of water under it, and so on. However, because of the Coriolis Effect, the direction of travel of the layers of water slowly move farther and farther to the right as they get deeper in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. In most cases, the very bottom layer of water affected by the wind is at a depth of 100 m - 150 m and is traveling about 180 degrees, completely opposite of the direction that the wind is blowing. Overall, the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> of water would be 90 degrees from the original direction of the wind.|$|E
50|$|Because {{chemical}} diffusion is a <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> process, {{the system in}} which it takes place is not an equilibrium system (i.e. {{it is not at}} rest yet). Many results in classical thermodynamics are not easily applied to non-equilibrium systems. However, there sometimes occur so-called quasi-steady states, where the diffusion process does not change in time, where classical results may locally apply. As the name suggests, this process is a not a true equilibrium since the system is still evolving.|$|E

Studies were performed in Necturus {{to determine the}} relationship of proximal tubular epithelial structure to the physiologic state of <b>net</b> NaCl <b>transport</b> under control experimental conditions and during expansion of the extracellular volume. Although <b>net</b> NaCl <b>transport</b> was depressed during volume expansion in both free flow and stopped flow tubules, morphology was different. Compared to control, epithelial cells of free flow tubules fixed in situ during volume expansion were flattened (reduction in cell height) and intercellular spaces were closed, whereas intercellular spaces were markedly dilated in stopped flow tubules. Dilated intercellular spaces were associated with reversal of the normal hydrostatic pressure gradient. Structural changes {{in the region of}} the tight junction were observed during volume expansion. It is proposed that alteration of the tight junction as a diffusion barrier and/or a decrease in effective distance between interstitial and luminal compartments would result in an increase in permeability and flux in the capillary to lumen direction, thus reducing <b>net</b> NaCl <b>transport</b> during volume expansion...|$|R

We hypothesized that stimulation of the natriuretic signaling pathway in RPE with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and with membrane-permeable analogs of cGMP would induce a <b>net</b> apical-to-basal <b>transport</b> of fluid. The hypothesis was tested using human RPE cultures that retain properties seen in vivo. Confluent monolayers were treated with ANP or membrane-permeable cGMP analogs {{in the presence of}} anantin, H- 8, and an AQP 1 inhibitor, AqB 013. Fluid movement from the apical to basal chambers was measured by weight and used to calculate <b>net</b> fluid <b>transport.</b> Our results demonstrated a 40 % increase in <b>net</b> apical-to-basal fluid <b>transport</b> by ANP (5 μM) that was inhibited completely by the ANP receptor antagonist anantin and a 60 % increase in <b>net</b> apical-to-basal fluid <b>transport</b> in response to the extracellularly applied membrane-permeable cGMP analog pCPT-cGMP (50 μM), which was not affected by the protein kinase G inhibitor H- 8.
