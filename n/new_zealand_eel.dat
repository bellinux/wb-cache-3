The fry were infected using bath challenge at 12 and 22 °C. Significant mortalities were observed at 12 °C for EHNV, ESV, PPIV and NZeelV. Background mortality was too high in the experiments performed at 22 °C for any conclusions about viral pathogenicity at this temperature to be drawn. Viruses could be re-isolated from samples from all challenged groups, and their presence in infected tissue was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry. The findings suggest that pike fry are susceptible to EHNV, ESV, PPIV and NZeelV and can be a vector for ECV and FV 3.

40|$|Freshwater eels {{are one of}} the world's most {{valuable}} cultured fish species. Although almost all worldwide eel production is derived from eel farms, no cultured eels are produced in New Zealand. Currently, the entire eel business in this country consists of catching shortfin (Anguilla australis) and longfin (A. dieffenbachii) in the wild and selling them on the local or international markets. However, changes in market specifications, production technology and wild eel stock restrictions have motivated an evaluation of culturing eels as a commercial route to contribute to regional economic development in New Zealand. This thesis describes a series of feeding trials that aim to show how to add value to the native New Zealand shortfin eel by developing a market-oriented eel product through aquaculture, and to provide a better understanding of some eel culturing strategies that may help improve fish production and reduce the eel-farm operational work. All trials were undertaken indoors in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and fish were fed commercial pelleted feed. Most of these experiments were developed on yellow shortfin eel at the Aquaculture Laboratory of the AUT University, but one experiment on feeding stimulants was done at the Unitat de Cultius Experimentals (IRTA, Centre de Sant Carles de la Ràpita, Spain) on glass eel and elvers of the European eel, because of the resources needed. The main outcomes of this thesis are: (1) The development of a <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eel</b> product aligned with international market specifications on the fat content. It was possible to grow a fatty shortfin-eel product with 20 to 22 % total fat starting from wild yellow eels with an initial fat content below 7 %. From a human dietary perspective, the fat quality of the eel product obtained by culturing was appreciably superior (higher proportion of omega- 3 fatty acids) than the fat of eels caught in the wild. (2) The achievement of good values of mean growth rate (SGR= 1. 1 % day- 1) and feed conversion ratio (FCR ≤ 1. 1) for rearing yellow shortfin eels. These values compared favourably with other eel species of similar size range, which indicates a good potential for culturing. (3) The rejection of a hypothesis that size grading can improve the proportion of fast-growers and reduce the high variation in individual growth rate of yellow shortfin eels. It was not possible to improve the individual growth rate of small eels (slow-growers) by having no large eels (fast-growers) in the same tank. These findings suggest that the wide variability in the individual growth rate performance of the eels is not primordially a consequence of the social interaction (hierarchical position) among tank-mates. (4) The confirmation of a hypothesis that feeding stimulants can improve the proportion of fast-growers and reduce the high variation in individual growth rate of juvenile eels. The use of feeding stimulants showed a beneficial effect on the growth rate, size distribution homogeneity, feed intake and digestive function. Although this study was performed on the European eel, the results are encouraging enough to warrant research on the use of stimulants on shortfin eel as a culturing technique to obtain a rapid and uniform fish growth. The outcomes of this research in conjunction with previous studies on the culture of shortfin glass eels and elvers indicate that the shortfin eel has good potential to be a cultured species. However, there are yet numerous aspects, mainly from a business and legislative perspective, which must be addressed before a new eel culture industry can be a reality in New Zealand...|$|E

30|$|For the European eel, as a {{consequence}} of these concerns, the European Commission has agreed to an eel recovery plan, the aim of which is to return the European eel stock to sustainable levels of adult abundance and juvenile recruitment (Svedäng and Gipperth 2012). In 2007, the European eel was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and Appendix II “includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival” (CITES 2007). Although stock assessment and management of the European eel have received increasing attention from both the scientific community and fisheries agencies in recent years (ICES 2006), such assessment and management of the Japanese eel have not yet been well studied. Such studies would help with the development of a concrete conservation policy and management applications for stock enhancement. Please note that despite the high demand for the product, the peak capture of Japanese eels is less than the lowest captures of European eels (Halpin 2007, Arai 2014 a) (Figure  4). This fact indicates a relatively low virgin biomass of Japanese eels. To make matters worse, trade in tropical eels started with no scientific assessment and management before usage in spite of our experience with severely declining stocks in European, American, Japanese, Australian and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eels.</b> Until now, there has been no information available on historical fishing records in tropical eels and only limited biological information compared with European, American, Japanese, Australian and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eels.</b>|$|R

30|$|For marine species, {{dispersal}} {{during the}} larval phase is often important in shaping population genetic structure, and ocean currents {{play an important}} role in larval transport (Sponaugle et al. 2002; Fisher 2005). The migration distances for temperate eels such as the Atlantic and Japanese eels show thousands of km, while those of the tropical eels have been found local-short distance migration less than 100  km (Arai 2014 b). The larval dispersal times for temperate eels such as the Atlantic, Australian, Japanese and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eels</b> were 1 to 5  months longer than those of the tropical species (Arai et al. 2001). The time and distance required for dispersing larvae and migrating adults might be longer in temperate eels.

30|$|Freshwater eels are {{the most}} {{important}} of the eel families from a conservation standpoint because they have a unique catadromous life history and are used as food resources. Recently, however, juvenile abundance has declined dramatically: by 99 % for the European eel and by 80 % for the Japanese eel (Dekker et al. 2003). Recruitment of the American eel near the species’ northern limit has virtually ceased (Dekker et al. 2003). Other eel species, including Australian and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eels</b> (Anguilla dieffenbachii and A. australis), also show indications of decline (Dekker et al. 2003). The main problem is that all young eels used in cultivation are wild juveniles (glass eels and elvers), which are captured in estuaries. Almost all (90 %) of the total world eel supply comes from aquaculture FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) (2010). Therefore, the supply of eel resources for human consumption is completely dependent on wild catch.|$|R

40|$|Research PaperAnnual {{recruitment}} of the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> longfin <b>eel</b> (Anguilla dieffenbachii) has decreased by around 75 percent since heavy levels of commercial fishing {{began in the}} early 1970 s. Given the unsustainability of existing regulatory policy, a deterministic multiple-cohort bioeconomic model is developed and applied to this system to gain insight into the optimal age structure and harvest profile for this species. This model illustrates that the rapid recovery of this fishery would rely on the ability of managers to sufficiently limit the harvest of more valuable year classes to allow for the rebuilding of spawning biomass. The importance of decreasing the degree of exploitation within the fishable population and lessening the time that longfins are available to harvest through higher minimum weight restrictions is also highlighted. The need for conservative management is reinforced when uncertainty regarding the effect of exploitation on fecundity and barriers to the successful instigation of these policies are considered...|$|R

The European eel and other freshwater eels are eaten in Europe, the United States, and other places. A traditional east London food is jellied eels, although the demand has significantly declined since World War II. The Basque delicacy angulas consists of elver (young eels) sautéed in olive oil with garlic; elvers usually reach prices of up to 1000 euro per kg.

In northern Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden, smoked eel is considered a delicacy.|$|R
30|$|The {{causes of}} decline in stock and {{recruitment}} {{are not well}} understood. Overfishing, habitat loss and migration barriers, increased natural predation, parasitism, ocean climate variation, and pollution might have an impact (Knights 2003; Friedland et al. 2007; Bonhommeau et al. 2008; Marcogliese and Casselman 2009). Since the European eel was listed by CITES under Appendix II and came under protection in March 2009, and since the export/import ban was issued by the EU in 2010, the international trade of juvenile eels has changed. Most recently, the Japanese eel {{was added to the}} IUCN’s list with an endangered classification (IUCN 2014), suggesting it has a high risk of extinction. Species other than European and Japanese eels, including several tropical species, seem to have replaced the European eel on the international market. In addition, countries including Canada, the USA, the Dominican Republic, Morocco, Madagascar, the Philippines and Indonesia have now entered the market and supply juvenile eels for the farming industry in China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea (Crook and Nakamura 2013; Anonymous 2013 a, Anonymous 2014). However, fewer studies are available on tropical eels than for European, American, Japanese, Australian and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eels.</b> The lack of availability of basic life history, stock and population information on the tropical eels could lead to further serious declines in these eels. Before tropical eel juveniles are used to replace and augment European and Japanese eels stocks, stock assessments and recruitment studies of source stocks are needed to determine the sustainability of tropical eels. However, consumers in East Asian countries do not pay attention to protection, conservation and enhancement of tropical eel populations, concentrating instead on having a stable eel supply and trade as they did with European and Japanese eels. If we continue such ad hoc eel resource usage, eels will become extinct around the world in the near future. Due to artificially induced breeding techniques for eel populations that are not yet firmly established, unlike populations of salmon, blue fin tuna and livestock, such a status will accelerate from threatened to declining wild eel stocks.|$|R

The use of historical harvest to calculate total allowable catch is asserted to be unsustainable based on recovery dynamics. In addition, individual transferable quota systems are argued to be fundamentally flawed for the protection of longfin fisheries because of high-grading, low-surplus production and a current lack of effective stock-assessment procedures. Area closure and the spatial definition of harvest rights are attractive alternatives given the territoriality of longfins and high larval spillover. The importance of unfished reserves is reinforcedwhen significant uncertainties regarding population strength, harvest intensity and growth dynamics are considered.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that individual fecundity of 34 migrating European female eels Anguilla anguilla increases linearly with body weight (BW) and total length (TL). The total individual fecundity of fish from 560 to 1960 g BW was between 981 x 103 and 6320 x 103 eggs, respectively. The mean relative individual fecundity equalled 2415 x 103 (± 524 x 103) per kg BW. The values of this parameter ranged from 1753 x 103 to 3224. 5 x 103 kg – 1.

30|$|Although European, American, Japanese, Australian and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>eels</b> {{appeared}} to have much shorter seasonal ranges during the recruitment period for {{about half of the}} year or less (Matsui 1952; Haro and Krueger 1988; Gandolfi et al. 1984; Sloane 1984; Jellyman 1977), at least a few juveniles of the tropical eels recruited year round. The temporal pattern of tropical juvenile recruitment was found to have considerable interannual variation (Arai et al. 1999; Sugeha et al. 2001) (Figures  1 and 2). Thus, continuous long-term {{research is needed to determine}} the causes of the variation. Such year-round recruitment in tropical eels might be more convenient in aquaculture, which would be able to culture eels throughout year. In fact, 70 tonnes of eels were exported to Japan from one eel farm in Indonesia in 2013, and this amount is estimated to double in 2014 (Anonymous 2014). Because the present market price of juvenile eels is 150 times higher than 20  years ago, a number of village people near juvenile eel fishing grounds in Indonesia tend to concentrate on eel fishing only, whereas they used to focus on farming and fishing (Anonymous 2014). However, the juvenile eel catch is now reported to be half that of 20  years ago (Anonymous 2014), although the estimated decline has never been evaluated based on scientific research. The causes of decline in eel stocks and recruitment are not well understood. One of the main reasons must be overfishing, as sharp declines in wild European and Japanese eel populations correspond to drastically increased aquaculture demands for these eels since the 1970 s (Figure  4). Now, tropical eels may have begun to follow the same trends as the European and Japanese eels. This suggests that we cannot rule out overfishing in tropical countries. Thus, if the wild juvenile eel catch of tropical eels continues to increase without assessment and protection of the stock and regulation of the catchment, all eel populations will decline to numbers outside safe biological limits. Currently, European, American and Japanese eels are seriously threatened with extinction due to eel consumption (Figures  4 and 5), and demand is still increasing. After the stocks and recruitment collapse in the present target eel species and areas, we will have to seek other targets for replacement and compensation to continue eel consumption. We may not be able to see such a unique animal on the earth in the near future.|$|R
50|$|Lake Manapouri {{provides}} 73% of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand’s</b> longfin <b>eel</b> lake habitat {{protected from}} commercial fishing. However the lake {{has experienced a}} decline in numbers of longfin eels due {{to the construction of}} the hydro- electric dam blocking eel migration. The outflow passage is blocked by the hydro-electric dam which means that eels can be killed when passing through the turbines. A vertical slot fish pass was installed in 1999 and trap and transfer of elvers (young eels) was started in summer 1998/1999. Since the trap and transfer operation commenced in 1998/99 more than 407,000 elvers have been transferred upstream of the Maraoa Control structure. Catch totals in the trap and transfer system can vary in correspondence to surface water temperatures falling below 15 C. The trap and transfer technique was successful in improving fish distribution however operations had to be stopped in 2004 due to the concerns that transferring elvers to upstream habitats would spread the exotic invasive algae Didymosphenia geminata. The operation now transfers elvers just past the dam due to these concerns. There is concerns also that the trap and transfer operation does not trap enough silvers eels (eels of breading age) with an average of 200-400 annually. This however equates to only one silver eel per hectare within the lake which is much lower than standards recommended overseas. More research is needed to understand if trap and transfer is the best option in Lake Manapouri.|$|R

Due to the various artifactual factors that may affect the accuracy of qPCR, internal reference genes are most often used to normalize qPCR data. Recently, many studies have employed computer programs such as GeNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder in selecting reference genes, but very few statistically validate the outcomes of these programs. Thus, in this study, we selected reference genes for qPCR of liver and ovary samples of yellow (juvenile), migratory (silver) and 11 -KT treated juveniles of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> shortfinned <b>eels</b> (Anguilla australis) using the three computer programs and validate the selected genes statistically using REST 2009 software and the Mann-Whitney test. We also tested for the repeatability of use for the best reference genes by applying them to a data set obtained in a similar experiment conducted the previous year. Results Out of six candidate genes, the combination of 18 s and eef 1 {{was found to be}} the best statistically validated reference for liver, while in ovary it was l 36. However, discrepancies in gene rankings were found between the different programs. Also, statistical validation procedures showed that several genes put forward as being the best by the programs were in fact, regulated, making them unsuitable as reference genes. Additionally, eef 1 which was found to be a suitable - though not the top ranked - reference gene for liver tissues in one year, was regulated in another.

The goal of this dissertation is to characterize and quantify the types of microbial production consumed by methane-seep fauna. Through combined laboratory and field studies from four methane seep locations (11 <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> sites; <b>Eel</b> River; Hydrate Ridge; and Costa Rica’s Mound 12), I found that aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria and the syntrophic partnership which mediates the anaerobic oxidation of methane are consumed within metazoan food webs. In <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> two communities were largely fueled by methane: (1) a sponge which provided a habitat and trophic conduit of methane-derived production to {{a diversity}} of fauna and (2) ampharetid polychaete beds. These ampharetid beds formed a distinct community which was fueled by aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, as shown through stable isotopic and fatty-acid analysis coupled to a mass-specific mixing model. The Dorvilleidae, a polychaete family which excels at inhabiting areas with high microbial production, provided a ideal taxa to study metazoan trophic linkages to Archaea. In the laboratory, I raised Ophryotrocha labronica, a dorvilleid, from egg to reproduction on monocultures of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic food sources. This demonstrated that all domains of life can support viable metazoan populations. In contrast to current biomarker paradigms, this species exhibited isotopic enrichment (not composition) which was foodsource specific whereas fatty-acid signature was largely not; a finding that explained many of the patterns observed in the field studies. Although archaeal biomarkers were not transferred from diet to consumer, sulfate-reducing bacteria, {{a member of the}} assemblage responsible for the anaerobic oxidation of methane, provided a mechanism that identified archaeal aggregates as a food source for dorvilleids in both authigenic-carbonate and soft-sediment habitats. As a final example of microbial-metazoan interactions, during the formal description of a novel species of Yeti crab, I identified how this crab farms chemosynthetic-epibiotic bacteria by waving its bacteria-covered setae in methane-seep fluid.

Habitat-specific growth was further investigated with measurement of widths of annual bands in otoliths. Longfinned eels 170 - 1095 mm in length ranged between 4 and 60 years old (N= 252). Eels in pastoral streams grew faster (mean annual length increment ± 95 % CL = 24 ± 3 mm to 36 ± 7 mm) than eels in streams in indigenous forest (annual length increment 12 ± 2 mm to 15 ± 3 mm). Eels from the hydro-electric lakes had growth rates (annual length increments 19 ± 4 and 19 + 7 mm) similar to eels from pastoral streams. Otoliths of most eels showed annual band widths that indicated growth {{in several different}} habitats, corresponding to growth during upstream migration, and limited movement among adult habitats. Estimated age at marketable size (220 g) ranged between 7 and 26 years. The particularly slow growth of longfinned eels in streams in indigenous forest has considerable implications for management. The fast growth rates of eels in hydro-electric lakes provides evidence for the potential of increased eel production by stocking. The probable selective production of female eels in these lakes may be nationally important to allow enhancement of breeding stocks...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal {{of studying}} earth surface processes is to disentangle the complex web of interactions among baselevel, tectonics, climate, and rock properties that generate characteristic landforms. Mechanistic geomorphic transport laws can quantitatively address this goal, but no widely accepted law for landslides exists. Here we propose a transport law for deep-seated landslides in weathered bedrock and demonstrate its utility using a two-dimensional numerical landscape evolution model informed by study {{areas in the}} Waipaoa catchment, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> and the <b>Eel</b> River catchment, California. We define a non-dimensional landslide number, which is {{the ratio of the}} horizontal landslide flux to the vertical tectonic flux, that characterizes three distinct landscape types. One is dominated by stochastic landsliding, whereby discrete landslide events episodically erode material at rates exceeding the long-term uplift rate. Another is characterized by steady landsliding, in which the landslide flux at any location remains constant through time and is greatest at the steepest locations in the catchment. The third is not significantly affected by landsliding. In both the “stochastic landsliding” and “steady landsliding” regimes, increases in the non-dimensional landslide number systematically reduce catchment relief and widen valley spacing, producing long, low angle hillslopes despite high uplift rates. The stochastic landsliding regime captures the frequent observation that deep-seated landslides produce large sediment fluxes from small areal extents while being active {{only a fraction of the}} time. We suggest that this model is adaptable to a wide range of geologic settings and is useful for interpreting climate-driven changes in landslide behavior...|$|R
