5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> bind the trustee's hands.|$|E

Since 1971, when he identified and named the wobble, weave and capsize modes, Robin Sharp has written regularly about the behavior of motorcycles and bicycles. While at Imperial College, London, he worked with David Limebeer and Simos Evangelou.|$|E

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts.

For this reason, it is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E

He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

It is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels it was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> delve into {{the validity of the}} conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast {{and the federal government}} did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so it is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or {{more so than the}} genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
