30|$|Rheology, therefore, can {{be defined}} as the study of flow and {{deformation}} of matter. As such, the study of rheology is important when talking about flow in porous media; it helps us to understand the behaviour of these fluids. Fluid in porous media can be classified as Newtonian and non-Newtonian. For <b>Newtonian</b> fluid, the <b>viscosity</b> is expressed by the relationship between the stress and shear rate. In <b>Newtonian</b> fluid, the <b>viscosity</b> remains constant, no matter the amount of shear applied; therefore, the relationship between the viscosity and shear stress is linear.

This unique combination of numerical and experimental tools has enabled the full description of the ionic liquid rheological response to extreme conditions oftemperature, pressure and shear rate.

In this study, rheological and interfacial properties of almond gum and gum arabic aqueous dispersions were comparatively investigated. The interfacial tension of almond gum and gum arabic aqueous dispersions was measured using the pendant drop method in hexadecane. The asymptotic interfacial tension values for almond gum were significantly lower than the corresponding values measured for gum arabic, especially at high concentration. Rheological properties were characterized by steady and oscillatory tests using a coaxial geometry. Almond gum flow curves exhibited a shear thinning non-Newtonian behavior with a tendency to a Newtonian plateau at low shear rate, while gum arabic flow curves exhibited such behavior only at high shear rate. The influence of temperature (5 - 50 [*][*]℃) on the flow curves was studied at 4 % (m/m) gum concentration and the <b>Newtonian</b> <b>viscosities</b> at infinite and at zero shear rate, for gum arabic and almond gum, respectively, were accurately fitted by an Arrhenius-type equation.

To {{achieve this goal}} we investigate the rheology of aqueous solutions of Natrosol 250 HH, a rheology modifier employed in various industries to thicken viscous solutions. We report the rheological properties as functions of the concentration and temperature and discuss the advantages and limitations of these materials in view of their use in analogue modelling experiments. The solutions are linear visco-elastic for low stresses (or strain-rates), becoming shear-thinning for larger stresses. For the typically slow analogue experiments of tectonics, the solutions can be considered linear visco-elastic with a Maxwell relaxation time {{much smaller than the}} characteristic observation time. This simplification is even more appropriate when the solutions are employed at temperatures higher than 20 °C, since the solutions then display a behaviour that is more viscous, less elastic at the same shear-rate, while the <b>Newtonian</b> <b>viscosity</b> reduces and the shear-rate limit between Newtonian and shear-thinning behaviours increases. The <b>Newtonian</b> <b>viscosity</b> is shown to increase non-linearly with concentration and decrease non-linearly with temperature.

These expressions are based on an approximate theory which considers the viscosity as composed as the sum of two relevant physical processes: η (ϕ,ω) = η_∞(ϕ) + η_cd(ϕ,ω), where η_∞(ϕ) = η_ 0 χ(ϕ) is the infinite frequency (or very short time) viscosity, with η_ 0 the solvent viscosity, χ(ϕ) the equilibrium hard sphere radial distribution function at contact, and η_cd(ϕ,ω) the contribution due to the diffusion of the colloidal particles out of cages formed by their neighbors, on the Péclet time scale τ_P, the dominant physical process in concentrated colloidal suspensions. The <b>Newtonian</b> <b>viscosity</b> η_N(ϕ) = η(ϕ,ω = 0) agrees very well with the extensive experiments of Van der Werff et al and others. Also, the asymptotic behavior for large ω is of the form η_∞(ϕ) + A(ϕ) (ωτ_P) ^- 1 / 2, in agreement with these experiments, but the theoretical coefficient A(ϕ) differs by a constant factor 2 /χ(ϕ) from the exact coefficient, computed from the Green-Kubo formula for η(ϕ,ω). This still enables us to predict for practical purposes the visco-elastic behavior of monodisperse spherical colloidal suspensions for all volume fractions by a simple time rescaling.

For this purpose poly(butyl acrylate-styrene) particles are used; the stabilizer consists of a mixture of two surfactants, an ionic one and a nonionic one. The {{difference between the two}} latices resides in the length of the hydrophilic part of the surfactants. It is verified that the stabilization is essentially steric rather than electrostatic, Viscosities and dynamic moduli have been measured at various volume fractions, The evolution of the plateau values of the storage modulus with volume fraction is used to calculate the interaction potential. Its shape closely resembles those obtained earlier for nonaqueous dispersions with a similar stabilizer layer thickness. From the interparticle potential an effective hard sphere diameter can be derived. If the limiting <b>Newtonian</b> <b>viscosities</b> are plotted versus volume fraction as calculated from the effective hard sphere diameter, the curves superimpose on the available curves for chemically grafted, nonaqueous dispersions. For thick adsorbed layers, extrapolation of the potential to larger distances can become questionable for the computation of the effective hard sphere diameter. The dynamic moduli also obey the same scaling relations as those found for the chemically grafted systems. Using samples with different stabilizer layer thicknesses, a suggested scaling for the hydrodynamic thickness could be verified. It can be concluded that adsorption of a stabilizer layer can lead to a rheological behavior identical to that of chemical grafting and that the detailed rheological properties can be predicted in a Similar fashion.
