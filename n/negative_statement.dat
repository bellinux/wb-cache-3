25|$|The {{grammatical}} category {{associated with}} affirmative and negative is called polarity. This {{means that a}} sentence, verb phrase, etc. {{may be said to}} have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a <b>negative</b> <b>statement</b> is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as English not, an affix such as Japanese -nai, or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the predicate. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called negation – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.|$|E
25|$|A proper {{definition}} {{limits the}} kind of reasoning undertaken in the processing of an idea, expressed in natural language, with the object of limiting the impact of optimistic thinking that tends to result in an ideal-final explanation as the truth. One requirement of a definition {{is that if we}} define that A is equal to B, then the reverse (B is equal to A) must also be true, or it is necessary to modify the original definition (A = B). In addition, a proper definition should have the following components: (1) it should be as simple as possible; (2) it should not involve circular reasoning; (3) it must be general or common; (4) metaphor, analogy, figurative language, description, obscure words, ghaib (occult words), abstractions, and vagueness are forbidden; and (5) a definition should not contain any <b>negative</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E

50|$|Examples: “not too bad” for “very good” is an {{understatement}} {{as well as a}} double <b>negative</b> <b>statement</b> that confirms a positive idea by negating the opposite. Similarly, saying “She is not a beauty queen,” means “She is ugly” or saying “I am not as young as I used to be” in order to avoid saying “I am old”. Litotes, therefore, is an intentional use of understatement that renders an ironical effect.|$|E

40|$|In this article, a {{study is}} {{presented}} that analyzed {{the effect of}} implicit and explicit prejudice, egalitarian values, {{and the type of}} a discussion host on the expression of prejudice in a group discussion. A total of 91 Norwegians from two towns were randomly assigned to 1 of 17 group discussions with a topic that made it likely that immigrants in Norway would be discussed. Six discussion groups had a Norwegian hosts; 11 had a non-Norwegian host. The number of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>statements</b> about immigrants made by each individual as well as the ratio of <b>negative</b> to total <b>statements</b> was regressed on implicit prejudice, explicit prejudice, egalitarian value orientation, discussion host type, and their interactions. It was controlled for age and gender of the participants. In discussion groups with non-Norwegian hosts, the number of <b>negative</b> and positive <b>statements</b> about immigrants was lower, but the effect was stronger for <b>negative</b> <b>statements.</b> Strong egalitarian values reduced the number of <b>negative</b> <b>statements,</b> whereas strong explicit prejudice reduced the number of positive statements. © The Author(s) 2013.

50|$|Philo stated his {{theology}} both {{through the}} negation of opposed ideas, and through detailed, positive {{explanations of the}} nature of God. In his <b>negative</b> <b>statement,</b> he contrasted the nature of God with the nature of the physical world. He integrated select theology from the rabbinic tradition, including God's sublime transcendence, and man's inability to behold an ineffable God. However, he significantly disagreed with the theology that God actively changes the world, is filled with zeal, is moved by repentance, and aids his chosen people.|$|E
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of negation {{is different in}} intuitionist logic than in classical logic. In classical logic, the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is false; to an intuitionist, it means the statement is refutable(e.g., {{that there is a}} counterexample). There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and <b>negative</b> <b>statement</b> in intuitionism. If a statement P is provable, then it is certainly impossible to prove that there is no proof of P. But even if it can be shown that no disproof of P is possible, we cannot conclude from this absence that there is a proof of P. Thus P is a stronger statement than not-not-P.|$|E

Exp II, using a different treatment, studied the pretest effects of positive or <b>negative</b> <b>statements</b> on 162 undergraduates.

[...] She further highlights the discrepancy between the antisemitic implications of the survey results (such as those later identified by Judt) with the 77% percent of interviewees who responded that actions against Jews were in no way justified.|$|E
