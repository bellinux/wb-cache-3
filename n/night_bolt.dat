"Madam," [...] said old Dryfesdale the steward, [...] "this much do I say {{for this}} silly page, {{that he could}} not be accessary to {{unlocking}} the doors, since I myself this <b>night</b> <b>bolted</b> him out of the castle. Whoever limned this night-piece, the lad's share in it seems to have been small." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} stage, Marty gets {{to control the}} DeLorean time machine on the street at <b>night,</b> dodging {{lightning}} <b>bolts</b> and obstacles while accelerating {{in such a way}} as to reach 88 mph precisely at the end of the stage, enabling the time machine to bring Marty home to 1985.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Jamaican 4 Ã— 100 metres relay team, {{setting the}} world record and Olympic record on 11 August 2012, at the 2012 London Olympics. Frater ran the second leg, and his split was timed at 8.9 seconds, only surpassed that <b>night</b> by Usain <b>Bolt's</b> 8.8 seconds on the anchor leg.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} <b>night</b> Usain <b>Bolt</b> {{lined up for}} the 200 m final despite looking {{fatigued}} for the preliminary rounds in the final he ran a world record time of 19.19 seconds meaning that for everyone of his golds he had broken the world record and also that in Berlin he had knocked more than {{a tenth of a}} second of both his previous world records. The final was the first to have five men going under 20 seconds but despite this Bolt was two metres ahead of the field coming of the bend and just kept on running.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{semiotic}} {{analysts have}} examined music videos to decode messages {{that are being}} sent to viewers. Invisible editing, a semiotic term, that film editors use to almost decode the message for the audience using narrative actions. Daniel Chandler's example from famous film editor, Ralph Rosenblum, [...] "a man awakens suddenly {{in the middle of}} the <b>night,</b> <b>bolts</b> up in bed, stares ahead intensely, and twitches his nose. Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze"(Chandler, pp. 166, 2007). Because of the actions of the actors, the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown. An example of invisible editing in music videos would be in narrative style, which consist of a plot and storyline of events and characters Michael Jackson's music video, Thriller is considered a narrative script, and it exceeds the song itself. In this case, the context of visual narrative semantically over-powers the meaning of the song itself. Many music videos use narrative style script, which is considered a more formal approach as the editing will add emphasis to the song's chorus, giving it a deeply ingrained musical archetype. Music videos that aren't formally organized usually have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics, and contain abstract images. Sledgehammer, by Peter Gabriel is an example of formally unorganized music videos. In general, music videos contain visuals that either represent the potential connotative meaning of the lyrics or the visuals can represent a semiotic system of its own. Although many analysts explain the music video as being a narrative structure, there are many videos that defy narrative conventions.|$|R

They start playing with {{bows and arrows}} and frighten one of the Redwall abbey dwellers. One <b>night,</b> a lightning <b>bolt</b> strikes the weathervane of Redwall, and the sword of Martin the Warrior falls from its resting place high above the Abbey grounds and falls {{at the feet of}} Samkim, who is dumbfounded by his discovery.|$|R
2500|$|On the Friday {{night before}} the 1979 festival was officially opened, the festival [...] {{attendance}} had already reached its maximum capacity. At 3 am Saturday morning Peter {{was on the phone}} negotiating paddocks from neighboring farms, while Fred, Mike and Bernie were out in the dead of <b>night</b> with <b>bolt</b> cutters, removing fences to allow cars and campers into newly acquired festival acreage. By 11 am Saturday morning on opening day, the traffic police closed the festival, and were telling people to go home, announcing on radio that the event could accommodate no more patrons. They ordered the organizers to remove the entry gates to free the roads, as vehicles and pedestrians were banked up in all directions for some 20 kilometers. But still they arrived. Some 5 kilometers towards Waihi a tent city spontaneously arose on a neighboring farm where approximately 15,000 people parked and then walked the final leg into the festival site. Others abandoned their vehicles in Waihi itself and made the pilgrimage to Nambassa on foot.|$|R
60|$|But {{to pursue}} this melancholy, but {{necessary}} detail. I am next to open to your Lordships, what I am hereafter to prove, that the most substantial and leading yeomen, the responsible farmers, the parochial magistrates and chiefs of villages, were tied two and two by the legs together; and their tormentors, throwing them with their heads downwards, over a bar, beat them on the soles of the feet with rattans, until the nails fell from the toes; and then attacking them at their heads, as they hung downward, as before at their feet, they beat them with sticks and other instruments of blind fury, until the blood gushed out at their eyes, mouths, and noses. Not thinking that the ordinary whips and cudgels, even so administered, were sufficient, to others (and often also to the same who had suffered as I have stated) they applied, instead of rattan and bamboo, whips made of {{the branches of the}} bale tree,--a tree full of sharp and strong thorns, which tear the skin and lacerate the flesh far worse than ordinary scourges. For others, exploring with a searching and inquisitive malice, stimulated by an insatiate rapacity, all the devious paths of Nature for whatever is most unfriendly to man, they made rods of a plant highly caustic and poisonous, called Bechettea, every wound of which festers and gangrenes, adds double and treble to the present torture, leaves a crust of leprous sores upon the body, and often ends in the destruction of life itself. At night, these poor innocent sufferers, these martyrs of avarice and extortion, were brought into dungeons; and in the season when nature takes refuge in insensibility from all the miseries and cares which wait on life, they were three times scourged, and made to reckon the watches of the night by periods and intervals of torment. They were then led out, in the severe depth of winter, which there at certain seasons would be severe to any, to the Indians is most severe and almost intolerable,--they were led out before break of day, and, stiff and sore as they were with the bruises and wounds of the night, were plunged into water; and whilst their jaws clung together with the cold, and their bodies were rendered infinitely more sensible, the blows and stripes were renewed upon their backs; and then, delivering them over to soldiers, they were sent into their farms and villages to discover where a few handfuls of grain might be found concealed, or to extract some loan from the remnants of compassion and courage not subdued in those who had reason to fear that their own turn of torment would be next, that they should succeed them in the same punishment, and that their very humanity, being taken as a proof of their wealth, would subject them (as it did in many cases subject them) to the same inhuman tortures. After this circuit of the day through their plundered and ruined villages, they were remanded at night to the same prison, whipped, as before, at their return to the dungeon, and at morning whipped at their leaving it, and then sent, as before, to purchase, by begging in the day, the reiteration of the torture in the night. Days of menace, insult, and extortion, <b>nights</b> of <b>bolts,</b> fetters, and flagellation, succeeded {{to each other in the}} same round, and for a long time made up all the vicissitude of life to these miserable people.|$|R
