5|$|Some of {{the ministers}} heading congregations {{in the area}} {{attended}} the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, who saw {{the actions of the}} ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed to reply.|$|E

The peace agreement also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the French Red Cross {{supplied}} 1.5tons of supplies to approximately 10,000people victims of Kalunde. Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{publicly}} about Biko's death, the country's police minister Jimmy Kruger initially implied {{that it had}} been the result of a hunger strike, a statement he later denied. His account was challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them that he would never kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} then {{attempted to}} elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to {{him out of}} anger at the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying {{at one point that}} Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E

5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E
5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E

The Emma Lazarus Council declared in 1931 that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> evicted in Brighton Beach for {{inability to pay}} rent, then backed that up by rallying supporters to prevent evictions and returning tenants' furniture to their apartments in those cases in which authorities attempted to effect eviction.|$|E
25|$|Analysts {{and other}} activists said Ai had been widely {{thought to be}} untouchable, but Nicholas Bequelin from Human Rights Watch {{suggested}} that his arrest, calculated to send the message that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> immune, must have had the approval of someone in the top leadership. International governments, human rights groups and art institutions, among others, called for Ai's release, while Chinese officials did not notify Ai's family of his whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a suit over reverse {{discrimination}} brought by 20 white and Hispanic firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the firefighters, agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race. The case, Ricci v.

25|$|A {{utilitarian}} view {{asserts that}} it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all). An alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already {{in place in the}} situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.|$|E
25|$|During his Presidency, Narayanan {{dissolved}} the Lok Sabha twice after determining through consultations {{across the}} political spectrum, {{that no one was}} in a position to secure the confidence of the house. Congress president Sitaram Kesri withdrew his party's support of the I. K. Gujral government and staked his claim to form the government on 28 November 1997. Gujral advised Narayanan of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. President Narayanan determined that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha and accepted Gujral's advice (4 December). In the ensuing general elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the single largest party, leading the largest pre-election coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the coalition leader Vajpayee staked his claim to form the government, though at that point he did not have a majority. Narayanan asked Vajpayee to furnish letters of support to demonstrate the NDA's ability to secure a majority. Vajpayee was able to meet this demand after support for the NDA grew, and subsequently he was appointed Prime Minister (15 March 1998) on the condition (which was met) that a vote of confidence be secured within 10 days.|$|E
