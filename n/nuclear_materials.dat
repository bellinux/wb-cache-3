40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 ¿s, more than 600 cases of illicit trafficking involving radioactive or <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> {{have been reported in the}} IAEA database. The reported seizures obviously represent only the tip of an iceberg and we have to assume that the real number of cases of illicit trafficking of <b>nuclear</b> and radioactive <b>material</b> is significantly higher. Most of the reported seizures refer to radioactive sources (such as 137 Cs, 192 Ir, 60 Co or 90 Sr) originating from medical or industrial applications. These materials pose a radiological hazard due to their high activity. The seized samples of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> were generally of higher mass, yet of lower activity as compared to medical or industrial radioisotope sources. The threat associated with <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is going beyond the shear consideration of the number of Becquerel of seized sample. The radiotoxicity of the alpha emitting nuclides typically encountered in <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is significantly higher than that of beta or gamma emitters usually applied in medical sources. This represents a considerable hazard if the material is handled in inappropriate ways and particularly if considered in a terrorist context. The use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> in a radiological dispersal device (colloquially referred to as a ¿dirty bomb¿) is therefore a matter of serious concern. Furthermore, <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> ¿if available in sufficient quantity and quality- may be used in nuclear explosive devices. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is generally under strict control of competent national or international authorities. This control may involve accountancy and safeguards measures and is generally combined with strict physical protection of the material. However, the reported seizures of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> prove that <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> can be diverted or stolen in some instances. This leads to the conclusion that the implementation of treaties, agreements or conventions on safeguards and physical protection has not been fully achieved or suffers from gaps. Closing these gaps and improving the control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> at the sites where theft or diversion occurred are therefore of prime importance. This, however, requires the identification of the origin of the seized <b>nuclear</b> <b>material.</b> JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|R
40|$|Fight against illicit {{trafficking}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> {{relies on}} the possibility to detect <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> concealed in vehicles, people or cargo containers.

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty years, the threats posed by <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> and <b>nuclear</b> weapons have changed. These changes demand a new response. During the Cold War, the primary {{concern was that}} more States might {{establish}} programs to develop nuclear weapons. This is still a possibility, however, the concern of State proliferation of nuclear weapons has been joined by a new concern, namely the concern that a non-State actor might acquire a nuclear weapon or misuse nuclear or other radioactive material to create a disruptive nuclear security event. Because the threat has changed, international and national approaches to nuclear security need to change. Measures should be adopted world-wide that respond to {{the potential for a}} non-State actor to acquire and misuse <b>nuclear</b> <b>material.</b> (The primary subject of this paper is containing <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> threats. However, the same concepts that apply to <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> apply to other radioactive material, and from this point forward “nuclear material” could be interchanged with “nuclear and other radioactive material. ”) The first step in preventing a non-State actor from acquiring <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is for States to require nuclear facilities (i. e. organizations that possess <b>nuclear</b> <b>material)</b> to establish programs to maintain control over and account for the <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> that they possess. Most States already require a program of accounting for and control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> as part of their international nuclear safeguards programs. Enhancing existing <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> control and accounting (MC&A) programs could help to address the evolved threat to nuclear security, in addition to improving safeguards. This paper addresses the need to enhance existing MC&A programs to accommodate the needs of nuclear security. If you know what <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> you have, if you know where it is, and if you would recognize if it had gone missing, then you have taken the first step toward protecting people and the environment from misuse of it—one of the primary goals of nuclear security...|$|R

The statistical evaluation using the uncertainties associated with individual measurement systems involved in the calculation of the material balance provides a fair standard for concluding whether the apparent loss of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> means a diversion or whether the facility's accounting system needs improvement.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the means of}} preventing illegal use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> by terrorists or other sub-national groups and by governments. With respect to sub-national groups, it concludes that the preventative measures of national safeguards systems, when taken together with the practical difficulties of using <b>nuclear</b> <b>material,</b> would make the diversion and illegal use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> unattractive in comparison with other avenues open to these groups to attain their ends.
