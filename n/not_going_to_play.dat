He led the tournament in assists {{and was named}} tournament MVP, but Canada finished fourth, missing out on the three Olympic spots available. That {{was the last time}} Nash played for Canada; he was reportedly upset about the firing of head coach Jay Triano in 2004.

500|$|Lennon's quote was {{featured}} in a 3 July article in The New York Times Magazine and provoked no reaction. In late July, when Datebook republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote [...] "I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" [...] on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something {{ought to be done}} to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E

2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part of it was that I had really had it with the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> minor chords.

2500|$|After {{playing the}} first two rounds of the 2014 season, Trengove missed the {{remainder}} of the season due to problems and a break in his navicular bone. During the trade period, the Herald Sun reported that he was linked to [...] in exchange for pick twelve in the 2014 national draft. He was reluctant to the trade and expressed his desire to stay at Melbourne, but stated that he would not block the move if it was fulfilled. The trade was set to be finalised, but a medical report was requested by Richmond, where it was discovered that he had reinjured his navicular bone, and the trade was ruled out. There was uncertainty surrounding his 2015 season and whether he could make a return, before he confirmed to Melbourne radio station, Triple M, in April 2015 that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at all in 2015 and would instead focus on 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Roy {{was drafted}} in the third round, 51st overall, in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens, which he disliked, being {{a fan of the}} rival Quebec Nordiques. His {{grandmother}} Anna Peacock was a big Canadiens fan, but died before seeing her grandson being drafted. Roy kept playing for the Granby Bisons of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) before being called up by the Canadiens. Despite the thoughts that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the team, on February 23, 1985, he made his NHL debut when he replaced the Canadiens' starting goaltender, Doug Soetaert, in the game's third period. Roy played for 20 minutes and earned his first NHL win without allowing a goal. After the game, he was reassigned to the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the AHL. Despite starting as a backup, Roy replaced Greg Moffet after he had equipment troubles during a game. [...] He earned a win, became the starting goaltender for the playoffs and led the team to a Calder Cup championship with ten wins in 13 games.|$|E

In December 2011, before the January {{transfer}} window, Bolton manager Owen Coyle admitted that Cahill may be sold as his contract will expire {{at the end of the}} 2011–12 season. Coyle said, [...] "If he [...] does move, there is no doubt there will be top clubs clamouring for Gary." [...] This led much speculation that Cahill could move to higher-placed clubs like Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United or Tottenham Hotspur, all of which showed interest. On 23 December, Coyle confirmed that they had started negotiations with Chelsea about a possible transfer, and a week later a transfer fee was agreed. Despite being on the brink of joining Chelsea, Cahill continued to play for Bolton, scoring the crucial goal in the 1–2 away win against Everton at Goodison Park on 4 January 2012. Two days after that, Coyle said that Cahill was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in their FA Cup clash against Macclesfield Town, as it would leave him cup-tied for Chelsea.|$|E

We are glad that Mary is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>play</b> grown-ups parts. So many on the screen can be the grand lady.
