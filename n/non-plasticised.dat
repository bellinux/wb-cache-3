5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{material}} for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is {{sometimes referred to as}} Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 [...] "MATERIALS BASED ON <b>NON-PLASTICISED</b> POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.|$|E
40|$|A methacrylic-acrylic polymer was {{synthesised}} {{for use as}} a <b>non-plasticised</b> membrane for hydrogen ion-selective sensor incorporating tridodecylamine as an ionophore. The copolymer {{consisted of}} methyl methacrylate and n-butyl acrylate monomers in a ratio of 2 : 8. Characterisation of the copolymer using FTNMR demonstrated that the amount of each monomer incorporated during solution polymerisation was found to be similar to the amount used in the feed before polymerisation. The glass transition temperature of the copolymer determined by differential scanning calorimetry was - 30. 9 Ã‚ÂºC. Potentiometric measurements conducted showed a linear pH response range of 4. 3 Ã¢Â€Â“ 9. 6 with the response slope of 56. 7 mV/decade. The selectivity of the sensors towards hydrogen ions was similar to other plasticiser based membrane electrodes and the logarithmic selectivity coefficients for discrimination against interference cations is close to Ã¢Â€Â“ 9. 7. However, the incorporation of a lipophilic anion as membrane additive is essential in ensuring optimum performance of the hydrogen ion sensor...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the characterisation of fine aggregates manufactured from waste quarry material and their use in concrete supported by artificial neural network models of the fresh and hardened concrete properties. The reutilization of rock filler, a by-product of the sand manufacturing process, as a soil liming material is explored. A set of tests and techniques were identified to characterise fine aggregates manufactured from quarry dusts via a dry processing system. Granite, limestone, sandstone and basalt manufactured sands and their unprocessed counterparts “feed quarry dusts” were characterised with respect to their shape and texture, grading and quality of fines (presence of clays). The results showed that the reprocessing of quarry dusts improves the particle shape and grading irrespective of rock mineralogy. Plasticised and <b>non-plasticised</b> concrete mixes were developed and the fresh and hardened properties tested. Concrete consistency, compressive and flexural strength is correlated with the fine aggregate characterisation test results. The manufactured fine aggregates showed a higher water demand when compared with natural sand whereas compressive and flexural strengths were enhanced. Artificial neural network models were developed to enable the prediction of the consistency and compressive strength of concrete. These models used the fine aggregate properties and mix composition parameters as input variables and were validated using a separate testing dataset, additional concrete mixes and numerical evaluation. Artificial neural network models were shown to be able to predict fresh and hardened concrete properties based on the fine aggregate characteristics. The excess fillers created in the sand manufacturing process were evaluated for soil liming potential through standard tests and a soil incubation study. The main finding was that materials with high silicate content exhibit a potential for liming, however, a higher dosage is required when compared to the dosage of high purity limestone to achieve the same liming potential...|$|E
40|$|High-pressure {{rheology}} {{has been}} used to assess the effects of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) on the melting point (Tm) and viscosity of poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) over a range of temperatures and pressures up to 300 bar over a wide range of shear rates. Plots of the storage and loss moduli against temperature show a significant shift of Tm to lower temperatures in the presence of CO 2, indicating that the polymer crystals melt at temperatures much lower than the ambient pressure Tm. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the viscosity of two PCL grades with different molecular weight (Mn ~ 10 kDa and 80 kDa) was also detected upon increasing the CO 2 pressure to 300 bar. Experimental viscosity data were fitted to the Carreau model to quantify the extent of the plasticising effects on the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time under different conditions. Similar analyses were conducted under high-pressure nitrogen, to compare the effects obtained {{in the presence of a}} <b>non-plasticising</b> gas...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant {{segregation}} in solid polymer films {{is a little}} studied area of scientific research. This investigation launches an initial exploration into the behaviour of surfactant and plasticiser (glycerol) molecules in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. By understanding the nature of segregation within these systems, information regarding the compatibility of components can be gained. A greater understanding of what dictates compatibility and small molecule {{segregation in}} polymers is of importance to many industrial products and processes. Using a series of ion beam analysis and neutron reflectometry experiments the segregation behaviour of three non-ionic, and two ionic surfactants is studied in great detail, both in binary <b>non-plasticised</b> and ternary plasticised PVA films. In order to use these techniques effectively, samples were mostly spin-cast, silicon substrate bound polymer films, of thickness < 200 nm. The non-ionic surfactants studied were a series of poly(oxyethylene glycol) alkyl ethers with a 12 -carbon lipophilic tail-group (C 12 Ex). Each of these surfactants exhibited spontaneous segregation to the air and/or substrate interface of the polymer film in binary films with PVA. Upon the introduction of plasticiser under ambient conditions, the amount of surface segregating surfactant is reduced, causing a greater concentration {{to be present in}} the bulk. However, when studied under relative humidity control the opposite effect is realised, and the presence of water in the films causes increased surfactant segregation. The ionic surfactants studied are cetlytrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In binary films with PVA, CTAB shows no segregating nature, until glycerol is introduced, at which point substrate and surface segregation is induced. SDS shows development of significant surfactant-plasticiser multi-lamella structures {{on the surface of the}} thin films upon the introduction of the glycerol. SDS-glycerol structures like this, with interstitial regions of plasticiser stabilising the surfactant lamellae are unlike anything seen on the surface of a solid polymer film before. Both of these features infer a complex array of interactions with the plasticiser. Surface energy and compatibility arguments are provided throughout to explain the diverse range of surfactant behaviours discovered in this work. Where surface energy is believed to be the driving force of surface segregation, with lower energy components segregating more, and compatibility to be the force which dictates how segregation behaves upon the introduction of plasticiser. Compatibility arguments are mostly comprised of the hydrogen bonding potential of the compounds within the films, where strong interactions between the polymer, plasticiser and surfactant give rise to increased compatibility, and therefore reduced segregation. Through this work, new, exciting information on the nature of small molecules in polymer systems is realised...|$|E
