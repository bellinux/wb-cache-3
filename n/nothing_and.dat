An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E

Two pretenders to Geoffrey's inheritance appeared {{over the next few}} years: a certain John Pestel, who achieved <b>nothing,</b> <b>and</b> Geoffrey's nephew, Geoffrey the Younger, who after much persistence managed to obtain the fief of Moraina.|$|E
5|$|Leaving {{his wife}} Greta {{and their two}} {{children}} in Britain, O'Leary returned to Canada in March 1921 with the purported intention of rejoining the RNWMP, newly renamed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. For unknown reasons, this plan came to <b>nothing</b> <b>and</b> after some months giving lectures on his war service and working in a publishing house, O'Leary joined the Ontario Provincial Police, charged with enforcing the prohibition laws. In 1924, with his family recently arrived from England, O'Leary left the Ontario police force and became a police sergeant with the Michigan Central Railway in Bridgeburg, Ontario, receiving £33 a month.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, {{he said in an}} interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to <b>nothing,</b> <b>and</b> Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E

5|$|Mosley {{was elected}} to his third term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone's management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing the value of their investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship to start by 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley was too close to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to <b>nothing</b> <b>and</b> the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).|$|E
5|$|On 29 June Army Norway {{launched}} {{its effort to}} capture Murmansk in a pincer attack. The northern pincer, conducted by Mountain Corps Norway, approached Murmansk directly by crossing the border at Petsamo. However, in mid-July after securing {{the neck of the}} Rybachy Peninsula and advancing to the Litsa River the German advance was stopped by heavy resistance from the Soviet 14th Army. Renewed attacks led to <b>nothing,</b> <b>and</b> this front became a stalemate for the remainder of Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|On Nothing, Meshuggah {{abandons}} {{the fast}} tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album {{was intended to}} be recorded using custom-made Nevborn eight-string guitars, but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used detuned Ibanez seven-string guitars instead. This technique, which involved keeping the instruments untuned during the sessions, created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for <b>Nothing</b> <b>and</b> re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars.|$|E

Although Stamford Corporation {{attempted}} to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were unable to do so.

These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed on the level.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to <b>nothing</b> (<b>and</b> would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{took part}} in the {{negotiations}} in August and September 1169 that attempted to reach a settlement between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks.

Reginald {{was one of the main}} clerics working for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Henry's plans to reward the four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.|$|E

5|$|When first discovered, Sedna {{was thought}} to have an unusually long {{rotational}} period (20 to 50 days).
