60|$|Thus he {{had come}} down, foreseeing with {{confidence}} how almost everything would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, {{that there would be}} no surprises in his visit. But he had found that humdrum world in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most fatal epoch of his life. The next morning he felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences--he dreaded so much the immediate issues before him--that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that he might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing or saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine, from the shallow absoluteness of men's judgments. He had found Lydgate, for whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why, in spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a creature of Will's susceptible temperament--without any <b>neutral</b> <b>region</b> of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him into the collisions of a passionate drama--the revelation that Rosamond had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for him. He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness of his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded. And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his fresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure: the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also despair.|$|E

50|$|With {{a battery}} {{connected}} this way, {{the holes in}} the p-type region and the electrons in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to neutralize the depletion zone, reducing its width. The positive potential applied to the p-type material repels the holes, while the negative potential applied to the n-type material repels the electrons. The change in potential between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign. With increasing forward-bias voltage, the depletion zone eventually becomes thin enough that the zone's electric field cannot counteract charge carrier motion across the p-n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. The electrons that cross the p-n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) will diffuse into the nearby <b>neutral</b> <b>region.</b> The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that may flow through the diode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Consider a given space, e. g., the Euclidean plane, and its decompo-sition into Voronoi regions {{induced by}} given sites.

These objects are defined in a somewhat implicit way and they also induce a decomposition of the space into regions.

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{analyses}} are often {{limited by the}} availability of appropriate molecular markers. Markers from neutrally evolving genomic regions may be particularly useful for inferring evolutionary histories because they escape the constraints of natural selection. For the majority of taxa however, obtaining such markers is challenging. Advances in genomics {{have the potential to}} alleviate the shortage of neutral markers. Here we present a method to develop numerous markers from putatively <b>neutral</b> <b>regions</b> of primate genomes. Results We began with the available whole genome sequences of human, chimpanzee and macaque. Using computational methods, we identified a total of 280 potential amplicons from putatively <b>neutral,</b> non-coding, non-repetitive <b>regions</b> of these genomes. Subsequently we amplified, using experimental methods, many of these amplicons from diverse primate taxa, including a ring-tailed lemur, which is distantly related to the genomic resources. Using a subset of 10 markers, we demonstrate the utility of the developed markers in phylogenetic and evolutionary rate analyses. Particularly, we uncovered substantial evolutionary rate variation among lineages, some of which are previously not reported. Conclusion We successfully developed numerous markers from putatively <b>neutral</b> <b>regions</b> of primate genomes using a strategy combining computational and experimental methods. Applying these markers to phylogenetic and evolutionary rate variation analyses exemplifies the utility of these markers. Diverse ecological and evolutionary analyses will benefit from these markers. Importantly, methods similar to those presented here can be applied to other taxa in the near future. </p...|$|R

This suppression is shown to increase {{the sensitivity of the}} neutrino bursts studies to the magnetic moment of neutrino by 1. 5 - 2 orders of magnitude, and for realistic magnetic field the observable effects may exist for (2 - 3) 10 ^{- 14 } Bohr magneton. In the isotopically <b>neutral</b> <b>region</b> the jumps of the effective potential exist which influence the probabilities of transitions. The experimental signatures of the spin-flavor transitions are discussed. In particular, in the case of direct mass hierarchy, the spin-flip effects result in a variety of modifications of the electron antineutrino spectrum. Taking this into account, we estimated the upper bounds on the magnetic moment from the SN 1987 A data. In the isotopically <b>neutral</b> <b>region</b> the effects of possible twist of the magnetic field on the way of neutrinos can be important, inducing distortion of the neutrino energy spectra and further increasing the sensitivity.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of sex determination varies substantively among evolutionary lineages. One important mode of genetic sex determination is haplodiploidy, {{which is used}} by ∼ 20 % of all animal species, including > 200, 000 species of the entire insect order Hymenoptera. In the honey bee Apis mellifera, a hymenopteran model organism, females are heterozygous at the csd (complementary sex determination) locus, whereas males are hemizygous (from unfertilized eggs). Fertilized homozygotes develop into sterile males that are eaten before maturity. Because homozygotes have zero fitness and because common alleles {{are more likely than}} rare ones to form homozygotes, csd should be subject to strong overdominant selection and negative frequency-dependent selection. Under these selective forces, together known as balancing selection, csd is expected to exhibit a high degree of intraspecific polymorphism, with long-lived alleles that may be even older than the species. Here we sequence the csd genes as well as randomly selected <b>neutral</b> genomic <b>regions</b> from individuals of three closely related species, A. mellifera, Apis cerana, and Apis dorsata. The polymorphic level is approximately seven times higher in csd than in the <b>neutral</b> <b>regions.</b> Gene genealogies reveal trans-species polymorphisms at csd but not at any <b>neutral</b> <b>regions.</b> Consistent with the prediction of rare-allele advantage, nonsynonymous mutations are found to be positively selected in csd only in early stages after their appearances. Surprisingly, three different hypervariable repetitive regions in csd are present in the three species, suggesting variable mechanisms underlying allelic specificities. Our results provide a definitive demonstration of balancing selection acting at the honey bee csd gene, offer insights into the molecular determinants of csd allelic specificities, and help avoid homozygosity in bee breeding...|$|R
