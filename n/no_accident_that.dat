The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy. It may be <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> the Youth in the poem has connections to flower-imagery (the Narcissus being the Wild Daffodil).|$|E
25|$|Although {{conversion}} {{was not as}} rapid as Ismail’s forcible policies might suggest, {{the vast}} majority of those who lived in the territory of what is now Iran and Azerbaijan did identify with Shiism {{by the end of the}} Safavid era in 1722. Thus, the population of Azerbaijan was forcibly converted to Shiism in the early 16th century at the same time as the people of what is nowadays Iran, when the Safavids held sway over it. Hence it is <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> in Iran and Azerbaijan, today's Sunni minorities are concentrated among the country’s non-Persian and non-Azerbaijani ethnic groups that are scattered along the country’s borders, with their Sunni co-nationals next door.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours....

Garber of the NASM interviewed Coandă, who related {{that the}} December 1910 flight was <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>that</b> he had seated {{himself in the}} cockpit {{intending}} to test five factors: aircraft structure, the engine, the wing lift, the balance of controls, and the aerodynamics. He said that {{the heat from the}} engine was [...] "fantastic", but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from the wooden fuselage. Garber wrote that as Coandă's aircraft began to move forward and rise from the ground, [...] "the exhaust flame, instead of fanning outward, curved inward and ignited the aircraft." [...] In this interview Coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control, but the landing was [...] "abrupt" [...] and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame, the engine reduced to [...] "a few handfuls of white powder." ...|$|E
500|$|The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, {{beyond the}} frost line, {{which is the}} point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the {{material}} is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to [...] within about 3million years. Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun. Theorists believe it is <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) {{on the order of}} , which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate. [...] Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150Earth masses ~105years thereafter and finally topping out at [...] [...] Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume.|$|E

He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare.

The end of the 19th century was not the only or the last time Zarathustra played a prominent role in shaping Western consciousness and philosophic discourse.

Some of the stone has been removed for local construction, but the Abbey ruins remain some of the most complete of any medieval religious house to survive in Scotland.
