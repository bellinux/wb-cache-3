In this investigation {{two different types of}} <b>nested</b> <b>ring</b> configurations are analysed: (A) In-Plane; where three rings of varying diameter are placed within each other and their axes are parallel. (B) Out of-Plane; where the rings have a 90 degree orientation. Material used was cold finished, drawn over mandrel (DIN 2393 ST 37 - 2) and is referred throughout the paper as mild steel. The Cowper-Symonds relation was used to predict the dynamic yield stress of the rings and this was included in the FE material model. The results obtained from experiments were compared to that of finite element method using the software package Ansys. Discussion is made on the post – collapse behaviour of these systems. It was found that the Out of-Plane ring system exhibited a more desirable force-deflection response due to its 90 degree orientation...|$|R

Strain gauge based force sensors {{are among the}} most common methods of measuring static and dynamic forces, yet they suffer from a wide array of negative attributes including: high cost due to signal amplification instrumentation, high temperature sensitivity, and only moderate dynamic range.

While Zeeman-Doppler imaging can provide surface magnetic field maps over much of the observed stellar surface, the Zeeman signature is suppressed in the dark polar regions. We have determined the effect on the global coronal structure of three current models for this polar field: that it is composed (a) of unipolar field, (b) of bipolar regions or (c) of <b>nested</b> <b>rings</b> of opposite polarity. We take as an example the young, rapid rotator AB Dor (rotation period = 0. 514 days). By adding these model polar fields into the surface field maps determined from Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we have compared the resulting coronal structure with the observable properties of the corona - the magnitude and rotational modulation of the X-ray emission measure and the presence of slingshot prominences trapped in the corona around the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We find that only the presence of a unipolar spot has any significant effect on the overall coronal structure, forcing much of the polar field to be open. Comment: 10 pages, 21 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Richat {{structure}} (Sahara, Mauritania) {{appears as}} a large dome at least 40 km in diameter within a Late Proterozoic to Ordovician sequence. Erosion has created circular cuestas represented by three <b>nested</b> <b>rings</b> dipping outward from the structure. The center of the structure consists of a limestone-dolomite shelf that encloses a kilometer-scale siliceous breccia and is intruded by basaltic ring dikes, kimberlitic intrusions, and alkaline volcanic rocks. Several hypotheses have been presented to explain the spectacular Richat structure and breccia, but their origin remains enigmatic. The breccia body is lenticular in shape and irregularly thins at its extremities to only a few meters. The breccia was created during karst dissolution and collapse. Internal sediments fill the centimeter- to meter-scale cavities. Alkaline enrichment {{and the presence of}} Cretaceous automorphous neoformed K-feldspar demonstrate the hydrothermal origin of these internal sediments and their contemporaneity with magmatism. A model is proposed in which doming and the production of hydrothermal fluids were instrumental in creating a favorable setting for dissolution. The circular Richat structure and its breccia core thus represent the superficial expression of a Cretaceous alkaline complex with an exceptionally well preserved hydrothermal karst infilling at its summit. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with a design study by an interdisciplinary team on visualizing a 10 -year record of sea-sonal and inter-annual changes in frontal position (advance/retreat) of nearly 200 marine terminating glaciers in Greenland. Whilst the spatiotemporal nature of the raw data presents a challenge to develop a compact and intuitive visual design, the focus on coastal boundaries {{provides an opportunity for}} dimensional reduction. In this paper, we report the user-centered design process carried out by the team, and present several visual encod-ing schemes that have met the requirements including compactness, intuitiveness, and ability to depict temporal changes and spatial relations. In particular, we designed a family of radial visualization, where radial lines corre-spond to different coastal locations, and <b>nested</b> <b>rings</b> represent the evolution of the temporal dimension from inner to outer circles. We developed an algorithm for mapping glacier terminus positions from Cartesian coordinates to angular coordinates.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} an axisymmetric stagnation {{flow past}} a small solid sphere touching an air bubble, which is significantly {{larger than the}} particle but smaller than the capillary length so that the deformation can be neglected. The disturbed flow due {{to the presence of}} the particle at the bubble surface was modelled by considering an axisymmetric stagnation point flow about a sphere and a plane. The stream function for the disturbed flow was derived based on the tangent-sphere coordinates. It is shown that the flow separation having an infinite set of <b>nested</b> <b>ring</b> vortices exists in a finite region enclosing the contact point. The presence of such vortices might have considerable influence on the bubble-particle attachment {{as well as on the}} transport of surfactants during the bubble-particle interaction. The force equation was obtained from the derived stream function and was equated to the modified Stokes drag force equation, and then an expression for the correction factor was obtained. The model for the correction factor includes the effect of particle size, and predicts finite force values at zero separation distance between the particle and bubble surfaces. The models presented in this paper should provide a better estimate for calculating the normal (stagnation flow) fluid force acting on particles in contact with bubbles in the multiphase flows found in mineral flotation and other metallurgical operations...|$|R

40|$|A salient {{stimulus}} may interrupt visual search {{because of}} attentional capture. It {{has been shown}} that attentional capture occurs with a wide, but not with a small attentional window. We tested the hypothesis that capture depends more strongly on the shape of the attentional window than on its size. Search elements were arranged in two <b>nested</b> <b>rings.</b> The ring containing the search target remained fixed, while a salient color singleton occurred either in the same or in the other ring. We observed that color singletons only disrupted search when shown in the same ring as the search target. It is important to note that, when focusing on the outer array, which presumably required a larger attentional window, singletons on the inner array did not capture attention. In contrast to the original attentional window hypothesis, our results show that attentional capture does not always occur with a large attentional window. Rather, attention can be flexibly allocated to the set of relevant stimulus locations and attentional capture is confined to the attended locations. Further experiments showed that attention was allocated to search elements that were perceptually grouped into “whole ” or “Gestalt”-like objects, which prevented attentional capture from nearby locations. However, when attention was allocated to noncontiguous locations that did not form a perceptual Gestalt, nearby locations elicited attentional capture. Perceptual grouping could be based on a combination of color and position, but not on color alone. Thus, the allocation of attention to Gestalt-like objects that were jointly defined by similarity and proximity prevented attentional capture from nearby locations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: A {{fundamental}} {{challenge of}} evolutionary and developmental biology is understanding how new characters arise and change. The recently derived eyespots on butterfly wings vary extensively {{in number and}} pattern between species and play important roles in predator avoidance. Eyespots form through the activity of inductive organizers (foci) {{at the center of}} developing eyespot fields. Foci are the proposed source of a morphogen, the levels of which determine the color of surrounding wing scale cells. However, it is unknown how reception of the focal signal translates into rings of different-colored scales, nor how different color schemes arise in different species. Results: We have identified several transcription factors, including butterfly homologs of the Drosophila Engrailed/Invected and Spalt proteins, that are deployed in concentric territories corresponding to the future rings of pigmented scales that compose the adult eyespot. We have isolated a new Bicyclus anynana wing pattern mutant, Goldeneye, in which the scales of one inner color ring become the color of a different ring. These changes correlate with shifts in transcription factor expression, suggesting that Goldeneye affects an early regulatory step in eyespot color patterning. In different butterfly species, the same transcription factors are expressed in eyespot fields, but in different relative spatial domains that correlate with divergent eyespot color schemes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that signaling from the focus induces <b>nested</b> <b>rings</b> of regulatory gene expression that subsequently control the final color pattern. Furthermore, the remarkably plastic regulatory interactions downstream of focal signaling have facilitated the evolution of eyespot diversity...|$|R

The advantages of a permanent magnet quadrupole as a final focus quadrupole magnet would be its vibration free property together with its compactness. In order to make full use of these properties in a beamline strength adjustability has to be added. Current activities and future plans for R&D are described after a short history is presented. 1 Short History of the R&D The series of R&D tasks were started from JFY (Japanese Fiscal Year) 2002 fllowing approval of the program. A “Super Strong Permanent Magnet ” scheme was utilized in the fabrication of magnets during this program. This is a so called extended Halbach configuration that enhances the field strength generated by use of soft magnetic materials such as permedur at the pole regions. A fixed strength Permanent Magnet Quadrupole (PMQ) was fabricated in the first FY, which achieved an integrated strength of 28. 5 T in 14 mm bore diameter, where the outer diameter and the length were 130 mm and 100 mm, respectively (see Figure 1). The peak field gradient corresponds to 290 T/m [2]. A variable type PMQ was fabricated in FY 2003, which uses the double ring structure (see Figure 2). The PMQ was divided into two <b>nested</b> <b>rings</b> with a rotatable outer ring while the inner ring is fixed. The rotation angle was restricted to only 0 ° and 90 ° to eliminate the skew component, which must be highly inhibited in Final Focus system in ILC.

40|$|The crustal {{history of}} two {{structurally}} complex areas {{on two different}} planetary bodies is explored, {{using a combination of}} image and topographic analysis, kinematic mapping and numerical modeling. Throughout the polygonal terrain of Utopia Planitia, Mars are found circular grabens that are inferred to overlie the rims of buried impact craters. The correspondence of circular grabens and polygonal terrain suggests that their formation may be intrinsically linked. A topographic analysis of circular grabens shows that they bound topographic depressions whose surface relief scales directly with diameter, consistent with a model of polygon formation dependent upon a “wet” cover material. A model is presented for why the circular grabens are sometimes comprised of two <b>nested</b> <b>ring</b> fractures. The model results imply that cover material in the southwestern polygonal area of Utopia may range from 1 – 2 km thick and strongly favors a wet sedimentary origin for the cover material. A systematic study of the topography of quasi-circular depressions (QCDs) around the Utopia Basin is presented. The results of this study support the assumption that QCDs are the surface representations of buried impact craters. There are ridges radial to Irnini Mons, Venus, revealed by high resolution mapping at 75 m/pixel. Unlike the unit of arcuate ridges directly south, these ridges are on top of the Irini flows and cannot be an older feature. Analytical modeling of the perturbation of regional stresses around a pressurized magma chamber conduit shows that {{in the presence of the}} regional north-south compression, responsible for the regional set of east-west trending wrinkle ridges, circumferential stresses can be compressive. Directional models of Venus 2 ̆ 7 tectonic history argue that all wrinkle ridge formation occurred prior to the formation of large volcanoes. Thus, continuing the regional compression that formed the wrinkle ridges through the volcano building event contradicts directionalism and supports non-directional tectonic models. ...|$|R

Studies of the phase behavior and phenomenology of such suspensions {{show that the}} LC is nematic, in agreement with theory, but that the predicted lamellar smectic phase does not appear. At high concentration lamellar correlations grow in the nematic but are limited in range, either by the finite size of the sheets or by defects in the sheets. Coexistence of the nematic with an isotropic phase is observed at all concentrations, indicating a long range attraction between the sheets. At high concentration the coexisting LC forms lens-shaped nematic tactoids, analysis of which enables estimates of the nematic elasticity and surface tension. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the bispherical internal structure of the nematic director field in the tactoids. Nematic cells with initial homeotropic orientation exhibit a periodic instability in the director field, which is unstable against {{the formation of a}} bend undulation of the sheets. This phenomenon, which is also observed in lyotropic colloidal suspensions of graphene oxide sheets, may be attributed to flexopolydispersity, the slow internal rearrangement of sheets of different size to optimize their spacing and thereby maximize entropy. Azobenzene-based molecules which form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) tethered to a glass surface are highly photo-sensitive and dynamically orient liquid crystals in contact with them when illuminated with polarized actinic light. We probe the coupling of such monolayers to the nematic liquid crystal in a hybrid cell by studying the dynamics of liquid crystal reorientation in response to local orientational changes of the monolayer by a focused actinic laser with a rotating polarization. This locally reorients the nematic, winding up a set of <b>nested</b> <b>rings</b> of splay-bend nematic director reorientation until the required torque exceeds that of the surface coupling, after which the nematic director starts to slip.

The mechanical implementation of the experiment and some representative results obtained with Laser Doppler Velocimetry in water are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} (~ 5 '') {{image of the}} nucleus of M 82 showing the presence of widespread emission of the formyl radical (HCO). The HCO map, the first obtained in an external galaxy, reveals {{the existence of a}} structured disk of ~ 650 pc full diameter. The HCO distribution in the plane mimics the ring morphology displayed by other molecular/ionized gas tracers in M 82. More precisely, rings traced by HCO, CO and HII regions are nested, with the HCO ring lying in {{the outer edge of the}} molecular torus. Observations of HCO in galactic clouds indicate that the abundance of HCO is strongly enhanced in the interfaces between the ionized and molecular gas. The surprisingly high overall abundance of HCO measured in M 82 (X(HCO) ~ 4 x 10 ^{- 10 }) indicates that its nuclear disk can be viewed as a giant Photon Dominated Region (PDR) of ~ 650 pc size. The existence of various <b>nested</b> gas <b>rings,</b> with the highest HCO abundance occurring at the outer ring (X(HCO) ~ 0. 8 x 10 ^{- 9 }), suggests that PDR chemistry is propagating in the disk. We discuss the inferred large abundances of HCO in M 82 in the context of a starburst evolutionary scenario, picturing the M 82 nucleus as an evolved starburst.

40|$|Detailed {{calculation}} of the heat distributions in the structural parts of the target (Hg) and the target itself were made with realistic proton profiles. Preliminary current profiles of the protons coming from the accumulator ring, calculated and parameterized by the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), were used as input to the Monte Carlo code LAHET. Due to limitations of the present version of the LAHET code, the real source was approximated with a <b>nest</b> of elliptical <b>rings</b> (all with the same eccentricity). The BNL's source was then fitted according to this elliptical description considering two constraints: (1) to preserve {{the areas of the}} contours of equal intensity of the real proton current density, and (2) to keep the ellipses with the same shape. In this way the best elliptical shape to describe the source was found. Because of the gaussian nature of the real current distribution, the elliptical fit is also gaussian in the elliptical coordinate...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we exhibit {{an example of}} a {{three-dimensional}} regular local domain (A, n) having a height-two prime ideal P with the property that the extension PA^ of P to the n-adic completion A^ of A is not integrally closed. We use a construction we have studied in earlier papers: For R=k[x,y,z], where k is a field of characteristic zero and x,y,z are indeterminates over k, the example A is an intersection of the localization of the power series ring k[y,z][[x]] at the maximal ideal (x,y,z) with the field k(x,y,z,f, g) where f, g are elements of (x,y,z) k[y,z][[x]] that are algebraically independent over k(x,y,z). The elements f, g are chosen {{in such a way that}} using results from our earlier papers A is Noetherian and it is possible to describe A as a <b>nested</b> union of <b>rings</b> associated to A that are localized polynomial rings over k in five variables.

40|$|We report remote {{strain and}} {{displacement}} measurement during elastic and plastic deformation using a metamaterial-based wireless and passive sensor. The sensor {{is made of}} a comb-like <b>nested</b> split <b>ring</b> resonator (NSRR) probe operating in the near-field of an antenna, which functions as both the transmitter and the receiver. The NSRR probe is fixed on a standard steel reinforcing bar (rebar), and its frequency response is monitored telemetrically by a network analyzer connected to the antenna across the whole stress-strain curve. This wireless measurement includes both the elastic and plastic region deformation {{together for the first}} time, where wired technologies, like strain gauges, typically fail to capture. The experiments are further repeated {{in the presence of a}} concrete block between the antenna and the probe, and it is shown that the sensing system is capable of functioning through the concrete. The comparison of the wireless sensor measurement with those undertaken using strain gauges and extensometers reveals that the sensor is able to measure both the average strain and the relative displacement on the rebar as a result of the applied force in a considerably accurate way. The performance of the sensor is tested for different types of misalignments that can possibly occur due to the acting force. These results indicate that the metamaterial-based sensor holds great promise for its accurate, robust and wireless measurement of the elastic and plastic deformation of a rebar, providing beneficial information for remote structural health monitoring and post-earthquake damage assessment. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R
