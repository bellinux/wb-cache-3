5|$|Brian {{turns down}} {{a chance to}} see Disney on Ice with Jillian, so she decides to give his ticket to Peter. After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization that there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly {{gets in the way of}} Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E
25|$|For a man it’s {{certainly}} hard to {{be truly}} good—perfect in hands, feet, and mind, built without a single flaw; only a god could have that prize; but a mere man, there’s just <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> can help being bad when some overwhelming disaster knocks him down. Any man’s good when life treats him well, and bad when it treats him badly, {{and the best of}} us are the ones the gods love most.|$|E
25|$|There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> didn't see her, {{since she}} was {{practically}} looking into the cabin. At one stage, he turned around toward the building. The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, {{the case}} of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng {{triggered}} a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen were permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he's</b> going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton {{set the record straight}} about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came out and said that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E
500|$|Gomez fought Amir Khan for the Commonwealth {{lightweight}} {{title at}} the National Indoor Arena, Birmingham, on 21 June 2008, Gomez's thirty-first birthday. [...] Khan said that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{will be as}} fit as me, so I expect a spectacular stoppage". Gomez {{did not attend the}} scheduled pre-fight press conference, prompting Khan to deride him, and promoter Frank Warren accused Gomez of failing to show respect to Khan and the media.|$|E
500|$|Another opening {{cinematic}} {{takes place}} in which Riddick is being transported for collection on the bounty. He and Johns have a brief conversation in which Riddick tells Johns that there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{is going to get}} the price he wants. Riddick wakes up as they land and stands out front of Butcher Bay waiting for the warden. He sneaks up behind Johns and breaks his neck and proceeds to escape. After getting his hands on a gun, he goes through the ventilation ducts and seemingly escapes into the desert. Everything fades to white as Riddick hears Johns saying [...] "Rise and shine, Riddick." [...] It turns out this escape was simply a dream.|$|E
500|$|Larry Layton, {{brother of}} author and former Peoples Temple member Deborah Layton, {{was convicted in}} 1986 of {{conspiracy}} {{in the murder of}} Leo Ryan. Temple defectors boarding the truck to Port Kaituma warned about Larry Layton that [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he's</b> a defector. [...] He's too close to Jones." [...] Layton was the only former Peoples Temple member to be tried in the United States for criminal acts relating to the murders at Jonestown. He was convicted on four different murder-related counts.|$|R

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|At first, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a [...] "quintessentially American person" [...] {{to play the role of}} House. Bryan Singer in particular felt there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was going to hire a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to [...] "a misspent youth [...] too much TV and too many movies". Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2007, a juror {{was accused}} of having {{made up her mind}} already that Pickton was innocent. The trial judge {{questioned}} the juror, saying [...] "It's reported to me you said from what you had seen you were certain Mr. Pickton was innocent, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could have done this. That the court system had arrested the wrong guy." [...] The juror denied this completely. Justice Williams ruled that she could remain on the jury since it had not been proven she made the statements.|$|E
2500|$|When John Kennedy {{was asked}} about the level of {{involvement}} and influence that his father had held in his razor-thin presidential victory over Richard Nixon, he would joke that on the eve before the election his father had asked him the exact number of votes he would need to win: there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was paying [...] "for a landslide". Kennedy was one of four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Nathaniel Fillmore, and George Herbert Walker Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to {{negotiate}} an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah's help; his reply was that [...] "in {{the face of}} public opinion, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could say a word against nationalisation". Harriman {{held a press conference}} in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the [...] "nationalisation crisis". As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: [...] "We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!" [...] Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Carpenter {{decided that the}} Phillies needed a new home. [...] As {{mentioned}} above, {{he never wanted to}} buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could make money playing there. [...] The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking, and the neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. [...] To that end, he sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. [...] The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. [...] In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1.|$|E
2500|$|One Texas Ranger {{said that}} {{although}} {{it was obvious to}} him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge: [...] "I remember him trying to cop to one he didn't do, but there was another murder case where I'll kiss your butt if he didn’t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain't <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't tell him. I think he did that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, {{as if he had been}} there before.|$|E
2500|$|After Baylor, Rouse {{worked as}} a {{graduate}} assistant coach at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He left the position in October 2007, and has not had another basketball job since; {{he has said that}} he has been blackballed for taping Bliss's statements. Despite the near-universal revulsion at Bliss's actions, many leading members of the college basketball coaching fraternity considered Rouse's recordings a serious breach of trust – for example, Mike Krzyzewski said that if he ever found out one of his assistants had been secretly taping him, [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would be on my staff". Jeff Ray, the Midwestern coach who hired Rouse, commented: [...] "I'm {{right in the middle of}} it, don't get me wrong. But sometimes the things you see are pretty disgusting. Why is there this black cloud hanging over him? He did nothing wrong. To me, this is all a testimony to the sad state of affairs of our profession." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned back}} in his chair as though wearied. Yet either the rest or the wine seemed already to have done him good. The lines about his mouth {{gradually}} softened.

But when they were on their <b>way</b> out <b>he</b> whispered in Anna's ear.|$|R

He was apparently a little annoyed.|$|R
2500|$|Kerry’s {{crew members}} who were there that day {{do not agree with}} Elliott’s {{characterization}} of the event in his 2004 affidavits. They contend that the enemy soldier, although wounded, was still a threat. For example, one of them, Fred Short, said, [...] "The guy was getting ready to stand up with a rocket on his shoulder, coming up. And Mr. Kerry took him out... he would have been about a 30-yard shot... here's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could miss us." [...] Del Sandusky, Kerry’s second in command, described the consequences to the lightly armored Swift Boat: [...] "Charlie would have lit us up like a Roman candle because we're full of fuel, we're full of ammunition." [...] Another witness stated that the VC [...] "had an entry wound at the side of his chest and exit wound at {{the opposite side of the}} chest cavity, a wound that was consistent with reports of the man turning to fire a second B-40 rocket." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, but there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would come with enough songs to fill {{out the rest of the}} record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
