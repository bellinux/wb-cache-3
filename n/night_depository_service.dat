40|$|Much of the {{research}} on financial services in low-income countries has focused on micro-credit programs. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the design of <b>depository</b> <b>services,</b> although many more low-income people use <b>depository</b> <b>services</b> than get access to credit. Having access to <b>depository</b> <b>services</b> is important for household well-being: to safeguard funds, to save for large purchases, and as insurance against unexpected expenditures. Economic reform programs in recent years have encouraged banks to push up nominal interest rates to keep deposit rates positive in real terms, and to motivate savings in financial assets. But once deposit rates are positive in real terms, banks typically increase minimum deposit size or find other ways to discourage small depositors because of the high costs of maintaining and servicing low-balance accounts. Traditional passbook savings accounts, the main product used by low-income households, are being phased out because of high costs. After South Africa's move to democracy in 1994, it was politically imperative that the country's major financial institutions help redress the historically weak system of services for low-income people. The authors describe one of the more interesting experiments. In 1993 Standard Bank of South Africa created an affiliate, called E Bank, to deliver basic banking services to the urban poor. E Bank provides a package of financial services designed specifically for low-income clients, offering greater convenience for the user while keeping under control the costs to the bank of providing services. E Bank combines the innovative technology of modified ATM services with staff available to help all clients. By rethinking the needs of the basic banking customer, E Bank was able to bundle services valued by poorer clients to justify a fee high enough to cover costs.

40|$|Working paper du GATE 2011 - 29 The European Central Bank (ECB) {{will offer}} to banks in 2013 an {{european}} shared platform for securities settlement, named TARGET 2 Securities (T 2 S), {{in order to}} open the national financial markets. The financial crisis did not change the ECB agenda. This paper develops a spatial competition model to understand {{the impact of this}} new organisation on european post-trading services. We analyse the incentives of the Central Securities Depositaries (CSD) to move to T 2 S when they become competitors in the market for settlement services and remain in a monopoly position for <b>depository</b> <b>services.</b> Settlement and <b>depository</b> <b>services</b> are complementary goods, because banks have to pay for these two services to buy or sell a security. We show that such a reform should induce a decrease in the settlement price and more generally in post-trading prices, but that prices depend strongly on market organisation. Under certain conditions, partial adhesion would make prices increase. This configuration appears as a Nash equilibrium. As CSDs are free to adhere to T 2 S, the ECB might be forced to regulate...|$|R
