50|$|Double nitrate {{crystallization}} was {{the means}} of commercial neodymium purification until the 1950s. Lindsay Chemical Division {{was the first to}} commercialize large-scale ion-exchange purification of neodymium. Starting in the 1950s, high purity (above 99%) neodymium was primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite, a mineral rich in rare-earth elements. The metal itself is obtained through electrolysis of its halide salts. Currently, most neodymium is extracted from bastnäsite, (Ce,La,Nd,Pr)CO3F, and purified by solvent extraction. Ion-exchange purification is reserved for preparing the highest purities (typically >99.99%). The evolving technology, and improved purity of commercially available <b>neodymium</b> <b>oxide,</b> was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glass that resides in collections today. Early neodymium glasses made in the 1930s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple, due to the difficulties in removing the last traces of praseodymium in the era when manufacturing relied upon fractional crystallization technology.|$|E
50|$|Neodymium {{is never}} {{found in nature}} as a free element, but rather it occurs in ores such as {{monazite}} and bastnäsite that contain small amounts of all the rare-earth metals. The main mining areas are in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The reserves of neodymium are estimated at about eight million tonnes. Although {{it belongs to the}} rare-earth metals, neodymium is not rare at all. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is about 38 mg/kg, which is the second highest among rare-earth elements, following cerium. The world's production of neodymium was about 7,000 tonnes in 2004. The bulk of current production is from China, whose government has recently imposed strategic materials controls on the element, raising some concerns in consuming countries and causing skyrocketing prices of neodymium and other rare-earth metals. As of late 2011, 99% pure neodymium was traded in world markets for US$300 to US$350 per kilogram, down from the mid-2011 peak of US$500/kg. The price of <b>neodymium</b> <b>oxide</b> fell from $200/kg in 2011 to $40 in 2015, largely due to illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions. The uncertainty of pricing and availability have caused particularly Japanese companies to develop permanent magnets and associated electric motors with fewer or no rare-earth elements.|$|E

The dissolution rates of the rare earth oxides were very low, resulting in concentrations of rare earth elements in the test solutions {{of the order of}} ppb. In the most extreme case, Gamble’s fluid dissolved 1, 400 times more of the rare earth oxides than pure water. Fairly high concentration of neodymium were found in the dissolving fluids, which means that trace neodymium present as an impurity in each rare earth oxide dissolved preferentially. For yttrium oxide, the ratio of neodymium to yttrium that dissolved in the saline solution was greater than 78, 000 to 1, taking into account the amount of each that was originally present in the yttrium oxide...|$|R
5000|$|The sharp {{absorption}} bands of neodymium cause the glass color to change under different lighting conditions, being reddish-purple under daylight or yellow incandescent light, but blue under white fluorescent lighting, or greenish under trichromatic lighting. This color-change phenomenon is highly prized by collectors. In combination with gold or selenium, beautiful red colors result. Since neodymium coloration depends upon [...] "forbidden" [...] f-f transitions {{deep within the}} atom, there is relatively little influence on the color from the chemical environment, so the color is impervious to the thermal history of the glass. However, for the best color, iron-containing impurities need to be minimized in the silica {{used to make the}} glass. The same forbidden nature of the f-f transitions makes rare-earth colorants less intense than those provided by most d-transition elements, so more has to be used in a glass to achieve the desired color intensity. The original Moser recipe used about 5% of <b>neodymium</b> <b>oxide</b> in the glass melt, a sufficient quantity such that Moser referred to these as being [...] "rare-earth doped" [...] glasses.

The {{most interesting}} are 150 Nd and 160 Gd (promising for 0 ν 2 β search), 136 Ce (2 β+ candidate {{with one of}} the highest Q 2 β). The main problem of compounds containing lanthanide elements is their high radioactive contamination by uranium, radium, actinium and thorium. The new generation 2 β experiments require development of methods for a deep purification of lanthanides from the radioactive elements. A combination of physical and chemical methods was applied to purify cerium, neodymium and gadolinium. Liquid-liquid extraction technique was used to remove traces of Th and U from neodymium, gadolinium and for purification of cerium from Th, U, Ra and K. Co-precipitation and recrystallization methods were utilized for further reduction of the impurities.

Based on thermodynamic calculations, a series of experiments were performed for converting the rare earth oxides into rare earth fluorides using AlF 3, ZnF 2, FeF 3, and Na 3 AlF 6 as fluorinating agents in a LiF–Nd 2 O 3 system.

Good superconducting transitions have been obtained on these films with thickness 10 - 12 nanometers. Such a Nd 2 CuO 4 layer has a stable crystal structure and behaves as an oxide semiconductor. At 77 K, its resistivity is ~ 40 times higher than that of PrBaCuO, which has been commonly used as buffer layer and barrier material. The lattice mismatch between Nd 2 CuO 4 and YBCO is much smaller than that between YSZ and YBCO. It allows highly epitaxial growth of YBCO without forming big defects and the intermediate layer. Measurements by using XRD, rocking curve, and cross-sectional TEM indicated that the crystallinity of YBCO films grown on Nd 2 CuO 4 buffer layer had been significantly improved.
