25|$|Also in 1919, Kraus {{published}} his collected war texts {{under the title}} Weltgericht (World Court of Justice). In 1920, he published the satire Literatur oder Man wird doch da sehn (Literature, or You Ain't Seen <b>Nothing</b> <b>Yet)</b> as a reply to Franz Werfel's Spiegelmensch (Mirror Man), an attack against Kraus.|$|E
25|$|Logistical {{arrangements}} in Wellington's army collapsed and the Allied soldiers marched in cold pouring rain {{for four days}} with very little food. Soult only sent his cavalry after the Allies. Even so, the French horsemen scooped up hundreds of stragglers. On 16 November, 600 Allied soldiers were captured by the French. The number of prisoners was even higher on the 17th and included Wellington's second-in-command, General Edward Paget. Before reaching the friendly fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo, the Allied armies lost 5,000 men missing, mostly soldiers who had died from hunger or exposure in the chaotic retreat. It appeared that all of Wellington's efforts in 1812 had been for <b>nothing.</b> <b>Yet,</b> his Anglo-Portuguese army had gained a moral ascendancy over the French {{that it would never}} relinquish.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{anger in}} {{infidelity}} is quite inevitable. In the initial stage of infidelity anger {{is not as}} apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not hard facts or evidence supporting one’s suspicions. Like previously talked about the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent {{in the first stage}} of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger, because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual’s anger because in reality there is <b>nothing</b> <b>yet</b> to be angry about, there is no proof of their romantic partner’s unfaithfulness. 25% of people surveyed felt angry in the beginning or suspicion stage of infidelity (Johnson, 2017). It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they are angry and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner {{because of the lack of}} evidence they have.|$|E

500|$|On January 12, 2011, {{composer}} Alan Menken {{was asked}} about the sequel in an interview. His reply was, [...] "I’ve heard things but there's <b>nothing</b> <b>yet.</b> I don’t know much about what’s happening with that. Honestly, I don’t know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I’m not frustrated that it isn’t one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I’m busy enough with that, so I really don’t need more on my plate." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2010 Eurotunnel, HS1 Ltd, DB {{and other}} {{interested}} train operators formed {{a working group}} to discuss changes to the safety rules, including allowing 200-metre trains. The Intergovernmental Commission currently requires trains to be 400m long. Deutsche Bahn carried out evacuation trials in the tunnel on 17 October 2010 with two 200m-long ICE3 trains, and displayed one of them at St Pancras station on 19 October. The current Velaro ICE3 sets {{do not meet the}} fire safety requirements for passenger services through the tunnel, but the Siemens Velaro D sets on order include the necessary additional fire-proofing. In March 2011, the European Rail Agency decided to allow trains with distributed traction to operate in the Channel Tunnel. DB is planning three services a day to Frankfurt (5h from London), Rotterdam (3h) and Amsterdam (4h) via Brussels from 2015. This had originally planned to be 2013, but has been delayed due to the availability of the Channel Tunnel version of the Siemens Velaro D trains, high rental costs of the French rail network and border controls in their stations. As of 2016, <b>nothing</b> <b>yet</b> has come to fruition, but the High Speed One website continues to state that [...] "HS1 Ltd are working with Deutsche Bahn on plans to incorporate three additional international return journeys, between Frankfurt and London via Cologne, Brussels and Lille. This will include connections from Amsterdam via Rotterdam to London." ...|$|E
2500|$|During 2015, {{the group}} {{established}} a fake company to gain entry to a speech being given by Prime Minister David Cameron at the Confederation of British Industry where they heckled him and held banners stating [...] "CBI = voice of Brussels". Cummings subsequently stated: [...] "You {{think it is}} nasty? You ain’t seen <b>nothing</b> <b>yet.</b> These guys have failed the country, {{they are going to}} be under the magnifying glass. Tough shit ... It is going to be tough". The campaign also stated their intention to target and disrupt meetings of pro-EU organisations and companies. In a letter to the Electoral Commission, Sir Eric Pickles, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said he believed Vote Leave had disqualified itself from lead status in the referendum (which entitles the campaign to public funding) after it pledged to run a [...] "nasty" [...] campaign against opponents.|$|E

2500|$|The Reverend Thomas Smith (1638–1710) and Humfrey Wanley (1672–1726) both {{catalogue}}d the Cotton library (in {{which the}} Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705. The Beowulf manuscript itself is identified by {{name for the}} first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley [...] "I can find <b>nothing</b> <b>yet</b> of Beowulph." [...] Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.|$|E
2500|$|No one {{was really}} safe from {{scrutiny}} or the chopping block, ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although {{the vast majority}} of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis [...] "'La Généreuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802", Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat [...] "disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes". [...] Also, captains and sailors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} earn a little on the side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with <b>nothing.</b> <b>Yet</b> still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace.|$|E
