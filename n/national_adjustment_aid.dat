40|$|Osmotic adjustment, {{measured}} by the lowering of the osmotic potential at full turgor, and its influence on leaf rolling and leaf death was assessed in the lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar IR 36 in both the greenhouse and field. The degree of osmotic adjustment varied with the degree and duration of stress, but was usually 0. 5 to 0. 6 megapascal (maximally 0. 8 to 0. 9 megapascal) under severe stress conditions. In leaves in which osmotic adjustment was 0. 5 to 0. 6 megapascal, leaf rolling and leaf death occurred at lower leaf water potentials in adjusted than in nonadjusted leaves. We conclude that osmotic <b>adjustment</b> <b>aids</b> in the drought resistance of rice by delaying leaf rolling, thereby maintaining gas exchange, and by delaying leaf death...|$|R

This cross-sectional approach reveals different degrees of change and patterns of adaptation, whilst in no case the EU fully supplanted national decision-making. The authors’ conclusion suggests that regulative and redistributive policies are less conflicting with European integration than distributive policies {{at the core of the}} French welfare state, but that the latter are also strongly resilient and resistant to radical changes. Patterns of policy changes are highly complex and diversified, and their “path-dependency” is rooted in the political feasibility of public policy at the domestic level...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to explore some of the ways that {{possessions}} may be used symbolically to <b>aid</b> <b>adjustment</b> in first-semester freshmen who are transitioning to college. Based on prior literature, the transition to college is often accompanied by self-discrepancies which may be alleviated through symbolic self-completion using possessions. Overall, 219 students participated in this study. Results indicate that first-semester freshmen, as well as upperclassmen students, rely on the symbolic use of possessions in both managing negative affect and symbolizing the ideal college student identity. Furthermore, managing affect through the use of feeling regulators was found to best <b>aid</b> <b>adjustment</b> early in the transition, while symbolizing the college identity through the use of identity claims was found to better <b>aid</b> <b>adjustment</b> later in the transition. In addition, the importance of the college student identity was found to moderate this relationship. The results of this study add to the current literature on self-discrepancies and symbolic self-completion, as well as pointing to the importance of personal possessions in symbolizing the identity and facilitating adjustment in self-relevant domains.

30|$|After {{the liberation}} of the country, China fully fell into the Soviet-led socialist camp in political, military, {{economic}} and cultural dimensions, and higher education was no exception.

As one of the inevitable results of comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union, New China also revoked sociology and anthropology on the grounds of that they were Western “bourgeois disciplines”. Physical anthropology was integrated into the Institute of Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), completely detaching from social sciences.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of house prices poses significant conceptual and practical problems, mainly because dwellings are heterogeneous assets whose prices {{can only be}} observed when they are sold. There are now seven main house price indices for the United Kingdom. In broad terms, each measures one of three different concepts: {{the value of a}} representative set of house transactions; the price of a house with “typical ” characteristics; the value of the housing stock. The indices are constructed from different data using different methods. Consequently, the available measures of house prices can give conflicting or misleading signals about house price inflation. The data and methods used to construct the indices can vary in three key respects: the point in the house purchase process at which the price is measured; the techniques used to adjust for differences in the characteristics of houses; and the weighting scheme used. Indices that measure the price earlier in the purchase process are able to detect price changes first, but will measure final prices with error because prices can be renegotiated extensively before the deal is finalised. This is not necessarily a disadvantage, because it is useful to have a measure of prices at each stage of the purchasing process and those indices measuring prices earlier in the purchase process may lead other indices. Quality <b>adjustment</b> <b>aids</b> interpretation of price changes, and can have significant effects on measure...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{properties}} of simple quantity-based monetary policy rules {{in the face of}} external volatility in low-income African economies. Using a DSGE model of a two-sector economy with currency substitution and focusing our attention on positive aid shocks, we suggest that strategies involving quite substantial reserve accumulation in the face of aid surges serve to ease macroeconomic adjustment to shocks, particularly when a portion of aid is used to support fiscal adjustment. We find {{the properties of}} these rules are robust to assumptions about the degree of integration of the domestic bond market with world capital markets. Although an open capital account facilitates smoother <b>adjustment</b> to temporary <b>aid</b> surges when an aid inflow is fully spent, it exacerbates the <b>adjustment</b> problem when <b>aid</b> is accompanied by fiscal adjustment and hence reinforces the case for a managed float in such circumstances...|$|R

40|$|The article {{asks what}} {{is the state of}} and {{prospects}} for economic reform under the Europe 2020 strategy and the European semester, within the context of economic policy coordination in the European Union (EU) and in the Eurozone. After briefly setting out the framework for economic policy coordination established since Maastricht, it sheds light on the Lisbon strategy’s problem-laden legacy for the Europe 2020 strategy (2011 - 2020) : the issues of non-binding member state commitment to an EU-wide reform agenda, and of member state failure to create sufficient ownership of reform. The article then examines the workings of the Europe 2020 strategy – the EU’s economic and institutional modernisation strategy for the current decade – with regard to structural reform especially in the Eurozone. It addresses the question of the effectiveness of the European semester process in light of the sovereign debt crisis. The article concludes that the Europe 2020 strategy’s approach continues to be valid in the EU context, but that for the strategy to deliver member states must get their act together and create ownership of reform for <b>national</b> <b>adjustment</b> capacit...|$|R

Under conditions of no supplementation, empirical supplementation, and designed supplementation, hepatocytes were exposed to plasma and their morphology, specific cell functions (urea, albumin production) and lipid metabolism were measured.

40|$|Highlights] Fully-fledged federations assign {{fiscal policy}} {{stabilisation}} {{largely to the}} federal level, based on a relatively large budget. In the euro area, a large federal budget is unrealistic at {{the current level of}} political and societal integration, and fiscal stabilisation will continue to rely mainly on national policies. For aggregate fiscal policy to become more stabilising with respect to the economic cycle, while achieving long-term sustainability, it is necessary (i) to avoid imposing self-defeating fiscal adjustments on crisis countries by making sovereign debt restructuring a real possibility (which involves strengthening the banking sector and extending the remit of the European Stability Mechanism); (ii) to task the planned independent European Fiscal Board with delineating exceptional times during which fiscal coordination is needed on top of monetary policy; (iii) to make national fiscal policies more stabilising by allowing incremental investment and unemployment spending to be shifted from bad to good times based on <b>national</b> <b>adjustment</b> accounts. We also recommend a move towards a European unemployment (re-) insurance scheme targeted at 2 ̆ 018 large 2 ̆ 019 shocks, with varying contributions from countries and a minimum set of labour-market harmonisation criteria, which in any case are desirable for the functioning of monetary union...|$|R
