40|$|In {{electric}} power systems, the generated power should be equal with the demand {{and power of}} network is mainly controlled through generation system. In such operation, the demand is satisfied through changing the generated power and afterward, the safe operation of power system is reached. But during recent years, a new concept has been developed in {{electric power}} systems namely demand side management (DSM). DSM is the modification of consumer demand for energy through various methods such as financial incentives and education. Usually, the goal of demand side management is to encourage the consumer to use less energy during peak hours, or to move the time of energy use to off-peak times such as nighttime and weekends. One of the important models of DSM is interruptible loads. Interruptible loads are the right for an electricity utility to interrupt supply to a customer, typically during a system emergency, to relieve short term network constraints up to a couple <b>of</b> hours. Interruptible <b>loads</b> can be deployed {{in one of two}} ways. The network operator gives <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> an interruptible <b>load</b> event to the customer, then relies on the customer to reduce their electricity USAge; or unilaterally interrupts supply to the customer. In this paper, the effect <b>of</b> interruptible <b>loads</b> on the power system reliability is investigated. A multi machine power system is considered as cases study. Simulation results show the great effects <b>of</b> interruptible <b>loads</b> on the power system reliability...|$|R

The two most alluring features which RAC provides are high availability and load balancing. Load balancing is performed by the load balancer {{which most of the}} time works as desired; But it is <b>noticed</b> that failure <b>of</b> <b>load</b> balancer could be a single point of failure for the entire RAC system. In the present work our aim is to have comprehensive study of literature available in the field <b>of</b> monitoring the <b>load</b> balance in Oracle RAC in order to keep a close watch on whether switchover between nodes is happening correctly and smoothly or not. Many Researchers and developers working in this field suggested various monitoring systems for load balancing in Oracle RAC, yet there is scope to get most efficient and accurate one. The concept of relative entropy is taken as inspiration from this extensive survey of the literatures available, which will help us in comparing the randomness of the each node and also the entire RAC system. Thus entropy based monitoring system has projected as efficient system in present review work...|$|R

It is almost impossible to form a just estimate of Valla's private life and character owing to the clouds of dust which were stirred up by this and other controversies, in which the most virulent and obscene language was employed. He appears, however, as a vain, jealous and quarrelsome man, but he combined the qualities of an elegant humanist, an acute critic and a venomous writer, who had committed himself to a violent polemic against the temporal power of Rome. In him posterity honors not so much the scholar and the stylist as the man who initiated a bold method of criticism, which he applied alike to language, to historical documents and to ethical opinions. Luther had a very high opinion of Valla and of his writings, and Cardinal Bellarmine calls him praecursor Lutheri, while Sir Richard Jebb says that his De Elegantiis [...] "marked the highest level that had yet been reached in the critical study of Latin." [...] Erasmus stated in his De ratione studii that for Latin Grammar, there was [...] "no better guide than Lorenzo Valla." ...|$|R

The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.
