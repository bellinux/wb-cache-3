40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} {{experiment}} the LCI group has performed to prepare our submission to CLEF-IP Classification Track. In this preliminary experiment {{we used a}} part of the available target documents as test set and the rest as train set. We describe the systems AGFL used for extracting these triples and the LCS used for classification by the Winnow algorithm. We show that the use of linguistic triples in place of bags of words improves the accuracy, as well as using the <b>names</b> and <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>applicants.</b> we found that using the complete descriptions as bags of words does not really perform better than using only abstracts and titles. Some simple mathematics show that the official measures are redundant and tha...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a need}} {{to amend}} the RTI Act to provide for the {{protection}} of those seeking information under the Act. The Asian Centre for Human Rights recommends that a separate chapter, “Protection of those seeking information under the(RTI) Act”, be inserted into the Act. Protection measures should include (a)mandatory, immediate registration of complaints of threats or attacks against RTI activists on the First Information Report and placing such FIRs before the magistrate or judge of the area within 24 hours for issuance of directions for protection of those under threats and their family members, and periodic review of such protection measures; (b)conducting inquiry into threats or attacks by a police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police/Assistant Commissioner of Police, to be concluded within 90 days; and (c)trial of the accused within six months. Further, concerned Public Information Officers, First Appellate Authorities and those directly related with the information sought under the RTI Act should be presumed to have abetted the offenses against the RTI activists unless evidence proves otherwise. (d)We know,'Prevention is better than cure, we should make changes in the present RTI Act which should ensure the anonymity <b>of</b> the <b>Applicant,</b> this can be achieved by removing the compulsion of mentions <b>of</b> <b>name</b> and <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>applicant.</b> And the Information should be posted on the Official Website. Now, most of the Information which results in threat to the life of whistle blowers and activists have no security concern. For example, all the information related to MNREGA if made public, is not going to result in threat to privacy of nation or anyone, But we have seen murders of various RTI activist seeking Informations related to MNREGA.|$|R
