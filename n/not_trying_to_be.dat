500|$|Regarding the {{ultimate}} objectives behind {{the making of}} the film, Morgan said he was not trying to blame just a single company nor the fast fashion industry as [...] "it did not invent a very irresponsible way of manufacturing, it did not invent overmarketing the consumption of things." [...] The director said the film was intended to be a caution on the [...] "incessant consumption of mediocre stuff" [...] and an incentive to view shopping as something more than a hobby, adding that buying is [...] "a moral act and there is a chain reaction of consequences". He commented he was <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "anti-business or anti-market" [...] but was just reaffirming basic human rights and showing the limits of natural resources.|$|E

"In the Summertime" [...] was {{nominated}} at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for [...] "Best Video", while [...] "Someday, Someday" [...] {{was nominated}} for [...] "Single of the Year", [...] "Best Group", and [...] "Best Pop Release". At the ceremony in October, the group performed [...] "Someday, Someday". In 2006 Carey described the group's style to Jet Magazine, it was [...] "Just be yourself" [...] and [...] "about being young and living in Australia. We’re <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 50 Cent or anything, we’re all just boys from the country, just trying {{to move into the}} city and make our way". He listed Evermore, Crowded House, Foo Fighters and Cold Chisel as his favourite bands. In February 2007 they supported Ozzy Osbourne on the Australian leg of his national tour.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{writing and}} song {{production}} were done by Canadian band Let's Go to War, {{whose members are}} Henry Walter, Adrien Gough and Peter-John Kerr. In an interview with The Canadian Press, Walter revealed they first sent several demos to Jive Records for Circus. After selecting it, Spears' management required several changes to the song, making [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] "substantially different from what was submitted." [...] Walter revealed they had no contact with the singer for the song production, and considered [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] as [...] "something different for Britney" [...] and [...] "a fun track and is <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anything it's not." [...] Spears recorded her vocals for the song in 2008 at Train Tracks Studios and Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with Walter and Eric Eylands. Guitar was provided by Chris Worthy, and audio mixing was done by Tony Maserati.|$|E

500|$|According to science-fiction {{historian}} Donald H. Tuck, Beyond published [...] "some {{very good}} material," [...] with appearances by many well-known authors, and {{the magazine is}} often cited as being the successor to the unusual fantasy tradition of Unknown. Author James Gunn said of the new fantasy magazines {{that appeared in the}} 1950s that [...] "the best of these was Beyond, created by Horace Gold as a companion fantasy magazine to Galaxy, which he had created three years before. Beyond Fantasy Fiction aimed at the same rationalized fantasy niche that Unknown had established and to which Gold had contributed stories." [...] Not everyone thought the magazine was completely successful in emulating Unknown, however; P.Schuyler Miller, reviewing an anthology drawn from the pages of Beyond, was generally approving but commented that [...] "Except for Budrys, Pohl, Brown and Sturgeon, these stories from Beyond are rather self-conscious. They are best when they are <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like Unknown." [...] Miller's assessment of the magazine overall was that it [...] "made a pass at the same position [...] but didn't make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers praised Super Punch-Out!! overall for <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realistic, for the {{originality}} of its different opponents, {{and for its}} simple controls. Chris Scullion from Official Nintendo Magazine {{praises the}} game for its outlandish characters, addictive gameplay, and simple controls. He adds that Super Punch-Out!! is [...] "superb way {{to prepare for the}} upcoming Wii [...] title". Scullion states that [...] "the thing that makes Super Punch-Out!! interesting (along {{with the rest of the}} games in the series) is that it's not a realistic boxing game". He adds that the opponents in the game are [...] "the real stars of the show", with each opponent having a unique personality, traits, and boxing styles. Skyler Miller from Allgame, like Scullion, praised the game for its simple, responsive controls, for its colorful, detailed opponents, and for its usage of the Super NES's transparent color palette for the fighter, which facilitates the [...] "behind the back" [...] perspective. He also appreciates the game's sound and music, in particular the usage of real voice for the announcer. Game Players magazine applauded the game's [...] "large, colorful graphics and easy-to-learn controls".|$|E

[...] Danzig has voiced his approval of certain aspects of Satanic ideologies, including the quest for knowledge and individual freedom. He has stated that religion does not play a role in how he perceives other bands and musicians.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers {{embarked}} on a world tour, {{which was the first}} time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; [...] "We never thought we would tour again, Paul [...] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Freddie." [...] The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. The Foo Fighters paid homage to the band in performing [...] "Tie Your Mother Down" [...] to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Paul Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Spedding calls Richards' guitar playing [...] "direct, incisive and unpretentious". Richards says he {{is focused}} on chords and rhythms while {{avoiding}} flamboyant and competitive virtuosity by <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the [...] "fastest gun in the west". Richards prefers teaming {{with at least one}} other guitarist and has almost never toured without one. Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards, and with Jagger, he introduced Berry's songs to the Rolling Stones' early repertoire. In the late 1960s Jones' declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks, including slide guitar. Jones' replacement Mick Taylor played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974. Taylor's virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles, most notably onstage. In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood, whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called [...] "the ancient art of weaving", which he and Jones had gleaned from the Chicago Blues artists.|$|E

[...] Speaking of the adapter's potential, he said, [...] "it seems like the Chromecast might actually deliver on all that potential, but Google still has {{a lot of work to}} do." [...] In particular, Patel pointed to Apple's AirPlay protocol as an example of an established competitor with many more features. TechCrunch's review of the device said, [...] "Even with a bug or two rearing its head, the Chromecast is easily worth its $35 pricetag." [...] Gizmodo gave the device a positive review, highlighting the ease of setup and sharing video. In comparing the device to competitors, the review said, [...] "Chromecast isn't Google's version of Apple TV, and it's <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be...</b> But Chromecast also costs a third of what those devices do, and has plenty of potential given that its SDK is just a few days old." ...|$|E

The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, {{a sense that the}} event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. [...] "It's not an editorial photo," [...] he explained, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a magazine. We're trying to create a moment." [...] Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brandfrom the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement. Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram's 15-second videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with her}} {{previous}} albums thematical prime focus on Afrodisiac is on [...] "relationship {{with love and}} life in general." [...] "It's about passion. It's romantic, and that's where I am in my life right now," [...] Norwood noted during promotion touring in 2004, {{a time when she}} was engaged to New York Knicks guard Quentin Richardson. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across," [...] she said. [...] "I really am all that." [...] Afrodisiac contains several references to Timbaland and longtime partner Missy Elliott, and alludes to fellow 1990s R singers such as Aaliyah and Monica. The album's opening track [...] "Who I Am" [...] discusses her rocky relationship with Robert Smith as well as the progression of her public image, while [...] "I Tried" [...] was heavily inspired by English rock band Coldplay, also incorporating lyrics of their 2000 song [...] "Sparks." [...] The tenth track [...] "Turn It Up" [...] is an homage to the early 1990s with references to Donnie Simpson's Video Soul, Kid n' Play, their 1990 film House Party and Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1996 studio album House of Music. The line [...] "'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar, want a guaranteed single, not an album filler" [...] levels indirect criticism at former main producer Rodney Jerkins.

Anna had caused a pleasant surprise; nothing could be neater than the way in which she played her little parts; one would even have suspected her of hiding much sly observation under her simplicity. And Mr. Middleton answered very well by <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> comic. The main source of doubt and retardation had been Gwendolen's desire to appear in her Greek dress. No word for a charade would occur to her either waking or dreaming that suited her purpose of getting a statuesque pose in this favorite costume. To choose a motive from Racine was of no use, since Rex and the others could not declaim French verse, and improvised speeches would turn the scene into burlesque. Besides, Mr. Gascoigne prohibited the acting of scenes from plays: he usually protested against the notion that an amusement which was fitting for every one else was unfitting for a clergyman; but he would not in this matter overstep the line of decorum as drawn in that part of Wessex, which did not exclude his sanction of the young people's acting charades in his sister-in-law's house--a very different affair from private theatricals in the full sense of the word.|$|E
