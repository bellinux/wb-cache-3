The country faces local elections this March, presidential elections in August and general elections next June, while top-level political scandals compound the deterioration {{in the state of}} democracy and rule of law. At the same time, stagnation in Turkey’s accession process continues to sour relations with the EU. In this new Policy Brief, Steven Blockmans puts forward a number of recommendations to help drive the EU accession process forward, namely the early opening of negotiation chapters 23 (judiciary and fundamental rights) and 24 (justice, freedom and security), in line with the EU’s so-called New Approach.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{empirical studies}} and reviews that support {{a shift from}} traditional classroom practices in the Primary school to those based in a teacher-child partnership developed through negotiation. The opening Chapter looks at the ontology of the contemporary classroom of the Primary school. It holds that reasons {{for the presence of}} largely directive practices can be found in teachers background and training and in society's dependent model of childhood. This focus is continued in Chapter Two in respect to research into motivational processes. Chapter Three presents two empirical studies looking at the nature of the directive classroom and the types of strategies that children use to cope with this phenomena. In Chapter Four negotiation is examined across a variety of domains, developing in Chapter Five a model of a negotiating classroom and examining {{the extent to which it}} can be said that children <b>negotiate.</b> <b>Chapter</b> Six presents three studies concerned with children's negotiating behaviour, the detailed nature of child-teacher classroom negotiating interaction and a sociometric perspective examining how children prefer to organize themselves. Study Six presents transcripts of negotiations between teacher and child with interpretive commentary. Chapter Seven follows a class examining the effects on children's academic performance while moving from a directive to a <b>negotiating</b> environment. <b>Chapter</b> Eight presents a study combining three classroom components to create eight classroom environments. It highlights poor independent teacherchild agreement on the elements within the classroom organization that produce the best / worst match on different criteria. It also outlines data indicating poor agreement between In-situ and later questionnaire data collection methods.

40|$|Scholars {{increasingly}} {{assume that}} most businesses enter Chapter 11 {{with a high}} percentage of secured debt, which leads to {{a high percentage of}} cases ending in the sale of the debtor’s assets under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code rather than with confirmation of a reorganization plan. However, evidence and discussions about “the end of bankruptcy” center on secured creditors’ role in the reorganizations of very large corporations. The few analyses of cross-sections of Chapter 11 proceedings suggest that secured creditor control is not nearly as omnipresent as asserted and that 363 sales are not as dominant as assumed. This Essay adds original empirical evidence to the debate by highlighting how one subset of debtors — religious organizations — whose main creditors typically are secured lenders have used the reorganization process. By focusing on 363 sales and other indices of creditor control, plan proposal and confirmation rates, recoveries to creditors, and post-bankruptcy survival rates, this Essay establishes that the traditional <b>negotiated</b> <b>Chapter</b> 11 case is alive and thriving among these debtors. The data suggest that these cases preserved significant value for secured creditors, while distributing value to unsecured creditors. The results show that further empirical examinations of secured creditors’ role in Chapter 11 cases may yield insights that diverge from current understandings of how creditor control impacts modern reorganization, and what that control means for reforms of Chapter 11...|$|R

40|$|Disturbing Translations: Distance, Memory, and Representation in Contemporary Latin American Literature” {{examines}} {{the legacy of}} dictatorship and political repression in Latin America, focusing on the significance of literature {{in the aftermath of}} trauma. Dictatorship disrupts the existing order and produces distance, particularly spatial distance (often resulting from displacement) and temporal distance (between the “before” and “after” of dictatorship and its legacy in the present). These distances are formally represented in literature via instances of textual disruption, such as ekphrasis, that echo and reconfigure the ruptures of dictatorship. This dissertation introduces the figure of translation as a broad metaphor for negotiating those distances that emerge in the wake of dictatorship, with particular attention to generational distance from trauma and the complexities of postmemory. Taking Marianne Hirsch’s concept of “postmemory” as a point of departure for examining the relationship between past trauma and its legacy in the present, this dissertation seeks to re-think postmemory through the lens of translation. While some elements of past trauma may be translated across space, time, and form, pain and loss are among those elements that resist translation; here, translation acknowledges its own limits, recognizing pain and loss without assimilating them. Chapter one explores the relationship between father and son and the references to photographs and film in Roberto Brodsky’s 2007 Bosque quemado. Here, engagement with visual materials is a form of translation, echoing the work of postmemory and the negotiations involved in constructing personal and national narratives in post-dictatorship Chile. Chapter two addresses Sergio Chejfec’s 1999 Los planetas, arguing that the novel depicts the city (here, Buenos Aires, Argentina) as a site of translation and memory where the past and present are contained in layers through which the continued impact of trauma on the present is <b>negotiated.</b> <b>Chapter</b> three considers the limits of translation in Maria Negroni’s La Anunciacion (2007), using Derrida’s notion of the parergon, or the frame, to explore the novel’s gestures toward trauma and excess.

40|$|The only {{potentially}} unique {{aspect of}} NAFTA Chapter 11 {{is that the}} governments of two nations with developed economies agreed to enter into an investment protection treaty between themselves. The overwhelming majority of BITs to date have been North to South, between capital-exporting countries and capital-importing countries, and the private investors who actually have benefited from such treaties have been those from the North. Practically speaking, countries such as Canada and the United States simply have not had to worry that they would ever have to defend a claim in arbitration under a BIT. The cross-border investment flows between Canada and the United States, however, are astronomically higher than, for example, those between Cameroon and the United States, and it was inevitable, once NAFTA 2 ̆ 7 s investment protection regime became operative, that Canada and the United States would be defending themselves before an international tribunal. Indeed, {{it is no coincidence}} that all of the Chapter 11 cases thus far commenced against the United States have been brought by Canadian nationals and all but one of the cases against Canada have been brought by US nationals. One may surmise that at least some of the distress felt by Canada and the United States over NAFTA Chapter 11 has been caused by the novel and disconcerting fact of having to live up to the same substantive and procedural guarantees that they have required of their BIT partners. Of course the fact that the NAFTA Parties are getting precisely what they bargained for does not necessarily answer the specific criticisms being leveled against Chapter 11. In analyzing the substance of this criticism, however, one should not lose sight of the reasons why the NAFTA Parties <b>negotiated</b> <b>Chapter</b> 11 in the first place. NAFTA Chapter 11 creates substantive investment protections that are enforceable in arbitration by the individuals directly impacted by any breach of such protections. In establishing this investment regime, the NAFTA Parties wanted to achieve three main objectives: (1) to tear down existing foreign investment barriers by eliminating arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions; (2) to build investor confidence throughout the region through the elaboration and enforcement of clear and fair rules; and (3) to 2 ̆ 2 depoliticize 2 ̆ 2 the resolution of investment disputes by eliminating the need for State- to-State adjudication.

Whereas {{commentary}} on autobiography in Coetzee tends {{to focus on}} the dynamics of secular confession and the idea of self-writing as 'autre-biography,' this thesis, taking the experience of emigration and literary celebrity as thematic pivots, argues that the protagonists of Coetzee's later fiction (Youth through Summertime) occasion a form of authorial self-disclosure that is not an end in itself but, with a nominal anchorage on Coetzee himself, a means of localising questions about literary genre, political complicity, the relation between author and character, the intersection of personal and collective history, and the social responsibility of the acclaimed writer. It is argued that the slippage of focus from the authorial personas in these fictions to the questions and critical voices they provoke nonetheless conspires to reaffirm the authority of the name and literary oeuvre' Coetzee. 'The thesis begins by examining the link in Youth between the protagonist's crisis of ethnic and literary identity and Coetzee's narrative strategy of subjective displacement (Chapter 1). It is shown that the refractive zone of questions in that fiction constitutes the self-qualifying reflex that becomes increasingly pronounced in the authorial surrogates and fictions that follow. Coetzee's representation of the acclaimed writer as a doubting, fallible, unheroic figure becomes in the case of Elizabeth Costello a rejection of the idea of the writer as a spokesperson for a group or cause and instead an opening for the pressures and responsibilities of living among others to be embodied and <b>negotiated</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 2). It is argued that Coetzee's Nobel Lecture provides a further example of this reserve about the reach of the writer's authority in the public realm: the deferral of authority in this text highlights by indirection an inconsistency in the Swedish Academy's invitation to Coetzee to speak for his work on the occasion of an award that celebrates its universal interpretability, its resistance to authorial meta-interpretation (Chapter 3). It is shown that in Slow Man, where the familiar metafictional interplay between the one who writes and the one who is written is framed on an emigrant history that is implicitly Coetzee's, the characters' contest of interpretation over photographs highlights the instability of the historical record - a point that holds for the text of Coetzee's personal history (Chapter 4). Emphasis on the nominal alignment of the author Coetzee and his authorial surrogate in Diary of a Bad Year governs a consideration of how the author's name- his proper name and reputation - focuses the condition of complicity with others as a reader and citizen; {{the question of whether the}} character JC speaks for Coetzee is revealed to be secondary to what it means to be held accountable for actions committed in the name of a group to which one belongs or set of interests to which one subscribes (Chapter 5). The thesis tracks the qualified textualisation of Coetzee 's authorial personas and history to Summertime, where' John Coetzee' is written out of an entanglement of acts of emigration and recollection in voices inflected with other histories than his own (Chapter 6) ...|$|R

The {{preamble}} of the Montenegrin constitution {{states that}} the Montenegrins are committed to European integrations, and that they share the same values and aims {{with the people of}} Europe. The government of Montenegro confirmed dedication to the European path by signing on 15 October 2007 a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA), thereby accepting responsibility for its European future. Montenegrin European path is advancing steadily and until now eighteen of thirty-five <b>negotiating</b> <b>Chapters</b> have been opened, out which two Chapters have been provisionally closed. EU Member states devoted themselves to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), {{as well as to the}} Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), with which they are strengthening the EU ’s external ability to act through the development of civilian and military capabilities in conflict prevention and crisis management. The acquis consists of political declarations, decisions and agreements, and member states must be able to support political dialogue in the framework of the policies, to align with EU statements, to take part in EU decisions and to apply agreed sanctions and restrictive measures. Montenegrin officials stated that, with respect to the EU policies vis-à-vis other third countries and regions, the country would not have difficulties in implementing CFSP and CSDP positions, yet, they expressed their commitment to be ready to fully and actively participate in the EU ’s policies by the date of accession. Montenegro, also colloquially called ’the EU ’s good student’, in its accession process is already aligning with the EU ’s policies. This paper will conduct an analysis with respect to how and to what extent the candidate countries, i. e. Montenegro is aligning its foreign policy with the EU ’s CFSP and CSDP. Theoretical framework will be built around two basic alternative conceptions – state-centric governance and multi-level governance, which will establish a base for our further analysis. Also, this paper will briefly present how the treaty of Lisbon impacted the CFSP and CSDP and created what we have today. Afterwards, I will present all alignments of the Montenegrin foreign policy with the EU ’s, with a special emphasis on the imposed sanctions in view of the situation in Ukraine, due to the multi-layered ties between Montenegro and Russia. All this should enable us to draw a conclusion if and to what extent EU ’s CFSP and CSDP are affecting and changing Montenegrin foreign policy and its postulates...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the use {{a range of}} writers {{in the early to}} mid-Victorian period have made of interplays between the fantastic and the mimetic modes in their texts. I respond to critical assessments of the role of fantasy writing within Victorian fiction, and develop new articulations both of this role and of the nature of fantastic-mimetic interplays. In doing so, I interrogate Stephen Prickett’s categorization of Victorian fantasy writing as an unconscious creative force and Rosemary Jackson’s detailing of ‘Victorian fantasy realism’ as an evocation of negative tensions within Victorian culture. I transpose Julia Kristeva’s theories of transformative poetic intertextuality into the context of intertextualities between pairings of a fantasy and a realist text by four different Victorian authors. Chapter One explores how uncanny textualites in Charlotte Brontë's juvenile novella, The Spell (1834), and her mature work Jane Eyre (1847) represent the fragmented nature of aesthetic identities in nineteenth-century artistic, religious and authorial contexts, and how this representation suggests ways of <b>negotiating</b> resolution. <b>Chapter</b> Two investigates the use of polyphonic textuality (combinations of fairy tale and ghost story motifs) in Nicholas Nickleby (1838 - 1839) and A Christmas Carol (1843) by Charles Dickens dramatizes the emotional complications of disability in terms of a wide spectrum of social exclusion. Chapter Three examines how astronomical imagery and cognitive dissonance represent educational reform in George Eliot's The Lifted Veil (1859) and Daniel Deronda (1876). Chapter Four traces the extended interrogation and transcendence of emotional deprivation in George Macdonald's Adela Cathcart, developed by a heteroglossic voice through the fairy tales 'The Light Princess', 'The Shadows' and 'The Giant's Heart' (all first published in 1864). I propose that these critical interrogations can best be understood through an adaptation of Damien Broderick’s theory of modern transrealism, adapted to the historical context of the Victorian period...|$|R

In recent years, with the increasing of compe-titiveness in most sectors, negotiation procedures become present in practically all of them. One particular environment in which the competitiveness has been increasing exponentially is the electricity markets sector. This work is directed to the study of electricity markets’ partici-pating entities interaction, namely in what concerns the formation, management and operation of aggregating entities – Virtual Power Players (VPPs). VPPs are responsible for managing coalitions of market players with small market negotiating influence, which take strategic advantage in entering such aggregations, to increase their <b>negotiating</b> power.

Part 2 examines the role of services in developing economies, including geographic determinants of business services location; electronic commerce; and case studies of the structure and potential for services liberalization in India, Egypt, Senegal, Kenya, and South Africa. Part 3 explores options and issues in the Services 2000 negotiations to be conducted {{under the auspices of the}} WTO, covering telecommunications policy reform; insurance services; media services; negotiating proposals for effective services liberalization; and the formation of <b>negotiating</b> coalitions. This <b>chapter</b> focuses on the Imperfect competition and trade liberalization under the GAT...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 10 of the book, Markets, {{rights and}} power in Australian social policy, edited by Gabrielle Meagher and Susan Goodwin, and {{published}} by Sydney University Press. From about the mid- 1980 s both {{state and federal governments}} in Australia effected a series of market-oriented reforms in education. This chapter examines the practice of ‘school choice’, which we argue has been fundamental to the development and operation of market-oriented schooling in Australia – and internationally. Rather than simply enrolling their child in the nearest government (or Catholic) school, as might have been the case in the 1970 s, parents in 21 st-century Australia have increasingly been positioned as active consumers who may or must choose a school for their child from a number of options, especially at the secondary school level. The public vigilance of parents acting as individuals, yet coordinated by the market mechanism, is meant to be a key driver of quality control. Under-performing schools, it is argued, will be forced to make improvements in order to attract parents. Well-managed schools will be validated in the marketplace. This chapter, by Helen Proctor and Claire Aitchison, is concerned with how families, as consumers, are shaped by, and respond to marketised schooling. Within this frame, financial capacity is more important than ever before – indeed the success of these reforms depend on a strong middle class. Nevertheless, we argue that school choice is predicated on more than the capacity to pay. School markets are complex and unique environments of competing interests, tensions and roles, potentially requiring specialised expertise and strategy to <b>negotiate.</b>   <b>Chapters</b> in Markets, rights {{and power in}} Australian social policy: Introduction: Capturing marketisation in Australian social policy 1) The politics of market encroachment: policymaker rationales and voter responses 2) The marketisation of human services and the expansion of the not-for-profit sector 3) The devil 2 ̆ 7 s in the detail: the hidden costs of private retirement incomes policy 4) Social benefit bonds: financial markets inside the state 5) 2 ̆ 7 Which bank? 2 ̆ 7 Competition and community service obligations in the retail banking sector 6) Community aged care providers in a competitive environment: past, present and future 7) Home security: marketisation and the changing face of housing assistance in Australia 8) Money and markets in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare system 9) Marketisation of immigrant skills assessment in Australia 10) Markets in education: 2 ̆ 7 School choice 2 ̆ 7 and family capital 11) Conditional income transfers and choice in social services: just more conditions and more markets?  ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is an exploratory {{study of the}} meaning and expectations of old age, and the attitudes and behaviour towards planning for care in old age, of a middle-aged cohort of South Asians of people, namely the Gujaratis and Bangladeshis in the East Midlands. The report is divided into seven chapters. Chapter one provides {{a brief overview of}} the research project and sets out the need for research in the field. This chapter includes a brief overview of selected literature on demographic, social and economic position of South Asian in Britain to provide a contextual background for the empirical chapters. Chapter two, covers our methodological approach, describing the rationale for using for using a qualitative and semi-quantitative approach, and outlines how focus groups and semi- structured in-depth interviews were used for gathering material. The chapter also includes how we selected and recruited the sample, background details about the sample size and characteristics and how the material was translated, transcribed, interpreted and analysed. Chapter three describes participants' understanding of the meaning of old age, their aspirations and expectations for growing old and their concerns about health, social welfare and financial independence and dependency in old age. This chapter also discusses how age, gender and ethnicity impact on participants' attitudes and expectations of ageing. Chapter four focuses on participants' expectations of personal and practical support from 'close' family members and the state. Their expectations of support are examined in the context of intergenerational responsibilities and obligations, potential difficulties and barriers which participants believe people in their age group are likely to encounter in negotiating support from their family. The last section of the chapter examines participants' attitudes to, and justifications for, expecting personal and practical support from the state, and the impediments they feel they are likely to face in <b>negotiating</b> support. <b>Chapter</b> five examines participants' attitudes and plans for financing retirement in terms of pensions and savings, and in terms of their expectations of financial support from state and family. We also examine the issues they believe will prevent them from living a financially secure and comfortable old age. Chapter six discusses participants' attitudes to saving, inheritance and the use of personal financial resources to pay for care in old age. The last section of this chapter examines participants' attitudes to funding long-term care through general taxation or long-term care insurance. The final chapter of the report, Chapter seven, concludes with a summary of issues highlighted by participants. We also examine the implications of these issues, and the impact they may have on future generations of older people, their families and the state. University of Leiceste...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} a 36000 -word document of a PhD by project {{completed in the}} sculpture department. of The Royal College of Art between October 2001 and September 2005. The purpose of this research has been to reflect upon {{what it is to}} make sculpture and to produce a document that reveals the many considerations and implications that occur with the making of sculpture; to document the challenge, the risk and the understanding that sculpture's venture brings. This thesis begins with the teleological emergency of sculpture's undertaking in order to disclose the advent of its theoretical implications - to reveal sculpture's vital importance to aesthetics, epistemology and ethics. With the aim of demonstrating the interdependency of sculpture's practical and theoretical problematic, each of the first four chaptersÃ‚Â· orientate t~mselves around a simple practical concern; the first chapter begins with the radical leap of sculpture, the second chapter addresses its fearful quivering, the third <b>chapter</b> <b>negotiates</b> the potential of its slip and the fourth chapter contemplates its fall. While the first four chapters are illustrated with images of historical and contemporary art, the fifth and final chapter documents the research that has been carried out {{within the context of a}} studio practice and within various exhibitions that occurred throughout the four-year period. This research project poses sculpture as a philosophical figure of doubt; sculptural practice is seen to figure doubt literally and radically, but its doubting is seen to initiate knowledge. Whereas sculpture could be said to have stepped down in relation to contemporary fine art practice, this project claims sculptural method as a vital and fundamental way to knowledge; it puts forward the postulation of sculpture as an overcoming that is contingent to its necessary and abysmal fall.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{gains from}} reforming trade in communications, finance, transport and business services are large, probably {{larger than those}} from comparable liberalisation of goods trade. Even exploiting the opportunities arising from goods trade liberalisation will require better services: sub-Saharan African exporters today pay transport costs many {{times greater than the}} tariffs that they face in industrial country markets. Moreover, without progress in services there may simply not be enough on the table to allow progress in other market-access areas: services are the strongest export interest of WTO members such as the EU, India and the USA that are the focal point of efforts to liberalise agricultural trade. So services matter. But what is Doha doing about it? It has been hard to judge, because of the opaqueness of services policies and the opaqueness of the request–offer <b>negotiating</b> process. This <b>chapter</b> tries to assess what is on the table. It begins by summarising what we believe to be the first survey of applied trade policies in the major services sectors of 102 industrial and developing countries. These policies are then compared with those countries’ Uruguay Round commitments in services and the best offers that they have made in the current Doha negotiations. In a nutshell, at this stage Doha promises somewhat greater security of access to services markets but not one iota of liberalisation. Ironically, two of the most protected sectors, transport and professional services (involving the international mobility of people), are either not being negotiated at all or are not being negotiated with any degree of seriousness. Uruguay Round commitments are, on average, 2. 3 times more restrictive than current policies. The best offers submitted so far as part of the Doha negotiations improve on Uruguay Round commitments by about 10...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{performance}} {{poetry is}} a democratic art form that elicits dialogue and is a catalyst for social change. Yet it is an art form that is still not well understood: it is accused of unconsciously mimicking hip-hop and being a watered-down, lesser version of "real" poetry. However once its power is harnessed {{it may be a}} powerful art form {{that can be used to}} address social ills and act as a medium for memory work. The themes that are prevalent in contemporary performance poetry illustrate society‘s preoccupations. Different South African and American poets from a wide range of socio-economic, national, generational and racial backgrounds are examined to explore the collective preoccupations that keep emerging in the poetry, issues pertaining to race and class, gender, and to the politics of the past and its effect on the present. There is a long debate around the influences of contemporary performance poetry, which is <b>negotiated</b> in <b>Chapter</b> One. Though Gil Scott-Heron‘s "The Revolution will not be Televised" is identified as being a major influence, Saul Williams‘s "Black Stacey" challenges some of the arguments made by Scott-Heron. Lesego Rampolokeng lays the foundation for South African performance poetry by criticising the new black elite in the country in "Riding the Victim Train". Chapter Two examines how the poets challenge the status quo in their work. Sarah Jones‘s "Blood" illustrates how the new black middle class in America is complicit in keeping poor people on the margins, while Kgafela oa Magogodi levels his criticism against state sanctioned poets in South Africa. Mxolisi Nyezwa‘s "The Man is Gone" illustrates that the new class based hierarchal system in South Africa is potentially harsher than the apartheid one that was based on race. Chapter Three focuses on gender issues that are prevalent in South Africa. Tumi Molekane‘s "Yvonne" illustrates the danger that is embedded in the hetero-normative narrative while oa Magogodi‘s "Samson and deli(e) lah" and Sam‘s "Eve" explore how this narrative is unjustly informed by misinterpretations of the Bible. History and the impact of the past on the present is the focus of Chapter Four. " 76 " by Molekane illustrates how the apartheid legacy still affects many in South Africa, while Andrea Gibson‘s "Eli" explores the devastating effects of America‘s war efforts in Iraq. Dennis Brutus highlights the cathartic attributes of poetry that is community-driven in "So Neat They Were" and "Mumia". The chapter ends with an exploration of how the form of izibongo is used by Chris Thurman in "Holy City (A Jozi Praise-Poem) ". The last poem illustrates how the past informs the present and suggests that despite the bleakness of the past, there is hope for South Africa because of its rich cultural heritage...|$|R
40|$|Water {{resource}} management {{is a major}} concern worldwide due to the rapid population growth and demands of economic development. Water resources are distributed unevenly and sharing water between multiple users or countries is common. Transboundary rivers create an interdependency among countries, where an upstream country can impact {{the quantity and quality of}} water downstream. ^ The dissertation analyzes multiple issues related to water management. Chapter One is based on a laboratory experiment that models a situation where the decisions of upstream farmers impact the pollution level downstream. The chapter explores the gender differences in the use of conservation technology, which improves downstream water quality. This study also examines framing, the role of emotional feedback, and their impact on the use of conservation. Results show that: (1) females behave more environmentally friendly, (2) in the framing treatments there is no gender difference in providing negative emotional feedback, while males are more likely to offer positive feedback, (3) the gender difference in providing emotional feedback disappears once we account for the lake cleanliness, and (4) negative feedback is especially effective on males. ^ Chapter Two provides background information on the Kura-Araks Basin. This basin lies across five countries, with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia occupying the majority of it. The chapter identifies and discusses national and transboundary water issues in the region, which include both the management of water quantity and quality. ^ Chapter Three focuses on the upstream-downstream relationship between Azerbaijan and Georgia. The purpose of this study is to compare aggregated isolated and linked games in the Kura-Araks Basin. It uses the interconnected game theoretic approach (using several issues that the countries can negotiate over) to analyze transboundary waters. Specifically, water quantity and water quality games are developed. Result show that interconnected (linked) games can generate outcomes that cannot be achieved when issues are <b>negotiated</b> independently. ^ <b>Chapter</b> Four discusses the issues associated with the traditional economic modeling and considers the alternative framework, namely metaeconomics, which recognizes the role of empathy in analyzing shared water resources. ...|$|R
