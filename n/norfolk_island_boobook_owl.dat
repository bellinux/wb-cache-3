40|$|The {{population}} of the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boobook</b> <b>owl</b> Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata, a nocturnal bird restricted to the Australian territory of Norfolk Island, {{was reduced to a}} single female in 1986. Deliberate introduction of two males of its nearest relative, the New Zealand boobook N. n. novaeseelandiae, as a conservation intervention has allowed the taxon to persist on Norfolk Island, albeit in hybrid form. Although declared Extinct in 2000, a re-examination of this unique situation has concluded there is a strong argument that the taxon should be categorized as Critically Endangered because, on average, approximately half the nuclear genome of the original taxon and all the mitochondrial DNA is conserved in all living owls on the island. This thus represents a special case in which the taxon can be considered to be extant, in hybrid form, even though no pure-bred individuals survive. More generally, we suggest that, in exceptional cases, hybridization may not be a threat to highly threatened species and that guidelines are needed to determine when to consider hybrid populations as extant forms of the original taxon, and when to declare extinction through hybridization...|$|E
50|$|The Norfolk boobook (Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata), {{also known}} as the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boobook,</b> <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>owl</b> or <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> morepork, was a bird in the true owl family endemic to <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island,</b> an Australian {{territory}} in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. It is an extinct subspecies of the morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae). However, although the taxon is extinct, its genes live on in the descendants of the hybrid offspring of the last female bird, which was sighted for the last time in 1996.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the origin}} of the town's name comes from the Aboriginal word for small owls, [...] "Caningera". The most notable owl found in the area is the {{southern}} <b>boobook</b> <b>owl,</b> which appears in various logos and symbols associated with Canungra. In 2005, the local Post Office released a special limited-release frank featuring Canungra and the <b>boobook</b> <b>owl.</b> However the word Cunungra comes from the Yugambeh word gungunga meaning [...] "a long flat or clearing".|$|R

25|$|Extinctions include {{that of the}} endemic Norfolk kākā and Norfolk ground dove {{along with}} endemic {{subspecies}} of pigeon, starling, triller, thrush and <b>boobook</b> <b>owl,</b> though the latter's genes persist in a hybrid population descended from the last female.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of mammals, but the island is {{particularly}} rich in bird-life with nearly 200 birds, of which seven endemic species and a number of others are found only here and on some nearby islands. The endemic birds include four vulnerable species — the secretive Sumba <b>boobook</b> <b>owl,</b> Sumba buttonquail, red-naped fruit-dove, and Sumba hornbill — as well as three more common species: the Sumba green pigeon, Sumba flycatcher, and apricot-breasted sunbird. Saltwater crocodiles can still be found in some areas.|$|R
50|$|English ornithologist John Latham {{described}} the <b>boobook</b> <b>owl</b> as Strix <b>boobook</b> in 1801, taking its species epithet {{from a local}} Aboriginal word for the bird. John Gould described Athene marmorata in 1846 from a specimen in South Australia; this is now regarded as a synonym. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, Gould recognised three species, all of which he placed in the genus Spiloglaux: S. marmoratus from South Australia, S. boobook, which is widespread across the continent and Tasmania, and S. maculatus from southeastern Australia and Tasmania.|$|R
