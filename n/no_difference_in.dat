5|$|Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was {{introduced}} in 2004. It is available in 500, 750, and 1000-mg strengths, mainly to counteract common gastrointestinal side effects, {{as well as to}} increase compliance by reducing pill burden. <b>No</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> effectiveness exists between the two preparations.|$|E

Rubin observed <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> marital adjustment between couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages. Rubin and Adams reported <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> marital satisfaction between couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous relationships. Gilmartin likewise found <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> marital satisfaction between sexually open and sexually monogamous couples. A study by Bergstrand and Willams found couples in open marriages had higher levels of satisfaction than couples in the general population.|$|R
5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Schaffer in Social Development (1996) {{suggests}} that the father–child relationship is primarily a cultural construction shaped by the requirements of each society. In societies where the care of infants has been assigned to boys rather than girls, <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> nurturing capacity was found. Other studies, however, point in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely haired tail {{is about}} as long as the head and body. It is dark brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail {{coloration}} as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E

30|$|The study {{demonstrates}} that participants experienced overall less discomfort, pain and tiredness using SS compared to SILS at both 30 and 60  min into the exercise irrespective {{of their experience}} with laparoscopy. There were <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ‘headaches’ and ‘general tiredness’ between SS and SILS. Also, there were <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ‘shoulder girdle pain’ in the first 30  min and <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ‘neck pain’ in the second 30  min (Table  2). This in part {{may be due to}} low numbers of participants in the study. The participants cut more circles and made fewer mistakes using SS than SILS (Table  3). However, the design was too small to enable an assessment between doctors of different grades.|$|R
5|$|C. c. perplexus, {{the western}} subspecies, occurs {{from the head}} of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its {{northern}} limits are Shark Bay and the mulga-eucalypt boundary line. It is less specialised in its habitat, as it does not share its distribution with the little raven, and does not appear to correlate with the range of sheep. The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies, with similarities to calls of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> plumage. Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E
30|$|In current literature, tooth {{agenesis}} is {{also reported}} {{as the most}} frequent dental anomaly among cleft patients [3 – 7]. Interestingly, in the CL[*]+[*]P B group, the frequency of tooth agenesis was significantly higher among males. All the other cleft groups showed <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the distribution of dental anomalies neither among them nor between genders. Other authors have also reported <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> dental anomalies between genders [14, 21].|$|R

5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This {{is in contrast to}} past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} thirty nine {{observations}} of antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) were made on 77 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 17 healthy controls. There were <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ADCC between these 2 groups or within the RA group with regard to disease activity, duration, seropositivity, or drug treatment. Sixty observations of phytohaemagglutinin induced cytotoxicity were made on 22 patients with RA and 10 healthy controls.

5|$|The {{embryonic}} heart begins beating {{at around}} 22 days after conception (5 {{weeks after the}} last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother's which is about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to decelerate, slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth. There is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> female and male heart rates before birth.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E

5|$|Out {{of respect}} for the seriously-injured Bianchi, the top three {{finishers}} did not spray champagne. At the podium interviews, conducted by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, Hamilton said that it had been a difficult race weekend and his speed {{near the end of the}} race was reminiscent of the 2008 British Grand Prix. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was lucky that the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
