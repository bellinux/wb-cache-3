5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and <b>not</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as praetor in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's {{contemporary}} Julius Caesar defeated two local tribes in battle. After his term as consul in 59 BC, {{he was appointed}} to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (<b>not</b> <b>into)</b> the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{molecular}} techniques {{at the end}} of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses that were different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results {{of molecular}} studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that molecular data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but <b>not</b> <b>into</b> the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only molecular differences.|$|E

5|$|The 1220 carucage, {{which was}} imposed on both laymen and clergy, was {{collected}} {{by a special}} commission, and was paid <b>not</b> <b>into</b> the Exchequer, but to the Templar Order church in London, the New Temple. The Templars through their international organization functioned as bankers in and between countries. The three men appointed to the commission—William de Halliwell, a friar, William FitzBenedict, a London resident, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer clerk—were responsible for accounting for the money received, which amounted to £3,000. The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short; the orders for the assessments to be made were issued in August, but required the tax to be collected by Michaelmas in late September. The 1220 tax attempted to allow for variation in land values, exempting barren land from taxation. The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler than the 1217 levy, as plough-teams were counted to determine the land size rather than requiring oaths from taxpayers. This tax gathered around £5,500. There was some difficulty in its collection however, as some counties did not pay, {{and a number of}} barons refused to pay, at least at first. The 1220 carucage was levied to pay for the defence of Henry's lands in Poitou, southern France.|$|E

The passages between {{the cars were}} wide and without doors, the seat pitch of 102 (second class) and 111cm (first class) was larger than on any other German train. Furthermore, the doors were unusually wide and featured steps that deployed automatically when the doors were opened to make entry as convenient as possible, and the glass doors dividing the two major areas of the intermediate cars were opened by proximity sensors. The ICE1 was the first German train in which smokers and non-smokers were separated <b>not</b> <b>into</b> {{different parts of the}} same car, but to different cars altogether.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Chernivtsi Oblast (⅔ {{of which}} is Northern Bukovina) had a {{population}} of circa 805,000, out of which 47.5% were Ukrainians and 28.3% were Romanians, with Germans, Jews, Poles, Hungarians and Russians comprising the rest. The strong Ukrainian presence was the official motivation for inclusion of the region into the Ukrainian SSR and <b>not</b> <b>into</b> the newly formed Moldavian SSR. Whether the region would {{have been included in}} the Ukrainian SSR, if the commission presiding over the division had been led by someone else than the Ukrainian communist leader Nikita Khrushchev, remains a matter of debate among scholars. In fact, some territories with a mostly Romanian population (e.g. Hertza region) were allotted to the Ukrainian SSR.|$|E
25|$|The benthic {{community}} {{has taken on}} a disproportionately large role in the food web ecology of the estuary due to key invasions by bivalves. The use of these clams, the Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis) has a wide salinity tolerance that extends into the low salinity zone, but <b>not</b> <b>into</b> freshwater. It filter feeds on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, such as calanoid copepod nauplii. The clam has few predators in the San Francisco Estuary and this allows it to grow to high densities (on the order of tens of thousands/m2). Because of its high clearance rates, it is capable of clearing the entire water column of portions of the estuary in a few days, leading to drastically depleted plankton populations. This is thought to be the main cause of a decline in ecosystem productivity after the invasion of the clams in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|During 1969, Buckley {{began to}} write and record {{material}} for three different albums: Lorca, Blue Afternoon, and Starsailor. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician Cathy Berberian, he decided to integrate the ideas of composers such as Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis in an avant-garde rock genre. He started to fully use his vocal range. According to Underwood, Buckley knew that Lorca had little to no chance in the commercial market. Selecting eight songs that {{had yet to be}} recorded, these tracks evolved into the sessions for Blue Afternoon, an album that was quite similar to Happy Sad in style. In a 1977 article for Down Beat magazine, Underwood wrote that Buckley's heart was <b>not</b> <b>into</b> the Blue Afternoon performances and that the album was a perfunctory response to please his business partners.|$|E

25|$|Testosterone can be {{administered}} parenterally, {{but it has}} more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in enanthate, undecanoate, or cypionate ester form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone {{at the site of}} injection; absorption rate (and thus injection schedule) varies among different esters, but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 12 weeks. A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system. Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle, <b>not</b> <b>into</b> the vein, to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. In addition, because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil, intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous embolism (clot) in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{concepts}} such as the serpent being identified as Satan, Eve's sin being sexual temptation, or Adam's first wife being Lilith, come from literary works found in various Jewish apocrypha, but not found anywhere in the Book of Genesis or the Torah itself. Writings dealing with these subjects are extant literature in Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Armenian and Arabic, going back to ancient Jewish thought. There influential concepts were then adopted into Christian theology, but <b>not</b> <b>into</b> modern Judaism. This marked a radical split between the two religions. Some of the oldest Jewish portions of apocrypha are called Primary Adam Literature where some works became Christianized. Examples of Christianized works is The Book of Adam and Eve, known as the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, translated from the Ethiopian Ge'ez by Solomon Caesar Malan (1882) and an original Syriac work entitled Cave of Treasures which has close affinities to the Conflict as noted by August Dillmann.|$|E
25|$|H. D'Arbois de Jubainville {{suggested}} in 1899 {{that the name}} meant Londino's fortress. But Coates argues {{that there is no}} such personal name recorded, and that D'Arbois' suggested etymology for it (from Celtic *londo-, 'fierce') would have a short vowel. Coates notes that this theory was repeated by linguistics up to the 1960s, and more recently still in less specialist works. It was revived in 2013 by Peter Schrijver, who suggested that the sense of the proto-Indo-European root *lendh- ('sink, cause to sink'), which gave rise to the Celtic noun *londos ('a subduing'), survived in Celtic. Combined with the Celtic suffix *-injo- (used to form singular nouns from collective ones), this could explain a Celtic form *londinjon 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'. This, in Schrijver's reading, would more readily explain all the Latin, Welsh, and English forms., Routledge Studies in Linguistics, 13 (New York: Routledge, 2014), p. 57. Similar approaches to Schrijver's have been taken by Theodora Bynon, who in 2016 supported a similar Celtic etymology, while demonstrating that the place-name was borrowed into the West Germanic ancestor-language of Old English, <b>not</b> <b>into</b> Old English itself.|$|E
