On February 6, 2004, Midway registered the domain names mkdeception.com and mortalkombatdeception.com. When Midway Entertainment was asked if Mortal Kombat: Deception was the official title, the developers gave <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> at that time. Later that month, Midway released the first trailer from the game, confirming this title.|$|E

25|$|In {{support of}} the album, Biohazard {{embarked}} on a short co-headlining tour of Europe with Suicidal Tendencies {{in the latter half}} of January 2012. The band arrived in Belgium to begin the tour on January 20 where abruptly, Scott Roberts was rushed to the hospital. After going through several tests and receiving <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> concerning his ailment, Roberts checked himself out of the hospital in time to perform with the band. After their set, Roberts was rushed back to the hospital. Roberts was released from the hospital in time to continue on with the tour at the next stop in Oberhausen, Germany on January 21. On January 22, Schuler left the tour to in order to return home and be with his wife for the birth of their baby. Danny Lamagna of Sworn Enemy and Suicide City stepped in to replace Schuler until he was able to return.|$|E
25|$|When the Volunteers didn't {{score on}} the first drive of the game, the Irish took advantage, with Brady Quinn leading an Irish drive that ended with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Anthony Fasano. The ensuing kickoff was fumbled by the Volunteers, and Quinn threw his second touchdown to Maurice Stovall three plays later. Volunteers' kicker, James Wilhout kicked a 26-yard field goal for their only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, on a Volunteer punt, Tom Zbikowski returned the ball 43-yards to give the Irish a 21-3 lead. After a Quinn fumble that was recovered by the Volunteers, Ainge led a 40-yard drive and threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Bret Smith to give the halftime score of 21-10. In the second half, after a failed fourth down conversion by the Irish, Wilhout kicked a 30-yard field goal to put the Volunteers down by 8. When the Irish didn't answer, Ainge and running back Arian Foster led the Volunteers to Foster's 3-yard touchdown. With Ainge's pass to Smith completed for a two-point conversion, the game was tied at 21 {{at the end of}} the third. In the fourth quarter, however, the Irish scored 20, including two D.J. Fitzpatrick field goals, a Quinn touchdown pass to Jeff Samardzija, and a Zbikowski interception return for a touchdown. With <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> by the Volunteers, the Irish won the game 41-21. With the win, Quinn continued his Irish record touchdown passing streak to 13 games, Samardzija's touchdown catch, his 12th broke an Irish record of touchdown catches in a season, and the Irish moved up in ranking to 7th nationally.|$|E

25|$|Australia won the toss again, {{and chose}} to bat. Openers Marsh and Taylor again got the {{tourists}} {{off to a}} solid start, but their heroics of the fifth test {{were not to be}} repeated, as Marsh was caught by debutant Igglesden off Galdstone Small for 17, the opening stand worth 48. David Boon came to the wicket and looked at ease, as he and Taylor set about building a solid second wicket partnership. The pair batted throughout the morning, and Taylor soon brought up his fifty. The young New South Welshman had been in majestic form throughout the series, and England had <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> for the well-timed left-hander. He pulled and drove with ease once again, to bring up his milestone. Boon likewise approached his half-century, but soon lost his partner Taylor, who rarely edged a ball outside off-stump of the bowling of Igglesden to be caught behind, and give the bowler his first ever test wicket. Taylor had gone for 71, and Australia were 130 for 2. Boon fell shortly after for 46, bringing Dean Jones to the wicket to partner his captain Allan Border. The pair seemed to enjoy each other's company, and once again built a solid 4th wicket partnership, batting throughout the remainder of the first day. Jones was in a hurry and scored freely, all around the wicket, working the field for quick singles and twos, and picking off the bad balls for four. Shortly before stumps he brought up his second century of the tour. At stumps on day one, Australia ended on 325 for 3, with Border not out on 66 and Jones on 114 not out.|$|E
500|$|Although giving [...] "sporadic" [...] {{comments}} {{during the}} interview, <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> {{had been given}} that touched upon the case. The Court had not previously considered [...] "whether a suspect can invoke {{the right to remain}} silent by remaining uncooperative and nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes" [...] and the dissent considered that silence throughout a lengthy interrogation [...] "long past the point when he could be deciding whether to respond cannot reasonably be understood other than as an invocation of the right to remain silent". Butler also distinguished between a [...] "sufficient course of conduct" [...] and mere [...] "inculpatory statements".|$|E
500|$|In 1991, {{following}} the break-up of guitarist Tom Morello's former band Lock Up, former Lock Up drummer Jon Knox encouraged Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello {{as he was}} looking {{to start a new}} group. Morello soon contacted Brad Wilk, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up. This lineup named themselves Rage Against the Machine, after a song de la Rocha had written for his former underground hardcore punk band Inside Out (also to be the title of the unrecorded Inside Out full-length album). Kent McClard, with whom Inside Out were associated, had coined the phrase [...] "rage against the machine" [...] in a 1989 article in his zine <b>No</b> <b>Answers.</b>|$|E

500|$|Vargas Llosa's third novel, Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral), was {{published}} in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative {{is the story of}} Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur. A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as [...] "The Cathedral". During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way. Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> and no sign of a better future. The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odría by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives. The persistent theme of hopelessness makes Conversation in the Cathedral Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.|$|E
500|$|The three then form a plan, {{which has}} Ed sitting {{alone on a}} bench in the {{playground}} with a [...] "Don't Touch!" [...] sign around his neck. Jonny (David Paul Grove) soon walks by, carrying his imaginary friend Plank, who is a board of wood. Impressed with Ed's hair cut, Jonny ignores the sign and rubs Plank against Ed's head. Eddy and Double D then jump out from behind a nearby bush and capture Jonny, accusing him of being the serial toucher. Eddy interrogates Jonny and Plank after tying them to chairs in Double Dee's garage and hooking them up to a homemade lie detector. However, when they give him <b>no</b> <b>answers,</b> he resorts to using chinese water torture on Plank. This makes Jonny need to use the bathroom and in his desperation, he falsely confesses to the crime. The Eds then collect their money and punish Jonny by trapping him in a tire.|$|E
500|$|With the {{lull in the}} fighting, and {{the onset}} of autumn rains, coupled with endless hills and {{deepening}} mud, Middleton's left knee, which had been uncomfortable {{for more than a}} year, was now becoming agonizing. He had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football, but there was no immediate explanation for the pain in his left leg. Medics studied his leg, but had <b>no</b> <b>answers.</b> In late November Middleton went to the hospital in Naples, staying well into December, still without adequate diagnosis. He was able to hobble around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton's difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, [...] "I don't give a damn about his knees; I want his head and his heart. And I'll take him into battle on a litter if we have to." [...] Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.|$|E

500|$|The {{absence of}} direct narrative, such as through cutscenes or in-game text, was a mixed point for reviewers. John Teti of Eurogamer {{considered}} the game's base story to be metaphorical for a [...] "story of {{a search for}} companionship", and that the few encounters with human characters served as [...] "emotional touchstones" [...] that drove the story forward; ultimately, Teti stated that these elements make Limbo [...] "a game that has very few humans, but a surplus of humanity". Hatfield praised {{the simplicity of the}} game's story, commenting that, [...] "with no text, no dialogue, and no explanation, it manages to communicate circumstance and causality to the player more simply than most games". Both Teti and Hatfield noted that some of the story elements were weaker {{in the second half of}} the game, when there are almost no human characters with whom the player comes into contact, but that the game ends with an unexpected revelation. GameSpot's Tom McShae found no issues with the game posing questions on [...] "death versus life and reality versus dream", but purposely providing <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> for them, allowing the player to contemplate these on their own. McShae also considered that the brief but gruesome death scenes for the boy helped to create an [...] "emotional immediacy that is difficult to forget". The New York Daily News Stu Horvath noted that Limbo [...] "turns its lack of obvious narrative into one of the most compelling riddles in videogames".|$|E
500|$|In 2005 David Crane {{published}} a new Scott biography {{in which he}} comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates [...] "so wholly obscured by legend". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott [...] "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the [...] "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" [...] of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring. Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, [...] "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data." [...] Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that [...] "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years". The New York Times Book Review was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice, and concluded that [...] "For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers <b>no</b> <b>answers</b> that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Creation science, {{which is}} {{promoted}} by AiG, is a pseudoscience that [...] "lacks the central {{defining characteristic of}} all modern scientific theories". Scientific and scholarly organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, Paleontological Society, Geological Society of America, Australian Academy of Science, and the Royal Society of Canada have issued statements against the teaching of creationism. The National Center for Science Education, a science advocacy group, criticize AiG's promotion of non-science. In direct response to AiG, <b>No</b> <b>Answers</b> in Genesis is a website maintained {{by members of the}} Australian Skeptics and retired civil servant John Stear for the purpose of rebutting claims made by AiG.|$|E
2500|$|Housemates on Trial was a live {{show that}} aired on Day 67 (28 June 2006). This special {{replaced}} a previously advertised special where housemates {{were to be}} hypnotised by hypnotist, Peter Powers, because not enough housemates consented to being hypnotised for enough footage to be produced for a special. [...] In this special, Housemates were asked {{a series of questions}} previously submitted by viewers and were run through a Layered Voice Analysis device to determine how honest the housemates were with their answers. This device did not require housemates to give yes or <b>no</b> <b>answers.</b> This special ran in a similar format to the previous special Truth, Lies, Eviction, except without an Eviction.
