5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> effects are of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, we have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, Roger Sperry {{developed}} split-brain preparations in non-human primates {{that emphasized}} the importance of information transfer that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.|$|E
500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show was, no idea what we were doing." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the band}} entered 2016, Cain felt {{the future for}} the group was bright: [...] "We're not done yet. I think we got more music in us," [...] he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band {{announced}} their break-up with a statement that read in part, [...] "We have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future holds, but for now we are done." [...] The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning.

The group performed 36 songs — some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat — while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{album cover}} depicts a Bible spiked with nails {{placed in a}} pentagram star shape, covered in blood with the word [...] "Slayer" [...] burnt across it. The liner notes intersperse the lyrics between passages from the biblical book of Job, partly crossed out with a black marker. The idea was suggested by the band's record company, although King wanted [...] more time to develop a better cover. King's concept for the cover was to show nails {{in the shape of}} a pentagram, and have them miss keywords in Bible verses so it appeared as if it had been created by a sociopath who knew where every word appears. He later complained that the outcome was typical of [...] "a record company with absolutely <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuck they were going to do", and said that the cover [...] "looked like a seventh grader defaced the Bible."A slip insert was placed in front of the covers in major retail outlets.|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{traveled}} to Tokyo in 2001 {{to prepare for}} this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and [...] "realized [...] had become a story {{that took place in}} an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> summer of 2002 was going to be like. ...

500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|Pelé {{was born}} on 23 October 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American {{inventor}} Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed [...] "Dico" [...] by his family. He received the nickname [...] "Pelé" [...] during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and that it is Hebrew for [...] "miracle" [...] (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.|$|E
500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, we had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard {{looking the other way}} and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E

MacColla’s men charged the Parliamentarians opposite them putting them to flight and killing a large number of them.

[...] "To Catch a Predator" [...] was written during the mixing process, when the group realized that the album needed a song [...] "that attacks an evil". Inspired by the television series To Catch a Predator, the song's lyrics describe Violent J luring pedophiles into his house to violently murder them. According to Bruce, [...] "I could easily see myself killing pedophiles in real life and having no guilt. The only reason I don’t do it is because I'd probably get caught. So its nice to live it out through my music." [...] "Boing Boing", a comedic sex-oriented rap, samples audio from a pornographic film which had previously been sampled by the group on their Tunnel of Love EP. Bruce says that the song was intended as a joke. Some fans interpreted the song as Bruce and Utsler calling themselves ugly, while others believed that they were bragging about how many women they have sex with. Bruce commented [...] "We're not sex symbols, especially not me. If there are girls, they’re there to see Shaggy." ...|$|E
