Crowfeather denies that he ever has any kits besides Breezepelt, and he states that Leafpool and their kits mean <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Breezepelt and Nightcloud are both outraged about never being informed. Seeing how {{everyone}} feels she did something wrong, Hollyleaf runs off into the tunnels which collapse.|$|E
25|$|The Falcon is {{captured}} by a larger ship piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, looking to reclaim their former vessel. Two rival gangs, seeking {{to settle debts}} with Han, board and attack, but Han and his allies flee in the Falcon. The gangs inform the First Order. At the First Order's Starkiller Base – a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses energy from stars – Supreme Leader Snoke orders General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Ren's {{ability to deal with}} emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Ren says Solo means <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Riis {{said that}} he bought and {{injected}} the EPO himself, and team coach Walter Godefroot {{turned a blind eye}} to the drug use on the team. He denied a passage of Jeff d'Hont's book, where it is related that his hematocrit level was once tested by the team and registered 64%. He said if someone wanted to take his yellow jersey they could do so, it meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Riis was removed from the official record books of Tour de France, but in July 2008 he was written back into the books, along with additional notes about his use of doping.|$|E

25|$|From 1932 to 1935, White {{lived in}} England, {{studying}} French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge University. His homosexuality took {{a toll on}} his first term academic performance, {{in part because he}} developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> sexually. That became White's first love affair.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins in}} a Los Angeles diner where a {{waitress}} named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) works with her best friend, Ginny (Juliette Lewis). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases {{her about her}} name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller (Billy Campbell), reveals that the customer had made a bet {{that he would be}} able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie (Tessa Allen). Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him and he admits it, but also insisting Darcelle means <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who becomes violent, slapping and punching her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying that he makes the money and gets to do whatever he likes, implying he wants an open marriage. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother (Janet Carroll); she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of physical abuse. Ginny advises Slim to leave and imprison Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch might have left town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo.|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more than I can say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... [Conclusion.] 2. That the {{man that}} has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> commend <b>him</b> <b>to</b> God, but his own good doings, shall never be in favour with him. This also {{is evident from the}} text: The Pharisee had his own righteousness, but had <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> commend <b>him</b> <b>to</b> God; and {{therefore}} could not by that obtain favour with God, but abode still a rejected one, and in a state of condemnation.|$|R
500|$|Finally, {{in chapter}} ten Townsend affirms that the [...] "backward Chinese" [...] are America’s [...] "only {{legitimate}} problem in Asia" [...] and asks {{what can be}} done to deal with a nation that spends aid money corruptly, does not respect its loans, mistreats and attacks foreigners, ignores international drug laws, will not protect foreign investment, and does not engage in productive diplomacy with other nations. He warns Americans that the Chinese see kindness only as weakness and thus can never respond to any type of positive reinforcement. [...] "For every Chinese, from highest to lowest," [...] he argues, [...] "all the acts of life are concentrated upon extracting, from those who mean <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> what he can for the benefit of himself and his clan." [...] By contrast, he believes that the Chinese do understand force and respect strength. Therefore, he advocates that the United States forgo naive [...] "sentimentalist" [...] thinking and adopt a policy of [...] "stern insistence upon our rights without cruel abuse of our strength", including withholding further loans without strict conditions and holding on to foreign concessions and extraterritoriality.|$|E

I don't know -- I wasn't present at the interview." ...|$|E
2500|$|Craig, renowned as the [...] "Humm Baby" [...] {{because he}} often said it, managed the Giants from late 1985 to 1992. In his first five full {{seasons with the}} Giants, the team had winning records. The Giants won 83 games in 1986 and won the National League Western Division title in 1987, losing the 1987 National League Championship Series to the injury-ridden, overachieving St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The one bright spot in that defeat was their {{slugging}} outfielder Jeffrey Leonard, who was named the series MVP in a losing effort. [...] In Leonard's own faltering words, the prize money ($50,000) meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but only the win that eluded him and his team. [...] He would have given anything to be going up north to play the Minnesota Twins, and his former teammate outfielder Dan Gladden, traded to the Twins {{at the start of}} the season, in the 1987 World Series, who beat the Cardinals in seven games.|$|E

2500|$|Curiosity {{about the}} victims {{led to the}} re-release of Tate's films, {{achieving}} greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate on the motives for the murders. Some of the published photographs of Tate were allegedly taken at a Satanic ritual, but were later proven to have been production photographs from Eye of the Devil. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said she was as [...] "sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known", while Patty Duke remembered her as [...] "a gentle, gentle creature. I was crazy about her, and I don't know anyone who wasn't." [...] Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a press conference, saying that many times they had written that Tate [...] "was beautiful. Maybe {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world. But did you ever write how good she was?" [...] Peter Evans later quoted the actor Laurence Harvey, who commented on Polanski immediately after the murders, [...] "This could destroy Roman. Marriage vows mean <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> but few men have adored a woman as much as he adored Sharon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many biographies {{have been}} written of Gordon, most of them of a highly hagiographic nature. The British Sinologist Demetrius Charles Boulger {{published}} a biography of Gordon in 1896 which depicted him as a staunch patriot and a Christian of immense virtue who displayed superhuman courage {{in the face of}} danger. By contrast, Gordon is one of the four subjects discussed critically in Eminent Victorians by Lytton Strachey, one of the first texts about Gordon that portrays some of his characteristics which Strachey regards as weaknesses. Notably, Strachey emphasizes the claims of Charles Chaillé-Long that Gordon was an alcoholic, an accusation dismissed by later writers like Alan Moorehead and Charles Chenevix Trench. Strachey depicted Gordon as a ludicrous figure, a bad-tempered, deranged egomaniac with a nasty habit of punching out Arabs whenever he was unhappy who led himself into disaster. Even more devastatingly, Strachey depicted Gordon as a monumental hypocrite, noting the contrast between Gordon's lofty Christian ideas of love, compassion, charity, grace and hope vs. a career full of hate, war, carnage, death and destruction. Strachey ended his essay on Gordon on a cynical note: [...] "At any rate, it all ended very happily-in a glorious slaughter of twenty thousand Arabs, a vast addition to the British Empire and a step in the Peerage for Sir Evelyn Baring". Long after his death and despite the popularity of Strachey's essay in Eminent Victorians, the appeal of the Gordon legend lived on. As late as 1933, the French historian Pierre Crabitès wrote in his book Gordon, le Soudan et l'esclavage (Gordon, the Sudan and Slavery) that as a Frenchman the Gordon legend had meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> when he began researching his book, but after examining all of the historical evidence, he could not help but admire Gordon who [...] "died as he lived, a Christian, a gentleman and a soldier".|$|E

5000|$|Four {{days after}} the murder, the name of Jovin’s thesis advisor, James Van de Velde, was leaked to the New Haven Register as the prime suspect in the case. Fifteen months later, criminologist John Pleckaitis, then a {{sergeant}} at the New Haven Police Department, admitted to Hartford Courant reporter Les Gura: [...] "From a physical evidence point of view, we had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> tie <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the case ... I had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> link <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the crime." [...] Famed criminologist Henry Lee’s offer to reconstruct the crime scene was accepted by the police but not carried out.|$|R
