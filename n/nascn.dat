This result supports the hypothesis that <b>NaSCN</b> causes destabilization of SWCNTs, namely, SWCNTs favor the phase with a lower concentration of <b>NaSCN.</b> Khripin et al. reported that the partitioning of SWCNTs in ATP systems was altered {{by the addition of}} 0 – 50  mM <b>NaSCN</b> [10].

However, the present results indicate that the alteration of the partitioning by <b>NaSCN</b> was induced by destabilization of the SWCNTs.

Because absorption spectra were insignificantly affected by these solutes (Additional files 1 : Figure S 1), the Raman spectral changes were attributed to slight alteration of the interband transitions.

40|$|Studies of {{numerous}} proteins with infrared spectroscopy have documented that unfolding {{is a general}} response of unprotected proteins to freeze-drying. Some proteins that are unfolded in the dried solid aggregate during rehydration, whereas others refold. It has been proposed for the latter case that aggregation is avoided because refolding kinetically outcompetes intermolecular interactions. In contrast, with proteins that normally aggregate after rehydration, minimizing unfolding during freeze-drying with stabilizer {{has been shown to}} be needed to favor the recovery of native protein molecules after rehydration. The purpose of the current study was to examine first the opposite situation, in which a denaturant is used to foster additional unfolding in the protein population during freeze-drying. If the protein is not intrinsically resistant to aggregation under the study conditions (e. g., because of intermolecular charge repulsion) and the denaturant does not disrupt intermolecular interactions during rehydration, this treatment should favor aggregation upon rehydration. With infrared spectroscopy we found that at concentrations of the denaturant Na thiocyanate (<b>NaSCN)</b> that only slightly perturbed chymotrypsinogen secondary structure in solution before freeze-drying, there was a large increase in protein unfolding in the dried solid and in protein aggregation measured after rehydration. Bands assigned to intermolecular beta sheet were present in the spectra of samples dried with <b>NaSCN,</b> indicating that aggregation could also arise in the dried solid. By examining the protein structure in the frozen state, we determined that in the absence of <b>NaSCN</b> the protein remains native. <b>NaSCN</b> caused structural perturbations during freezing, without the formation of intermolecular beta sheet, that were intermediate to structural changes noted after freeze-drying. In contrast, samples treated in the presence of <b>NaSCN</b> and sucrose had native-like spectra in the frozen and dried states, and much reduced aggregation after rehydration.

Briefly, the transfer free energy of 1  M <b>NaSCN</b> and 1  M urea was approximately − 0.4  kJ/mol for the phenyl group, whereas that of NaCl was approximately 0.3  kJ/mol. These results imply that <b>NaSCN</b> and urea favorably interact with the aromatic sidewalls of SWCNTs. However, despite the potential chaotropic effect of these solutes, the inactivity of urea on SWCNTs indicates a lack of favorable interaction between the chaotropes and the SWCNT sidewalls at low concentrations. In addition, there were less significant or insignificant differences in the Raman spectral profiles of NaCl, NaBr, and NaNO 3 compared with {{the difference in the}} profiles of NaCl and <b>NaSCN</b> (data not shown).

40|$|The {{colloidal}} stability of poly(ethylene glycol) -decorated poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA/Tween- 20, particles was investigated {{by means of}} phase separation measurements, {{in the presence of}} sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium chloride, sodium bromide, sodium nitrate, or sodium thiocyanate (<b>NaSCN)</b> at 1. 0 mol L- 1. Following Hofmeister's series, the dispersions of PMMA/Tween- 20 destabilized faster in the presence of NaF than with <b>NaSCN.</b> After the phase separation, the systems were homogenized and except for the dispersions in NaF, re-dispersed particles took longer to destabilize, indicating that anions adsorbed on the particles, creating a new surface. Except for F- ions, the adsorption of anions on the polar outmost shell was evidenced by means of tensiometry and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements. Fluoride ions induced the dehydration of the polar shell, without affecting the polar shell electron density, and the formation of very large aggregates. A model was proposed to explain the colloidal behavior in the presence of Hofmeister ions.

40|$|The {{colloidal}} stability of surfactant-dispersed single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) {{is determined by}} microscopic physicochemical processes, such as association, partitioning, and adsorption propensities. These processes can be controlled {{by the addition of}} solutes. While the effects of cations on the {{colloidal stability}} of SWCNTs are relatively well understood, {{little is known about the}} effects of anions. In this study, we examined the effects of anions on the stability of SWCNTs dispersed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using sodium salts, such as NaCl and <b>NaSCN.</b> We observed that the intensity of the radial breathing mode Raman peaks rapidly decreased as the salts were added, even at concentrations less than 25  mM, indicating the association of SWCNTs. The effect was stronger with <b>NaSCN</b> than NaCl. We propose that the association of SWCNTs was caused by thermodynamic destabilization of SDS assemblies on SWCNT surfaces by these salts, which was confirmed through SWCNT separation experiments using aqueous two-phase extraction and gel chromatography. These results demonstrate that neutral salts can be used to control the colloidal stability of surfactant-dispersed SWCNTs...|$|E
30|$|The adsorbed SWCNTs in 1 wt% SDS, i.e., semiconductor-enriched SWCNTs, were eluted by {{solutions}} containing different solutes after {{removing the}} flow-through fraction {{to examine their}} desorption effect on the SWCNTs. Figure  3 b shows a representative absorption spectrum of the SWCNTs eluted with a 25  mM NaCl solution {{and that of the}} SWCNTs eluted with a subsequent 1 wt% DOC solution. The spectrum of SWCNTs eluted only with 1 wt% DOC is shown in Fig.  3 b for reference and corresponds to that in Fig.  3 a. Hirano et al. reported that cations have dominant effects on SWCNT desorption from hydrogel surfaces; the larger the ionic diameter is, the stronger the desorption effect is [12]. For example, Cs+ ions are more effective for desorption than Na+ ions. The 25  mM NaCl solution eluted a large quantity of SWCNTs (Fig.  3 b). The SWCNTs remaining on the hydrogel surfaces in the presence of 25  mM NaCl, which were eluted by the subsequent addition of 1 wt% DOC, were mainly (6, 5) tubes with an S 11 peak at approximately 980  nm (Fig.  3 b); the higher adsorbability of (6, 5) tubes is due to their larger band gap [12, 37]. The same procedure was applied to the other solutes, i.e., <b>NaSCN,</b> urea and the NaCl/urea mixture. Figure  3 c summarizes the quantity of SWCNTs eluted by these solutes, which was determined based on the absorbance values at 280  nm; note that the absorbance is insignificantly affected by light absorption of <b>NaSCN</b> itself under these conditions. Despite the dominant effect of sodium ions, a slight but significant difference was observed between NaCl and <b>NaSCN</b> (Fig.  3 c), which indicates that thiocyanate ions have some elution effect, even on (6, 5) tubes. In contrast, the effect of urea was comparable to that of the no additive sample. The effect of the NaCl/urea mixture was similar to that of NaCl. Therefore, <b>NaSCN</b> has a destabilizing effect on SDS-dispersed SWCNTs, even in the adsorption reaction. In addition, as seen for urea, there is no chaotropic effect on the stability of the SWCNTs in the adsorption reaction at low concentrations, which is consistent with the results in ATP systems. The chaotropic effect appears at higher concentrations, typically greater than 1  M [12].|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} hen egg white {{lysozyme}} and the inorganic salt sodium thiocyanate on {{the integrity of}} Streptococcus mutans BHT were studied by transmission electron microscopy. Both control cells and cells exposed to <b>NaSCN</b> possessed thick outer cell walls and densely staining inner cell walls juxtaposed to the plasma membranes. In the presence of <b>NaSCN,</b> however, the S. mutans BHT nucleoid was coagulated into thick electron-dense filaments. Exposure of S. mutans BHT to 150 μg of hen egg white lysozyme per ml resulted in the progressive destruction of both the cell walls and the plasma membranes. The enzyme appeared to affect {{the region of the}} cell wall septum, and exposure to 150 μg of hen egg white lysozyme per ml for as short a time as 10 min resulted in visible morphological cell wall alterations. At 30 min, ultrastructural observations revealed {{that the majority of the}} cells were in the process of expelling a portion of their cytoplasmic contents from the septal and other regions of the cells at the time of fixation. After 3 h of incubation in the presence of this high lysozyme concentration, gelled protoplasmic masses, which were free from the cells, were evident. In addition, extensive damage to the outer and inner cell walls and to the plasma membranes was apparent, although the cells maintained their shape. On some areas of the cell surface, the outer cell wall and plasma membrane were completely absent, whereas at other locations the outer cell wall was either split away from the inner cell wall and plasma membrane or distended from an area free of inner cell wall and plasma membrane. Upon addition of <b>NaSCN</b> to the hen egg white lysozyme-treated cells, both the gelled protoplasmic masses and the damaged cells exhibited an exploded appearance and existed as membrane ghosts, cell wall fragments, or dense aggregates of cytoplasmic components. The effects of a low lysozyme concentration (22. 5 μg/ml) on S. mutans morphology were less pronounced at short incubation times (i. e., 10 and 30 min) than those that were observed with a high enzyme concentration; however, breaks in the cell walls and dissolution of the plasma membranes with resulting cell lysis were visible after a prolonged (3 -h) incubation and after subsequent addition of <b>NaSCN...</b>|$|E
