"Well, then, {{long before}} {{daylight}} I {{was up and}} off, feeling my way as best I could in the first grey glimpses of dawn, so that I got a good start--at least I thought so; but soon I found my pursuers had also started early and were overhauling me; and no wonder, seeing that their canoes were large and well manned. I now felt that I had no chance of escaping by water, but I had by that time got into {{a part of the}} country with which I was well acquainted, and knew that if I could only reach a certain point before being caught, I might take to the bush and cross overland to my friend's hut here. That was early this morning. The only trouble I had was that my wound was beginning to give me considerable pain, and I felt losing strength for want of food. I had scarce time to cat, much less to search for food, they pressed me so hard. However, a man makes a hard struggle for life, so I tightened my belt, and set to work with such good will, that I was soon a long way ahead of them, and got out of sight at a place where the river takes a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> and is full of small islands. At last, about noon, I reached the desired point, paddled carefully in among the reeds, so as to prevent the savages seeing where I had landed, jumped ashore, hid the canoe, stepped out as hard as I could, and--here I am." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Side {{emitting}} plastic {{optical fibers}} {{can be used}} in textile structures for some special optical activities due to the light leaking out from their surface. One significant characteristic of plastic optical fibers is their tendency to weaken side emitting capability under mechanical deformation, which can be simulated as repeated bending cycles under prescribed pretension. The principle of evaluation of flex fatigue was based on the repeated bending cycles until break. Q-Q plot and three-parameter Weibull distribution were used for estimation <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> cycles <b>of</b> plastic optical fibers with different diameters. The relationship between flex fatigue and flexibility were analyzed and compared with logarithmic values...|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{cable pulling}} methods are very {{sensitive}} to the condition of the duct and to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> and undulations throughout the duct route. Therefore, for microducts, Air-Blown (AB) cable installation techniques are expected to be the most useful. AB cable installation requires the use of a device that injects a high volume of air into the duct, at pressures as high as 20-25 psi. The viscous drag forces generated by the rushing air {{along the length of the}} cable act to reduce or overcome the friction between the cable and the duct.|$|E
50|$|Many graph drawing styles allow bends, {{but only}} in a limited way: the curve {{complexity}} of these drawings (the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> per edge) is bounded by some fixed constant. Allowing this constant to grow larger {{can be used to}} improve other aspects of the drawing, such as its area. Alternatively, in some cases, a drawing style may only be possible when bends are allowed; for instance, not every graph has a RAC drawing (a drawing with all crossings at right angles) with no bends, or with curve complexity two, but every graph has such a drawing with curve complexity three.|$|E
50|$|If an n-vertex graph has a RAC {{drawing with}} {{straight}} edges, {{it can have}} at most 4n − 10 edges. This is tight: there exist RAC-drawable graphs with exactly 4n − 10 edges. For drawings with polyline edges, the bound {{on the number of}} edges in the graph depends on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> that are allowed per edge. The graphs that have RAC drawings with one or two bends per edge have O(n) edges; more specifically, with one bend there are at most 6.5n edges and with two bends there are at most 74.2n edges. Every graph has a RAC drawing with three bends per edge.|$|E

The residual modulus is investigated during the flex fatigue processes. The results exhibit the exponential relationship between applied pretension and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> cycles at break. It is {{indicated that the}} flex fatigue of POFs might be sensitive with high swing angle or swing speed. There is an evident loss of modulus for two POFs with pretensions of 4 and 10 % of ultimate tensile strength during 10 -times bending cycles.

40|$|A new {{criterion}} for the optimum design of curved dielectric waveguides is proposed. The bends designed {{according to this}} model are named matched bends. In the matched bend, the suitable choice <b>of</b> both <b>bending</b> radius and bending angle reduces the total losses <b>of</b> the <b>bend</b> and avoids the leaky-mode excitation at the end <b>of</b> the <b>bend.</b> For a given angle, a discrete <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> radii that satisfy the matched bend criterion can be analytically determined. With respect to the lateral offset, matched bends are more robust to both fabrication tolerances and wavelength and can be realized in every technology. The reduction of the leaky-mode excitation at the output <b>of</b> the <b>bend</b> is a fundamental property when two or more components are cascaded. Ghost images in the spectral response, cross talk, and asymmetries of the transfer function are successfully reduced.

The results indicate that specimens in the hot rolled or cooled from the dual α + β phase regions have a higher shape recovery ratio than specimens cooled from the single phase β region with the maximum complete recovery strain reaching 1. 8 %. The shape recovery ratio decreases with increasing total deformation strain. Bending temperature within the experimental range has a small effect on the shape memory recovery ratios...|$|R
50|$|Wool crimp: The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> {{per unit}} length along the wool fibre {{approximately}} indicates spinning capacity of the wool. Fibres with a fine crimp have many bends and usually have a small diameter. Such fibre can be spun into fine yarns, with great lengths of yarn for a given weight of wool, and greater market value. Fine fibres may be utilised {{in the production of}} fine garments such as men's suits whereas the coarser fibres may be used for the production of carpet and other sturdy products. Crimp is measured in crimps per inch or crimps per centimetre. Average diameter or mean fibre diameter is measured in micrometres (microns). For generations, English wool-handlers categorized wool along the above lines estimating spinning capacity by eye and touch. This spread worldwide as the Bradford system.|$|E
5000|$|For st-planar graphs {{that are}} not transitively reduced, an {{equivalent}} transitively reduced graph may be obtained by subdividing each edge. However, a straight-line drawing of the resulting transitively reduced graph will form a drawing of the original graph in which some edges have bends, at the dummy vertices introduced by the subdivision. A planar dominance drawing is not necessarily an upward planar drawing, because some edges may be horizontal, but rotating it by 45° necessarily gives an upward planar drawing. [...] In a comparison with other methods for drawing directed acyclic graphs, the left-right algorithm (together with a planarization preprocessing step) was found to perform well {{in terms of the}} area of the drawings it produces, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends,</b> and the aspect ratio of the drawing, but less well in total edge length.|$|E
50|$|Indirect {{coupling}} {{means that a}} building is coupled with the earth by means of earth ducts. An earth duct is a buried tube that acts as avenue for supply air to travel through before entering the building. The supply air is cooled by conductive heat transfer between the tubes and surrounding soil. Therefore, earth ducts will not perform well {{as a source of}} cooling unless the soil temperature is lower than the desired room air temperature. Earth ducts typically require long tubes to cool the supply air to an appropriate temperature before entering the building. A fan is required to draw the air from the earth duct into the building. Some of the factors that affect the performance of an earth duct are: duct length, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends,</b> thickness of duct wall, depth of duct, diameter of the duct, and air velocity.|$|E

5000|$|Another way {{to rapidly}} produce steam is {{to feed the}} water under {{pressure}} into a tube or tubes surrounded by the combustion gases. The earliest example of this was developed by Goldsworthy Gurney in the late 1820s for use in steam road carriages. This boiler was ultra-compact and light in weight and this arrangement has since become the norm for marine and stationary applications. The tubes frequently have a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> and sometimes fins to maximize the surface area. This type of boiler is generally preferred in high pressure applications since the high pressure water/steam is contained within narrow pipes which can contain the pressure with a thinner wall. It can however be susceptible to damage by vibration in surface transport appliances. In a cast iron sectional boiler, sometimes called a [...] "pork chop boiler" [...] the water is contained inside cast iron sections. These sections are mechanically assembled on site to create the finished boiler.|$|E

A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> cycles, up to 500, 000 cycles, were imposed on the Ag nanowire electrodes with and without PEDOT:PSS overcoating layer. In situ resistance measurement during bending tests revealed that the Ag nanowire electrode with PEDOT:PSS overcoating layer was mechanically reliable, showing a 21. 9 % increase in resistance after 500, 000 cycles <b>of</b> <b>bending.</b> Scanning electron microscope images revealed that {{the failure of the}} Ag nanowire network occurred along with cracks initiated in the PEDOT:PSS layer, which resulted in the increase in resistance under bending.

Our study underscored that PEDOT:PSS is effective in protecting the Ag nanowires, while maintaining the high mechanical stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequencing}} of part set-ups, {{in the context}} of design verification or process planning activities for sheet metal bending operations, is a rather complex combinatorial problem. The verification of the feasibility and the acceptability <b>of</b> a single <b>bend</b> set-up requires CPU-time consuming operations, e. g. collision checking and a manipulation requirement analysis. For more complex parts, and thus increased <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>bends,</b> exhaustive search methods can therefore not be applied in a time-economic way. Although the identification of an optimal sequence may not always be possible, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> techniques can be applied to significantly downscale the problem size. Several complementary approaches have been worked out to proceed in identifying near-optimum feasible bend sequences. Constraint solving and branch-and-bound techniques are used to identify interesting potential solutions.
