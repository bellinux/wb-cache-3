50|$|The clip {{coordinate}} {{system is a}} homogeneous {{coordinate system}} in the graphics pipeline. In OpenGL, clip coordinates are positioned in the pipeline just after view coordinates and just before <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because the physical-device-based {{coordinates}} {{may not be}} portable {{from one}} device to another, a software abstraction layer known as <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates</b> is typically introduced for expressing viewports; it appears for example in the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) and later systems inspired from it.|$|R
5000|$|Objects are {{transformed}} via a projection transformation into clip coordinates, {{at which point}} it may be efficiently determined on an object-by-object basis which portions of the objects will be visible to the user. All coordinates may then be divided by the [...] component (the fourth component in homogeneous coordinates) in {{what is called the}} perspective division. This transformation puts the objects into <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The matrix used to {{transform}} the world coordinates into the light's viewing coordinates {{is the same as}} the one used to render the shadow map in the first step (under OpenGL this is the product of the modelview and projection matrices). This will produce a set of homogeneous coordinates that need a perspective division (see 3D projection) to become <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates,</b> in which each component (x, y, or z) falls between −1 and 1 (if it is visible from the light view). Many implementations (such as OpenGL and Direct3D) require an additional scale and bias matrix multiplication to map those −1 to 1 values to 0 to 1, which are more usual coordinates for depth map (texture map) lookup. This scaling can be done before the perspective division, and is easily folded into the previous transformation calculation by multiplying that matrix with the following: ...|$|R
50|$|The method unwraps {{the mesh}} {{of an object}} using a vertex shader, first calculating the {{lighting}} based on the original vertex coordinates. The vertices are then remapped using the UV texture coordinates as the screen position of the vertex, suitable transformed from the 1 range of texture coordinates to the 1 range of <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates.</b> By lighting the unwrapped mesh in this manner, we obtain a 2D image representing the lighting on the object, which can then be processed and reapplied to the model as a light map. To simulate diffusion, the light map texture can simply be blurred. Rendering the lighting to a lower-resolution texture in itself provides {{a certain amount of}} blurring. The amount of blurring required to accurately model subsurface scattering in skin is still under active research, but performing only a single blur poorly models the true effects. To emulate the wavelength dependent nature of diffusion, the samples used during the (Gaussian) blur can be weighted by channel. This is somewhat of an artistic process. For human skin, the broadest scattering is in red, then green, and blue has very little scattering.|$|R
40|$|The CORE System is a {{proposed}} standard for a device-independent graphics system. The {{concept of a}} device-independent system was first developed in 1977 by the Graphics Standards Planning Committee (GSPC) of ACM Siggraph and later refined in 1979 [1, 2]. The CORE System design has received favorable reviews and has been implemented by various vendors at several universities, and other computing facilities (e. g. [3, 7]). The main objectives of the CORE System are to provide uniformity, compatibility, and flexibility in graphics software. Three advantages that the CORE system provides over non-standard graphics systems are device independence, program portability, and functional completeness. A large number of different graphics hardware devices currently exist {{with a wide range}} of available functions. The CORE System provides device independence by shielding the applications programmer from specific hardware characteristics. The shielding is at the functional level: the device-independent (DI) system uses internal routines to convert the application programmer 2 ̆ 7 s functional commands to specific commands for the selected hardware device driver (DD). The progammer describes a graphical world to the CORE System in device-independent <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The programmer also specifies the viewport on the logical view surface (output device) where a picture segment is to be placed. As the CORE System becomes the accepted standard graphics package, program portability will become more feasible. Program portability means the ability to transport application programs between two sites without requiring structural modifications. The CORE System was designed for functional completeness so that any graphics function a programmer desires is either included within the system or can be easily built on top of CORE System routines...|$|R
40|$|We {{will have}} α, β, γ ∈ [0, 1] if {{and only if}} x is in the {{triangle}}. Intuitively, a triangle consists of all weighted averages of its vertices. We call (α, β, γ) the barycentric coordinates of x. This is a non-orthogonal coordinate system for the plane. (Of course, none of this works if the triangle is degenerate, i. e. if the vertices lie along a common line.) 2 Rasterization Now suppose you want to draw a triangle with vertices pi = (xi, yi), i ∈ { 0, 1, 2 } onto a canvas of discrete pixels. This is called triangle rasterization and can be accomplished in many ways; what follows is one conceptually simple algorithm for triangle rasterization. We assume that the pi are <b>normalized</b> <b>device</b> <b>coordinates</b> (NDC); that is, the canvas corresponds to the region [− 1, 1] × [− 1, 1]. This is what you get after applying all transformation matrices. First, identify a rectangular region on the canvas that contains all of the pixels in the triangle (excluding those that lie outside the canvas). This could be the whole canvas, but for efficiency we’d like to deal with fewer pixels. It’s not hard to calculate a tight bounding box for a triangle: simply calculate pixel coordinates for each vertex, and find the minimum/maximum for each axis, clipped to the canvas size. Once we’ve identified the bounding box, we loop over each pixel in the box. For each pixel, we first compute the corresponding NDC coordinates (x, y). Next we convert these into barycentric coordinates for the triangle being drawn. To do this, let fab(x, y) def = (ya − yb) x + (xb − xa) y + xayb − xbya 1 for a, b ∈ { 0, 1, 2 }. We then have α = f 12 (x, y) f 12 (x 0, y 0) β = f 20 (x, y) f 20 (x 1, y 1) γ = f 01 (x, y) f 01 (x 2, y 2) You will probably want to compute the denominators here outside the loop. Also, watch out for divide-by-zero errors; these indicate a degenerate triangle which you can throw out entirely. Once we have (α, β, γ) we can check if all of α, β, γ lie in [0, 1]. If not, the current pixel is outside the triangle and we’re done with this loop iteration. Otherwise, we draw the pixel. ...|$|R

40|$|In growing {{bacterial}} cells, {{the global}} reorganization of transcription {{is associated with}} alterations of RNA polymerase composition and the superhelical density of the DNA.

We thus demonstrate a tight coupling between polymerase holoenzyme composition and the supercoiling regimen of genomic transcription. Accordingly, we identify functional clusters of genes with distinct σ factor and supercoiling preferences arranging alternative transcription programs sustaining bacterial exponential growth.

Then, we combine related rotation matrix to project the accelerations at local <b>device</b> <b>coordinate</b> system (DCS) into the global coordinate system (GCS). Finally, the global walking direction may be extracted by PCA over horizontal accelerations. Due to gyro and acceleration drifts, the accuracy performance of user heading estimation and positioning may degrade rapidly over a relatively short period.|$|R
