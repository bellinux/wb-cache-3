40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of nucleot(s) ide analogues (NAs) for oral antiviral therapy has dramatically improved the clinical outcome {{of patients with}} chronic hepatitis B. <b>NAs</b> appear to <b>be</b> safe and induce potent suppression of viral replication.

In the absence of hormones, the Mg dose-activation curves were monophasic, whereas {{in the presence of}} hormones a clear hetero-geneity was revealed. Therefore, inhibitory hormones induced a right-hand shift in the Mg dose-activation curve. This hormonal effect was concentration-dependent. In hu-man platelets, the inhibition of prostaglandin E 1 -stimulated adenylate cyclase by norep-inephrine was also due to a decrease in the apparent affinity for In anterior pituitary gland, when Mg was substituted by Mn 2, similar results were obtained. Thus, dopamine produced its inhibition by decreasing the apparent affinity for Mn 2 both under basal and vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated conditions. At Mg or Mn 2 concentrations high enough to obtain saturation of the low apparent affinity state, hormone-induced inhibition was not observed.

40|$|Abstract. Nicotinic acid (NA), {{a member}} of the vitamin B family, is well known for its {{functions}} in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis due to decreasing plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In recent years, the major side effect of NA, cutaneous flushing, has also attracted extensive attention. However, the effects of NA in other aspects of physiology or cell biology have remained elusive. The present study provided evidence that high concentrations of <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to first reduce and later elevate intracellular [Ca 2 +] in the NIH 3 T 3 cell line. The reduction of the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration was achieved within the initial 10 sec, and was preceded by a gradual elevation of intracellular [Ca 2 +]. Notably, marked accumulation of opaque materials in the perinuclear region was observed in NIH 3 T 3 cells treated with 70 mM NA. Further analysis revealed that treat-ment with 70 mM NA for 1 h disassembled the microtubule and F-actin cytoskeleton systems and resulted in β-tubulin degrada-tion in an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. These data indicated that high concentrations of NA disrupted cytoskeleton structures, which may have contributed to minus end (nucleus region) to plus end (cell membrane region) -directed transport processes and resulted in the deposition of material in the peri-nuclear region. Artificially increasing [Ca 2 +] adding CaCl 2 to the culture media effected the disassembly of F-actin, while it had no apparent effect on microtubules. These results suggested that the disruption of the cytoskeleton systems was not entirely due to the NA-induced elevation of [Ca 2 +]. Finally, microinjection of NA into xenopus embryos blocked the transport of melano-somes to the peripheral cellular area. In conclusion, the present study indicated that NA disassembles F-actin and microtubule systems, thereby blocking cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular transport...|$|R

This protection was recently shown to be mediated by CD 4 + T cells and to be critically dependent on the cysteines and amino acids 193 and 194 (H. Plotnicky-Gilquin, A. Robert, L. Chevalet, J. -F.

On G 2 Na, we identified a domain (amino acid residues 182 to 198) responsible for the T-helper-cell activity. This region coincided with a peptide designed AICK (residues 184 to 198) which includes the previously identified murine and human T-helper-cell epitope on the native G protein (P. W. Tebbey, M. Hagen, and G. E. Hancock, J. Exp. Med. 188 : 1967 - 1972, 1998). Immunization with AICK, in alum or complete Freund's adjuvant, significantly reduced nasal RSV titers in normal BALB/c mice.

Former studies showed that nicotinic acid (NA) lowered plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations and increased insulin sensitivity in dairy cows. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether the expression of proteins involved in hepatic and adipose insulin signaling and protein expression of hepatic glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2) were affected by dietary NA and dietary concentrate intake in periparturient dairy cows. Twenty pluriparous German Holstein cows were fed with the same diet from about 21 days before the expected calving date (d- 21) to calving. After calving, cows were randomly assigned in 4 groups and fed with diets different in concentrate proportion ("HC" with 60 : 40 % or "LC" with 30 : 70 % concentrate-to-roughage ratio) and supplemented with NA (24 g/day) (NA) or without (CON) until d 21. Biopsy samples were taken from the liver, subcutaneous (SCAT) and retroperitoneal (RPAT) adipose tissues at d- 21 and d 21. Protein expression of insulin signaling molecules (insulin receptor (INSR), phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ)) and hepatic GLUT 2 was measured by Western Blotting. The ratio of protein expression at d 21 /at d- 21 was calculated and statistically evaluated for the effects of time and diet. Cows in HC had significantly higher dietary energy intake than cows in LC. In RPAT a decrease in PI 3 K and PKCζ expression was found in all groups, irrespectively of diet. In the liver, the GLUT 2 expression was significantly lower in cows in NA compared with cows in CON. In conclusion, insulin signaling might be decreased in RPAT over time without any effect of diet. <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to modulate hepatic GLUT 2 expression, but its physiological role is unclear...|$|R

In previous {{studies in which}} HA mutants lacking either one (mutants G 1 and G 2) or both (mutant G 1, 2) glycosylation sites had been expressed from a simian virus 40 vector, we showed that these glycans regulate receptor binding affinity (M. Ohuchi, R. Ohuchi, A. Feldmann, and H. D. Klenk, J. Virol. 71 : 8377 – 8384, 1997). We have now investigated {{the effect of these}} mutations on virus growth using recombinant viruses generated by an RNA polymerase I-based reverse genetics system. Two reassortants of influenza virus strain A/WSN/ 33 were used as helper viruses to obtain two series of HA mutant viruses differing only in the neuraminidase (NA). Studies using N 1 NA viruses revealed that loss of the oligosaccharide from Asn 149 (mutant G 2) or loss of both oligosaccharides (mutant G 1, 2) has a pronounced effect on virus growth in MDCK cells. Growth of virus lacking both oligosaccharides from infected cells was retarded, and virus yields in the medium were decreased about 20 -fold. Likewise, there was a reduction in plaque size that was distinct with G 1, 2 and less pronounced with G 2. These effects could be attributed to a highly impaired release of mutant progeny viruses from host cells. In contrast, with recombinant viruses containing N 2 <b>NA,</b> these restrictions <b>were</b> much less apparent. N 1 recombinants showed lower neuraminidase activity than N 2 recombinants, indicating that N 2 <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to partly overrule the high-affinity binding of mutant HA to the receptor. These results demonstrate that N-glycans flanking the receptor-binding site of the HA molecule are potent regulators of influenza virus growth, with the glycan at Asn 149 being dominant and that at Asn 123 being less effective. In addition, we show here that HA and NA activities need to be highly balanced in order to allow productive influenza virus infection...|$|R

Like some previous methods the algorithm uses randomised, or stochastic, sampling of a four-dimensional hypocentral parameter space, to search for solutions with acceptable data fit. Considerable ¯exibility is allowed {{in the choice of}} misfit measure. At each stage the hypocentral parameter space is partitioned into a series of convex polygons called Voronoi cells. Each cell surrounds a previously generated hypocentre for which the fit to the data has been determined. As the algorithm proceeds new hypocentres are randomly generated in the neighbourhood of those hypocentres with smaller data misfit. In this way all previous hypocentres guide the search, and the more promising regions of parameter space are preferentially sampled. The NA procedure makes use of just two tuning parameters. It is possible to choose their values so that the behaviour of the algorithm {{is similar to that of}} a contracting irregular grid in 4 -D.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hemagglutinin}} (HA) {{of influenza}} viruses initiates infection by binding to sialic acid {{on the cell}} surface via α 2, 6 (human) or α 2, 3 (avian) linkage. The influenza neuraminidase (NA) can cleave both α 2, 3 - and α 2, 6 -linked sialic acids, but all influenza NAs have a marked preference for the non-human α 2, 3 linkage. Recent H 3 N 2 influenza viruses have {{lost the ability to}} agglutinate chicken red blood cells. To determine if changes in HA specificity or affinity correlate with NA specificity or activity, we examined red cell binding and elution of a series of H 3 N 2 viruses. We found that the NA activity of many influenza viruses does not release binding by their HA. In some egg-adapted strains, lack of elution correlates with low levels of viral NA activity, and these elute rapidly when bacterial <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> added. However, a Fujian-like virus, A/Oklahoma/ 323 / 03, does not elute by its own NA or with Vibrio cholerae sialidase, and it binds to red cells pre-treated with V. cholerae sialidase. It elutes after addition of the broad specificity Micromonospora viridifaciens sialidase. Human glycophorin inhibits A/Oklahoma/ 323 / 03 hemagglutination 6 -fold better than fetuin. We conclude that specific forms of sialic acid are used as receptor by recent human H 3 N 2 influenza viruses, perhaps involving branched α 2, 6 sialic acid or α 2, 8 sialic acid structures on O-linked carbohydrates. The virus itself has no O-linked glycans, so even though the <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> not <b>able</b> to cleave receptors on cells, the viruses will not self-aggregate.

40|$|Disruptive Technologies have {{developed}} a low power IoT chip. To further improve their chip, the task of developing a low power occupancy sensor was given. There are several commercially available motion detectors on the marked, but real occupancy sensors, with the possibility to detect presence and not only movement, is not in widespread use. To <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to detect presence two possible technologies are in focus in this thesis, ultrasound and radar. The main goal of the thesis, has been to show if {{it is possible to}} design a occupancy sensor, within the objectives given by Disruptive, the main objective is a average power consumption of 450 <b>nA.</b> To <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to achieve this requirement it was chosen to focus on ultrasound technology and look closer at a possible COTS transducer. There were made no test with the selected transducer, but calculations on the power consumption where made. These calculations showed, that it is not reasonable to assume that the selected transducer, could be made to comply with the stringent power requirements. To further make this case, test where performed with a secondary ultrasound transducer to demonstrate some of the issues with employing ultrasound, in a low power system. It was shown that ultrasound are prone to large propagation losses, giving it a range shorter than wanted. Based on the research done in this thesis {{it is not possible to}} make any final conclusion on the possibilities to use ultrasound in a low power occupancy system. It is however shown that ultrasound has some challenges not present with the use of radar. These challenges are connected to wave propagation, where ultrasound have a greater propagation loss compared to radio and to much time is spent listening and processing the echo signal with the use of ultrasound. For further research into the field of low power occupancy sensing, radar is therefore recommended, rather than ultrasound...|$|R

A lens with a larger numerical aperture will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to visualize finer details than a lens with a smaller numerical aperture. Assuming quality (diffraction-limited) optics, lenses with larger numerical apertures collect more light and will generally provide a brighter image, but will provide shallower depth of field.|$|R
40|$|We re-investigated the {{properties}} of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 4 D 11, to human growth hormone (hGH) that showed a very weak affinity, recognizing hGH only when the hormone was solubilized on a solid surface. MAb 4 D 11 did not significantly bind 125 I-hGH. It was found that three mAb directed to different hGH epitopes (mAb 3 C 11, 10 C 1 and <b>NA</b> 71) <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to induce the binding of the soluble antigen to mAb 4 D 11. The co-operative effect could be demonstrated by the formation of binary complexes (Ag:Ab, 1 : 2) detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and by the increase of radioactivity found when the synergistic mAb were added to 125 I-hGH incubated with mAb 4 D 11 immobilized on polyvinyl microplates. Other possible explanations, such as the formation of cyclic complexes or the generation of a new epitope in the Fc fragment of the first antibody (Ab), were dismissed because the Fab fragment {{of one of the}} enhancing mAb (3 C 11) gave the same effect as the intact Ab. The data suggest that the hGH molecule undergoes a localized conformational change after binding to mAb 3 C 11, NA 71 or 10 C 1 and that mAb 4 D 11 binds with high affinity to the modified region of the hormone. The formation or not of ternary complexes (Ag:Ab, 1 : 3) was used to localize the 4 D 11 epitope {{on the surface of the}} Ag. It is suggested that mAb 4 D 11 recognizes a conformational change produced in the region defined by the AE 5 /AC 8 epitopes, which is close to the hGH antigenic domain only expressed when the protein is immobilized on plastic surfaces...|$|R
