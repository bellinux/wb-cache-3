40|$|Incremental damage {{assessment}} {{is a tool}} {{used to assess the}} justification for expensive modifications of inadequate dams. The input data to incremental {{damage assessment}} are the output from the breach analysis and flood routing. For this reason, flood routing should be conducted carefully. Distorted results from the flood routing technique or unstable modeling of the problem will distort the results of an incremental damage assessment, because an error in the estimated incremental stage will cause a certain error in the estimated incremental damages. The objectives of this study were (1) to perform a comprehensive survey of the available dam break flood-routing techniques, (2) to evaluate the performance of commonly used flood-routing techniques for predicting failure and no-failure stage, incremental stage, average velocities, and travel times, and (3) to develop a set of recommendations upon which future applications of dam break models can be based. Flood-routing techniques that are evaluated cover dynamic routing as contained in DAMBRK, and kinematic, Muskingum-Cunge, and <b>normal</b> depth <b>storage</b> routing as contained in the Hydrological Engineering Center (HEC 1). These techniques were evaluated against the more accurate two-dimensional flood-routing technique contained in the diffusion hydrodynamic model (DHM). Results and errors from different techniques for different downstream conditions were calculated and conclusions were drawn. The effect of the errors on the incremental stage and the errors in the incremental stage were estimated. Overall, the performance of one-dimensional techniques in predicting peak stages, and assessing a two-feet criterion showed that DAMBRK did best, and <b>normal</b> depth <b>storage</b> and outflow did worst. This overall ranking matches the degree of simplification in representing the true flood-routing situation. However, in some circumstances DAMBRK performed worst, and <b>normal</b> depth <b>storage</b> and outflow outperformed either the Muskingum-Cunge or kinematic techniques. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} the specific performance characteristics of all the methods when selecting one for a flood-routing application...|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{increase}} of safety requirements with respect to storage of LPG over the last ten years, underground storage is becoming increasingly significant. Storage is possible in engineering geological and in civil engineering constructions. The main features of these two solutions are presented. LPG can be stored either pressurized or refrigerated. This report concerns the pressurized storage in a civil construction. In mounded storage a horizontal cylindrical steel vessel is covered with sand. The <b>normal</b> mounded <b>storage</b> has some disadvantages which can be solved by partly submerging the vessel in the groundwater. This mode of storage is called mounded storage with a floating foundation. It is expected that using this method the differential settlements of the vessel will be smaller. Also {{the height of the}} mound will be smaller. A layer of sand on top of the vessel will prevent it from floating up. For some various sizes and shapes of the vessel the required thickness of this layer is calculated. In this report {{on the basis of a}} few criteria for the depth of the excavation and the length of the vessel the best alternative is chosen. For the chosen vessel the wall thicknesses are calculated and checked following the British Standard Specification for fusion-welded pressure vessels (BS 5500). A partly submerged vessel needs a coating and a cathodic protection system to prevent it from corroding. Exact the same coating and cathodic protection used for the <b>normal</b> mounded <b>storage,</b> can be used for the mounded storage with a floating foundation. The vessels will be shop-built in a tent close to their foundation. The foundation will be built in a dry excavation. With cranes the vessels will be put on their foundation. When the vessel is partly submerged the potential longitudinal bending moment in the vessel will be less. The differential settlement will be smaller but this does not effect the wall thicknesses since the dry situation is mandatory for the calculation of these sizes. The mounded storage with a floating foundation will be less expensive than storage in spheres, but more expensive than the <b>normal</b> mounded <b>storage.</b> However, other reasons than cost could perhaps make the mounded storage with a floating foundation a preferable storage method.
