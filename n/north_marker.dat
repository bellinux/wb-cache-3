50|$|Spain's Morisco {{population}} {{was the last}} population who self-identified and traced its roots to the various waves of Muslim conquerors from North Africa. Modern population genetics generally assume Moriscos to have had both significant Iberian and North African ancestry, even if, after centuries of presence and intermarriage in the Iberian peninsula they were unlikely to differ significantly in ethnic terms from the wider Spanish population. For this reason, studies in population genetics which aim to ascertain Morisco ancestry in modern populations search for Iberian or European genetic markers among contemporary Morisco descendants in North Africa, and for <b>North</b> African genetic <b>markers</b> among modern day Spaniards.A wide number of recent genetic studies of modern-day Spanish and Portuguese populations have ascertained an unusually high level of North African admixture {{as compared to the}} rest of the European continent, which is generally attributed to Islamic rule and settlement of the Iberian peninsula. Common <b>North</b> African genetic <b>markers</b> which are relatively high frequencies in the Iberian peninsula as compared {{to the rest of the}} European continent are Y-chromosome E1b1b1b1(E-M81) and MtDna Haplogroups L and U6. Studies coincide that North African admixture tends to increase in the South and West of the peninsula, peaking in parts of Andalusia, Extremadura and North West Castile. Distribution of <b>North</b> African <b>markers</b> are largely absent from the northeast of Spain as well as the Basque country. The uneven distribution of admixture in Spain has been explained by the extent and intensity of Islamic colonization in a given area, but also by the varying levels of success in attempting to expel the Moriscos in different regions of Spain , as well as forced and voluntary morisco population movements during the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|R

50|$|A {{small part}} of I-65 was the first interstate Highway opened to traffic in Tennessee. A 1.8 mi section near the Alabama-Tennessee state line opened on November 15, 1958. The McDowell and McDowell Construction company had started work on the {{interchange}} in May 1957. Until 2000, the 2 mi northern leg of the loop in Nashville was designated as Interstate 265. On April 7, 2000, the I-265 designation vanished, and I-65 itself was re-routed from the southern and {{eastern half of the}} loop (where it traveled concurrently with I-24/I-40) to the western and northern half of the loop (where it travels concurrently with I-40 only on the western side, and has the northern stretch to itself). Nashville-Davidson County's city/county government had argued to have the designations changed in order to help alleviate traffic congestion caused by motorists' following I-65 through {{the main body of the}} city. Because of this, the new I-65 route is approximately 1 mi longer than the previous route. Mile <b>markers</b> <b>north</b> of Nashville were not changed with the reroute, so they do not accurately represent the length of I-65 in Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|A {{section of}} the pre-statehood wagon road, the Old Camden Trail, was a highly {{traveled}} road throughout the nineteenth century that connected Little Rock and Camden.

It is still marked on current maps in the town and has a historical <b>marker</b> <b>north</b> of Prattsville in the pioneer Village of Belfast, unfortunately the historic road has been gated and access to the marker blocked. During the Civil War, as part of Gen. Frederick Steele's Camden expedition, part of the larger Red River Campaign, attempted to cross the Saline River at Pratt's Ferry with his troops to get his nearly supply-less Union Army back to Little Rock along the Old Camden Road, however the water there was too high, and Gen. Steele and his troops turned south to cross at Jenkins Ferry, where his Union Army were engaged by Confederate Troops in what is called the Battle of Jenkins Ferry. Gen. Steele's Camden expedition cost the Union army countless men and badly needed supplies. Gen. Steele and the Union Army escaped and made a retreat back to Little Rock along the Old Camden Trail.|$|R
50|$|Humans {{who deal}} with the species caught in mist nets are called banders in the United States. Banders are {{responsible}} for banding the species caught in the net {{so they can be}} tracked. In the United States, in order to band a bird or bat, one must have a banding permit. Banding permits are given to people who have gone through training and whose projects contribute to the conservation and management of the bird population. Banders are responsible for the animals caught and thus apply their training by paying attention to stress cues (for birds these include panting, tiredness, closing of eyes, and raising of feathers). If not, the animal can severely injure itself. There are different types of banding permits for birds, the Master Permit and the Sub permit. Master Permits are given to individuals who band on their own or who supervise banding operations. Sub permits are given to individuals who will be supervised while banding by a person with a Master Permit. In order to receive a permit, one must fill out an application and return it to the nearest banding office. Banders must ask for special authorization in their application in order to use mist nets, cannon nets, chemicals, or auxiliary <b>markers</b> (<b>North</b> American Bander’s Study Guide 6).|$|R

50|$|Fiske was apprenticed to Stephen T. Fansler, {{the post}} {{photographer}} at Fort Yates. When Fansler abandoned the studio in 1900, Fiske took over, aged 17, following into {{the footsteps of}} his illustrious predecessors, the legendary photographers Orlando Scott Goff and David Francis Barry. He continued to operate his studio, primarily at Fort Yates, {{until his death in}} 1952. Around the same time {{at the turn of the}} century, Frank’s parents moved to a ranch near Fort Rice. Having grown up among the Lakota people of Standing Rock Indian Reservation Frank developed a great interest and admiration about the Sioux nation, their history and culture documenting many aspects of their lives through his photography. He was fascinated listening to the stories of the old warriors. In 1917 he published his first book “The Taming of the Sioux”. In 1918 Fiske enlisted in the army and briefly served in World War I, albeit he was not sent overseas. The following year, on his birthday he married Angela Cournoyer, a direct descendant of chief Forked Horn and fur trader Joseph Picotte. In 1921, their only daughter Francine was born. In 1933 Fiske published his second book, “Life and Death of Sitting Bull”. Among Fiske's photographs is one of Red Tomahawk, Sitting Bull’s assassin, which later was reproduced and now is on <b>North</b> Dakota highway <b>markers.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{understanding}} of population {{relationships in the}} Mediterranean region {{is crucial to the}} reconstruction of recent human evolution. Andalusia, the most southern region of Spain, has been continuously and densely occupied since ancient times and has a rich history of contacts with many different Mediterranean populations. Thus, to understand the Mediterranean peopling process, investigators should analyze the population relationships between the Iberian peninsula and northern Africa based on an assessment of genetic diversity that takes Andalusia into consideration. The aim {{of this study was to}} address the extent of genetic variation in the Iberian peninsula between its geographic extremes (Huelva and the Basque area) and to explain the intensity of the phylogenetic relationships between Andalusians and other neighboring populations, such as those from North Africa. We present, for the first time, results on allotype markers (GM and KM) of human immunoglobulins in the Andalusian population from Huelva. The most frequent GM haplotypes in Andalusia correspond to those that are also the most common in Europe. A sub-Saharan haplotype was found at a relatively high frequency compared to other Iberian samples, and a <b>North</b> Asian <b>marker</b> did not reach polymorphic frequencies in the study sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the first two principal components (94. 1 % of the total genetic variance) revealed an interesting geographic structure for the 49 populations selected from the literature. The Huelva sample showed a central position in the multivariate space [...] despite being geographically located at one of the extremes of the Mediterranean basin [...] and clustered with most Western European populations. Western Europe and Eastern Europe (the latter group paradoxically including Italy and the major islands of the western Mediterranean) were differentiated. North African populations were grouped in two clusters that did not separate either Arabs and Berbers or their present-day countries. Analysis of immunoglobulin allotype markers shows that gene flow among human populations should generally be interpreted in terms of complex patterns, with the observed frequencies being the consequence of the entire genetic and demographic history of the population. Single historical events rarely determine gene frequencies in large human populations. Analysis of the GM system has shown that the Andalusian population from Huelva, as a result of its complex history, is not simply an outstanding part of the Mediterranean world but rather the genetic center of gravity of that world...|$|R
