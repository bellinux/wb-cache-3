Theoretical {{modeling}} of thermodynamic performance {{plays an important}} role in the design and development of pulse tube cryocoolers. In the present work, a thermodynamic model of a GMtype double-inlet pulse tube cryocooler has been developed. It includes calculation of ideal refrigeration power, various losses, and hence <b>net</b> <b>refrigeration</b> power. An experimental setup was designed and fabricated to carry out experimental investigations on the GM-type double-inlet pulse tube cryocooler. Experiments were conducted, and the results obtained were used for comparison with the isothermal model developed in the present work.

The introduction of new technologies in the post-World War II era significantly affected the entire notion of an elite, as developments such as nylon fishing <b>nets,</b> <b>refrigeration</b> and motorisation made fishing more lucrative as an occupation in its own right and removed the economic differences between those who laboured and those who either traded or lived off the organisation of labour.

First, the expansion valve usually doesn’t work properly if injecting a gas-liquid mixture such as refrigerant with flash-gas presence.

40|$|We {{discuss in}} this paper the {{development}} of a mixed-refrigerant Joule-Thomson microcryocooler (MCC) to support on-chip cooling of high temperature superconducting electronics that require less than 5 mW of <b>net</b> <b>refrigeration</b> at about 80 K. Some applications include the cooling of infrared and terahertz imaging sensors that operate at about 77 K. Terahertz sensors can be used for the imaging of concealed nonmetallic weapons as well as the spectroscopic identification of chemical and biological material. The MCC is designed to deliver approximately 9 mW gross refrigeration, which yields about 3 mW of <b>net</b> <b>refrigeration</b> once losses due to the heat exchanger, conduction, radiation, and pressure drop are subtracted. The cryocooler utilizes a multicom-ponent gas mixture that is precooled to 240 K by a thermoelectric cooler. Precooling the gas mixture signifi-cantly increases the minimum isothermal enthalpy difference, which is the gross refrigeration power per unit flow. For a pressure ratio of 16 : 1 this enthalpy difference is about 1. 43 kJ/mol for the mixed refrigerant compared with 0. 15 kJ/mol for pure nitrogen. The MCC has been designed to operate at pressure ratios of 16 : 1 to 25 : 1 for a flow rate of about 6 mmol/s (~ 0. 15 std. cm 3 /s) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the partial {{substitution}} of Mn by Co on the magnetic, magnetoelastic, and magnetocaloric properties of Ni 50 Mn 35 In 15 Heusler alloys were studied using x-ray diffraction, temperature and field dependences of the magnetization [M(T,H) ], and strain gauge techniques. It was observed {{that the presence of}} ~ 3 % Co atoms in Mn sites strongly affected the magnetic and magnetoelastic behaviors of Ni 50 Mn 35 In 15. At H= 5 T, a maximum magnetoelastic strain of ~ 0. 6 % was observed for Ni 50 Mn 35 In 15.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, fabrication, and characterization of several coldstages intended {{to investigate the}} feasibility of a low pressure ratio three stage cascaded Joule-Thomson (JT) based cryogenic cooler. The coldstages investigated use single component refrigerants operating at pressure ratios of less than 0. 5 : 0. 1 MPa. Low pressure ratio single component refrigerants offer {{an order of magnitude}} higher specific refrigeration capacity but a narrower temperature range of cooling when compared to mixed refrigerants. Cryogenic temperatures can be reached by cascading several self-contained JT refrigeration cycles. A micro-fabricated polyimide based single stage coldstage is built using micro-fabrication techniques developed in previous works. Several processing challenges are identified and recommended solutions and best practices are implemented. Control of the JT restriction is difficult as the polyimide micro-channels expand under high internal pressure. The coldstage is run in a high pressure environment to press the JT restriction into the correct geometry and cools to 280 K. To better control the JT restriction, a glass capillary based coldstage design is identified. The coldstage uses a glass capillary to form the JT restriction. The coldstage cools to 267 K and 283 K when run in a vacuum environment and atmosphere respectively as calculated. The coldstage is integrated with a mini-compressor and intermittently cools to 288 K in atmosphere. The glass capillary design is further developed to make a two stage cascaded coldstage with a Kapton tube-in-tube inter-stage heat exchanger. The coldstage cools to 228 K with a <b>net</b> <b>refrigeration</b> power of 150 mW. A three stage coldstage is demonstrated using the same design. The coldstage cools to 193 K with <b>net</b> <b>refrigeration</b> power of 15 mW. The coldstages presented demonstrate the feasibility of low pressure ratio cascaded JT cryogenic coolers. The efficiencies of the coldstages are low because of large natural heat leak into the systems and inefficiencies of the inter-stage heat exchangers. Future work can improve efficiencies through design optimization of the inter-stage heat exchangers and implementation of more significant thermal insulation. An in-depth review of micro-fabrication techniques based on mechanical design, thermal design, and quality and ease of fabrication is needed for future scalability...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} in this paper is a second law analysis of a Stirling cryocooler. A one-dimensional model is proposed for the simulation of the gas flow in the expansion space, the regenerator, the warm-end, the compression space and the compressor. Helium gas is selected as the working medium. An algorithm has been developed considering parametrically the most from the main operational tasks of the thermodynamic cycle. Performance indices such as heat input, efficiency, external dimensions of the engine and technical requirements are taken into account as constraints. Engine operating parameters i. e. speed, external temperature, mean pressure are fixed. The regenerator loss has a critical influence on the cryocooler efficiency and the reduction of this kind of internal irreversibilities is extremely difficult due to the generator is subject to rapidly cycling flows accompanied by steep temperature gradients and large pressure variations. The second flow analysis of the regenerator identifies two principal losses, the irreversible internal heat transfer into the solid matrix and the hydraulic resistance. An optimization technique leads to entropy generation charts, extremely useful for a good design of the regenerator. Finally the main thermodynamic characteristics (<b>net</b> <b>refrigeration,</b> power input and the coefficient of performance) of the cryocooler are given both cases with and without external and internal irreversibilities...|$|E

Regenerator designs which produce the maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of the system is considered as an optimized regenerator. The length and diameter of the regenerator were fixed from the cooler system requirements. Single mesh regenerators made of 200, 250, 300, 400 and 450 Stainless Steel wire meshes were considered and the optimum phase angle and mesh size were obtained. A maximum COP of 0. 1475 was obtained for 300 mesh regenerator at 70 ° phase angle. Then multi mesh regenerators were considered with finer mesh on the cold end and coarser mesh on the hot end. The optimum size and length of each mesh in the multi mesh regenerator and the optimum phase angle were calculated.

The J-T microcryocooler supports on-chip cooling applications, such as terahertz and infrared imaging sen-sors operating at about 77 K that require less than 5 mW of <b>net</b> <b>refrigeration.</b> The high pressure ratio of the compressor is enabled by minimizing dead volume and using a 10 mm diameter metal-ized polyamide membrane 500 μm thick that is actuated by a lead zirconium titanate piezoelectric (PZT) stack. With a stroke of about 28 μm and a swept volume of about 2 mm 3, the design flow rate could be achieved with a drive frequency of about 100 Hz. The entire microcryocooler, compressor module, sensor, and thermal integration module are expected to occupy less than 10 cm 3 volume. At present the compressor module demonstrates a pressure ratio of 21 : 1 when blanked off and has a volume less than 2 cm 3. Numerous design iterations to achieve the 21 : 1 ratio, studies comparing stroke and volume vs. frequency to achieve design flow rates, and measured power consumption as a function of drive frequency are discussed.
