40|$|Abstract- The {{insertion}} loss (IL) {{is regarded as}} the best interference suppression characteristic of power filters or suppression components. The IL definitions are considered and as an alternative the paper suggests the use of <b>network</b> <b>parameters.</b> It is a known fact that the standard IL measurements do not provide reliable information about the operational performance of a suppressor. This is largely due to the source and load mismatch, which is typical in power lines. Arguments are presented, showing that <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> allow for more complete and reliable characterization of power filters and components. The IL would not be abandoned, because the <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> provide enough information to obtain not only the standard IL, but also the IL in a non 50 Ω system. A new treatment of “worst case ” or minimum IL is proposed, which is also based on <b>network</b> <b>parameters.</b> Furthermore, input, output, or transfer impedances, simulation models, and other characteristics, can be obtained from the <b>network</b> <b>parameters,</b> but not from the currently published standard IL data...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{efficiency}} of Weighted Least Squares (WLS) State Estimation changes according to both the uncertainty of <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> and the uncertainty of measurements. Performance of State Estimator based mainly on the accuracy of its inputs {{and it is very}} important for the power system planners to improve the state estimation by determining whether to invest on increasing the measurement preciseness or improve the power network model. For this purpose, an algorithm for simulation of the uncertainty effects on the state estimator is proposed and tested on IEEE 14 -Bus power network test case. The implementation of this algorithm enables us to analyze how much the state estimator's output is affected according to the <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> uncertainty by means of state errors distribution versus the <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> uncertainty. On the other hand, a serious defect in an estimator is the lack of unbiasedness. Hence a new prominent analysis is performed to find how <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> uncertainty can affect the state estimator's bias by using distribution of the ratio between the absolute value of state errors mean and the related standard deviations versus the <b>network</b> <b>parameters</b> uncertainty and comparing it with a predefined threshold. Moreover, this analysis is also performed considering correlation in the <b>network</b> <b>parameters,</b> to investigate the effect of parameters correlation on the state estimator...|$|R

50|$|Once {{a set of}} geometrically {{independent}} variables have been chosen {{the state of the}} network is expressed in terms of these.

This set of equations can be expressed in a matrix format which leads to a characteristic parameter matrix for the <b>network.</b> <b>Parameter</b> matrices take the form of an impedance matrix if the equations have been formed on a loop-analysis basis, or as an admittance matrix if the equations have been formed on a node-analysis basis.|$|E
50|$|ATM uses {{connection}} oriented virtual channels (VCs) which have fully deterministic paths through the network, and usage and <b>network</b> <b>parameter</b> control (UPC/NPC), which are implemented within the network, {{to limit the}} traffic on each VC separately. This allows the usage of the shared resources (switch buffers) in the network to be calculated from {{the parameters of the}} traffic to be carried in advance, i.e. at system design time. That they are implemented by the network means that these calculations remain valid even when other users of the network behave in unexpected ways, i.e. transmit more data than they are expected to. The calculated usages can then be compared with the capacities of these resources to show that, given the constraints on the routes and the bandwidths of these connections, the resource used for these transfers will never be over-subscribed. These transfers will therefore never be affected by congestion {{and there will be no}} losses due to this effect. Then, from the predicted maximum usages of the switch buffers, the maximum delay through the network can also be predicted. However, for the reliability and timeliness to be proved, and for the proofs to be tolerant of faults in and malicious actions by the equipment connected to the network, the calculations of these resource usages cannot be based on any parameters that are not actively enforced by the network, i.e. they cannot be based on what the sources of the traffic are expected to do or on statistical analyses of the traffic characteristics (see network calculus).|$|E
