40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the little explored phenomenon of subtitling of live theatre broadcasts. Its aim is to describe the subtitling practice and the outer process of the translation, to determine the translation norms applied in this domain and to monitor reception of the final product. The descriptive thesis explores the translation practice of the <b>NT</b> <b>Live</b> series, which <b>is</b> one of a kind in the Czech Republic. Several case studies help to explore the reception and translation norms. The research makes use of both qualitative methods, such as semi- structured interview and comparative translation analysis, and quantitative methods, such as standardized questionnaire. The results are interpreted with regard to theoretical findings of translation studies in areas related to the subtitling of live theatre broadcasts. The thesis concludes that the client's requirements are minimal and the norms are gradually established by the subtitlers themselves, or adopted from television subtitling practice. Although the live cuing of the subtitles is an inseparable part of the translation process, there is little cooperation between the subtitlers and those who cue subtitles during the broadcast. Concerning reception, the audience is rather satisfied with the subtitles, but it could be advisable to revise [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The UK has {{in recent}} years {{undergone}} a digital revolution. New technologies such as digital TV, music downloads and online games are ripping up established business models. Last year, the UK became the first major economy where advertisers spent more on internet advertising than on TV advertising. This digital revolution has caused upheaval in the creative industries – in some sectors, it has enabled creative businesses to reach audiences in new ways that were unimaginable in the analogue age; but in others it has ‘cannibalised’ their established revenue streams. In all cases, digital technologies have produced seismic changes in consumer expectations and behaviour, and social media platforms are becoming more important as venues for the discovery and discussion of creative content. Unlike film and recorded music, live performance organisations produce ‘experiential goods’ whose features are less easy to translate digitally. Yet, digital technologies <b>are</b> impacting on <b>live</b> performance bodies such as theatres, live music, opera and dance companies too. The National Theatre’s <b>NT</b> <b>Live</b> broadcasts of live productions to digital cinemas may contain broader lessons for innovating organisations in the performing arts sector. With this in mind, NESTA has been conducting an in-depth research study on the two <b>NT</b> <b>Live</b> pilots that <b>were</b> broadcast last year – Phèdre on 25 th June and All’s Well That Ends Well on 1 st October. The research shows how this innovation has allowed the National to reach new audiences for theatre, not least by drawing on established relationships between cinemas and their patrons all over the country. It confirms the centrality of ‘live’ for the audience experience – both in the theatre and in cinemas. Cinema audiences report even higher levels of emotional engagement with the production than audiences at the theatre. They also claim {{that they are now}} more likely to visit the theatre in the future, suggesting that there may be positive spillovers on the wider sector. All this suggests an appetite for cultural experiences that <b>are</b> <b>live,</b> going against the prevailing logic of ‘consumption on demand’, where individuals are free to choose the place and time where they access content, but do so detached from the unique circumstances where it was produced in the first place...|$|R

40|$|Since 2008, the Royal National Theatre {{has been}} beaming several plays per year into cinemas across the United Kingdom {{in the form}} of livecasts. These live {{transmissions}} have created a form of access to the National Theatre previously unavailable to those outside London, and have been well enough received by audiences to have become a fixture of cinema programming across this country and others. Taking <b>NT</b> <b>Live</b> (the National Theatre’s digital wing responsible for livecasting) as its focus, this dissertation aims to fill the current gap in academic writing dealing with livecasts. How is livecasting related to past attempts to record or transmit theatre, and how have those predecessors’ aesthetics been drawn upon by <b>NT</b> <b>Live?</b> The relationship between historical precedents (such as live television dramas, pre-recorded theatre and Electronovision) and livecasting are examined from aesthetic and historical perspectives. The specific set of aesthetics visible in livecasting are analyzed through textual analyses of several <b>NT</b> <b>Live</b> productions, and the impact of film language on the plays transmitted is examined as a key aspect of the hybridized medium of livecasting. The “liveness” of livecasting is also examined with reference to existing theoretical frameworks within film and television and theatre studies, and livecasting’s offer of co-presence in time, but not space, is discussed. How are livecast audiences expected or encouraged to feel a part of the theatre experience, if at all? The experience of attending a livecast as opposed to a film or play is examined, {{and the degree to which}} livecasts make theatre available to wider audiences is discussed as a key element of this new technology, particularly with reference to the National Theatre, whose remit and very name suggest that its plays should be available to the widest audience possible. This dissertation provides a discussion of some of the most fundamental aspects of livecasting, a subject bound to receive further academic treatment as this new transmedia option becomes more firmly entrenched in our cultural landscape...|$|R

The development merits, however, a reassessment of the liveness debate launched with the seminal contributions by Peggy Phelan’s 1993 book Unmarked: The Politics of Performance and Philip Auslander’s 1999 study Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture. There are clear and undeniable differences between live performance, simulcast, cinema screening and TV broadcast in terms of creation and reception. These differences do not imply value judgments, and the different art forms or media do not represent threats to each other. Consciousness studies, in this case the Vedanta model of consciousness, enables an enhanced understanding of experiences reported by spectators in relation to liveness, and further enables an appropriately new context for understanding the new phenomenon of simulcast.

Cultural leaders fail if they cannot demonstrate the public value of their work, he says. Bakhshi 2 ̆ 7 s comments will ring through Australian cultural organisations {{as the federal government}} drafts its National Cultural Policy. Arts Minister Simon Crean says the arts sector 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to society and the economy should be measurable. Speaking at an event on Tuesday night hosted by the Australia Council for the Arts and the City of Sydney, Bakhshi described the debate about the economic v intrinsic value of the arts as the most contested area of cultural policy. Top 50 Tech Rec Coverage It is the difference between hard economic measures such as dollars generated and less tangible factors such as aesthetic or spiritual value. Arts bodies do not want to use the tools or language of economics, he says, and there is a dearth of rigorous evidence about the economic value of culture. But Bakhshi, co-author of a paper called Measuring Intrinsic Value: How To Stop Worrying and Love Economics, says economic research can be used to measure intrinsic value. He proposes a holistic approach to studying the impact of the arts by using a mix of economic tools and other disciplines, including field research. A study he conducted with Australian cultural economist David Throsby looked at the British National Theatre 2 ̆ 7 s <b>NT</b> <b>Live</b> program of digital cinema broadcast and people 2 ̆ 7 s responses to it. They discovered that audiences found the broadcast of Racine 2 ̆ 7 s Phedre, with Helen Mirren, to be aesthetically satisfying on its own terms, a phenomenon they described as "beyond live". The study points to the economic and cultural value of <b>NT</b> <b>Live,</b> he says.

As the main contribution of the work we introduce two types of metrics: intensity, relating to how intensively co-present and remote aspects of a performance are rated, and cohesion, relating to how a performance as a whole, the combination of co-present and remote aspects, affects an audience. In particular, we model audience response based on two in the wild evaluations, staged by a low budget theatre company, a streamed and a distributed performance. The streamed performance <b>is</b> similar to <b>NT</b> <b>Live,</b> where a theatre play is delivered to other theatres with an audience. The distributed performance, on the other hand, connects actors in two different theatres (with audiences) creating one single play. The streamed performance was experienced as less intense as well as less cohesive by the remote audience, whilst the distributed performance integrated co-present and remote aspects tightly. Remote aspects of the distributed performance were still experienced as less intense, but the performance as a whole was highly cohesive. Apart from the identification of these two new metrics (intensity and cohesion), based on our experiences we argue that an innovative way of bundling relevant emerging technologies is needed to give a voice to the, as yet silent, remote audience...|$|R
