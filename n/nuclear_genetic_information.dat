5000|$|A {{spermatozoon}} (pronounced , alternate spelling spermatozoön; plural spermatozoa; from σπέρμα [...] "seed" [...] and ζῷον [...] "living being") is a motile sperm cell, {{or moving}} {{form of the}} haploid cell that is the male gamete. A spermatozoon joins an ovum to form a zygote. (A zygote is a single cell, with {{a complete set of}} chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo.)

30|$|The method {{considered}} {{in this work}} introduces some novelties with respect to classical approaches, which have been already underlined in [5]. The gene flow network is extracted {{by means of a}} model-independent measure, which is a normalised version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. An interesting aspect of the application of this method is that we extract the gamete space from the allele sequences and we perform the analysis in that space. Gametes are the mother and father sexual cells that fuse in a sexual reproduction event. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> from the two gametes remain mostly separated in the daughter cell (in the different chromosomes of each chromosome pair) and subsequent cells originating from it, but sequencing techniques cannot identify which gene is coming from which gamete. From the observed alleles in each individual in our dataset we construct the set of possible gametes that could have originated such individual, and we apply our techniques to such gamete pool. The distance measure in the gamete space has to be considered more detailed than the one in the allelic space, since it takes into account the possible correlations between different loci. An extension of the method to include mutation effects can be easily obtained as better explained below.|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} three decades, protoplasts {{have been shown to}} be an {{effective}} tool in studying the biochemistry and genetics of fungi, as the thick cell wall is no more a barrier. In this work we describe and discuss this versatile tool in mycology in two ways, preparation level and utilisation level. At the preparation level we describe the optimal conditions to obtain yeast protoplasts, including buffers employed, incubation time, regeneration of protoplasts, and compare the methodology to obtain the protoplasts from yeast and filamentous fungi. At the utilisation level we analyse the methodology to introduce foreign DNA into host genomes via protoplast transformation, probably the most universal method of gene transfer, and via protoplast fusion, a tool to "illegitimaly" transfer <b>nuclear</b> and/or organellar <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> beyond phylogenetic boundaries. Finally, we conclude about the importance and actuality of fungal protoplasts in mycological research...|$|R

40|$|Is <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> {{of special}} ethical significance? Does it require special regulation? There is {{considerable}} contemporary debate about this question (the genetic exceptionalism debate). <b>Genetic</b> <b>information</b> is an ambiguous term and, {{as an aid}} to avoiding conflation in the genetic exceptionalism debate, a detailed account is given of just how and why <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> is ambiguous. Whilst ambiguity is a ubiquitous problem of communication, it is suggested that <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> is ambiguous in a particular way, one that gives rise to the problem of significance creep (i. e., where claims about the significance of certain kinds of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> in one context influence our thinking about the significance of other kinds of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> in other contexts). A contextual and contrastive methodology is proposed: evaluating the significance of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> requires us {{to be sensitive to the}} polysemy of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> across contexts and then examine the contrast in significance (if any) of genetic, as opposed to nongenetic, information within contexts.

40|$|Background: <b>Genetic</b> <b>{{information}}</b> entails {{information about}} future risk of disease or information about carrier status. The Human Medical use of Biotechnology Act (2003) § 5 - 8 prohibits {{the use of}} this form of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> outside the health care system, and protects people against discrimination and stigmatization. This means that insurance companies or employers are not entitled to use <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> in applications for health insurance or in terms of employment. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain new insight and a broader knowledge regarding the Human Medical use of Biotechnology Act § 5 - 8 and its injunction against the use of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> outside the health care system. The focus of the study was how involved parties experience the Act’s ban towards using <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> outside the healthcare system. Material and methods: Qualitative method was used through in-depth interviews of seven participants from various involved parties of the Human Medical use of Biotechnology Act § 5 - 8. Results: The study shows that the general feedback from the participants is that they experience the paragraph 5 - 8 to be important. This is because <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> is private and can easily be linked to a person’s identity. They also experience that <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> can easily be misused, misinterpreted and can lead to healthy people being proclaimed sick due to genetic testing. Despite the challenges associated with enforcing the paragraph, the participants believe that it has a major role to protect people from discrimination and stigmatization. In future perspectives they also think the paragraph will be important in terms of new technology and commercial forces. Conclusion: The paragraph 5 - 8 has an important significance for the participants. To prevent people from discrimination and stigmatization, it will also be important in future perspectives to prohibit the use of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> outside the health care system. Suggestions for further research would be to investigate how people with genetic risk for disease experience the prohibition of <b>genetic</b> <b>information</b> outside the health care service...|$|R
