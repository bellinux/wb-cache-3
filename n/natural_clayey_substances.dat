40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of some {{laboratory}} shear tests aimed at evaluating {{the influence of the}} displacement rate on the residual shear strength of a <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soil and of kaolin-sand mixtures at various percentages. Some results relative to a bentonite are also reported. The tests were performed by means of various types of shear apparatuses {{in a wide range of}} displacement rates. The results show that the residual shear strength increases with the displacement rate for the considered kaolin and bentonite, whereas it remains constant for the sand. The influence of the percentage of kaolin on the shear behaviour of the mixtures is not linear. No influence of the displacement rate was observed on the shear strength of the <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soil. However, an influence of pore fluid composition on the residual shear strength on this latter, as well as on the shear creep behaviour was observed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} the processes responsible for slip-weakening in clayey gouge zones, rotary-shear experiments were conducted at seismic slip rates (equivalent to 0. 9 and 1. 3 m/s) at 0. 6 MPa normal stress on a <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> gouge for saturated and non-saturated initial conditions. The mechanical {{behavior of the}} simulated faults shows a reproducible slip-weakening behavior, whatever initial moisture conditions. Examination of gouge obtained at the residual friction stage in saturated and non-saturated initial conditions allows the definition of two types of microstructures: a foliated type reflecting strain localization, and a non-foliated type composed of spherical aggregates. Friction experiments demonstrate that liquid-vapor transition of water within gouge due to frictional heating has a high capacity to explain the formation of spherical aggregates in the first meters of displacement. This result suggests that the occurrence of spherical aggregates in <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> fault gouges can constitute a new textural evidence for shallow depth pore water phase transition at seismic slip velocity and consequently for past seismic fault sliding...|$|R
40|$|In clay soils having low initial pH values, {{electrokinetic}} {{transport of}} heavy metals {{has proven to}} be effective. The transport of these metals is predicated on maintaining a low pH throughout the cell, which in turn keeps the metals in the pore water phase, where they are accessible to EK transport. Development of high pH gradients in the cathode region due to the formation of OH-, from the dissociation of water, produces unfavorable conditions for the transport of heavy metals, namely precipitation. Standard electrokinetic methods have not been employed to a great extent in <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soil. These soils tend to magnify the problems mentioned above and pose several unique problems related to remediation that currently used techniques cannot overcome.

A wide range of tests was conducted on various percentages of RBI Grade 81 subgrade mixtures such as Atterberg limits, compaction characteristics, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Unconfined Compression Strength tests (UCS). It can be noticed that the CBR of clayey subgrade has increased significantly {{with the addition of}} RBI Grade 81. Similarly, the maximum dry density (MDD) has decreased and the optimum moisture content (OMC) has increased with RBI Grade 81 addition to subgrade. The strength of clay subgrade at 8 % of RBI Grade 81 has improved 3 – 3.5 times as compared to the <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> subgrade.

The analysis of the experimental results obtained in drained and undrained nonisothermal tests and during thermal consolidation made it possible to identify a link between the thermal and the time-dependent behaviour of the soil skeleton. Therefore, as for creep processes, the response of the soil to thermal loading is not unique but among other factors depends strongly on the overall and recent stress history experienced by the soil. In the range of temperatures investigated, the deformability and strength of the soil were found to be relatively independent of temperature. Stiffening of the soil results from thermal cycles...|$|R

Yield stress {{is an important}} parameter to quantify and analyze the strength and compressibility behavior of the artificially compacted clays; such materials are indeed of practical significance in various projects, e.g., engineered landfills, clay liners, etc. The present study aims to investigate the influence of different geotechnical characteristics of compacted clays of wide plasticity range on the compaction induced yield stress, and also to develop the correlational models to quickly predict the yield stress. Three <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soil samples of different geotechnical properties were collected from different sites; 27 more samples of varying index properties were prepared by mixing bentonite with natural soil samples at varying rates. Series of one-dimensional consolidation tests were performed to determine compressibility parameters like yield stress, compression index, and coefficient of volume compressibility. Atterberg’s limits, grain size, compaction characteristics, and compressibility have a significant influence on the compaction induced yield stress. Predictive models of yield stress are also developed by using the plasticity index, optimum water content, and maximum dry unit weight as independent variables.

40|$|In-situ {{bioremediation}} is a technology, {{which has}} recently gained {{the attention of}} specialists for the clean-up of hydrocarbons. Organic chemicals are persistent and hard to deal with, because they are usually present in three forms: dissolved into groundwater, as free product over the groundwater surface, and adsorbed onto soil particles. The requirements for the bioremediation process to occur are the availability of microorganisms, a biodegradable pollutant, an electron acceptor, and nutrients. The shortage of nutrients in an available form for the microorganisms is very often a limiting factor for successful bioremediation in-situ. The main difficulties for the supply of nutrients usually come from the low permeability of soils. The feasibility of the application of electrokinetic processes, and, more specifically, the induced electroosmotic flow, for achievement of uniform distribution of nutrients for in-situ bioremediation in a <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> silt was investigated.

The analysis and comparison indicate that the MCC model is able to accurately describe many features of the mechanical behavior of the soil in isotropic {{consolidation test}} and consolidated-drained triaxial test. And the MCC model can well describe the variation of excess pore water pressure with the development of axial strain in consolidated-undrained triaxial test, but its ability to predict the relationship between axial strain and shear stress is relatively poor.

In addition, Mandel-Cryer effect unable to be discovered by the conventional triaxial test in laboratories was disclosed by FEM.

Also, backfilling will be done to overcome the un-leveling depths or raising levels of site construction, especially near the sea region. Therefore, backfilling soil materials used under the foundation of structures should be investigated regarding its effect on ground motion characteristics, especially at regions subjected to earthquakes. In this research, 60 -meter thickness of sandy fill material was used above a fixed 240 -meter of <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soil underlying by rock formation to predict the modified ground motion characteristics effect at the foundation level.

40|$|ABSTRACT Classification of {{expansive}} soils is {{a required}} component of geotechnical design {{to improve the}} long-term performance of structures. The current methods to classify swelling soils are based primarily on indices like the Atterberg limits, which are indirectly related to clay mineralogy and clay structure. The long-term goal {{of this research is}} to explore alternative ways to classify clays and to modernize geotechnical soil classification methods using measurement and analysis techniques based on clay surface properties. Clay surface properties such as specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) are indicative of the clay mineralogy. For expansive clays, interactions of the clay surface with water molecules influence behavior. Consequently, water vapor sorption methods may potentially be used to determine clay surface properties. SSA is the measure of surface area per unit mass (m 2 /g). SSA measurement methods can be classified into three main categories: physical methods, positive adsorption methods, and negative adsorption methods. The most common techniques are positive sorption methods, where the sorption of molecules on the surface is measured. The sorbates can be either polar (e. g., N 2) or non-polar (e. g., Ethylene Glycol Monoethyl Ether (EGME), water vapor). CEC is a measure of exchangeable mineral charge. Common measurement techniques include those based on replacing the cations in the natural exchange complex with a known cation species (e. g., ammonium displacement method) A water vapor sorption isotherm characterizes the relationship between relative humidity (RH) and the equilibrium moisture content of some material in that environment obtained along an adsorption (wetting) or desorption (drying) path at some temperature. A water vapor sorption isotherm is equivalent to a soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) since RH and soil suction can be directly related by Kelvin?s equation. A sorption isotherm, therefore, is a direct measurement of how the physical and chemical interactions between water and the soil surface result in water retention, and thus is an indirect measurement of the fundamental compositional and surface properties of the material (mineralogy, SSA, CEC). In the first chapter of this thesis SSA values obtained by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) Theory are determined from water vapor sorption isotherms obtained at low relative humidity values, and compared with values obtained using the more conventional EGME retention method. Thirteen samples of <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soils and a suite of mixtures of end member Wyoming bentonite and Georgia kaolinite are tested. Additional comparisons are made for a suite of Mg+ 2, Ca+ 2, Na+, K+, and Li+-saturated forms of the bentonite to examine influences of exchangeable cation type and to extend the possible range of water vapor sorption isotherms over a wide range. The second chapter examines the performance and applicability of six existing isotherm models (Freundlich, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, Frenkel-Halsey-Hill, Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer, Double Log Polynomial, and Dubinin-Astakhov) for representing the water vapor sorption behavior of clayey soils. Dry mixtures of Wyoming bentonite and Georgia kaolinite are tested to cover a wide range of possible isotherms. Trends observed in the equation parameters with increasing bentonite content are discussed and analyzed separately for adsorption and desorption processes. In the third chapter, an original empirical method is proposed to indirectly estimate the CEC of clayey soils based on relatively simple water vapor sorption measurements. A master curve is obtained from measured water vapor sorption isotherms of 24 clayey soil samples. The validation of the proposed method is independently tested using twelve samples of <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soils and nine water vapor sorption isotherms available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStrontium {{is a good}} monitor of geochemical {{processes}} in <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> formations. In the Callovian-Oxfordian formation of Bure in France, strontium is sorbed on clay minerals and carried by carbonates, detrital minerals and accessory celestite. In {{order to determine the}} strontium distribution among these different phases, four-step sequential extractions (I. cobalt hexamine trichloride, 2. acetic acid, 3. EDTA and 4. tri-acid) were performed on samples from different levels of the clayey formation. The leachates were also analyzed for strontium isotopes, {{in order to determine the}} strontium origins. This sequential procedure is well suited to determining strontium distribution in claystones, although it is less efficient in clay-rich limestones and in celestite-rich samples. The carbonates (38 - 47 % of the total strontium) show Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios (0. 7070 - 0. 7071) that have recorded the isotopic composition of the Callovian-Oxfordian seawater. Diagenetic carbonates (dolomite, ankerite and siderite) have almost not incorporated any strontium, which has been trapped by celestite during the late diagenesis. The major part of the celestite shows Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios (0. 7069 - 0. 7070) quite close to the primary carbonates. However, a second generation of celestite (0. 7074) shows a slight Sr- 87 -enrichment and is isotopically in equilibrium with the exchangeable strontium (27 - 48 % of the total strontium with a mean Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 value of 0. 70745) and the present-day porewater (0. 7074). This very low Sr- 87 -enrichment could be explained by the partial destabilisation of detrital minerals (feldspars, micas, clays) which exhibit 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios consistent with their pristine Hercynian origin (0. 7229 - 0. 7350). Diffusion of strontium from the subjacent Dogger aquifers (0. 7076 - 0. 7082) could also be invoked to explain the slight 87 Sr-enrichment...|$|R

Research was conducted on artificial clay-sand mixtures and <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soils collected from the sliding surfaces of earthquake-induced landslides. The undrained response of normally consolidated clayey soils to cyclic loading was studied by means of a ring-shear apparatus. For the artificial clay-sand mixtures, {{it was found that the}} presence of a small amount of bentonite (= 7 %) would cause rapid liquefaction, while a further increase in bentonite content (= 11 %) produced the opposite effect of raising soil resistance to liquefaction by a significant degree. It was demonstrated that the bentonite-sand mixture was considerably more resistant to liquefaction than the kaolin-, and illite-mixtures, given the same clay content. The test results of plastic soils revealed the significant influence of plasticity on the liquefaction resistance of soil. The microfabric of clayey soil was investigated by means of a scanning electron microscope. The analysis showed that the liquefaction potential of soil was strongly related to certain particle arrangements. For example, soil vulnerable to liquefaction had an open microfabric in which clay aggregations generally gathered at the sand particle contact points, forming low-strength "clay bridges" that were destroyed easily during cyclic loading. On the other hand, the microfabric of soil that was resistant to liquefaction appeared to be more compact, with the clay producing a matrix that prevented sand grains from liquefying. In the case of the natural soils, the obtained results indicated that their cyclic behavior was similarly influenced by factors such as clay content, clay mineralogy and plasticity. The relation between the liquefaction potential of natural soil and its microfabric was thus also established. On the basis of the obtained results, the authors posited an explanation on the mechanism of liquefaction for clayey soil. No Full Tex...|$|R

Specific surface area (SSA) details of the same soils were determined using the chemical ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) method. Attempts were made to predict macroswell properties, using both pore and surface area properties. Modeling analyses and results showed that the swelling behavior of the clays was dependent on a newly introduced parameter that accounted for both clay mineralogy constituents and internal pore distribution of the soils. The new swell property models showed accurate predictions of measured swell strains of the present soils, depicting the importance of including mineralogy and pore fabric details in a given soil...|$|R
40|$|<b>Natural</b> slopes in <b>clayey</b> {{soils are}} often {{affected}} by failures which may cause {{the onset of}} landslides of the flow type travelling large distances and damaging buildings and major infrastructures. Particularly, the so-called earthflows pose challenging tasks for the individuation and forecasting of the remobilized masses; as a consequence, the mathematical modelling of the propagation stage allows enhancing the understanding of earthflows {{in order to obtain}} reliable assessments of run-out distances and displaced soil volumes. This paper deals with the reactivations of Montaguto earthflow (Southern Italy) occurred from 1998 to 2009 that are simulated, through the depth-integrated “GeoFlow-SPH” model, thanks to the availability of a detailed data-set. The achieved results provide a satisfactory agreement with the in-situ information and outline how a change of the rheology of the mobilized masses can affect the whole phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Re-use of {{agricultural}} drainage water and industrial wastewater {{is one of}} the adopted strategies in different countries to close the gap between water resources and water demands. Drainage and industrial wastewater contain varieties of toxic pollutants that can potentially cause hazard on humans and environment. Although adsorption techniques are considered one of the proper methods for the wastewater treatments, economic aspect is a crucial factor for the broad application of such technique. Addressing this, the thesis concerns on proposing sorbents having the potential to remove heterogeneous pollutants simultaneously, particularly taken in consideration the limited resources in developing and emerging countries, in this study exemplified for Egypt. For this purpose, <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> sediments as cheap and environmentally friendly materials were used in combination with various organic modifiers to produce of organically modified clayey sediments (OMCs). In contrast to the <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> sediments, OMCs are expected {{to have the ability to}} remove heterogeneous pollutants including anionic and cationic as well as organic and inorganic pollutants. The sorbability and desorbability characteristics of OMCs were investigated for Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + (cationic), Cr 2 O 72 - (anionic-) and metalaxyl m (MM; organic-pollutants). The basic clay materials in OMCs were naturally occurring kaolinitic (kao sediment) and bentonitic (bent sediment) clayey sediments distributed widely in Egypt. Different concentrations of the organic modifiers L-Carnitine (Carnitin), L Cystine dimethyl ester (Cys_ester), Methyltriphenyl-phosphonium (MTP) or Hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium (HDTM) were employed. The modification of <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> sediments with organic modifiers increased the organic carbon contents of OMCs following the order Carnitin 50 % of the CEC of the natural bent sediments were able to remove all Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + from the solutions. However, increasing the loading concentration of Cys_ester decreased the sorption of those metal ions as compared to natural bent sediment. OMC modified with Carnitin at loading concentration up to 21 % of the CEC was able to remove 84 % of Cd 2 + and 100 % of Pb 2 + from the solutions but a further increase of Carnitin loading decreased the sorption of the metal ions. The OMCs modified with HDTM and Cys_ester were very efficient in removing Cr 2 O 72 - from the solutions and the removal increased with increasing loading concentrations of the organic modifiers. The OMCs based on bent sediments loaded with HDTM, MTP, Carnitin and Cys_ester at loading concentrations equal to 102, 79, 18 and 66 % of CEC of the natural bent sediments, respectively, and in addition OMC loaded with Humic acid (HA), were selected as promising sorbents to test the sorbability and desorbability of OMCs with respect to the pollutants. The sorption processes were investigated as function of the metal concentration, sorption time, the initial solution pH and the electrolyte concentration. OMCs modified with HDTM, MTP, HA and Carnitin showed high sorbability for Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +. However, OMCs modified with Cys_ester displayed the best sorbent for Cr 2 O 72 -. OMCs were successful to remove almost all Cd 2 +, Pb 2 + from the solutions at wide ranges of pH; 4 - 8 and 4 - 6, respectively, while the optimum for the sorption of Cr 2 O 72 - was pH 4. The Langmuir model described adequately the observed sorption data of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + on all sorbents and Cr 2 O 72 - on OMC modified with Cys_ester better than the Freundlich model. The sorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics with the rate constants demonstrating faster sorption on OMCs with Carnitin and HA for Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + and faster sorption on OMCs with MTP and Cys_ester for Cr 2 O 72 -. Sorption of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +, particularly on OMCs with Carnitin and HA, were decreased with increasing electrolyte concentrations. Whereas, increasing the electrolyte concentrations enhanced the sorption of Cr 2 O 72 - to OMC with Cys_ester. OMCs showed ability to release the sorbed heavy metals, which shows the potential for re-using. The presence of other solutes in the binary and ternary component systems strengthened the sorption of Cr 2 O 72 - on OMCs based bent sediments with HDTM and MTP and enhanced the sorption of MM on OMCs with Cys_ester and MTP. Competition phenomena were recorded for the sorption of Cd 2 + and MM on OMC with HDTM. No competition behaviours were observed in the sorption of the tested pollutants on OMC with Cys_ester. OMCs with HDTM, MTP and Cys_ester were able to remove Cd 2 +, Cr 2 O 72 - and MM simultaneously from the binary and ternary component systems. The results indicate the prospective application of the OMCs in the treatments of natural agricultural drainage water and industrial wastewater. In verschiedenen Ländern ist die Nutzung landwirtschaftlichen Dränagewassers und industriellem Abwasser eine etablierte Methode um die Diskrepanz zwischen Wasserressourcen und -verbrauch zu überbrücken. Diese Wasserquellen enthalten eine Vielzahl toxischer Schadstoffe die die menschliche Gesundheit sowie die Umwelt beeinträchtigen können. Auch wenn Sorptionsverfahren als für die Aufbereitung dieser Wasserquellen geeignet betrachtet werden, ist der ökonomische Faktor ausschlaggebend für den Einsatz dieser Verfahren. Die vorgelegte Arbeit beschreibt, unter Berücksichtigung der begrenzten Ressourcen in Entwicklungs- und Schwellenländern, Sorptionsmittel, die die Fähigkeit aufweisen verschiedene Schadstoffe gleichzeitig dem Wasser zu entziehen. Zur Herstellung der Sorptionsmittel wurden natürliche tonige Sedimente, als kostengünstige und umweltfreundliche Materialien, in Kombination mit verschiedenen organischen Modifikatoren verwendet um &# 8223;organisch modifizierte tonige Sedimente? (organically modified clayey sediments: OMCs) zu erzeugen. Im Vergleich zu natürlichen tonigen Sedimenten sollen OMCs die Eigenschaft aufweisen verschiedenartige organische Schadstoffe, einschließlich anionischer, kationischer, organischer und anorganischer Schadstoffe zu sorbieren. Die Sorptions- und Desorptionseigenschaften der OMCs wurden für Cd 2 +, Pb 2 + (kationisch), Cr 2 O 72 - (anionisch) and Metalaxyl -m (MM; organisch) untersucht. Die tonigen Sedimente, die zur Herstellung der OMCs verwendet wurden, sind in Ägypten natürlich vorkommende kaolinitische (kao sediment) und bentonitische (bent sediment) tonige Sedimente. Verschiedene Konzentrationen der organischen Modifikatoren L-Carnitine (Carnitin), L-Cystine dimethyl ester (Cys_ester), Methyltriphenyl-phosphonium (MTP) oder Hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium (HDTM) wurden verwendet. Die organische Modifikation der natürlichen tonigen Sedimente führte zu einem ansteigendem Gehalt an organischem Kohlenstoff, der folgenden Reihenfolge entsprechend: Carnitin 50 % der KAK natürlicher bentonitischer Sedimente bewirkten HDTM und MTP die vollständige Entfernung von Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + aus der Lösung; allerdings führte eine erhöhte Beladung mit Cys_ester zu einer verringerten Sorption dieser Schwermetalle, verglichen mit natürlichen bentonitischen Sedimenten. OMC, welches mit einer Konzentration von bis zu 21 % Carnitin modifiziert wurde, entfernte 84 % des Cd 2 + und 100 % des Pb 2 + aus der Lösung, allerdings führte die weitere Erhöhung der Carnitin-Konzentration zu einer verringerten Sorption der Metalle. OMCs die mit HDTM und Cys_ester modifiziert wurden entfernten effektiv Cr 2 O 72 - aus der Lösung, und die Sorptionsrate nahm mit steigender Konzentration der Modifikatoren zu. Auf bentonitischen Sedimenten basierende OMCs, die mit HDTM-, MTP-, Carnitin- und Cys_esterkonzentrationen gleich jeweils 102, 79, 18 and 66 % der KAK natürlicher bentonitischer Sedimente beladen waren, sowie mit Huminsäure (HA) beladenes OMC, wurden als geignete Sorbenten ausgewählt um die Sorption und Desorption von Schadstoffen zu untersuchen. Die Sorptionsprozesse wurden als Funktion der Metallkonzentration, der Sorptionszeit, des Ausgangs-pH der Lösung sowie der Elektrolyt-konzentration untersucht. OMCs die mit HDTM, MTP, HA und Carnitin modifiziert wurden, wiesen eine hohe Sorption von Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + auf. Jedoch zeigte mit Cys_ester modifiziertes OMC die höchste Sorption von Cr 2 O 72 -. OMCs entfernten Cd 2 + und Pb 2 + fast vollständig von Lösungen mit einem pH-Bereich von 4 - 8, bzw. 4 - 6. Das Sorptionsmaxima von Cr 2 O 72 - lag bei pH 4. Das Langmuir-Model eignete sich besser als das Freundlich-Model zur Beschreibung der Sorptionsrate aller Sorbenten für Cd 2 + und Pb 2 +, sowie für die Sorption von Cr 2 O 72 - durch mit Cys_ester modifiziertes OMC. Die Sorption folgte einer Kinetik pseudo-zweiter Ordnung; die Absorptionskonstanten weisen auf eine schnellere Sorption von Cd 2 + und Pb 2 + durch OMCs mit Carnitin und HA, sowie auf eine schnellere Sorption von Cr 2 O 72 - durch OMCs mit MTP und Cys_ester hin. Die Sorption von Cd 2 + und Pb 2 + wurde durch höhere Elektrolyt-Konzentrationen beeinträchtigt, insbesondere für OMC mit Carnitin und HA, während eine eine Erhöhung der Elektrolyt-Konzentration zu einer erhöhten Sorption von Cr 2 O 72 - durch OMC mit Cys_ester führte. Des weiteren können OMCs die sorbierten Schwermetalle desorbieren, wodurch die Wiedervertbarkeit der Materialen möglich wird. Die Präsenz anderer gelöster Stoffe in Systemen mit zwei oder drei Komponenten verstärkt die Sorption von Cr 2 O 72 - durch mit HDTM und MTP modifizierten OMCs die auf bentonitischen Sedimenten basieren, und führt zu einer größeren Sorption von MM durch mit Cys_ester und MTP modifizierten OMCs. Es wurde eine Konkurrenz für die Sorption von Cd 2 + and MM durch OMC mit HDTM beobachtet, allerdings wurde keine Konkurrenz zwischen den untersuchten Schadstoffen für mit Cys_ester modifizierten OMCs beobachtet. Mit HDTM, MTP und Cys_ester modifzierte OMCs konnten simulatan Cd 2 +, Cr 2 O 72 - und MM von den Systemen mit zwei und drei Komponenten sorbieren. Die Ergebnisse deuten auf die Möglichkeit eines erfolgreichen Einsatzes organisch modifizierter toniger Sedimente für die Aufbereitung landwirtschaftlichen Dränagewassers, sowie industrieller Abwassers hin...|$|R
40|$|Semipenneable {{properties}} of <b>clayey</b> <b>natural</b> materials {{can have a}} significant impact on a range of geological and geochemical processes on laboratory and field scale. The importance of chemical osmosis in semipenneable natural clays for transport of contaminants was first discussed in the Netherlands in relation to the environmental aspects of contaminated harbour sludge depots. One of the main depots, De Sluiter near the Port of Rotterdam, is constructed in a salt water aquifer without a bottom liner. The clayey harbour sludge itself acts as a layer oflow hydraulic conductivity, restricting advective transport of contaminants. However, the construction also enables the sludge layer to act as a semipenneable membrane. The main objective of this study was to develop and apply instrumentation for the direct measurement of the semipenneability of materials like contaminated harbour sludge and other clayey materials under unconsolidated conditions...|$|R
40|$|During the {{construction}} of civil engineering structures on soft clayey deposits, engineers must {{have to consider the}} consolidation behavior of the deposit. Due to the <b>natural</b> viscosity of <b>clayey</b> soils, their consolidation behaviour is strongly influenced by vertical stress as well as by organic content. As more and more constructions are concentrated in densely populated urban areas, there is an increasing need to construct buildings and geotechnical structures on soft clay materials, which usually produce significant creep deformation. Although a lot of research work has been carried out related to the secondary consolidation behaviour of a natural clay material, there are still many questions about this phenomenon. Detailed laboratory studies on soft soil are necessary for the better understanding and, consequently, better prognosis of this behavior. Some of these studies were performed and are presented in this project. One dimensional consolidation tests were conducted on ten numbers of plastic clays of plasticity index (Ip) ranging from 13...|$|R
40|$|Effective waste {{management}} requires {{the protection of}} groundwater resources against potential contamination from the leachates generated by the land disposed wastes. In general, waste disposal facilities are lined with impermeable barriers {{to protect against the}} migration of leachates into the <b>natural</b> water bodies. <b>Clayey</b> soils, due to their easy availability and economic viability, are normally preferred as liner materials. In this regard, extensive laboratory studies have been conducted on clayey soils to understand their permeability behavior as affected by the permeation of contaminant cationic solutions. It is also known that the clayey soils retain the heavy metal ions due to their surface characteristics. However, relatively little information is available on the retention characteristics of clayey soils. Hence, in this study, an attempt has been made to study the retention characteristics of clayey soils upon permeation of inorganic cationic solutions. The results indicate that the major portion of the retention of metal ions by clayey soils is through ion exchange...|$|R
40|$|In 1996 the Backfill and Plug Test Project {{started at}} the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden) managed by SKB (the Swedish Radioactive Waste Agency). The Backfill and Plug Test Project makes up an {{important}} part of SKB's research in order to store nuclear waste in a deep geological repository in a safe manner. ENRESA (the Spanish Radioactive Waste Agency) collaborates in this project with the Swedish companies SKB and Clay Technology in characterising the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the backfill material used to backfill a gallery. The backfill, obtained by mixing 30 % of sodium bentonite MX- 80 and 70 % of crushed granite rock by weight, which maximum grain size was 20 mm, has been experimentally investigated. The experimental campaign took into account the salt water effects (up to 16 g/L) on its hydro-mechanical behaviour. Because of the bentonite content, its activity is quite large if compared with <b>natural</b> <b>clayey</b> soils. Therefore, changes in the pore fluid chemistry influence the hydro-mechanical behaviour of this mixture. Due to the current application of the mixture, as candidate for sealing galleries in a future repository for nuclear waste, interest was focused on the variation of permeability related to variation of salt concentration in pore fluid. Oedometer tests on specimens permeated with different salt water contents and water uptake tests permeated with different salt water contents were performed. Compaction tests with distilled and salt water were also performed. Osmotic suction was investigated on a different mixture of sodium bentonite and sand keeping the same weight ratio. Crushed granite was substituted by sand in order to use transistor psychrometers were used in this determination. The experimental study of the mixture included the design and calibration of a new mini-piezometer which allows performing constant and variable head tests in saturated clayey soils. Some numerical tools were also developed to analyse pulse tests performed in laboratory and in situ (tests performed in late March of 2003 in the ZEDEX gallery in the ÄHRL full-scale laboratory). Different methods (analytical, semi-analytical and numerical) were used to analyse the pulse tests performed in laboratory and in situ. Finally, the thesis focused on using a new finite element simulator, which solves thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) problems in a fully coupled way (Guimarães, 2002), to simulate the saturation process of a barrier for nuclear waste made up with this mixture. Interest was mainly focused on simulating the influence on the mixture hydraulic behaviour when salt concentration in pore fluid changed. A simple geochemical model, which took into account the ion exchange reaction between of Na+ and Ca 2 +, was considered. An empirical law of permeability variation with pore fluid salt concentration, obtained from the experimental information, was implemented in the finite element code. Effects of mixture molecular diffusion were also investigated, pointing out the importance of this parameter when transport of solutes in porous media is solved. Total suction was computed as the sum of matric suction and osmotic suction. Osmotic suction was calculated by obtaining salt concentrations and by using the Van't Hoff equation. In this way, osmotic suction was not assumed constant as it is usually considered in engineering practice. This thesis has contributed to the characterisation of a material, which is difficult to investigate, and it has provided with accurate information of the backfill permeability, one of the key parameters when designing a nuclear waste repository.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} proportion of sand {{as well as its}} gradation on the undrained strength behavior of soils, undrained tests on statically compacted specimens of clay–sand mixtures were carried, with two extreme clay minerals, namely commercially available kaolinite and bentonite mixed with specimens of three grades of sand fractions, and also varying their proportion from 10 to 80 %. This work was extended to two natural soils, viz., Red earth (kaolinitic type) and B.C. soil (montmorillitic type) by using fractionized fine portion from these soils obtained by sedimentation process, and later mixed with different proportions and grades of sand fractions. Results from this experimental investigation reveals that, at optimum sand content in clay–sand mixtures, use of medium sand fractions is more beneficial to improve the undrained strength of the mixtures irrespective of the clay mineral type being present in the mixture. It thus implies that proper selection of grade of sand is also important along with the optimum content to obtain higher strength of a clay–sand mixture. This has practical implications in understanding the performance of embankments or any ground improvement applications involving strength of <b>clayey</b> <b>natural</b> soils for better load carrying capacity, stability, and good performance of the structure supported by soil. It is also very useful in the geo-environmental applications like proper selection of proper grade of clay–sand mixtures as liners for better performance.|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} are generally used in unbound layers of road pavement structures. The mechanical behavior {{of these materials}} is widely studied with repeated load triaxial tests (RLTT) in which the elastic response {{is defined as the}} resilient behavior. Usually observed under total stress conditions, the effect of pore pressure changes during loading are not usually included in design. Further, the unbound layers frequently exist under partially saturated conditions. The influence of the unsaturated state, i. e., the suction, on the mechanical behavior, of unbound granular materials for roads has not been sufficiently studied and is generally not taken into account in models used for these materials. This article presents an experimental study of the repeated load response of a compacted <b>clayey</b> <b>natural</b> sand, and describes a model for the response which includes the effects of soil suction. The response of the proposed model formulated in terms of effective stress is compared with a similar model formulated in terms of total stress. The results from both the effective stress model and the total stress model are compared with the measured volumetric and deviatoric response. It is suggested that since the model parameters for the effective stress formulation are relatively constant for all values of suction (water content), the resilient response can be best captured by an effective stress model...|$|R
