5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, <b>nacreous</b> <b>layer,</b> {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E

[...] The c-axis is perpendicular to the shell wall, and the a-axis parallel to the growth direction.

Identification of these structures as altered nacreous concholin and discrimination from contaminating structures of foreign organisms, a frequent finding in fossil shells, were based on detection of similar structural modifications in the Recent Nautilus shell, in well preserved shells of Pennsylvanian and Mesozoic cephalopods and in alterations produced artificially in experimental diagenesis of the Recent Nautilus shell. Nacreous organic remnants subsisted in recrystallized shells. The mechanism of the conchiolin alterations, the significance of variations in the structural patterns of nautiloid conchiolin, the structural pattern of ammonoid nacreous conchiolin, and modifications in configuration of the <b>nacreous</b> <b>layers</b> in shells with preserved original aragonite and in recrystallized shells, have been discussed...|$|R

40|$|Nacre is a {{biogenic}} composite material. One protein {{from the}} organic {{fraction of the}} <b>nacreous</b> <b>layers</b> of Haliotis laevigata is perlucin.

The model was calculated by means of comparative modelling and tested with molecular dynamic simulations. One computational study with the newly available perlucin structures is presented in this thesis. A rigid docking analysis of several structures of the CTLD of perlucin led to the proposal of several residues that could be involved in homodimer formation. The experimental part of this thesis consists of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments performed with nacre proteins. A suitable buffer solution composition - near neutral pH value of 7. 3 and 1 M NaCl - is given that can serve as a basis for future SEC experiments with perlucin. Current SEC results could point to a dimerization of perlucin...|$|R

[...] Its structure {{is similar to that of}} proteins involved in silica deposition in diatoms. [...] It consists of 1428 amino acid residues. Its molecular weight is estimated to be 142 kDa. Its terminus consists of a protease inhibitor, which contributes to its longevity in the molluscan shell matrix.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of {{the organic}} remnants has been compared in the TEM, after decalcification of the mural nacre of ammonites and fossil nautiloids by EDTA, which removes a soluble fraction, and after fixation and decalcification by formaldehyde-cetyl-pyridinium chloride-EDTA (CPC method) and chromium sulphate solutions, which are both considered to insure a better preservation of these organic remains. The loose networks of altered trabeculae, frequently fused into membranes, which constitute the ultrastructure of the fossil organic remnants of nacre after decalcification by EDTA, are {{also found in the}} samples treated by the CPC method and by chromium sulphate. Continuous membranes, superimposed on the networks, are especially abundant in the material treated by chromium sulphate. It is concluded that the networks of altered trabeculae are not artifacts, but are the representative ultrastructures {{of the organic}} remnants of the <b>nacreous</b> <b>layers</b> in the fossils studied so far. It is suggested that disappearance of EDTA soluble substances does not distinctly alter the ultrastructure of the fossil organic residues...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nacreous</b> <b>layers</b> of {{pearl oyster}} {{are one of}} the major {{functional}} biominerals. By participating in organic compound-crystal interactions, they assemble into consecutive mineral lamellae-like photonic crystals. Their biomineralization mechanisms are controlled by macromolecules; however, they are largely unknown. Here, we report two novel lectins termed PPL 2 A and PPL 2 B, which were isolated from the mantle and the secreted fluid of Pteria penguin oyster. PPL 2 A is a hetero-dimer composed of a and c subunits, and PPL 2 B is a homo-dimer of b subunit, all of which surprisingly shared sequence homology with the jacalin-related plant lectin. On the basis of knockdown experiments at the larval stage, the identification of PPLs in the shell matrix, and in vitro CaCO 3 crystallization analysis, we conclude that two novel jacalin-related lectins participate in the biomineralization of P. penguin nacre as matrix proteins. Furthermore, it was found that trehalose, which is specific recognizing carbohydrates for PPL 2 A and is abundant in the secreted fluid of P. penguin mantle, functions as a regulatory factor for biomineralization via PPL 2 A.

40|$|The {{periostracum}} is {{the outermost}} layer overlying the inner prismatic and <b>nacreous</b> <b>layers</b> of the shells of bivalves. In the present study, the distributions of Cd and Pb {{in the soft}} tissues (ST) and periostracum of the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis sampled from 15 sampling sites in the coastal waters of Peninsular Malaysia were determined. The concentrations of Cd (0. 21 - 10. 87 mg/g dry weight) and Pb (1. 16 - 40. 20 mg/g dry weight) in the periostracum were generally higher {{than those in the}} ST (Cd: 0. 10 - 5. 55 mg/g dry weight; Pb: 2. 53 - 18. 62 mg/g dry weight). Based on correlation analysis from nine geographical populations, the higher correlation coefficients (R values) between the periostracum-geochemical fractions of the sediments than between the ST-geochemical fractions of the sediments indicated that the periostracum could be a potential biomonitoring material for Pb. Hence, the present results supported the use of the periostracum of P. viridis as a potential biomonitoring material for Pb but not for Cd. However, more studies are warranted to verify its usefulness for the biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution in tropical coastal water...|$|R

40|$|The Akoya {{pearl oyster}} (Pinctada imbricata) was {{experimentally}} exposed to (a) constant levels of lead (Pb) at 180 μg L - 1 for nine weeks, or (b) two short term (pulse) exposures of Pb at 180 μg L - 1 (three weeks each) with an intervening depuration period (three weeks), to assess its utility as an (i) accumulative monitor of Pb contamination and an (ii) archival monitor for discriminating constant versus pulsed Pb exposure events. P. imbricata showed similar reductions in growth (based on shell morphology and wet weight) and Pb accumulation patterns for whole tissue and shell {{in response to}} both Pb exposure regimes. Thus the whole oyster was deemed an inappropriate accumulative monitor for assessing short-term temporal variation of Pb exposure and effect. However, using secondary ion mass spectrometry, Pb was shown to accumulate in the successively deposited <b>nacreous</b> <b>layers</b> of the shell of P. imbricata, documenting the exposure history of constant versus pulsed Pb events. Patterns of Pb deposition not only reflected the frequency of Pb exposure events but also their relative durations. Thus, the shell of P. imbricata may be employed as a suitable biological archive of Pb exposure. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{homology}} of biomineralization pathways is underlined by {{a remarkable}} experiment whereby the <b>nacreous</b> <b>layer</b> of a molluscan shell was implanted into a human tooth, {{and rather than}} experiencing an immune response, the molluscan nacre was incorporated into the host bone matrix.

40|$|The {{organic matrix}} from each {{structural}} unit of Mytilus californianus has a distinctive amino acid composition. Systematic variations in composition occur within the outer prismatic layer and the periostracum. In small shells there are profound {{changes in the}} periostracum composition as the animal grows {{during the first year}} or so. There is a relationship between the amount of organic material present in the original shell unit and the relative amounts of the basic and acidic amino acids in the organic matrix. The matrix from calcitic shell structures has a larger net excess of acidic residues than does the matrix from aragonitic structures. Temperature changes appear to be reflected in compositional changes in the <b>nacreous</b> aragonite <b>layer</b> with increasing temperature favoring a higher number of net acidic amino acid residues. Thus, as temperature increases, the differences in matrix composition between the <b>nacreous</b> aragonite <b>layer</b> and the outer prismatic calcite layer become progressively smaller. Decreasing salinity seems to have a similar effect to increasing temperature. From a study of a series of radiocarbon-dated shell materials, it is found that the composition of the organic matrix undergoes a significant amount of change within a few thousand years under a rather dry environment. The oxidation products of certain amino acids are present in progressively larger amounts in older materials, suggesting oxidation as one of the possible mechanisms involved in fossilization. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{fossil record}} shows that all {{molluscan}} classes evolved some 500 {{million years ago}} [...] from a shelled ancestor looking something like a modern monoplacophoran, and that modifications of the shell form ultimately {{led to the formation}} of new classes and lifestyles. However, a growing body of molecular and biological data indicate that at least certain shell features have evolved many times, independently. The <b>nacreous</b> <b>layer</b> of shells is a complex structure, but rather than being difficult to evolve, it has in fact arisen many times convergently. [...] The genes used to control its formation vary greatly between taxa: under 10% of the (non-housekeeping) genes expressed in the shells that produce gastropod nacre are also found in the equivalent shells of bivalves: and most of these shared genes are also found in mineralizing organs in the deuterostome lineage. [...] The independent origins of this trait are further supported by crystallographic differences between clades: the orientation of the axes of the deposited aragonite 'bricks' that make up the <b>nacreous</b> <b>layer</b> is different in each of the monoplacophora, gastropods and bivalves.|$|E
50|$|Aragonite forms {{naturally}} {{in almost all}} mollusk shells, and as the calcareous endoskeleton of warm- and cold-water corals (Scleractinia). Several serpulids have aragonitic tubes.

In some mollusks, the entire shell is aragonite; in others, aragonite forms only discrete parts of a bimineralic shell (aragonite plus calcite).

50|$|Nacre is {{secreted}} by the {{epithelial cells}} of the mantle tissue of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent <b>nacreous</b> <b>layer,</b> commonly known as mother of pearl. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against parasites and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a blister pearl attached to {{the interior of the}} shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called encystation and it continues as long as the mollusc lives.|$|E
50|$|In {{oysters and}} {{potentially}} most molluscs, the <b>nacreous</b> <b>layer</b> has an organic {{framework of the}} protein MSI60, which has a structure a little like spider silk and forms sheets; the prismatic layer uses MSI31 to construct its framework. This too forms beta-pleated sheets. Since acidic amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, are important mediators of biomineralization, shell proteins tend to be rich in these amino acids. Aspartic acid, which can make up up to 50% of shell framework proteins, is most abundant in calcitic layers, and also heavily present in aragonitic layers. Proteins with high proportions of glutamic acid are usually associated with amorphous calcium carbonate.|$|E
5000|$|Some mollusk shells protect {{themselves}} from predators by using a two layered system, {{one of which is}} nacre. Nacre constitutes the inner layer while the other, outer, layer is made from calcite. The latter is hard and thus prevents any penetration through the shell, but is subject to brittle failure. On the other hand, nacre is softer and can uphold inelastic deformations, which makes it tougher than the hard outer shell. The mineral found in nacre is aragonite, CaCO3, and it occupies 95% vol. Interestingly, nacre is 3000 times tougher than aragonite and {{this has to do with}} the other component in nacre, the one that takes up 5% vol., which is the softer organic biopolymers.

The outer layer gradually thins from 0.6 mm in thickness to only about 0.1 mm thick at about 65 mm further down the shell until it eventually disappears around the opening of the phragmocone (the peristome). Sometimes there is a hollow gap between the rostrum and the lamellar layer of the conotheca, indicating either organic content that have since disappeared or disintegration of the lamellar layer itself. The phragmocone of Belemnotheutis had about 50 chambers that were originally aragonitic, though they are usually replaced by calcium phosphate during the process of fossilization.|$|R
