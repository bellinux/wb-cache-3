5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This {{section of the}} freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along {{this section of the}} highway. Additionally, traffic that <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a U-turn. Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10, stating that although it was [...] "perfectly serviceable, professionally produced television," [...] it was [...] "much like the last week {{with a little bit}} of been-there-done-that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it," [...] and that the plot was [...] "almost boilerplate for this genre." [...] By this point in the series, the reviewer believed that [...] "the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you're always ahead of it. The show <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> things up." [...] Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha, opined; [...] "Though not the show's best hour to date, 'Power Hungry' is still a solid entry. Good directing, writing, and outstanding production values are maintained as the series' norm." [...] In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer's [...] "casual surrender", as [...] "in the past, those associated with 'the pattern' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture, going as far as committing suicide. What's this guy's deal? He obviously has a plan." [...] However the reviewer was skeptical as to why Astrid was comfortable working with Walter again, considering he subdued her in the previous episode.|$|E

As a result of {{political}} upheaval, the prince's position in the island's class system is eroded by newly moneyed peasants and [...] "shabby minor gentry." [...] As the novel progresses, the Prince is forced to choose between upholding the continuity of upper class values, and breaking tradition to secure continuity of his (nephew's) family's influence ("everything <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> so everything can stay the same"). A central theme of the story is the struggle between mortality and decay (death, fading of beauty, fading of memories, change of political system, false relics etc.), and abstraction and eternity (the prince's love for the stars and calculations, continuity and resilience to change of the Sicilian people). In a letter to a friend, the author notes: [...] "Be careful: the dog Bendic√≤ is a very important character and is almost the key to the novel". This heraldic emblem is the key to destruction, in the sense that ruin comes even to the dog.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{conflict}} between Wolverine and Cyclops {{that led to the}} former abandoning Utopia, Husk became a teacher at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. At a faculty meeting, Paige tries to express her insecurity about not being cut out for teaching because the students aren't listening to her. Ironically, Beast cuts her off before she can finish. Later, Cannonball expresses his frustration about there only being a memorial for dead X-Men, including their brother Jay, in the faculty lounge and that he doesn't understand how Paige agrees with this decision when she can't even look at Jay's picture. Casting off Sam's feelings, Paige announces she has class and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> In reply to this, Sam states that she sheds her skin every time she's unhappy and her power isn't an antidepressant. At that moment, the school is attacked, and Paige is instructed to go teach as normal. During her class, Rogue interrupts and informs Paige {{that there is a problem}} with the [...] "heating system." [...] Upon leaving the class, Paige instantly husks into her fire form and destroys the invading N'Garai in the mansion. During Paige's time at the school, it becomes apparent that her mysterious molting condition is only worsening because her skin is in a state of constant cracking and flaking.|$|E

Some Western commentators also talk about a [...] "crisis of ideology" [...] within the party; {{they believe that the}} CPC has rejected communism. Wang Xuedong, the Director of the Institute of World Socialism, said in response, [...] "We know there are those abroad who think we have a 'crisis of ideology,' but we do not agree." [...] According to Jiang Zemin, the CPC [...] "must never discard Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Mao Zedong Thought.‚Äù He said that ‚Äúif we did, we would lose our foundation.‚Äù He further noted that Marxism in general [...] "like any science, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> as time and circumstances advance." [...] Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CPC's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction of the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism‚Äîwhich is why we talk about a ‚Äòsocialist market economy‚Äô with Chinese characteristics." [...] Marxism in its core is, according to Jiang Zemin, methodology and the goal of a future, classless society, not analyses of class and of the contradictions between different classes.|$|E
