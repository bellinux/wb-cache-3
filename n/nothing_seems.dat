5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

Ernest F. Henderson states that the existence of this Bull is doubted by many while, in noting that its authenticity has been questioned without resolution, P. S.

It is notable that decisions of Pope Alexander III, Pope Lucius III, and King Henry VIII in proclaiming the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 were predicated on this document.|$|E
25|$|A {{small town}} in northwestern Pennsylvania, Cambridge Springs seems like an {{unlikely}} location to hold an international chess tournament. However, {{back in the early}} 1900s Cambridge Springs was a flourishing resort town due to a couple geographic oddities. The primary factor was location. At first glance <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> remarkable about the town, but in fact it is located on the Erie Railroad line, halfway between New York and Chicago, which made it an ideal stopover location for railway patrons. The secondary factor was the local mineral springs which were visited by numerous people seeking to improve their health.|$|E
25|$|Mackworth {{headed the}} county {{sequestration}} committee, which confiscated and leased out the estates of royalist landowners, pending their reaching {{a settlement with}} the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents, based at Goldsmiths' Hall. Mackworth's dealings with the Ottley family are fairly well known {{from their point of}} view, as their correspondence is preserved. The county committee began felling Francis Ottley's trees in retribution for his burning of houses while governor or Sheriff. This was quickly forbidden by the Committee for Compounding but it seems that Mackworth and the county committee were slow to comply. In April 1647, a letter from Lucy Ottley, the wife of Sir Francis, to Richard Ottley, their eldest son, mentioned moves by Mackworth and others to prosecute Sir Francis, but the details are unknown and <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> to have come of it. Mackworth's name heads the signatories on the document releasing Ottley's lands from sequestration in March 1648, although the financial details were far from settled. Ottley was accused of involvement in the attempted royalist uprising of that summer but apparently never apprehended. There were legal proceedings between Mackworth and Ottley in February 1649, but their nature is not known, although there was apparently difficulty in securing legal officials not related to either party. Sir Francis completed his business with the compounding Committee in the summer and died later in the year.|$|E

The Almoravids did come, in 1086, but at the {{invitation}} of the taifa kings whose territories were threatened by the expansionist Christian king Alfonso VI of León and Castile. Yusuf ibn Tashfin incorporated the taifas into the Almoravid realm in 1090, but they reemerged 50 years later following the political disintegration of the Almoravid state. The Almoravids' successors, the Almohads, returned to Spain in 1146 and gained control of the taifas once again. Incursions by Alfonso VII of León and Castile and Alfonso I of Aragon into Muslim-held territory in Al-Andalus had shown that the area around Algeciras needed to be more strongly defended. The Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min therefore ordered the construction of a fortified city on Gibraltar, to be called the Madinat al-Fath (the [...] "City of Victory").|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{suggestion of}} unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area {{appeared in a}} September 17, 1950, article published in The Miami Herald (Associated Press) by Edward Van Winkle Jones. Two years later, Fate magazine published [...] "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door", a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of Flight 19, a group of five US Navy Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers on a training mission. Sand's article {{was the first to}} lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of American Legion magazine. In it, author Allan W. Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, [...] "We are entering white water, <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no white." [...] He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes [...] "flew off to Mars." [...] Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of Argosy, Vincent Gaddis' article [...] "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" [...] argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region. The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, Invisible Horizons.|$|E

[...] Julian Benson of Kotaku wrote that [...] "Valhalla is a cocktail of game genres. It draws from visual novels, with each customer who visits your bar having a different story to tell. There's a healthy measure of Papers, Please, too, with you having to perform a mundane job (drink mixing) by following a complicated list of tasks. [...] And, on top of that you also get to manage and decorate your bar, so there's a dash of Animal Crossing for flavour." [...] He also quipped that [...] "year after year, <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> to slow the pace of successful cyberpunk bartender simulators." [...] Push Square's Nicola Hayden additionally added that [...] "gaining cult success around the more niche areas of the Internet, VA-11 HALL-A, a cyberpunk bartending simulator, has managed to stir up quite a fuss."

2500|$|By 1894 the LCC {{had adopted}} a device {{consisting}} of [...] "an armed female figure between the armorial bearings of the Cities of London and Westminster". The question {{of an official}} coat of arms for the county council was first raised {{at a meeting of}} the council in 1897. Despite the opposition of two members on the grounds that it was [...] "an insidious attempt to undermine the democratic character of the Council" [...] and, jokingly, that they should not [...] "degenerate to the level of the City Corporation", the General Purposes Committee were instructed to take steps to obtain a coat of arms. <b>Nothing</b> <b>seems</b> to have come of this, and the unofficial device continued in use. In May 1906 the general purposes committee was asked to consider and report on whether the council should make an [...] "application to the College of Arms or otherwise take steps to obtain a coat of arms, with a view to commemorating worthily its work in connection with public improvements, such as the construction of new streets and bridges, the restoration of ancient buildings and the like." [...] No further action appears to have been taken until February 1911, when the committee recommended that a coat of arms be obtained at a cost not exceeding £100. The recommendation was rejected by the council, with one member stating that the letters [...] "L.C.C." [...] would be good enough for the council. Another councillor sarcastically suggested the arms of the council should include, among other things, a wrecked ship, the shut gates of the work department and a tombstone to the memory of municipal enterprise with the motto [...] "ad quod damnum".|$|E
2500|$|The Lowther {{coal mines}} at Whitehaven {{inherited}} by James {{were on the}} eastern edge of high ground {{to the west of the}} town (what was later known as the 'Howgill colliery') and worked seams which dipped westward at a gradient of about 10%. The distance to which the seams could be followed using gravity drainage by adits was therefore considerable, but limited. To continue mining without the pits flooding, Sir John had had to use horse-powered gins to raise water mechanically, but this was expensive (and increasingly so as the seams were followed deeper): Sir John, and after him James, had concerns that there were little more reserves of economically retrievable coal. In 1712 John Spedding urged Lowther to consider the adoption of pumping by steam, by 'Captain Savory's invention', but <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> to have come of this until in 1715 Lowther discussed the problem of recovering a flooded pit with Thomas Newcomen. Newcomen submitted proposals in October 1715, which Spedding found clear and businesslike; from them he concluded that a Newcomen engine would recover the pit in two-thirds the time that horse gins would take, and would do so at a quarter of the cost. [...] A contract was signed (November 1715) for a small (17-inch diameter cylinder) Newcomen engine to be erected and leased from the consortium holding Savery's patent for £182 a year. Despite numerous teething problems, the engine (and the pumps it operated) proved a success and in February 1727 after ten years operation Lowther bought the engine (and the right to operate it) outright for £200 and paid another £350 for a license to build and operate another (slightly larger) one. About this time, Lowther commented to John Spedding ...|$|E

2500|$|While he was {{studying}} he developed the tenement garden in Holborn, that he refers to frequently in his work, and later published a catalogue of the plants there. This became popular, and he received gifts of seeds and plants from around the world. He also received offers to supervise the gardens of noblemen. In 1577, he began work as superintendent at the gardens of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Lord Burghley, the Queen's Lord High Treasurer) at the Strand and Theobalds, Hertfordshire, a position he continued in for more than 20 years. In 1586, the College of Physicians established a physic garden with Gerard as curator, a position he held till 1604. In 1588, Burghley was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and Gerard wrote to him commending himself as a suitable superintendent of the university botanic garden, writing [...] "to signe for ye University of Cambridge for planting of gardens". Amongst his qualifications he wrote [...] "by reason of his travaile into farre countries his great practise and long experience". There is no evidence for this claim and <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> to have come of his application. By 1595, when he {{was appointed to the}} Court of Assistants, he had established a reputation as a skilled herbalist and spent much time commuting from the Court to the garden he established close to his cottage in the suburb of Holborn, London and also attending to his duties for Burghley. In 1596 he requested that the Barber–Surgeons' Company establish a physic garden ("Mr. Gerrard's garden") in East Smithfield, but this was not proceeded with. It was reported that Queen Elizabeth held his achievements in high regard. In 1604 he was granted a lease on a garden adjoining Somerset House, by Anne, the Queen Consort to King James I, but the following year relinquished it to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, second son of Lord Burghley, in which he was described as [...] "herbarist" [...] to James I.|$|E
2500|$|Plutarch {{wrote that}} when Caesar was {{allocated}} the governorship of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior for 60 BC {{he was in}} debt and his creditors prevented him from going to his province. Crassus paid off the most intransigent creditors and gave a surety of 830 talents. Caesar was then allowed to leave. Suetonius noted this episode as well, but did not mention who made the payments and gave the surety [...] Plutarch thought that Crassus did this because he needed Caesar for his political campaign against Pompey. However, this cannot be taken for granted. In a speech Cicero made against an agrarian bill proposed by the plebeian tribune Publius Servilius Rullus in 63 BC, he claimed that Rullus was an insignificant figure and a front for unsavoury 'machinators' whom he described as the real architects of the bill and as {{the men who had}} the real power and who were to be feared. He did name these men, but he dropped hints that made them identifiable by saying, [...] "Some of them to whom nothing appears sufficient to possess, some to whom <b>nothing</b> <b>seems</b> sufficient to squander." [...] Sumner points out that these were references to the popular images of Crassus and Caesar. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that Crassus, Pompey and Caesar might have been willing to co-operate on a specific policy issue they agreed with as they had done in 70 BC. Moreover, Caesar had supported the Manilian law of 66 BC, which gave Pompey the command of the final phase of the Third Mithridatic War and in 63 BC and, as noted above, he proposed a motion to recall Pompey to Rome to restore order in Rome {{in the wake of the}} Catalinarian Conspiracy. Therefore, Caesar was willing to support Pompey because, although he was not a popularis, he was not an optimate and, therefore, a potential ally. Moreover, at the time of the creation of the first triumvirate Pompey was at odds with Caesar's enemies, the optimates. The suspension for his praetorship in 62 BC by the senate when he advocated the recall of Pompey had probably shown Caesar that his political enemies, the optimates, had the means to marginalise him politically. To attain the consulship Caesar needed the support of Pompey and Crassus who, besides being the two most influential men in Rome, did not belong to the optimates and were liable to politically marginalised by the optimates as well. Plutarch maintained that Caesar sought an alliance with both men because allying with only one of them could have turned the other against him and that he thought that he could play them off against each other. However, the picture might have been more nuanced than this.|$|E
