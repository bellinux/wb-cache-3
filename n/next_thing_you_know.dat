Despite Anka's original version totaling six minutes and 29 seconds, Streisand's is considerably shorter at three minutes and 52 seconds. On Anka's self-written book My Way: An Autobiography, he wrote that {{he was surprised to}} learn that Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters was the one who produced the track: [...] "Peters was still her hairdresser. <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> he's her producer, and he's produced mega motion pictures". However, he also acknowledged Streisand's rendition: [...] "Barbra can sing the phone book. She has no problem singing anything. She's got one of the great voices". For an album review on Billboards [...] "Top Album Picks" [...] column in their weekly magazine, a critic listed Streisand's version of [...] "Jubilation" [...] as one of the [...] "best cuts" [...] on ButterFly.|$|E
500|$|Complications in Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Malachy occurred when she begins {{an affair with}} Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle) while working with him at The Loft. Metcalfe expressed that she had initial [...] "reservations" [...] about the storyline which she felt was [...] "far-fetched", adding that once she had begun filming the scenes she thought the plot was [...] "brilliant" [...] even though she felt Mercedes would {{be perceived as a}} [...] "bitch". Whittle expressed similar doubts, saying he felt it was [...] "a bit out of character" [...] for Calvin, although he felt the plot was [...] "exciting". At first the pair did not like each other, but after spending time together, they realised that there was more to their personalities than they initially thought. Whittle explained that the attraction between Mercedes and Calvin began [...] "building", to the point that she and Malachy have [...] "a massive row" [...] and Calvin comforts her; Whittle stated that [...] "the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> they’re tearing each other’s clothes off".|$|E
2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|R
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing.

That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|R

500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E

We had chosen a city to make a movie about -- not a school in a city, or a dude in a city -- so we had to talk to a city, ask a city questions. It became a very organic, long, many-rabbit-holes, never-stop-casting sort of film. There are certain things we captured just because we were living there. We knew film had to be a chorus, it had to be a poem, it had to be a butterfly, going from place to place. You can't just hang a city on one person, or one family, I don't think. So it was a totally different kind of filmmaking -- it felt experimental, kind of artsy, kind of crazy." ...|$|R
