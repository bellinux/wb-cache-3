40|$|Kuantan River {{is one of}} the {{important}} rivers in Pahang state which contributes many resources to the community. A study of the Kuantan River water quality was conducted during a period from September 2011 to November 2011. Three sampling stations were selected based on the topography characteristics of the river. A total of nine chemical water quality parameters and three physical parameters were measured. Three physical parameters measured were temperature, conductivity and suspended solid (SS). The nine chemical parameters were pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, nitrates, phosphate, and heavy metals, i. e. cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb). Parameters such as conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were analyzed in-situ measurement {{while the rest of the}} parameters analysis conducted in laboratory. The result obtained was compared to the <b>National</b> Water <b>Quality</b> <b>Classes</b> by DOE. In Conclusion, Kuantan River was classified as DOE NWQS Class II water body...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{ecological}} assessment of running waters based on benthic macroinvertebrates {{different levels of}} taxonomic resolution (species, genus, family and higher) are in use. Although assessment systems are often developed with detailed data on species level, water managers and other end-users could like to use data on higher taxonomic levels to assess {{the ecological}} quality of a water body because of limited human or money resources. The question that arises is, if an assessment system built with species level data is also applicable using data with a higher taxonomic resolution. Within the AQEM project a multimetric assessment system was developed to evaluate the ecological <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> (from bad (1) to high (5) ecological quality) of different stream types throughout Europe. The present study focuses on the question whether the resulting water <b>quality</b> <b>class</b> changes using the AQEM Assessment Software (AAS) with different taxonomic resolutions and if yes, how large the deviations of ecological <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> from the original classes are and if the deviations are unidirectional. For analyses data from four Austrian and two Dutch stream types were used. It is demonstrated that the assignment of a site to an ecological <b>quality</b> <b>class</b> may change if different taxonomic levels are used. Deviations in both directions (higher/lower ecological <b>quality</b> <b>class)</b> were observed. In most cases the divergence was only one ecological <b>quality</b> <b>class,</b> but also larger deviations occasionally occurred. The causes {{of changes in the}} assessment were investigated by separately looking into the underlying metrics of the multimetric system. Some of the evaluated metrics rely on autecological information on species level and are simply not applicable on higher taxonomic levels. Other metrics worked on higher taxonomic levels as well and showed more or less good distinctions between ecological <b>quality</b> <b>classes.</b> It is concluded that the AQEM Assessment Software is not applicable if data on higher taxonomic levels are used. As the deviations were not unidirectional and ranged from one to three ecological <b>quality</b> <b>classes,</b> {{it is not possible to}} include a correction factor for using the software with higher taxonomic resolution data...|$|R

30|$|The NQF {{represents}} a major reform in ECEC services, designed to deliver high quality ECEC programs for all children. The NQF {{consists of three}} parts — {{the introduction of a}} new <b>National</b> <b>Quality</b> Standard (NQS), the implementation of a <b>national</b> <b>quality</b> assessment and rating system and third, the implementation of the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF). The EYLF has been implemented progressively from July 2010, with formal implementation of NQS and <b>national</b> <b>quality</b> assessment and rating system commencing the 1 st of January 2012. DEEWR (2011 b) has stated that “the <b>National</b> <b>Quality</b> Framework will require all providers to improve services in the areas that impact on a child’s development and safety and to provide families with quality information to help them make informed choices about services” (at their website). Even though the NQS and the <b>national</b> <b>quality</b> assessment and rating system were implemented from early 2012, an all-encompassing system will take several years to achieve to meet the NQS criteria (e.g., staff-child ratio, staff qualifications requirements).|$|R

The factors affecting the quality of CRA, however, being multitudinous and complicated so much, associated to regional characteristic of CRA, led to a research on evaluating quality of CRA from China. First, the CRA was partitioned into three fuzzy <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> corresponded to high, middle, and poor, respectively, whose applicable environment action grades and projects in terms of <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> were suggested. Second, a fuzzy synthesis method how to evaluate <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> was proposed. The present method used six indices, i. e., attached mortar content, bulk specific density, water absorption, Los Angeles abrasion loss, chlorid content and sulfate content. The weights for six indices were obtained based on credibility matrix and frequency statistic and the memberships based on optimum-intervel-style membership function. Using fuzzy weighted average operator, judgment matrix was calculated and synthetic membership score was considered as <b>quality</b> <b>class</b> judgment standard. Last, large numbers of engineering examples were computed using a program compiled in Matlab language. Computing {{results show that the}} present method is objective and reliable...|$|R
