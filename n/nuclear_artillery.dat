5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery,</b> and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> shells from service, and dismantling of the US <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Project E {{nuclear warheads}} {{were also used}} on the sixty Thor Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles which were {{operated}} by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under Project Emily. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its Corporal missiles in 1958. The United States subsequently offered the Honest John missile as an interim replacement, and it remained in service until 1977, when it was in turn superseded by the Lance missile. Eight-inch and 155mm <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> rounds were also acquired under Project E. A maritime version of Project E known as Project N provided nuclear depth bombs used by the RAF Coastal Command. The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.|$|E
5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, the US offered the Honest John missile. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John {{missiles}} with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments, the 24th at Nienburg (and later Paderborn), the 39th at Sennelager, and the 50th at Menden, with two batteries each. In addition, each regiment had two batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers (later replaced by M110 howitzers) with W33 nuclear warheads. A British <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> round project was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met {{the same fate}} on 10 August 1962. The Honest Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. One of the Honest John regiments, the 50th Missile Regiment, Royal Artillery, was then re-equipped with the Lance missile, with its W70 nuclear warhead. The W48 was acquired for the 155mm M109 howitzers. Both it and the W33 would remain in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the Davy Crockett, but had decided against it by February 1962.|$|E
50|$|The 17th Field Artillery Brigade {{moved to}} Augsburg Germany on 20 September 1978 {{and was the}} only <b>Nuclear</b> Capable Field <b>Artillery</b> unit in Germany.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this agreement, the 62nd Engineers and an {{artillery}} company were moved to Caserma Passalacqua. Both companies had <b>nuclear</b> weapons. The <b>artillery</b> company's Sergeant missiles had nuclear warheads and the engineering company was an ADM (Atomic Demolition Munitions) engineering unit.|$|R
50|$|Italy and the United States of America {{had also}} signed a {{bilateral}} military agreement in 1954, which allowed the American Forces leaving Austria after {{the signing of}} the Austrian State Treaty in 1955 to use bases in Italy. At the end of 1955 10,000 US troops left Austria and joined the US Southern European Task Force (SETAF) in Italy. SETAF included two <b>nuclear</b> armed <b>artillery</b> battalions, whose equipment was handed over to the Italian Army when the SETAF was reduced in size and most of its troops returned to the continental USA.|$|R
5|$|When the Cold War {{ended in}} 1991, {{there were more}} than 500 US nuclear weapons in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were Ground Launched Cruise Missiles, and {{approximately}} 100 were B57 nuclear depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155mm <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> shells. The cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991 {{under the terms of the}} 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range nuclear weapons. The last US warheads, including the B57s and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American nuclear weapons then remaining in the UK were 110 or so B61 nuclear bombs stored at RAF Lakenheath for USAF F-15E Strike Eagles, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British WE.177 nuclear bombs used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British nuclear weapons were British warheads on the Trident missiles of the s.|$|E
25|$|The weapons {{deployed}} included <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery,</b> nuclear demolition {{mines and}} warheads for Corporal and Lance missiles in Germany; theatre nuclear weapons on RAF aircraft; Mark 101 nuclear depth bombs on RAF Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft, later {{replaced by a}} modern successor, the B-57 deployed on RAF Nimrod aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{elaborate}} computerized {{early warning}} {{systems such as}} Defense Support Program were developed to detect incoming Soviet attacks and to coordinate response strategies. During this same period, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems were developed that could deliver a nuclear payload across vast distances, allowing the U.S. to house nuclear forces capable of hitting the Soviet Union in the American Midwest. Shorter-range weapons, including small tactical weapons, were fielded in Europe as well, including <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> and man-portable Special Atomic Demolition Munition. The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile systems allowed for hidden nuclear submarines to covertly launch missiles at distant targets as well, making it virtually impossible for the Soviet Union to successfully launch a first strike attack against the United States without receiving a deadly response.|$|E
5000|$|Picatinny Arsenal was tasked {{to create}} a <b>nuclear</b> capable <b>artillery</b> piece in 1949. Robert Schwartz, the {{engineer}} who created the preliminary designs, essentially scaled up the 240mm shell (then the maximum in the arsenal) and used the German K5 railroad gun {{as a point of}} departure for the carriage. (The name [...] "Atomic Annie" [...] likely derives from the nickname [...] "Anzio Annie" [...] given to a pair of German K5 guns which were employed against the American landings in Italy.) The design was approved by the Pentagon, largely through the intervention of Samuel Feltman, chief of the ballistics section of the ordnance department's research and development division. A three-year developmental effort followed. The project proceeded quickly enough to produce a demonstration model to participate in Dwight Eisenhower's inaugural parade in January 1953.|$|R
50|$|Throughout his career, Sergeant Major Green {{has been}} {{assigned}} numerous duties to include: field artillery cannoneer; field <b>artillery</b> <b>nuclear</b> projectileman; tower operator; drill instructor, senior drill instructor and drill master; battery section chief and battery gunnery sergeant, Assistant Marine Officer Instructor at Southern University and A&M College; first sergeant of Inspector-Instructor Staff, B Company, 1st Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment; and sergeant major of Headquarters Marine Corps Henderson Hall, United States Marine Corps Forces, Europe/Marine Corps Forces Africa and 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.|$|R
5000|$|Sheridan and Campbell {{prepare to}} attack Garner's base {{and destroy the}} weapons, but are forced to re-think their {{strategy}} when Sheridan receives a warning from Garner that she will use the V-2 rockets {{if they continue to}} provoke her. Sheridan assures Garner that he won't back off, and Garner simply responds that Sheridan will be [...] "rolled over by the modern world" [...] as communism will be inevitably victorious. Good news arrives when the Soviet Government declares the 8th Guards Army (the branch of the Soviet military Garner was working with) is an extremist renegade faction and Allied Commander General Eisenhower orders a full-scale assault on Garner's base. With the help of some newly developed <b>nuclear</b> equipped <b>artillery,</b> Sheridan manages to destroy Garner's base, destroying the German nuclear warheads and killing Garner in an atomic blast. At the end, Sheridan expresses his wish to take a vacation and see Europe [...] "without the bullets".|$|R
500|$|Cannon in the 20th and 21st centuries {{are usually}} divided into sub-categories and given {{separate}} names. Some {{of the most}} widely used types of modern cannon are howitzers, mortars, guns, and autocannon, although a few superguns—extremely large, custom-designed cannon—have also been constructed. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> was experimented with, but was abandoned as impractical. Modern artillery is used in a variety of roles, depending on its type. According to NATO, the general role of artillery is to provide fire support, which is defined as [...] "the application of fire, coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy, neutralize, or suppress the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|The final type of {{ammunition}} {{developed for the}} Iowa class were [...] "Katie" [...] shells. These shells were born from the concept of nuclear deterrence that had begun to shape the United States armed forces as the Cold War began. To compete with the Air Force and the Army, which had developed nuclear bombs and nuclear shells for use on the battlefield, the US Navy began a top-secret program to develop Mk.23 nuclear naval shells with an estimated yield of 15 to 20kilotons. These shells were designed to be launched from the best seaborne artillery platform available, {{which at the time}} were the four ships of the Iowa class. The shells entered development around 1953, and were reportedly ready by 1956; it is not known whether they were ever deployed on the Iowa-class battleships because the US Navy does not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships. In 1991 the US unilaterally withdrew its <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> shells from service, and Russia responded in kind in 1992. The US removed around 1,300 nuclear shells from Europe and reportedly dismantled its last shells by 2003.|$|E
2500|$|The initial impetus {{behind the}} {{two-stage}} weapon was President Truman's 1950 promise {{to build a}} 10-megaton hydrogen superbomb as the U.S. response to the 1949 test of the first Soviet fission bomb. But the resulting invention {{turned out to be}} the cheapest and most compact way to build small nuclear bombs as well as large ones, erasing any meaningful distinction between A-bombs and H-bombs, and between boosters and supers. All preferred techniques for fission and fusion explosions are incorporated into one all-encompassing, fully scalable design principle. Even [...] diameter <b>nuclear</b> <b>artillery</b> shells can be two-stage thermonuclears.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, while Sweden was {{deciding}} on its stance toward nuclear weapons, Swedish representatives, through their {{contacts with the}} American Department of Defense gained access to some secret information in the late 1960s. This information included nuclear weapons tactics, reconnaissance requirements, ideas regarding the necessity of quick decision-making, and nuclear physics data. Swedish representatives also looked at the MGR-1 Honest John weapons system that could utilize W7 or W31 <b>nuclear</b> warheads. For <b>artillery</b> purposes, the US developed a W48 projectile for 155mm artillery with 0.072 kiloton effect. Any plans for such a small Swedish nuclear device have never been recovered.|$|R
40|$|Two {{classroom}} simulations—SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION and MULTIPOLAR ASIAN SIMULATION—are used {{to teach}} and test {{various aspects of the}} Borden versus Brodie debate on the Schelling versus Lanchester approach to nuclear conflict modeling and resolution. The author applies a Schelling test to segregate high from low empathic students, and assigns them to hard case positions in three simulations to test whether high empathy students can engage in tactic bargaining and whether low empathetic students are necessarily as escalation prone. He has a bipolar nuclear simulation that is an easy case for the Brodie set of assumptions about nuclear war, avoidance, and Schelling-esque tacit bargaining. He expects the system structure and high empathy leader selection to contain escalation, despite the temptation of relying on accelerated Single Integrated Operational Plan solutions and the counterincentive of diminished tacit bargaining through decapitation attacks. The second simulation is a multipolar nuclear simulation set in the near future of Asia, and emulates the Borden-esque logic of <b>nuclear</b> war as <b>artillery</b> exchanges, with a Lanchester squar...|$|R
40|$|Biographical) From the Autoridad del Canal de Panama website, Governors and Administrators section: Dennis P. McAuliffe {{was born}} on April 8, 1922 in New York City, the son of Michael McAuliffe and Mary Ryan. He {{graduated}} from the US Military Academy at West Point and commissioned as a second lieutenant of field artillery on June 6, 1944; assigned to the 89 th Infantry Division as a battery officer; served through the division’s wartime deployment to Europe in late 1944. In 1946 he married Kathleen Bolton. From 1946 to 1948 {{he was assigned to}} the US Army Military Government in South Korea functioning in an advisory role. He earned his master's degree in electrical engineering in 1950; in June 1950, he joined Army Field Forces Board No. 1 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and for two years was a test officer with new artillery radar and electronic equipment; in 1952 participated in the overall preparatory and operational effort for the firing of the first <b>artillery</b> <b>nuclear</b> shell. After attending the Artillery Advanced Course at Fort Sill (1953 - 54), he joined the 663 d Field Artillery at Fort Bragg as operations officer; from 1955 to 1956 served as battalion operations officer in Okinawa; in 1957 was appointed as the Secretary of the General Staff of Headquarters, US Army Ryukyu Islands; from 1958 to 1959 was student at the US Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. McAuliffe attended the National War College from 1963 to 1964 and then served for 13 months in Korea as the assistant commander, I Corps Artillery; he was designated to the Army Chief of Staff in 1966; in 1967 he became the executive officer to the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff; and joined the 1 st Infantry Division in Vietnam in 1969. McAuliffe then became deputy denior advisor in the III Corps and Military Region until 1970. He returned to Europe for duty with Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and in 1973 was reassigned to Fort Leavenworth as deputy commanding general until 1974. On October 1, 1979, he was appointed by President Carter as the first administrator of the new Panama Canal Commission, position created by the new Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, and with the requirement of McAuliffe's retirement from the army. McAuliffe’s tenure as administrator, from 1979 to 1989, was marked by the many challenges and changes involved in shepherding the newly organized Canal agency through its first ten years of existence. During his administration the Canal tolls were increased three times in 1979, 1983, and 1989; in 1983 a permanent transit reservation system was implemented; the project to deepen the river bed of the Canal by three feet was completed in 1985 as well as the construction of the hydrographic station in Rio Piedras at Madden reservoir in 1985; and finally the widening project at Bohio was finished in 1989. Dennis McAuliffe died July 31, 2012 in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. His work during the first ten years of the Canal's transition period to Panamanian administration was greatly recognized. A Panama Canal tugboat is named after him. His co-workers remember him as a being a mediator and good-natured person. [URL] on behalf of the Estate of Canal Administrator D. P. McAuliff...|$|R
