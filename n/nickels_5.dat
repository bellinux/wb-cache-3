40|$|Abstract. Integer {{programming}} {{is concerned with}} solving linear systems of equations over the non-negative integers. The basic question {{is to find a}} solution which minimizes a given linear objective function for a fixed right hand side. Here we also consider parametric versions where the objective function and the right hand side are allowed to vary. The main emphasis is on Gröbner bases, rational generating functions, and how to use existing software packages. Concrete applications to problems in statistical modeling will be presented. 1. An Introductory Coin Problem This lecture is about solving linear equations over the non-negative integers. Our point of departure is the integer programming problem in standard form: (1. 1) Minimize c · u subject to A · u = b and u ∈ N n. The given instance consists of an integer matrix A ∈ Zd×n, a row vector c ∈ Zn and a column vector b ∈ Zd. The unknown is the column vector u = (u 1, [...] .,un). What makes the problem hard is the requirement that the ui be non-negative integers. As an example consider the following simple coin problem. Suppose you are carrying a large collection of coins in your pocket. The allowed coins are pennies (1 cent), <b>nickels</b> (<b>5</b> cents), dimes (10 cents) and quarters (25 cents). The problem is to replace your “portfolio ” by an equal number of coins having the same monetary value, but such that the number of nickels plus the number of quarters is minimized. This problem can be expressed in the standard form (1. 1) by setting 1 1 1 1 (1. 2) d = 2, n = 4, A...|$|E

In order to improve the response rate to NiSO 4 5 % pet. patch tests, a testing procedure utilizing pretreatment of the test area by 1 -day (24 -h) occlusion was introduced. Patients underwent 2 patch tests on adjacent sites of the volar surface of both forearms. 3 of the patch tests were performed with 40 mg <b>nickel</b> sulfate <b>5</b> % pet., whereas a control test was carried out by occluding with an empty chamber. 2 of the nickel sulfate test sites were pretreated with 1 -day occlusion performed with an empty chamber.

Every day, when customers spend cash for purchases, they exchange coins. There are a variety of ways a spender may determine which coins from their wallet to give a cashier in a transaction, and of course a given spender may not use the same algorithm every time. In this paper, however, we make some simplifying assumptions so that we can provide an answer to the question ‘What is the expected number of coins in your wallet?’. Of course, the answer depends on where you live! A currency is a set of de-nominations.

40|$|International audienceSulphur grain {{boundary}} segregation during hot-compression of <b>nickel</b> (<b>5.</b> 4 wt. ppm S) is monitored using Auger electron spectroscopy and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The deformation conditions (temperature/deformation rate) investigated are: 550 °C/ 0, 550 °C/ 3 × 10 − 5 s− 1, 550 °C/ 3 × 10 − 4 s− 1 and 450 °C/ 3 × 10 − 5 s− 1. It is shown that plastic deformation accelerates the kinetics of sulphur {{grain boundary}} segregation {{by a factor}} of ∼ 103 to a few 105, depending on the deformation conditions. Very high levels of segregation (∼ 0. 8 monolayer of sulphur) are obtained after very low deformation (∼ 5 %). In addition a linear dependence of the segregation level with time and deformation is demonstrated. The segregation kinetics during plastic deformation is proportional to the deformation rate and almost independent of temperature. Several metallurgical mechanisms are discussed and confronted with the experimental results: dislocations dragging, pipe diffusion, dislocation collection/diffusion and acceleration by excess vacancies.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether sensitization to these metals was associated with exposure to dental alloys and oral and skin complaints/symptoms in a European multicentre study. METHODS: In six dermatology clinics, patch tests with palladium (3 % Na 2 PdCl 4; Pd[*]=[*] 102. 0 [*]µmol/g) and <b>nickel</b> (<b>5</b> % NiSO 4. 6 H 2 O; Ni[*]=[*] 190. 2 [*]µmol/g) were performed in consecutive patients, and patients' characteristics were collected with a questionnaire and a clinical investigation. RESULTS: In total, 906 patients were included, of whom 24. 3 % reacted to palladium and 25. 2 % to nickel. The rate of monosensitization was 6 - 7 % for both metals. Palladium sensitization (as opposed to no sensitization to both metals) was associated with exposure to dental crowns [odds ratio (OR) 2. 0], skin reactivity to metals (OR 2. 8), oral lichenoid lesions (OR 4. 7), xerostomia (OR 7. 3), and metal taste (OR 20. 7), but not with eczema, stomatitis, or oral burning sensation. Additionally, xerostomia (OR 8. 7) and metal taste (OR 4. 6) were associated with sensitization to both metals.
