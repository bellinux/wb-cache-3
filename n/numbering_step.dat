40|$|Background. Carrying out whole tasks {{is often}} too {{difficult}} for novice learners attempting to acquire complex skills. The common solution is to split up the tasks into a <b>number</b> of smaller <b>steps.</b> The <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> must be optimised for efficient and effective learning. Aim. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the relation between the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> provided to learners and the quality of their learning of complex skills. It is hypothesized that students receiving an optimised <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> will learn better than those receiving either the whole task in only one step or those receiving a large <b>number</b> of <b>steps.</b> Sample. Thirty-five sophomore law students studying at Dutch universities, mean age = 22. 8 years (SD = 3. 5), with 63 per cent females. Method. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three computer-delivered versions of a multimedia program on how to prepare and carry out a law plea. The versions differed only in the <b>number</b> of learning <b>steps</b> provided. Videotaped plea-performance results were determined, various related learning measures were acquired and all computer-actions were logged and analysed. Results. Participants exposed to an intermediate (i. e., optimised) <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> outperformed all others on the compulsory learning task. No differences in performance on a transfer task were found. A high <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> proved to be less efficient for carrying out the learning task. Conclusions. An intermediate <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> is the most effective, proving that the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> can be optimised for improving learning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Stepped spillways are {{hydraulic}} structures that, {{because of}} their significant capacity in energy dissipation, {{have been widely used}} by designers. Flow mechanism over them is complex and many investigations have been performed to study that mechanism. The effect of some parameters such as the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> in energy dissipation has not been fully investigated. In this study the latest design criteria have been reviewed and then an algorithm has been developed to design the stepped spillways which are based on the effect of <b>number</b> of <b>steps.</b> Results show that the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> affects the energy dissipation. With increasing the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> energy dissipation increases and then decreases. Thus for specific discharge and spillway slope, the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> can be optimized for maximum energy dissipation. By reducing design discharge the optimum <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> increases. Research work on this subject can be continued in the future and various aspects of the design parameters may be investigate...|$|R
40|$|This study explores how the {{interior}} {{layout of the}} workspace can affect employees’ <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> and face-to-face interactions. Eighteen participants were recruited for the study and {{the data was collected}} over ten business days. The participants completed self-report forms to report the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> and interactions they had daily. A positive relationship was found between distance and the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> and interactions. A negative correlation was found between depth, a construct of the space syntax theory, and the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> and interactions. The findings further examined whether the results support a social ecological model with the relationships between distance, depth, the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> and interaction, and moderate variables (personal, environmental, and organizational factors). Findings indicated that the <b>number</b> of <b>steps,</b> as a function of human behavior, was affected by distance and depth (as environmental factors), age and years of working (as personal factors), and work hours (as an organizational factor) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine which randomly assigned noncontingent intervention (walking independently, with a coactor, or to preferred music) could improve self-determination of adults with Down syndrome by increasing the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> during a walking exercise class. Participants were 10 adults who were diagnosed with Down syndrome between 24 to 52 years of age. Data were visually analyzed to determine if the participants increased the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> taken measured with a pedometer. Based on this visual analysis, there were individual differences among each of the participants between baseline and each of the three interventions. Five of the participants increased the mean <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> walking with a coactor compared to baseline. One participant had the highest mean <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> walking during baseline. Further, three participants increased the average <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> during the intervention of listening to prefened fast tempo music compared to baseline. In addition, one participant had the highest mean <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> walking independently. A Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the differences on the average <b>number</b> of <b>steps.</b> Results revealed a significant repeated measures effect, [F(3, 91) = 6. 03,p <. 01], indicating that that {{there was a significant difference}} in the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> walked between baseline and the three intervention types for the group. A pairwise comparison for the group revealed that that the interventions all had a greater <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> than baseline (p <. 05). Maintenance session occurred on two occasions in the same setting. The mean of the maintenance sessions across the participants was similar to the baseline and independent phases, but lower than the coactor or music phases. One generalization session occurred outdoors. Generalization scores were similar compared to the baseline and lower than the interventions. It was concluded that noncontingent interventions can improve self-determination towards exercise experience for adults with Down syndrome. However, they may not be effective in maintaining or generalizing the mean <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> once the intervention is removed. French, Ron Dr. Nichols, David Dr. Kinnison, Lloyd Dr...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether pedometers {{can be used}} to measure physical activity in dogs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS: 26 dogs. PROCEDURE: To determine pedometer accuracy, <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> recorded with the pedometer as dogs walked, trotted, and ran for a distance of approximately 30 m (100 ft) at each gait was compared with actual <b>number</b> of <b>steps.</b> Dogs and owners then wore pedometers for 7 to 14 days, and dog pedometer output was compared with body condition score, owner-reported activity of the dog, and owner pedometer output. RESULTS: Most owners classified their dogs as active or quite active and indicated that their dogs exercised 3 to 7 days/wk. For all dogs, body condition score was 5, 6, or 7 on a scale from 1 to 9. At a walk, pedometers overestimated actual <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> by approximately 17 % in large and medium dogs and underestimated actual <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> by approximately 7 % in small dogs. No significant differences between pedometer-recorded and actual <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> were detected when dogs trotted or ran. <b>Number</b> of <b>steps</b> per day for the dogs was significantly correlated with owner-reported activity of the dog (r = 0. 305) and <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> per day for the owners (r = 0. 469) and was inversely correlated with body condition score (r = - 0. 554). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that pedometers can measure physical activity in dogs with reasonable accuracy. A lower <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> per day was associated with a higher body condition score, and less active owners generally had less active dogs...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to study the relationship between increase in <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> measured by pedometers, behavioral estrous parameters and time of ovulation, in order to investigate whether the <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> can be used as a tool for estrous detection and as a predictor for time of ovulation. In total, 63 ovulations were observed in 43 Holstein-Friesian cows. Different behavioral signs of estrus were observed at 3 h intervals. Cows were equipped with pedometers, which stored <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> in 2 h time periods and pedometer estrus alerts were defined using different algorithms and thresholds. The percentage of behavioral estruses also detected by pedometers measurements, ranged between 51 and 87 % for all estrous periods. When only estrous periods where taken into account in which more than one animal was in estrus, detection percentages increased up to 95 %. <b>Number</b> of <b>steps</b> taken during the estrous period was higher when more animals were in behavioral estrus at the same time, and <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> taken during the estrous period was also higher for primiparous cows compared to multiparous cows. Ovulation occurred 29. 3 ± 3. 9 h after onset of increased <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> (ranging between 39 and 22 h) and 19. 4 ± 4. 4 h after the end of increased <b>number</b> of <b>steps</b> (ranging between 35 and 12 h). The intervals were not influenced by the number of animals that were in estrus at the same time or by parity. In conclusion, pedometers can detect estrus accurately and appear to be a promising tool for prediction of ovulation and hence could be a tool for improving fertilization rates...|$|R
