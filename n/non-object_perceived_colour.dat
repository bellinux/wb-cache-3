40|$|The {{subject of}} the present thesis is the {{phenomenon}} of simultaneous colour contrast: As is well known, the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of a given light stimulus depends almost as strongly on the stimulation of neighbouring regions of the visual field as on the local stimulus itself. Thus, the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of a target stimulus can be manipulated either by changing the colour co-ordinates of the target itself, or, alternatively, by changing the colour co-ordinates of the surround. Classical models of simultaneous contrast {{are based on the}} implicit assumption that the changes in <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> brought about by these two kinds of manipulation are basically of the same kind, and thus may compensate each other. This ‘compensation assumption’ is equivalent to the widespread assumption that the space of <b>perceived</b> <b>colours</b> is three-dimensional. In principle, though, the well-established facts of trichromatic theory are compatible with a dimensionality of the space of <b>perceived</b> <b>colours</b> higher than three (namely three times the number of differently coloured regions in the visual field). One of the central results of the present investigations is that the compensation assumption seems to be unwarranted in the case of simple centre-surround stimuli. This instilled the expectation that classical methods for measuring simultaneous contrast effects, such as grey settings and asymmetric colour matching, may sometimes be inappropriate, and thus yield misleading results. In further experiments it is shown that this is indeed the case when uniformly coloured surrounds are used. In the case of variegated surrounds, however, matters appear to be much less complicated. This difference seems to be due to impressions of perceptual transparency being evoked by uniform surrounds, but not by variegated ones...|$|R

This work aims to aid suchcolour design by exploring three main questions: 1. Is itpossible to survey and map out what <b>colours</b> people <b>perceive</b> onfacades observed under different conditions? If so, whatmethods {{can be used}} {{and it is possible}} to obtain results ofwider application? 2. How does the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of a facadevary with changing observation conditions? What is the impactof factors such as light conditions, viewing distance andsurrounding colours? 3. How does the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of thehouse, in different situations, differ from the colourcorresponding to the specification of the sample used forselection? Are there any recurring tendencies that can bepresented in a practically useful way? The work was based onabout 3600 observations of painted timber and rendered facades,made by both experienced colour researchers and "naïve"school students, with various daylighting conditions, viewingdistances and seasons. Colour specifications and discussions oncolour attributes were made within the conceptual framework ofthe Natural Colour System (NCS). Inherent colour was measuredby comparison with colour samples placed directly on the facadesurface. Six methods for determination of <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> weredeveloped and evaluated, along with a method for comparison ofperceived and inherent colour. A combination of all gave themost reliable results. Results showed some recurring tendenciesfor <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> to vary with viewing conditions, but thevariations were always smaller than the difference betweenperceived and inherent colour. Consistent variation patternsfor the difference between inherent and <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> werefound for both hue and nuance. Most obvious was that perceivedcolour always had less blackness than inherent colour. Possibleexplanations included differences between the outdoor viewingsituation and the standard situation where inherent colour isdefined, and the observer 9 ̆ 2 s acquired sense of what colours"belong" outdoors. A fuller explanation would require furtherstudies such as of colour perception in different lightsituations, and of three dimensional context effects.

In this work existing metrics that predict the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> difference in digital images of complex scene are studied and compared. Performance evaluation was based on the correlations between values of the metrics and results of subjective tests that were done as a pair comparison, in which fifteen test participants evaluated the subjective colour differences in digital images.

The first chapter of this thesis introduces {{the possibility of using}} a digital computer in conjunction with a colour television monitor to calculate and display the luminance distribution in a lighted room; a system which may offer advantages both for the experienced designer and the student of lighting design. The display system is described briefly, along with some possible shortcomings. An account is given of the methods used for inter-reflection calculation. These inter-reflection calculations are then developed to include colour and techniques of photometric and colorimetric measurement with reference to the television display. A complete description of the display system hardware is also given. This display system as initially designed uses chromaticity as the criterion for colour reproduction. The shortcomings of this approach are discussed. Techniques for <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> measurement are described and the results presented for the <b>colour</b> <b>perceived</b> from some simple display images.

The objective is to describe the <b>perceived</b> <b>colours</b> to be expected in rooms with sunlight and diffused light, and thus develop a tool for colour design. Two empirical investigations provide the basis for six attached papers. The model is exploratory with a qualitative character. One hundred and ninety-one studies were carried out with 79 observers in full-scale rooms, with double-glazed transparent room windows facing north or south. The NCS colour sample collection and colour terminology were used, with three yellow, red, blue and green hues in two nuances: whitish 1010 and more chromatic 1030. The walls were painted in a total of 23 selected inherent colours with each colour observed in up to 10 studies. Colour matching was achieved using a colour reference box and results were analysed with the aid of the terms inherent colour and identity colour. The colour reference box was tested in a separate study to investigate any methodological problems. Room character was described using semantic differentials, and data was processed using the SPSS statistics program. Verbal description using own words was applied in a descriptive and reflecting method to find sensory differences and precise, yet ordinary descriptions. Colour differences between rooms were assessed using verbal description of hue and nuance, and a supplementary method with specified colour samples. Emotional impressions of colour and rooms were assessed using a method describing primary emotions and the results were compared with results from another study using small colour samples. The colouring that enhanced or neutralised room light situation was compared as regards emotional impression and thereafter compared with results from another study. Daylight from the different compass points caused a clear shift in hue and nuance. The <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> was consistently more chromatic and more blackish than the inherent colour used. Nuance 1010 shifted more in chromaticness than nuance, while 1030 instead increased most in chromaticness. Even minor colour differences resulted in major differences in colour experience. The north-facing room in yellowish colours shifted towards reduced yellowishness in both hue and chromaticness. Indications were that north-facing rooms in reddish blue become more reddish than south-facing rooms. QC 2010071...|$|R
