5000|$|The Fort St. Vrain HTGR was {{substantially}} {{more efficient than}} modern light water reactors, reaching a thermal efficiency of 39-40%, excellent for a steam-cycle power plant. Operation of the HTGR design could be readily attenuated to follow the electrical power demand load, rather than be required to generate its <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> all the time. The reactor was also comparatively fuel efficient, with a maximum burnup of 90,000 MW days thermal (compared to Light Water Reactors with burnups of 10,000 - 40,000 MW days thermal). The basis of this improved run time is that the core design [...] "fertilizes" [...] the thorium pellets within the fuel with neutrons, and then burns the bred fissiles through normal neutronic processes without requiring removal from the core. Like all HTGRs, the Fort St. Vrain precluded the possibility of major core damage or radioactive releases in such a quantity that could seriously threaten public safety, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allowed operation with much smaller safety zones compared to LWR designs. It was also notable that plant personnel received negligible exposure to ionizing flux {{during the course of}} operations. Further, the PCRV reflected an innovative RPV that had the potential to be substantially less costly than the metallic RPVs then in service, which were made of expensive nickel-manganese superalloys (e.g. Inconel, Hastelloy, and Monel) in the case of PWRs or surgical grade stainless steel 316L in the case of BWRs. The fuel, by omitting Zircalloy sheathing (allowed due to the inert, non-aqueous core) was made far less expensive.|$|E
40|$|AbstractKey {{differences}} of precisely measuring currents on wafer based solar cells and multi-junction solar cells are shortly described {{at the beginning}} of the paper. In the next section, the impact of precise Standard Test Condition (STC) measurements on the energy yield prediction by PV simulation software is reviewed, with special mention of the Staebler-Wronski Effect. Solar modules containing amorphous silicon absorbers perform in moderate latitudes in a cyclic way: hot season with higher output and cool season with lower output. Both, spectral variations of the irradiance as well as temperature rise during irradiance are reported in literature contributing to this cycling behaviour, which finally is not an issue but a feature of this technology. In consequence, a ‘design to geography’ approach is suggested for module manufacturers, allowing for higher energy yields even without considerably increasing <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> under STC. Standardisation, which highlights the energy yield in addition to STC <b>nameplate</b> <b>power,</b> is identified as urgently needed. A better understanding of amorphous silicon based multi-junction PV modules can only be gained, if more spectrally resolved data acquisition is performed and evaluated for high and low geographic latitudes. Instead of a ‘static’ temperature coefficient, amorphous silicon modules are better characterised with the ‘effective’ temperature coefficient which can become positive e. g. in building integrated heat-insulating PV elements...|$|E

HVAC chillers may be well positioned to provide secondary frequency regulation as a demand side resource. This article describes the experimental development and performance of a practical controller that modifies chiller power demand to provide secondary frequency regulation. Chiller characteristics are identified through testing of a 200 -ton (703 -kWth) chiller serving a commercial building in Boston. Appropriate control strategies are subsequently determined. Controller demonstrations using standard electric system operator test routines show the chiller power response to exceed qualification requirements while providing up to ± 25 % of chiller <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> in secondary frequency regulation capability.

40|$|Abstract—Data centers {{can lower}} costs {{significantly}} by provisioning expensive electrical equipment (such as UPS, diesel generators, and cooling capacity) {{for the actual}} peak power consumption rather than server <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> ratings. However, {{it is possible that}} this under-provisioned power level is exceeded due to software behaviors on rare occasions and could cause the entire data center infrastructure to breach the safety limits. A mechanism to cap servers to stay within the provisioned budget is needed, and processor frequency scaling based power capping methods are readily available for this purpose. We show that existing methods, when applied across a large number of servers, are not fast enough to operate correctly under rapid power dynamics observed in data centers. We also show that existing methods when applied to an open system (where demand is independent of service rate) can cause cascading failures in the software service hosted, causing the service performance to fall uncontrollably even when power capping is applied for only a small reduction in power consumption. We discuss the causes for both these short-comings and point out techniques that can yield a safe, fast, and stable power capping solution. Our techniques use admission control to limit power consumption and ensure stability, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement in performance. We also discuss why admission control cannot replace existing power capping methods but must be combined with them. Keywords-power capping; admission control; frequency scaling; I...|$|E
40|$|In many datacenters, server racks {{are highly}} underutilized. Rack slots are left empty {{to keep the}} sum of the server {{nameplate}} maximum power below the power provisioned to the rack. And the servers that are placed in the rack cannot make full use of available rack power. The root cause of this rack underutilization is that the server <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> is often much higher than can be reached in practice. To address rack underutilization, server vendors are shipping support for per-host power caps, which provide a server-enforced limit on the amount of power that the server can draw. Using this feature, datacenter operators can set power caps on the hosts in the rack to ensure that the sum of those caps does not exceed the rack's provisioned power. While this approach improves rack utilization, it burdens the operator with managing the rack power budget across the hosts and does not lend itself to flexible allocation of power to handle workload usage spikes or to respond to changes in the amount of powered-on server capacity in the rack. In this paper we present CloudPowerCap, a practical and scalable solution for power budget management in a virtualized environment. CloudPowerCap manages the power budget for a cluster of virtualized servers, dynamically adjusting the per-host power caps for hosts in the cluster. We show how CloudPowerCap can provide better use of power than per-host static settings, while respecting virtual machine resource entitlements and constraints.

But how much energy is returned to society (i. e. net energy) by this technology, and which factors contribute the most {{to the amount of}} energy returned? The objective of this thesis was to examine the importance of certain inputs and outputs along the solar panel production chain and their effect on the energy return on (energy) investment (EROI) for crystalline wafer-based photovoltaics. A process-chain model was built using publicly available life-cycle inventory (LCI) datasets. This model has been kept simple in order to ensure transparency. Univariate sensitivity analysis for processes and multivariate case studies was then applied to the model. The results show that photovoltaic EROI values are very sensitive to assumptions regarding location and efficiency. The ability of solar panels to deliver net energy in northern regions of the earth is questionable. Solar cell wafer thickness have a large impact on EROI, with thinner wafers requiring less silicon material. Finding an alternative route for production of solar-grade silicon is also found to be of great importance, as is introduction of kerf loss recycling. Equal system sizes have been found to yield an primary EROI between approximately 5. 5 - 19 depending on location and assumptions. This indicates that a generalized absolute EROI for photovoltaics may be of little use for decision-makers. Using the net energy cliff concept in relation to primary EROI found in this thesis shows that primary EROI rarely decreases to less than the threshold of 8 : 1 in univariate cases. Crystalline photovoltaics under similar system boundaries as those in the thesis model does not necessarily constrain economic growth on an energetic basis...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the gas turbine hybrid vehicle (GTHV) under development at the University of Roma "Sapienza. " A GHTV is an electric vehicle (traction entirely electric on 1 or 2 axles) equipped with a small turbogas operating as a range extender and -when needed- as a recharger for other auxiliaries. After a brief review {{of the history of the}} GTHV technology, a few configurations proposed in the past by different Authors are described and critically analyzed. Then, a complete feasibility assessment of a prototype configuration of a GTHV is presented and discussed in detail. Two possible implementations are studied: one for a small city car (peak power 4 - 8 kW) and one for a sport GT or passenger sedan (50 - 100 kW). All issues related to the system and component design, packaging, identification of the "optimal" hybridization ratio, performance of the conversion chain (gas turbine+batteries+electrical motor), kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS), mechanical and electric storage devices (flywheels, capacitors, advanced batteries), monitoring and control logic, compliance with the European vehicular ECE emission regulations, are explicitly addressed. One of the most important results of this analysis is though that there are several "nearly optimal" solutions and the final choice for a possible future industrialization would be dictated by manufacturing, commercial or marketing considerations. It because not only the system performance, but also the absolute and relative sizes (i. e., <b>nameplate</b> <b>power)</b> of the turbines and of the battery package depend substantially on the type of driving mission the car is required to perform.

40|$|Secondary {{frequency}} {{regulation is}} a necessary electric grid ancillary service that balances electric power system supply and demand on short time intervals of seconds to minutes. Commercial HVAC chillers may be well positioned to provide secondary frequency regulation as a demand side resource. Commercial 200 ton (703 kWth) chillers serving two buildings in the Boston area are used to experimentally develop a practical closed-loop controller that modifies chiller power demand to provide secondary frequency regulation. In the first setup, a physical controller is connected directly to the chiller and adjusts power through chilled water setpoint. In the second setup, both the chiller and air handling units are controlled through the BAS. Demonstrations using standard electric system operator test routines show the chiller power response to exceed qualification requirements while providing up to +/- 25 % of chiller <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> in secondary frequency regulation capability. The controller is further demonstrated to provide secondary frequency regulation continuously for several hours longer than the standard test routines, during which building cooling load changes significantly. Analysis of results indicate minimum power and variable COP as two factors that could be incorporated into future models to more accurately reflect observed chiller transient behaviour and predict performance. BAS communication delays, ramp rate limits, and compressor cycling are additional factors that can have significant negative impacts on controller performance. Extrapolation of experiment results to higher-level analysis indicates that chillers {{can contribute to the}} secondary frequency regulation requirements at the grid level in aggregate, although potential varies greatly depending on climate and building type. There is more potential in the south, where 21 % of secondary frequency regulation requirements might be met with chillers; the contribution of chillers in colder climates is minimal. Short-term power balance to achieve stability is essential for the operation of the modern electrical power system. Providing stability through modified control of existing HVAC chillers in commercial buildings is a technologically feasible alternative to existing solutions and can make a meaningful contribution to the electrical grid. by Po-An (Leo) Su.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project was to combine the ease-of-installation and ease-of-use {{attributes}} of industrial induction motors with the low-loss and small size and weight advantages of PM motors to create an ultra-efficient, high power density industrial motor that can be started across-the-line or operated from a standard, Volts/Hertz drive {{without the need for}} a rotor position feedback device. PM motor products that are currently available are largely variable speed motors that require a special adjustable speed drive with rotor position feedback. The reduced size and weight helps to offset the magnet cost in order make these motors commercially viable. The scope of this project covers horsepower ratings from 20 ? 500. Prototypes were built and tested at ratings ranging from 30 to 250 HP. Since fans, pumps and compressors make up a large portion of industrial motor applications, the motor characteristics are tailored to those applications. Also, since there is extensive use of adjustable frequency inverters in these applications, there is the opportunity to design for an optimal pole number and operate at other than 60 Hz frequency when inverters are utilized. Designs with four and eight pole configurations were prototyped as part of this work. Four pole motors are the most commonly used configuration in induction motors today. The results of the prototype design, fabrication, and testing were quite successful. The 50 HP rating met all of the design goals including efficiency and power density. Tested values of motor losses at 50 HP were 30 % lower than energy efficient induction motors and the motor weight is 35 % lower than the energy efficient induction motor of the same rating. Further, when tested at the 30 HP rating that is normally built in this 286 T frame size, the efficiency far exceeds the project design goals with 30 HP efficiency levels indicating a 55 % reduction in loss compared to energy efficient motors with a motor weight that is a few percentage points lower than the energy efficient motor. This 30 HP rating full load efficiency corresponds to a 46 % reduction in loss compared to a 30 HP NEMA Premium? efficient motor. The cost goals were to provide a two year or shorter efficiency-based payback of a price premium associated with the magnet cost in these motors. That goal is based on 24 / 7 operation with a cost of electricity of 10 cents per kW-hr. Similarly, the 250 HP prototype efficiency testing was quite successful. In this case, the efficiency was maximized with a slightly less aggressive reduction in active material. The measured full load efficiency of 97. 6 % represents in excess of a 50 % loss reduction compared to the equivalent NEMA Premium Efficiency induction motor. The active material weight reduction was a respectable 14. 5 % figure. This larger rating demonstrated both the scalability of this technology and also the ability to flexibly trade off power density and efficiency. In terms of starting performance, the 30 ? 50 HP prototypes were very extensively tested. The demonstrated capability included the ability to successfully start a load with an inertia of 25 times the motor?s own inertia while accelerating against a load torque following a fan profile at the motor?s full <b>nameplate</b> <b>power</b> rating. This capability will provide very wide applicability of this motor technology. The 250 HP prototype was also tested for starting characteristics, though without a coupled inertia and load torque. As a result it was not definitively proven that the same 25 times the motor?s own inertia could be started and synchronized successfully at 250 HP. Finite element modeling implies that this load could be successfully started, but it has not yet been confirmed by a test...|$|E

Demand response reduced CO₂ /SO₂ emissions levels 3 % by enabling 11 % more generation of wind power. Demand resources representing 25 % of <b>nameplate</b> wind <b>power</b> and priced at 150 % of a gas turbine's marginal cost were a recommended combination that balanced maximum system improvement at minimal ratepayer impact. The system cost benefits of each study case enabled the calculation of a demand curve representing the system operator's willingness to pay fixed costs for capacity from the pool of operating savings. With demand response, wind generators increased profits, coal plants reduced profits slightly, and natural gas plant profit was cut to almost zero. With high levels of unpredictable renewable resources and limited ability to import power, demand response represents a promising technique to balance the grid at low cost. by D. Karl Critz.
