For this, demolished concrete blocks from 33 different sites were collected and crushed into coarse aggregates. As virgin aggregate, first class brick aggregates (<b>normal</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate) were investigated. About 350 concrete cylinders of diameter 150 mm and height 300 mm were made using normal and recycled brick aggregates with W/C= 0. 45 and 0. 55. Test items include slump, unit weight, compressive strength, tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and stress-strain curve. For W/C = 0. 55, recycled brick aggregate concrete shows lower compressive strength compared to the <b>normal</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate concrete. The results are improved for W/C= 0. 45. The average strength of recycled brick aggregate concrete is found at 25. 5 MPa (3700 psi) and 20. 7 MPa (3000 psi) for W/C= 0. 45 and 0. 55 respectively.

40|$|Despite {{their poor}} performance, {{non-standard}} clay bricks {{are commonly used}} in construction of low-rise buildings and rural houses in Indonesia. These clay bricks are produced traditionally in home industries. Indonesia is located in an active seismic region and many masonry buildings were badly damaged or collapsed during recent earthquakes. Such buildings are classified as non-engineered structures as they are built without using any proper design standard. Lateral load response of un-reinforced masonry walls is investigated in this research project, {{with the aim of}} better understanding the behaviour of these masonry walls using low quality local bricks. A comprehensive experimental program was undertaken with masonry wall elements of 600 mm x 600 mm x 110 mm constructed from local bricks from Cikarang in West Java - Indonesia. Wall specimens were constructed and tested under a combination of constant vertical compression load and increasing horizontal or lateral in-plane loads, of monotonic, repeated and cyclical nature. The vertical compressive loading was limited to 4 % of maximum brick compressive strength. Masonry mortar mix used to construct the specimens was prepared according to Indonesian National Standard. Three different types of masonry wall panels were considered, (i) (<b>normal)</b> <b>brick</b> masonry walls, (ii) surface mortared brick masonry walls and (iii) comforted surface mortared brick masonry walls. The results indicated that the lateral load bearing capacity of masonry wall is usually lower than that of mortared and comforted walls. Despite this, the lateral load capacity under cyclic loads decreased 50 % of the average capacity of the walls under monotonic and repeated lateral loads. Using the results from the experimental program, a simplified model for the equivalent diagonal spring stiffness of local clay brick walls was developed. This stiffness model derived from experimental results in then used to simplify the structural analysis of clay brick wall panels in Indonesia. The design guideline for brick masonry houses and low-rise buildings in six Indonesian seismic zones was developed, as a contribution towards the development of design guidance for constructing brick masonry houses in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Wall {{structure}} plays {{important roles}} in supporting the superstructures, separates spaces in buildings into sections and delineates a space in open air. Most {{of the construction of}} house in Malaysia use bricks and mortar which consists of cement, aggregates and water as the materials to build the structure of wall. However, cement and bricks manufacturing process will contribute to a high emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2) which may lead to global warming. Therefore, objective {{of this paper is to}} find an alternative solution to reduce this environmental problem. The alternative way that can solve the problem is by replacing the use of bricks in building construction by plastic bottles filled with sand as we called it plastic bottle green house. Reuse of these non-biodegradable plastic bottles not only can solve the environmental problem, but it can also reduce the pollution. The main concern of this project is the strength of bottle bricks. Therefore, there were two types of experiments were used to evaluate the properties of bricks and plastic bottle filled with sand which are compression test and temperature test in indoor and outdoor of wall structure. The compression test is prepared for 1. 5 L bottle brick, 250 ml bottle brick and common clay brick. As a results, the strength of 1. 5 L and 250 ml bottle bricks is 3 and 4 times respectively stronger compare to common clay brick. The comparison of indoor and outdoor wall temperature, air humidity and wind velocity between the plastic bottle green house and <b>normal</b> <b>brick</b> house has indicate that plastic bottle has recorded highest reading for outdoor wall temperature with 36 °C and lowest reading on outdoor humidity and outdoor wind velocity with 78 % and 0. 8 m/s respectively.

40|$|Present study {{attempted}} {{to verify the}} feasibility of producing cement blocks by partially replacing fine aggregates with carbon black contaminated silica sand (CBCSS), which is a by-product of the tyre manufacturing process. In the present study performance tests such as compressive testing and flexural testing were conducted. In addition resistance against rain drops was measured {{and the quality of}} water, in case of inundation was also checked. As experimental investigations, eight individual black blocks were cast and tested for compressive strength and nine sample panels were made and tested for flexural and compressive strengths. In addition, pressurized drizzle test was conducted for individual blocks to study the erosion resistance characteristics against rain. Moreover, particularly in lower lands, during floods there is a room for these panels containing CBCSS being immersed under water for certain days. The present study accommodated the above through water quality test and the results were verified with drinking water specifications. Compressive strength of individual black blocks was 4. 74 N/mm 2, which is well above to that of the minimum requirement of 1. 2 N/mm 2 as per the SLS 855 : Part 1 : 1989. These blocks, according to the Sri Lankan Standard, could be used for both load bearing walls for up to two storeys and in any non-load bearing walls. The flexural strength parallel to the bed joint was 0. 113 N/mm 2, which is just below the recommended characteristic flexural strength of 0. 2 N/mm 2 as per the BS 5628. The flexural strength perpendicular to the bed joint was 0. 61 N/mm 2, which is higher than the recommended characteristic flexural strength of 0. 4 N/mm 2 as per the BS 5628. The pressure drizzle test being done to the black blocks was shown smaller indentation after one hour to that of a <b>normal</b> <b>brick</b> at 50 kPa pressure, which revealed a fact that black blocks are rather resistive in terms of indentation to rain to that of normal bricks. Water, in which the black blocks were immersed for three days, satisfied the standard levels for drinkable water, recommended by the SLS 614 - 1983, which implies the fact that black blocks would not release any additional pollutants to the existing water/flood. Hence, it shall be concluded that the black blocks could be used in constructing masonry walls...|$|E

It has been restored from 1995 - 1997. The choir from 1498 is still intact and is a national monument. The church is the presumed to be the tomb of Hildeware, Countess of Rode, from 1507. This was the foundress of the first church. There are some Baroque paintings and a and font in the interior from the 12th century. There is also an organ of 1839, produced by Frans Smits. This was restored in 2001.|$|R
40|$|The OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion tRacking Apparatus) {{experiment}} {{is a long}} baseline neutrino oscillation experiment {{that was designed to}} perform a conclusive test of the νμ → ντ oscillations hypothesis. The main aim of this {{experiment is}} a direct observation of τ leptons in ντ charged-current interactions. A good electromagnetic shower reconstruction is important for the τ detection in the τ → e decay channel. So far, 4 ντ candidates have been observed in the OPERA detector with a background of 0. 23 events. Given the number of analyzed events and the low background, νμ → ντ oscillations are established with a significance of 4. 2 σ. Reconstruction of electromagnetic showers is one of the fundamental tools needed by neutrino experiments and the estimation of their energy is a crucial issue. This is also true for the OPERA experiment where we have developed and tested an algorithm, in order to evaluate the energy of electron through the identification of its shower for the τ → e decay channel as well as νe interactions by using the OPERA <b>bricks.</b> <b>Normal</b> reconstruction of a shower event depends upon the shower being contained in one brick. However, when a shower is initiated in the upstream portion of the brick, the shower will begin in the first brick, pass through the Electronic Detector (ED) and end in the second brick; making normal reconstruction methods unusable. Nearly half of the electromagnetic shower events detected take place across two bricks, meaning that previously, half of detected events had to be discarded. I have expanded my code in such a way to analyze showers with one or two brick distributions, allowing us to include 50 percent more events in our data sets. This approach is using {{for the first time the}} information of the downstream brick to reconstruct and estimate the energy of electromagnetic showers in the OPERA experiment...|$|R
40|$|The Khorāsān, a vast {{territory}} covering northern Afghanistan, north-eastern Iran {{and some}} parts of Central Asia, now {{is limited to a}} region in the north-eastern modern Iran divided into three provinces; i. e., Razavi Khorāsān, North Khorāsān and South Khorāsān. From {{the last quarter of the}} twelfth century to the first quarter of the thirteenth century, this territory was in the hands of Khwārazmshāhids in a short interval between the Seljuk and Mongol periods. The history of the Khwārazmshāhids began with the Anush Tigin reign in 1077 AD and declined in 1220 AD by the Mongol conquest, and at the summit of this period their land stretched from the Zagros Mountains (west of Iran) to the borders of India. During the Khwārazmshāhid period, several important buildings were erected of which six have been survived in Khorasan; i. e., the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād, the Zuzan mosque, the Farumad Mosque, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows and the Khosrowshir mosque. The Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād (1212 AD) and the Zuzan mosque show a typical style of this period; the two-iwan plan that these mosques are based on, and brickwork combined with insets glazed ornaments to cover the facades. Accordingly, the Farumad Mosque, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows and the Khosrowshir mosque can be built or decorated in the Khwārazmshāhid period. The results obtained from on site investigations showed that the arranged, borida and tarāshida (forming the brick-based elements to create the patterns by cutting and carving the <b>normal</b> fired <b>brick</b> respectively) are the techniques widely used in the pre-Khwārazmshāhid buildings. The pish-shekli (forming the wet brick paste by cutting, engraving, moulding, etc. before any firing treatment) is another technique for producing brick-based ornaments before the Khwārazmshāhids. Besides, engraving the surface of plain brick courses, the so-called pas-tarāshida technique, is also employed to create the decorative patterns at a few monuments before and contemporary with the Khwārazmshāhid period beyond the Khorāsān's frontiers. As far as the architectural decorations of above-mentioned monuments are concerned, the pish-shekli and borida bricks are mainly used to decoratethe Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād while borida and tarāshida bricks decorate the façades of the madrasa/mosque of Zuzan where the found pish-shekli elements are attributed to its destroyed pre-Khwārazmshāhid buildings. The glazed ornaments of the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād (hobnail and small triangular pieces) are turquoise in colour although turquoise, blue-dark and white glazes with different shapes are used to decorate the façades of the Zuzan mosque. In addition, brickwork combined with glazed elements decorates the undated above-mentioned monuments. The majority of the brick-based embellishments at the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows and Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin are pish-shekli elements with different shapes, sizes and motifs combined with glazed ornaments. The pish-shekli bricks at the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows contain geometric patterns and the triangular turquoise glazed pieces are cut from an older inscription. In the contrary, the pish-shekli bricks at the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin are composed of floral patterns (with less frequent geometric patterns and epigraphy) with special shapes. The glazed ornaments of this mosque are some circular elements on which the word al-Molk is applied. On the other hand, the brickwork in the mosque of Farumad are executed in moulded and stamped pish-shekli elements with geometric and floral patterns however there are two friezes with carved pish-shekli elements in this monument. Insets with glazed ornaments (turquoise and less frequent dark-blue, lustre and underglazed painted) are occasionally employed to decorate the façades of the courtyard of the Farumad mosque. Moreover, in the semi-ruined mosque of Khosrowshir, beside the moulded and stamped brick-based decorations, similar to those at the Farumad mosque, the carved pish-shekli and tarāshida bricks are also employed. Likewise, two glazed architectural decorations were found in the surface survey around this mosque. Analytical studies took another important part of studies performed on the brickwork and glazed ornaments of the above-mentioned monuments. More than hundred samples, including brickwork decorations, glazed elements, structural bricks and glaze together with local clays were collected were subject of various analytical methods such as wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Besides, micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-Raman), micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX) and thin section petrography were used to respond to the occasional technological questions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to handle the compositional data of the bodies and glazes. Handling the data obtained by WDXRF by PCA, the bodies were classfied into two main categories in terms of the SiO 2 concentration; that is, clay bodies and stone-paste bodies. Accordingly, beside the clay-based brickwork, the glazed decorations of the mosques of Gonābād, Ferdows and Khosrowshir were made on stone-paste bodies while those of the Zuzan mosque were applied on both clay-based and stone-paste bodies. Moreover, the results showed that the chemical composition of the samples of the Gonābād, Khosrowshir and Zuzan were different while the Ferdows’ samples were grouped with those of the Zuzan mosque. Moreover, statistically handling the WDXRF data on the clay bodies, it was proved that most of clay bodies were made of local clays except the samples of the Zuzan mosque. Furthermore, WDXRF, performed on the clay-bodies, showed that most of the samples of the Farumad mosque, with three exceptions, were grouped in a separate cluster. A strong correlation of Mg and Cr accounted for the clay bodies of the Farumad mosque showed that the clay used in the bodies was most probably supplied from the local clay sources near Farumad. Concerning the glazes, cross sections of the glazed bodies under polarised light microscope showed a priming white layer between bodies and glazes in most of the stone-paste samples. Moreover, the ICP-MS results suggested that cobalt and copper were the main colouring agents of the glazes which are responsible for dark-blue and turquoise colours respectively. Handling the ICP-MS data by PCA, it was shown that all the glazes were basically alkali in nature to which Pb and Sn were added to opacify some glazes. The reddish (or buff) colour of the clay bodies was, in fact, covered with tin-opacified glazes to cover the reddish colour of the bodies although opacified glazes were occasionally observed on stone-paste bodies...|$|R
