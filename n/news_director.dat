5|$|Liaising with NBN <b>News</b> <b>director</b> Jim Sullivan, NBN Late Edition News {{producer}} Matt Carden {{secured a}} live feed through the Nine Network of ABC America enabling first pictures to be aired of the New York attacks within minutes.

40|$|Abstract A {{recent study}} on the {{perceptions}} of professional seals of approval among television weathercasters provides {{some insight into the}} rarely-studied field of broadcast meteorology. The study provides one perspective (weathercasters), but {{it is also important to}} consider the opinions of clients (viewers) and employers (<b>news</b> <b>directors).</b> While weathercasters appear to have strong feelings about each of the two major seals of approval, the viewers and <b>news</b> <b>directors</b> tend to place more importance on other factors...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of media {{in the lives of}} {{consumers}} has been a longstanding concern of various scholars. Although the news media do not tell consumers what to think explicitly, they do imply what consumers should think, via the contexts in which news is presented. The central thrust of this thesis is a psychological and sociological perception study of news directors’ implicit and explicit perceptions of race when creating news content. The aim is to discover whether an implicit or explicit racial bias can be found amongst some <b>news</b> <b>directors</b> when covering racial minority groups. A better understanding of bias provides valuable insights on what media practices to utilize when covering diverse groups. Results lacked support that <b>news</b> <b>directors</b> exhibited any form of racial bias. Although the general assumption of the study was unsupported, the study provided possible realms for future research to study the history of negative perceptions of mass media content in terms of racial minority groups. This study has contributed and provided substantial support that broadcast <b>news</b> <b>directors</b> at network affiliate stations do not exhibit implicit or explicit racial bias...|$|R

40|$|Every year, {{thousands}} {{of college students}} head to television newsrooms to work as interns {{to learn from the}} professionals. Back on campus, they sit in classes and listen to professors who, many times, have not been in a television newsroom themselves for years and years. This research looks at faculty internships. In this pilot-study, the television <b>news</b> <b>directors</b> in North Carolina were surveyed to learn if they would welcome such interns into their newsroom, what they would allow them to do, how they see the college or university faculty intern as both a challenge and a risk. Results indicated that <b>news</b> <b>directors</b> would welcome the wisdom and contributions of mid-career interns. Included in this research are lessons learned from a small sample of faculty who have devoted part of their summer breaks working back in the field.
