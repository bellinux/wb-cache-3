40|$|Central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> greatly {{contribute}} to overall network efficiency. Here we examined whether small vessel disease (SVD) related white matter alterations in central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> {{have a greater}} impact on executive functioning than alterations in non-central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections.</b> Brain <b>networks</b> were reconstructed from diffusion-weighted MRI scans in 72 individuals (75 ± 8 years) with cognitive impairment and SVD on MRI. The centrality of white matter <b>connections</b> in the <b>network</b> was defined using graph theory. The association between the fractional anisotropy (FA) of central versus non-central connections, executive functioning, and markers of SVD was evaluated with linear regression and mediation analysis. Lower FA in central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> was more strongly associated with impairment in executive functioning than FA in non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> (r = 0. 41 vs. r = 0. 27; P 50 %– 10 % connections). Higher SVD burden was associated with lower FA in central as well as non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections.</b> However, only central network FA mediated the relationship between white matter hyperintensity volume and executive functioning [change in regression coefficient after mediation (95 % CI) : − 0. 15 (− 0. 35 to − 0. 02) ]. The mediation effect was not observed for FA alterations in non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> [− 0. 03 (− 0. 19 to 0. 04) ]. These findings suggest that the centrality of <b>network</b> <b>connections,</b> and thus their contribution to global network efficiency, appears to be relevant for understanding the relationship between SVD and cognitive impairment.

This library checks the BTI.INI file to see if it needs to access data on the local system or whether it needs to access data on a remote server. If it needs to access the server, then it uses the Windows version of DPMI to access a DOS-based requester named BREQUEST.EXE. The requester then establishes a <b>network</b> <b>connection</b> to the server, which processes the request and passes back a message to the requester when the database request is completed.|$|E

25|$|Remote Desktop Services (RDS), {{known as}} Terminal Services in Windows Server 2008 and earlier, {{is one of}} the {{components}} of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a <b>network</b> <b>connection.</b> RDS is Microsoft's implementation of thin client, where Windows software, and the entire desktop of the computer running RDS, are made accessible to a remote client machine that supports Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDS, only software user interfaces are transferred to the client system. All input from the client system is transmitted to the server, where software execution takes place. This is in contrast to application streaming systems, like Microsoft App-V, in which computer programs are streamed to the client on-demand and executed on the client machine.|$|E

Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States Government Department of Defense (DoD) created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information.|$|E
