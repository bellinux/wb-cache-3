40|$|The modern {{reformulation}} of Classical {{analysis of}} value and distribution built upon Sraffa’s Production of Commodities provides quite a general and open framework to study distributive relationships, that {{deserves to be}} still explored. The present work aims to go through these relationships according to the perspective ensuing from the notion of “natural economic system”, developed by Pasinetti. The natural economic system {{is a sort of}} ideal configuration, which allows to accomplish the potentialities of the production system concerning growth, employment and the satisfaction of final wants. Actual (capitalist) economies do not normally fulfil the “natural” configuration. But this configuration can be considered a reference point in order to discriminate between the conditions that have to be verified for the system to reproduce itself and grow according to its potentialities, and the conditions that have to be regarded as pertaining to the institutional sphere. On this perspective several indications can be drawn on various aspects. In this work we shall focus on the normative conclusions that can be drawn about income distribution. Firstly a description of the characteristics and the implications of the “natural” configuration of income distribution will be provided: we will focus on natural rates of profit (which are differentiated among sectors), on the natural level of wages and on the natural rate of interest. Secondly we will depict some instruments to orientate the actual set-up of capitalistic economies towards the natural configuration. In particular we will develop a notion of uniform <b>natural</b> <b>profit</b> rate and we will describe the consequent necessary (“natural”) financial system which allows the natural accumulation of capital to be realized in a capitalistic context, where profit rates tend to be uniform. ...|$|E

Economists such as Milton Friedman have argued that <b>natural</b> selection favors <b>profit</b> maximizing firms over firms engaging in other behaviors. Consequently, producer efficiency, and therefore Pareto efficiency, are justified on evolutionary grounds. We examine these claims in an evolutionary general equilibrium model. If the economic environment were held constant, profitable firms would grow and unprofitable firms would shrink. In the general equilibrium model, prices change as factor demands and output supply evolves. Without capital markets, when firms can grow only through retained earnings, our model verifies Friedman's claim that <b>natural</b> selection favors <b>profit</b> maximization. But we show through examples that this {{does not imply that}} equilibrium allocations converge over time to efficient allocations. Consequently, Koopmans critique of Friedman is correct. When capital markets are added, and firms grow by attracting investment, Friedman's claim may fail.

60|$|As I did not, Sir, deny to the {{paymaster}} the <b>natural</b> <b>profits</b> of {{the bank}} that was in his hands, so neither would I to the Bank of England. A share of that profit might be derived {{to the public in}} various ways. My favorite mode is this: that, in compensation for the use of this money, the bank may take upon themselves, first, the charge of the Mint, to which they are already, by their charter, obliged to bring in a great deal of bullion annually to be coined. In the next place, I mean that they should take upon themselves the charge of remittances to our troops abroad. This is a species of dealing from which, by the same charter, they are not debarred. One and a quarter per cent will be saved instantly thereby to the public on very large sums of money. This will be at once a matter of economy and a considerable reduction of influence, by taking away a private contract of an expensive nature. If the Bank, which is a great corporation, and of course receives the least profits from the money in their custody, should of itself refuse or be persuaded to refuse this offer upon those terms, I can speak with some confidence that one at least, if not both parts of the condition would be received, and gratefully received, by several bankers of eminence. There is no banker who will not be at least as good security as any paymaster of the forces, or any treasurer of the navy, that have ever been bankers to the public: as rich at least as my Lord Chatham, or my Lord Holland, or either of the honorable gentlemen who now hold the offices, were at the time that they entered into them; or as ever the whole establishment of the Mint has been at any period.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} wealth appears and reappears in Ricardo’s works within three {{different}} sets of arguments. One {{is concerned with the}} distinction between wealth and value, another with the causes of the progress of wealth, the third with the consequences of this progress on the trend of <b>natural</b> wages, <b>profit</b> and rent. Ricardo deals with these subjects sometimes in agreement and sometimes in disagreement with Smith. The agreement reaches a climax on the notion of wealth as such {{as well as on the}} causes of its progress while the disagreement ramifies into the foundations both of that distinction and of the resulting conclusions on the trend of <b>natural</b> wages, <b>profits</b> and rent. This entry will focus on the details of Ricardo’s agreements and disagreements with Smith on the subject of wealth as distinct from the close subject of value. We will prove that, except for some minor differences, Ricardo’s notion of wealth is the same as Smith’s. As such, it is used by Ricardo as synonymous with the notion of the “annual produce of the land and labour”, or of the “necessaries, conveniences and amusements of human life”, available in a country in a period. This coincidence permeates Ricardo’s theory of wealth in so far as this theory is focused on the progress, as distinct from the distribution, of wealth. Thus, starting from a similar theory of wealth but from a very different theory of value, Ricardo develops some of his criticisms of Adam Smith’s theory on the basis of his distinction between value and riches (wealth) as well as of his exclusive notion of rent as a price paid to the owner of land “for the use of its original and indestructible powers”. These criticisms are consistent with Ricardo’s starting point on value as labour embodied and are in contrast with Smith’s different starting point on value as labour commanded.

By adopting this approach it is possible to show that the structural economic dynamics is conditioned not only to patterns of evolving demand and diffusion of technological progress but also to the distributive features of the economy, which can give rise to different regimes of economic growth.

It also gives a new interpretation of Part III of this last work. The main conclusions are first, that Marx had an intrinsic explanation of the falling rate of profit but was unable to give it a satisfactory demonstration and second, that he had a number of subsidiary explanations of which the most important was resource scarcity.

The model is used to simulate the effects of typical structural adjustment policies: a reduction in agro-chemicals subsidies, reduced implicit export tax rate, a devaluation of the currency, a cut in governmental expenditure and a reduction of foreign transfers. The result of a joint implementation is a 9 percent higher GDP level compared to the baseline scenario after 10 years. The effect of soil degradation is found to represent a reduction in the GDP level of more than 5 percent for the same time period.

The WILMAR stochastic unit commitment model was used to represent {{a version of the}} Danish electricity and heat system with an enhanced level of wind generation. The study found that demand response reduced the marginal operating cost of the electrical system 3 %. Demand response reduced CO₂ /SO₂ emissions levels 3 % by enabling 11 % more generation of wind power. Demand resources representing 25 % of nameplate wind power and priced at 150 % of a gas turbine's marginal cost were a recommended combination that balanced maximum system improvement at minimal ratepayer impact. The system cost benefits of each study case enabled the calculation of a demand curve representing the system operator's willingness to pay fixed costs for capacity from the pool of operating savings. With demand response, wind generators increased profits, coal plants reduced <b>profits</b> slightly, and <b>natural</b> gas plant <b>profit</b> was cut to almost zero.

This project brings a trans-hemispheric approach to composition history by developing a theory of "frontier rhetoric" as a lens for analysis. Used to describe the rhetorical strategies that emphasize narratives of progress to disenfranchise others, frontier rhetoric allows us to examine {{the ways in which}} colonialism is embedded within institutions and reproduced by curriculum and policies. In the case of UA, institutional stakeholders envisioned their university as an Americanization project that both opened up Arizona’s <b>natural</b> resources to <b>profit,</b> while creating a citizenry devoted to defending their country. In the case of UNM, we see a subtler manifestation of frontier rhetorics, such as in the way Spanish was emphasized for the purposes of sending multilingual teachers out into the primarily Spanish speaking regions of the territory. An analysis of the students' curricular and extra-curricular writing from this time shows that students had the opportunity to challenge and resist frontier rhetorics through newspaper writing. The curricular and extra-curricular use of public genres such as newspapers allows students to take {{a more active role in}} negotiating their own understandings of citizenship and community engagement. Finally, this dissertation connects these histories to the present by discussing the ways in which writing program administrators can use frontier rhetoric to assess the inclusivity of their programs and adopt a translingual orientation in an effort to combat monolingual mentalities. This history makes visible the ways in which colonial legacies are embedded within our educational institutions, challenges the Eurocentric tendencies of composition histories, and offers new perspectives on the ways in which rhetorical education can both reproduce and resist oppressive attitudes about language, race, and culture...|$|R
40|$|Decentralisation, or "going local " {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} known is being seen in many quarters {{as the answer to}} the seemingly faceless bureaucracy and inefficiency that so often characterises local government. This article examines the rapid rise of the going-local initiatives which have become increasingly popular in many parts of England, and looks at the implications for Scottish local government. We do this by looking at the inability of local government to deliver a sufficiently high standard of service, with adequate accountability to local people, and importantly the steps which have been taken by some authorities to correct this. We also touch-albeit very briefly- on the potential of decentralisation as a vehicle for social and political change. Finally, we examine a case study; Edinburgh District Council's detailed strategy for going local. What's wrong with local government? Most politicians of all parties would agree that there is a problem. They would accept that local authorities tend to be too remote and inflexible, a bureaucracy which provides services to the public which are often less than satisfactory. Politicians whilst agreeing that a problem exists, do of course, fundamentally disagree when it comes to problem-solving. Broadly speaking their responses can be categorised as follows: Cut it? This school of thought believes that the "frontiers of the state "-including the local state- should be rolled back. Privatisation of many local authority services would provide the freedom for ratepayers to spend their money as they like. The rationale implied here thus sti·esses not only ideological commitment, but also an economic one, in that inefficient local authority services should be supplanted by the private sector operating within a free market according to the <b>natural</b> laws of <b>profit.</b> (This view, is of course, generally accepted as current Government policy).

This transdisciplinary panel aims at investigating inner tensions in the deployment of capitalism in past and present rural Congo, both within and beyond the porous boundaries of the concessions, mines and stations where its actors and agents live(d) and work(ed). Each paper is articulated around a different enclave and a different natural resource – timber, copper, diamonds, palm oil, elephants, biodiversity – yet all are bound by similar lines of enquiry. They focus on the disjuncture between ambitions and effective results, highlighting the different limitations that competing agendas, local communities and an uncontrolled nature can pose to economic prospects. They underline the key importance of affects, emotions, hopes and anxieties in the effective enforcement of extraction or conservation. Furthermore, they grasp spaces and resources not merely as economic battlefields, but as always invested with feelings and meanings that are often at odds with “rational” exploitation prospects. In an effort to move beyond epistemological boundaries that have long separated research on pre and post-independence Congo, participants also articulate present situations within the long-term legacies of colonialism, pushing against the disciplinary divide between history and anthropology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{on earth}} {{strongly}} {{depends on the}} radiative balance of its atmosphere, and, thus, on the abundance of the radiatively active greenhouse gases. Largely due to human activities since the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric burden of many greenhouse gases has increased dramatically. Direct measurements during the last decades and analysis of ancient air trapped in ice from polar regions allow to quantify the change of these trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere. From a presumably "undisturbed" pre-industrial situation several hundred years ago until today, the CO 2 mixing ratio increased by almost 30 %. In the last decades this increase was nearly exponential, leading to a global mean CO 2 mixing ratio of almost 370 ppm {{by the turn of}} the millenium. The atmospheric abundance of CO 2 the main greenhouse gas containing carbon, is strongly controlled by exchange with the organic and inorganic carbon reservoirs. The world oceans are definitely the most important carbon reservoir, with a buffering capacity for atmospheric CO 2 largest on time scales of centuries and longer. In contrast, the buffering capacity of the terrestrial biosphere is largest on shorter time scales from decades to centuries. Although today equally important, the role of the terrestrial biosphere as a sink of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions is still poorly understood. Any prediction of future climate strongly relies on an accurate knowledge of the greenhouse gas concentrations in the present day atmosphere, and of their development in the future. This implies the need to quantitatively understand their natural geophysical and biochemical cycles including the important perturbations by man's impact. In attempting to disentangle the complexity of these cycles, Radiocarbon observations have played a crucial role as an experimental tool enlightening the spatial and temporal variability of carbon sources and sinks. Studies of the “undisturbed” <b>natural</b> carbon cycle <b>profit</b> from the radioactive decay of 14 C in using it as a dating tracer, e. g. to determine the turnover time of soil organic matter or to study internal mixing rates of the global oceans. Moreover, the anthropogenic disturbance of 14 C through atmospheric bomb tests has served as an invaluable tracer to get insight into the global carbon cycle on the decadal time scale...|$|R
40|$|Background: In agriculture, {{information}} about the spatial distribution of crop height is valuable for applications such as biomass and yield estimation, or increasing field work efficiency in terms of fertilizing, applying pesticides, irrigation, etc. Established methods for capturing crop height often comprise restrictions in terms of cost and time efficiency, flexibility, and temporal and spatial resolution of measurements. Furthermore, crop height is mostly derived from a measurement of the bare terrain prior to plant growth and measurements of the crop surface when plants are growing, resulting in the need of multiple field campaigns. In our study, we examine a method to derive crop heights directly from data of a plot of full grown maize plants captured in a single field campaign. We assess continuous raster crop height models (CHMs) and individual plant heights derived from data collected with the low-cost 3 D camera Microsoft® Kinect® for Xbox One™ based on a comprehensive comparison to terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) reference data. Results: We examine single measurements captured with the 3 D camera and {{a combination of the}} single measurements, i. e. a combination of multiple perspectives. The quality of both CHMs, and individual plant heights is improved by combining the measurements. R 2 of CHMs derived from single measurements range from 0. 48 to 0. 88, combining all measurements leads to an R 2 of 0. 89. In case of individual plant heights, an R 2 of 0. 98 is achieved for the combined measures (with R 2  =  0. 44 for the single measurements). The crop heights derived from the 3 D camera measurements comprise an average underestimation of 0. 06  m compared to TLS reference values. Conclusion: We recommend the combination of multiple low-cost 3 D camera measurements, removal of measurement artefacts, and the inclusion of correction functions {{to improve the quality of}} crop height measurements. Operating low-cost 3 D cameras under field conditions on agricultural machines or on autonomous platforms can offer time and cost efficient tools for capturing the spatial distribution of crop heights directly in the field and subsequently to advance agricultural efficiency and productivity. More general, all processes which include the 3 D geometry of <b>natural</b> objects can <b>profit</b> from low-cost methods producing 3 D geodata...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze the Chilean {{privatization}} process as a whole. Since {{it has been a}} wide-ranging process, we examine its different aspects. After a historic review of the privatization pro-cess,we study the 37 Chilean State Owned Enterprises (SOE’s) that were privatized during the period 1981 - 2000 and for which pre-privatization and post-privatization financial, employment and productive data are available. We show that these firms behaved no differently from the average firm in their economic sectors after privatization, implying that they were efficient SOE’s. The large increase in profitability of privatized firms {{can be explained by the}} performance of firms in the regulated sector. In particular, employment in these firms increased after privatization, showing that they were no overmanned under government control. We show that the profitability in the sector is due to the more efficient use of physical capital and by the fact that the regulators were unable to transfer these gains to consumers. Next, we examine the effects of the privatization of social services. We analyze in detail the effects of privatization on the performance of telecommunications and the electric sector. We find confirmation of the fact that in the regulated, <b>natural</b> monopoly sectors <b>profits</b> increased, whereas sectors that are characterized by competition, profits have been lower. Nevertheless, regulated firms are fairly efficient, implying that incentive regulation has been successful. Another privatization process involved infrastructure, where the main highways and ports have been franchised successfully, and where the benefits in terms of reduced transportation costs will increase the efficiency of the economy as a whole. Next we study the effects of the privatization of the pension system, the health insurance system and of educa-tion through a voucher system. We find that the big benefit of the pension system is that pensions can no longer be expropriated by the political system, but that the system is expensive, though costs have fallen lately. The private health insurance system has not been a big success due to the information asymmetries that plague health care, but have had the beneficial effect of showing the inefficiencies of the public system and thus putting pressure on it to improve. Similarly, the use of vouchers has not been shown unequivocally to lead to a better education system (though there is some evidence that this is so), but has put pressure on the public system to improve. More-over,vouchers would be more effective if parents were informed of the results of their children in standardized tests and if public schools were able to fire bad teachers. Finally, the increased competition in higher education has led to improvements in the quality of the traditional State financed institutions and to a large increase in the coverage of higher education. ...|$|R
