40|$|Authoritarianism {{is a form}} {{of social}} {{behavior}} characterized by strict obedience to the authority of a state or organization and adherence to enforcing and maintaining control through the use of oppressive measures. It refers to a complex of nine subsyndromes (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, and Sanford, 1950), of which conventionalism (strict adherence to conventional values), aggression and submission are the most important (Meloen, 1991). The subsyndromes explain why authoritarian people tend to look down on (contraidentify) and discriminate social or ethnic groups that are 'different'. Authoritarianism is part of a broader cluster of cultural conservative attitudes, especially vivid within the lower social classes (Meloen and Middendorp, 1985; De Witte, 1990).

40|$|Bragg grating-based sensor {{devices are}} popular {{as they are}} {{relatively}} simple to fabricate and use, but the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> for temperature effects is of particular importance for accurate and reliable measurement of other parameters. Equally, the use of rare-earth-doped fiber has revolutionized many aspects of both communications and sensor systems and recent research has produced fluorescence decay-time and intensity ratio transducer devices which yield reproducible and accurate temperature measurement. This work reports on research carried out on sensor devices using co-located Bragg gratings and fluorescence decay-time sensors, using both separate optical fibers (plain and rare-earth-doped silica respectively) or with the Bragg grating actually written into the fluorescent fiber. The sensor system thus created is simple and effective with a single optical source used to excite both the fluorescence emission (which provides decay time information) and to enable the measure-induced Bragg grating wavelength shift to be determined. With such systems under test, satisfactory strain and temperature resolutions have been achieved. Applications include temperature compensated structural monitoring and monitoring of temperature in structures where the sensors are exposed to strain...|$|E

40|$|Globalisation means {{gains from}} trade, {{but not for}} everyone. As gains from trade come along with factor price convergence, {{substantial}} fractions of the working classes in the high-wage countries of the West are likely {{to belong to the}} group of losers. In this situation it is tempting for the welfare state to help out, but the difficulties are enormous. On the one hand, the payment of social replacement incomes makes wages stick, preventing the gains from trade, causing mass unemployment and turning the economies of the West into bazaars with excessive outsourcing and offshoring activities. On teh other, taxes <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> payments to the working classes can hardly be levied from the mobile factors of production, given that globalisation has increased their mobility.

40|$|The CLIC final focus {{momentum}} {{acceptance of}} ± 0. 5 % limits the bunch-to-bunch energy {{variation in the}} main beam to less than ± 0. 1 %, since the estimated single-bunch contribution is ± 0. 4 %.

Therefore, a compensation method is needed to reduce the resulting bunch-to-bunch energy spread of the main beam.

40|$|Substantial {{amounts of}} {{maternal}} androgens {{are found in}} birds' eggs and {{have been shown to}} benefit offspring development. Within-clutch patterns of increasing androgen concentrations over the laying sequence are often hypothesized to compensate for the negative effects of hatching asynchrony. However, detrimental effects to offspring fitness of exposure to high yolk androgen levels have also been demonstrated. This suggests that mothers should forego these costs to their offspring when the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> for hatching asynchrony is low or when alternative compensatory strategies, e. g. in terms of increasing egg mass, are available. Here we show that in the south-temperate lesser double-collared sunbird Nectarinia chalybea, a species with hatching asynchrony but also with high survival of last-hatched chicks, mothers do not deposit resources differentially in terms of either yolk androgen concentration or egg mass across the laying sequence.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Flow cytometry is a ubiquitous, multiparametric {{method for}} character-izing {{cellular}} populations. However, this method can grow increasingly complex {{with the number}} of proteins that need to be screened simultaneously: spectral emission overlap of fluorophores and the subsequent <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation,</b> lengthy sample preparation, and multiple control tests that need to be performed separately must all be considered. These factors lead to increased costs, and consequently, flow cytometry is performed in core facilities with a dedicated technician operating the instrument. Here, we describe a low-cost, label-free microfluidic method that can determine the phenotypic profiles of single cells. Our method employs Node-Pore Sensing to measure the transit times of cells as they interact with a series of different antibodies, each corresponding to a specific cell-surface antigen, that have been functionalized in a single microfluidic channel. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method not only by screening two acute promyelocytic leukemia human cells lines (NB 4 and AP- 1060) for myeloid antigens, CD 13, CD 14, CD 15, and CD 33, simultaneously, but also by distinguishing a mixture of cells of similar sizeAP- 1060 and NALM- 1 based on surface markers CD 13 and HLA-DR.
