I am very glad that my break came with EastEnders, as they are like a family who look after you. Working on the show has given me the chance to learn so much from the actors, especially {{those who are in}} my TV family. There are lots of things you can only learn from actually working on a set. The stage school I attend -also Singer Stage School - prepares you really well, but it is so different when you are actually there on set being filmed. Just a few things I have learned are how to read a script properly (not only my lines but stage directions and any acting I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> in the background), how to work with adults in the workplace, which is very different from being at school, and lots of different wordswhich I didn’t know before such as"running up", [...] "turning", [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". As well as all of that, you need to be real by adding in some of your own character. I am quitea lively character in real life, so I do take that on to the set and they have got used to me and like me turning it into my Tiffany character. [...] "Perhaps my most useful lesson has been that while this is an amazing experience, whether you are famous or not, directors can be quite strict, so you must listen all the time and be punctual. Working to such a tight schedule can also mean very long days and I do get tired - but I still can’t wait to go back in the next time."

40|$|Introduction: In one sense, urban {{ecosystems}} {{might be}} thought of as unique in the range of challenges and opportunities for insects that they create. However, many of the ecological processes and anthropological effects they encapsulate can equally be found in other human dominated environments. So applying ecological lessons from both within and outside urban areas is important for insect conservation within our towns and cities. Methods: Here, I apply this principle by describing the entomological lessons relevant to urban insect conservation that I have learned from my work in both urban areas and agricultural systems. I will describe work on roundabouts and the importance of habitat management for insects. I will introduce you to some rare species in some urban green spaces. Results/Conclusion: I will show you what I have found in my studies of small-scale habitat heterogeneity, and consider how that might be applied to urban environments. I will finish by reflecting on the success, or otherwise, of my personal attempts to encourage insect biodiversity, and consider what I and we, as entomologists, <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about LANing culture. For some, this is ‘gaming culture plus ’ – for others, {{the games are}} the {{smokescreen}} for the BitTorrent sites, porn and illegal downloads. Either way, the LANing activity is a cultural choice overwhelmingly associated with young males and {{with the kind of}} commitment and technological dedication that was first recognised in Kidder’s (1981) work, The Soul of the New Machine. Alongside the passion for ‘pimping ’ the machine – adding heat sinks, coolers, neon lights, high speed graphic cards etc – is the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> all these things to excess. LANing is at its purest when it involves the negation (or postponement) of everyday life. Organised LANs, for example, are round the clock 26 -hour techno-fests fuelled by full-sugar coke and cold fast food runs. It’s a badge of honour to fall asleep in a morning classroom because the night has been spent in a massively multiplayer online game. For all the value ascribed by contemporary society to technological prowess, creativity and digital literacy, the dissident uses of the LAN for copyright flouting and for trading porn and other illegitimate programming – and the implications of nocturnal engagement with the LANing world – means that kids that are into LANs tend also to be constructed as ‘playing up’. Thus the exhortation to ‘Play up! Play up! And play the game! ’ is subverted to mean non-compliant behaviour consequent upon dedicated engagement with gaming culture...|$|E
40|$|Being a {{guardian}} of the interface between illness and disease is a challenging and active process. What do the stories of babies Toby, Tyla, and their 20 or so friends, {{all of whom have}} been treated for skull asymmetry, tell us about this? 1 According to their parents, they were all born ‘beautiful ’ with a lovely rounded head but at the age of a few weeks this became misshapen. The parents consulted health professionals and were reassured that the head shape would get better and was simply related to the baby being put ‘back to sleep’. The evidence of the parents eyes however, was that things were getting worse with time. The treatment for skull asymmetry with orthotic devices, according to the narratives, does produce results. Treatment for what is usually regarded as a self-correcting condition is not available on the NHS and parents often go to huge lengths to fund raise. There is a lack of evidence that helmet moulding for positional skull asymmetry does work and is better than simple positioning measures or doing nothing at all. Equally {{there is a lack of}} evidence that helmet moulding does not work. 2 There are some important things we should be doing in primary care. There are preventative measures. There are also occasional children where the condition does herald significant pathology; not all skull asymmetry is positional and benign, so a thorough assessment is needed. Perhaps most of all what we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> is offering parents an explanation, including an honest account of the evidence, and of course, taking the parent’s concerns seriously...|$|E
40|$|The United States is {{a driving}} force {{of the global economy}} and a major {{innovator}} in the technology sector. For decades the world has looked to The United States as a leader of great technological advancements with the strong economy to allow investors a chance make these technologies a reality. So why is it now that we lag behind other countries {{when it comes to making}} our technology energy efficient? Sure we’ve been steadily growing our production of renewable resources with wind and solar energy, bet we are still behind in the second largest source of pollution, transportation. According to the EPA, transportation accounts for 27 % of total U. S. greenhouse gas emissions, lead only by electricity production. Since 1975, following the Arab oil embargo, the U. S. government has regulated vehicles through Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. The purpose of these standards is to improve the average fuel economy of vehicles made in the U. S. From 1990 until 2010, the standard for passenger vehicles was 27. 5 miles per gallon. For 20 years our emissions requirements were stagnant. Meanwhile, in 2010 the European Union had requirements 41 mpg and Japan had requirements of 46 mpg. In addition, the United States also trailed behind China, Canada, and India in vehicle standards as of 2010. These CAFE standards aren’t just good for reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions. When vehicles require less gasoline, it reduces our overall consumption. This is great news for people who want to reduce the United States dependence on foreign oil, and was the main purpose behind the CAFE standards being introduced in the first place. Increasing vehicle efficiency will improve our nation’s energy security and save drivers money when filling up at the pump. It’s for these reasons that I believe the U. S. needs to continue increasing the efficiency of our vehicles. The U. S. has set the standard for 2016 at 37. 8 mpg, and proposed a 56. 2 mpg standard in 2025. While it is a step in the right direction, perhaps we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> more if we want to be world leaders once again. We need to set an example to the world that efficient vehicles are not only economically feasible, but necessary to reduce energy consumption and pollution on a meaningful scale...|$|E
