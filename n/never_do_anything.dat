By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

500|$|On 19 November 2007, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar refuted Malaysia's {{claim that}} Singapore was {{attempting}} to subvert the status quo by claiming sovereignty of Pedra Branca. He said Singapore was [...] "an honest, law-abiding state that has never and will <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to endanger navigational safety, security arrangements or the Singapore Strait's environment". Rather, it was Malaysia that had sought to alter the status quo by publishing a map in 1979 that altered maritime boundaries with seven neighbouring countries. This was evidenced by a telegram that the Malaysian Government had sent to its overseas missions in December 1979, notifying them that the map would [...] "affect" [...] Brunei, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} season episode [...] "Duets", she asks Santana to be her partner for the duet {{competition}} while they are making out. Santana rejects her, so Brittany attempts to make her jealous by dating fellow glee club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). She sleeps with Artie, but Santana tells him that Brittany was just using him for his voice, so he breaks up with her, to Brittany's dismay. Brittany's relationship with Artie continues to develop; in [...] "Never Been Kissed", he gets her {{to go out with}} him again. As of [...] "Furt", they are officially dating. In [...] "Sexy", following her performance of [...] "Landslide" [...] with Santana and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), Santana admits her true feelings for Brittany. Although Santana fears being ostracized by the McKinley High student body for being in a same-sex relationship, she confesses her romantic love to Brittany, feelings which are reciprocated. However, Brittany states that she loves Artie too, and would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to hurt him, even if it means not being able to be with Santana. She says that if she and Artie ever break up, she would be Santana's, proudly so.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Marge's mother Jackie is particularly nightmarish in her first real appearance. The final sequence on the rooftop with Lisa and Bart is lovely, and Homer's comment to Marge is a magical wrap-up to a good episode." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the episode [...] "maintained a nicely irreverent tone most of the time— irreverent {{enough to make it}} amusing, at least," [...] and added: [...] "The interaction of the Simpson and Bouvier families at dinner was terrific, and Bart’s experiences on skid row made their point while they still managed to be pointed and clever. 'Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was another winner." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute", another season two episode, were the first episodes that [...] "asked [...] to truly care about the characters, and they work beautifully." [...] Both Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal and Jacobson thought the most memorable line of the episode was Jackie's line to Marge: [...] "I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll just say one thing— you <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> right." [...] A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was Homer's [...] "Oh Lord, be honest– are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?".|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to go right for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As one of {{the highest-ranking}} Catholics in the country, Catherine was an obvious target for Protestant extremists, and it was hardly {{surprising}} that the Popish Plot of 1678 would directly threaten her position. However, Catherine was completely secure in her husband's favour ("she could <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> wicked, {{and it would be}} a horrible thing to abandon her" [...] he told Gilbert Burnet), and the House of Lords, most of whom knew her and liked her, refused by an overwhelming majority to impeach her. Relations between the royal couple became notably warmer: Catherine wrote of Charles' [...] "wonderful kindness" [...] to her. and it was noted that his visits to her apartments became longer and more frequent.|$|E

Wang Baodong of the Chinese Embassy in the United States responded that the accusations {{are a result of}} sinophobic paranoia. He states that, [...] "China would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to harm sovereignty or security of other countries. In conformity with such national policies, the Chinese government has never employed, nor will it employ so-called civilian hackers in collecting information or intelligence of other countries.

[...] Steeves said that the Wright brothers, [...] "under the guise of offering to help finance his inventions, actually received inside information that aided them materially in completing their own plane."

2500|$|On {{his return}} for Yorkshire, he {{struggled}} for form and was {{left out of}} the England Test and ODI squads to face Sri Lanka. In the County Championship he managed 25wickets at an average of 41.00. In September, Shahzad was reprimanded for scuffing the pitch during the penultimate Championship match against Warwickshire and fined £750. The club was relegated from the First Division in the final match of the season. Shahzad regretted the incident, explaining [...] "It's not the way I want to play my game. I don't {{want to be seen as}} a cheat, or a pitch-damager.... It's one mistake I've made in an eight- or nine-year career so far. It's out of the blue for me, and I definitely would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> like it again. It was just a random, stupid act."

2500|$|There are {{commonly}} {{said to be}} three (or maybe four) small exceptions to the rule against enforcing non-charitable purpose trusts, and there is one certain and major loophole. First, trusts can be created for building and maintaining graves and funeral monuments. Second, trusts have been allowed for the saying of private masses. Third, it was (long before the Hunting Act 2004) said to lawful to have a trust promoting fox hunting. These [...] "exceptions" [...] {{were said to be}} fixed in Re Endacott, where a minor businessman in who lived in Devon wanted to entrust money [...] "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself". Lord Evershed MR held this invalid because it was not a grave, let alone charitable. It has, however, been questioned whether the existing categories are in fact true exceptions given that graves and masses could be construed as trusts which ultimately benefit the landowner, or the relevant church. In any case the major exception to the no purpose trust rule is that in many other common law countries, particularly the United States and a number of Caribbean states, they can be valid. If capital is entrusted under the rules of other jurisdictions the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 Schedule 1, articles 6 and 18 requires that the trusts are recognised. This follows the Hague Trust Convention of 1985, which was ratified by 12 countries. The UK recognises any offshore trusts unless they are [...] "manifestly incompatible with public policy". Even trusts in countries that are [...] "offshore financial centres" [...] (typically described as [...] "tax havens" [...] because wealthy individuals or corporations shift their assets there to avoid paying taxes in the UK), purpose trusts can be created which serve no charitable function, or any function related to the good of society, so long as the trust document specifies someone to be an [...] "enforcer" [...] of the trust document. These include Jersey, the Isle of Mann, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. It is argued, for example by David Hayton, a former UK academic trust lawyer who was recruited to serve on the Caribbean Court of Justice, that having an enforcer resolves any problem of ensuring that the trust is run accountably. This substitutes for the oversight that beneficiaries would exercise. The result, it is argued, is that English law's continued prohibition on non-charitable purpose trusts is antiquated and ineffective, and is better removed so that money remains [...] "onshore". This would also have the consequence, like in the US or the tax haven jurisdictions, that public money would be used to enforce trusts over vast sums of wealth which might <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for a living person.|$|E
