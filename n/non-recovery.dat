MethodsTo analyze the timeliness of AE reporting to the PMDA, 6610 reports for five categories of cardiovascular devices were retrieved. Two durations were calculated: (1) time from the date the AE occurred to that when the MAH captured it (DOC: days); and (2) time from the date of MAH capture to that of MAH report (DCR: days). Number of DOC> 15 days (DOC 15) and delayed reports (DCR> 15 or 30 days) were also calculated. ResultsAEs included 9. 2 % deaths and 7. 5 % <b>non-recoveries.</b> DOC 15 and delayed reports were 51. 0 % and 10. 9 %, respectively. By multivariate analysis, DOC 15 was associated with foreign AE, device category, MAH, patient outcome, event category, and AE {{that had to be}} reported within 15 or 30 days (AE 15 / 30). Delayed report was associated with device category, MAH, patient outcome, event category, and AE 15 / 30. CommentsAlthough Japanese MAHs complied with the obligation to report AEs, they often failed to share AEs with healthcare providers.

50|$|The {{deficits in}} {{functioning}} associated with Bipolar II disorder stem {{mostly from the}} recurrent depression that Bipolar II patients suffer from. Depressive symptoms are much more disabling than hypomanic symptoms and are potentially as, or more disabling than mania symptoms. Functional impairment {{has been shown to}} be directly linked with increasing percentages of depressive symptoms, and because sub-syndromal symptoms are more common—and frequent—in Bipolar II disorder, they have been implicated heavily as a major cause of psychosocial disability. There is evidence that shows the mild depressive symptoms, or even sub-syndromal symptoms, are responsible for the <b>non-recovery</b> of social functioning, which furthers the idea that residual depressive symptoms are detrimental for functional recovery in patients being treated for Bipolar II. It has been suggested that symptom interference in relation to social and interpersonal relationships in Bipolar II Disorder is worse than symptom interference in other chronic medical illnesses such as cancer. This social impairment can last for years, even after treatment that has resulted in a resolution of mood symptoms.|$|E

In this method, a steel cylinder - a coring gun - has hollow-point steel bullets mounted along its sides and moored to the gun by short steel cables.

The mooring cables ideally pull the hollow bullets and the enclosed plug of formation loose and the gun carries them to the surface.

Disadvantages are possible <b>non-recovery</b> because of lost or misfired bullets and a slight uncertainty about the sample depth.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} the course of back pain in older patients and identify prognostic factors for <b>non-recovery</b> at 3 months' follow-up. We conducted a prospective cohort study (the BACE study) of patients aged > 55 years visiting a general practitioner (GP) with a new episode of back pain in the Netherlands. The course of back pain was described in terms of self-perceived recovery, pain severity, disability, pain medication, and GP visits at 6 weeks' and 3 months' follow-up. Prognostic factors for <b>non-recovery</b> at 3 months' follow-up were derived from the baseline questionnaire and physical examination. Variables with a prognostic value were identified with multivariable logistic regression analysis (method backward), and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was calculated for the prognostic model. A total of 675 back pain patients (mean age 66. 4 (SD 7. 6) years) participated in the BACE cohort study. At 6 weeks' follow-up 64 % of the patients reported <b>non-recovery</b> from back pain. At 3 months' follow-up 61 % still reported <b>non-recovery,</b> but only 26 % of these patients had revisited the GP. Longer duration of the back pain, severity of back pain, history of back pain, absence of radiating pain in the leg below the knee, number of comorbidities, patients' expectation of <b>non-recovery,</b> and a longer duration of the timed 'Up and Go' test were significantly associated with <b>non-recovery</b> in a multiple regression model (AUC 0. 79).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} <b>non-recovery</b> in non-traumatic complaints at the arm, neck and shoulder in general practice 6 {{months after the}} first consultation. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was set in 21 Dutch general practices. Consulters with a first or new episode of non-traumatic arm, neck or shoulder complaints and age 18 through 64 yrs entered the cohort. Complaint, patient, physical, psychosocial and work characteristics were investigated as possible predictors of <b>non-recovery</b> at 6 months using multiple logistic regression analyses (backward Wald). RESULTS: At 6 months, 46 % {{of the total population}} (n = 612) and 42 % of the working subpopulation (n = 473) still reported complaints. Complaint characteristics (long duration of the complaint before consultation, recurrent complaint, musculoskeletal comorbidity and complaint mainly located at wrist or hand) were most predictive of <b>non-recovery</b> followed by psychosocial characteristics (more somatization and experiencing less social support). Having a specific diagnosis was associated with recovery. In the working subpopulation, the same variables were predictors of <b>non-recovery.</b> Additionally, low supervisory support was associated with <b>non-recovery.</b> The models correctly classified 72 - 75 % of the patients (explained variance 0. 27 - 0. 28). CONCLUSIONS: Besides questions on complaint characteristics, information on somatization and support can help a general practitioner to recognize patients at risk of persistent complaints...|$|E
40|$|Background The Sept 11, 2001 (9 / 11) World Trade Center (WTC) {{disaster}} {{has been}} associated with several subacute and chronic health effects, but whether excess mortality after 9 / 11 has occurred is unknown. We tested whether excess mortality has occurred in people exposed to the WTC disaster. Methods In this observational cohort study, deaths occurring in 2003 – 09 in WTC Health Registry participants residing in New York City were identified through linkage to New York City vital records and the National Death Index. Eligible participants were rescue and recovery workers and volunteers; lower Manhattan area residents, workers, school staff and students; and commuters and passers-by on 9 / 11. Study participants were categorized as rescue and recovery workers (including volunteers), or non-rescue and <b>non-recovery</b> participants. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated with New York City rates from 2000 – 09 as the reference. Within the cohort, proportional hazards were used to examine the relation between a three-tiered WTC-related exposure level (high, intermediate, or low) and total mortality. Findings We identified 156 deaths in 13 337 rescue and recovery workers and 634 deaths in 28 593 non-rescue and <b>non-recovery</b> participants. All-cause SMRs were significantly lower than that expected for rescue and recovery participants (SMR 0 · 45, 95 % CI 0 · 38 – 0 · 53) and non-rescue and <b>non-recovery</b> participants (0 · 61, 0 · 56 – 0 · 66). No significantly increased SMRs for diseases of the respiratory system or heart, or for hematological malignancies were found. In non-rescue and <b>non-recovery</b> participants, both intermediate and high levels of WTC-related exposure were significantly associated with mortality when compared with low exposure (adjusted hazard ratio 1 · 22, 95 % CI 1 · 01 – 1 · 48, for intermediate exposure and 1 · 56, 1 · 15 – 2 · 12, for high exposure). High levels of exposure in non-rescue and <b>non-recovery</b> individuals, when compared with low exposed non-rescue and <b>non-recovery</b> individuals, were associated with heart disease- related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2 · 06, 1 · 10 – 3 · 86). In rescue and recovery participants, level of WTC-related exposure was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1 · 25, 95 % CI 0 · 56 – 2 · 78, for high exposure and 1 · 03, 0 · 52 – 2 · 06, for intermediate exposure when compared with low exposure). Interpretation This exploratory study of mortality in a well defined cohort of 9 / 11 survivors provides a baseline for continued surveillance. Additional follow-up is needed to establish whether these associations persist and whether a similar association over time will occur in rescue and recovery participants...|$|E

40|$|Injuries, {{including}} {{those related to}} traffic, are an important cause of long-term morbidity among people in productive ages. This thesis focuses on self-perceived recovery after traffic related minor musculoskeletal injuries. The aims of the studies were to characterize the variation in recuperation time using sick-leave and self-perceived <b>non-recovery</b> as markers of residual illness, to identify prognostic factors of delayed recovery (Paper I), to relate selfperceived recovery to functional health status, {{as measured by the}} Short Form- 36 (Paper II). to develop a new instrument - the Prediction of Prolonged Self-perceived recovery after musculoskeletal injuries questionnaire, the PPS - and to evaluate its predictive ability regarding self-perceived recovery by applying it on a new group of patients (Paper III) and finally, to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary intervention program in terms of by patient reported recovery at 12 months (Paper IV). This thesis is based on two prospective studies on patients with traffic related musculoskeletal injuries. In the first study, 318 patients were included (Papers I and II). All patients received medical and surgical treatment according to the hospital routines. Information about the patient's background and the injuries were collected and the patients were asked to assess their functional health status during the week that had preceded the accident using the SF- 36. The patients were followed up at 1 month and at 6 months by means of a mailed questionnaire and asked to report if they felt recovered, to report their duration of sick leave and to rate their functional health status (SF- 36) In the second study (Papers III and IV) 387 patients were enrolled and followed up in the same manner. The PPS questionnaire was filled in by all enrolled patients and the ones predicted to have a high risk of <b>non-recovery</b> were randomized to an intervention (n= 65) or to a control group (n= 62). The intervention program consisted of four group sessions and focused on information about injuries and pain management and called attention to self-care and physical activity. All patients were followed up at 6 months (Paper III) and 12 months (Paper IV). Self-perceived <b>non-recovery</b> was reported by about 60 % at 1 month and by about 40 % at 6 months. The injury-type, working status and educational level were associated with selfperceived <b>non-recovery</b> at 1 month, while only working status and educational level were associated with self-reported <b>non-recovery</b> at 6 months (Paper I). Patients who reported recovery had significantly higher SF- 36 subscores than those who reported <b>non-recovery,</b> even if not all of the recovered patients had reached their pre-injury levels. The physical dimensions of the SF- 36 were more strongly associated with feeling of recovery both at 1 month and at 6 months (Paper II). The PPS questionnaire identified patients at high risk of <b>non-recovery</b> more accurately than a prediction that was based solely on information about the injury (Paper III). A significantly larger proportion of the patients in the intervention group than in the control group reported selfperceived recovery at 12 months (Paper IV). In conclusion, the injury in combination with, social, and emotional factors interact in the recovery process after an injury. The PPS questionnaire might be useful in identifying patients at risk of delayed recovery. Intervention focusing on somato-p sycho- social support in the early phase after an injury seems to enhance self-perceived recovery in selected patient groups but need to be verified in future studies...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAtrioventricular (AV) {{block is}} one of the main {{clinical}} manifestations in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). Although steroid therapy is considered to be effective for AV block, the efficacy has not been demonstrated in detail. Methods and resultsFifteen CS patients presenting with advanced or complete AV block were retrospectively investigated. All patients were treated with 30 mg/day of prednisone after device implantation, which was tapered to a maintenance dosage of 5 – 10 mg/day. During a mean follow-up of 7. 1 years, AV block resolved to normal conduction or first-degree AV block in 7 patients (recovery group). The improvement was driven within the first week of steroid therapy in 4 patients, while 3 patients showed late recovery of AV conduction. The remaining 8 patients were classified as the <b>non-recovery</b> group. The recovery group showed a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (69. 4 ± 8. 9 % versus 44. 1 ± 19. 3 %, p= 0. 029) and higher prevalence of advanced AV block (87. 5 % versus 28. 6 %, p= 0. 040) compared with those of the <b>non-recovery</b> group. In patients with the recovery group, there was no late recurrence of AV block during the follow-up period. ConclusionsEarly initiation of steroid therapy may be effective for AV block, and steroid therapy before device implantation is a possible therapeutic strategy for some selected patients...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) protocol using propofol and sufentanil without neuromuscular blocking agents (NBAs) for a <b>non-recovery</b> lung pathology study in rabbits including 10 h of pressure-controlled ventilation. TIVA was started with 20 mg/kg/h propofol and 0. 5 mg/kg/h sufentanil. The depth of anaesthesia was assessed by reflex testing and monitoring of spontaneous movements or respiratory efforts. Vital parameters were monitored to assess the effects of the TIVA protocol. The infusion rates were increased whenever reflex testing indicated inadequate depth of anaesthesia, and were reduced when vital parameters indicated unnecessarily deep levels. Median infusion rates of 35 mg/kg/h propofol and 2. 0 mg/kg/h sufentanil were needed to ensure an adequate depth of anaesthesia. This protocol suppressed spontaneous movements, breathing and palpebral reflexes, but was unable to suppress corneal and pedal withdrawal reflexes. Since significant drops in arterial blood pressure (ABP) were observed and the animals were not exposed to painful procedures, positive corneal and pedal withdrawal reflexes were tolerated. In conclusion, propofol and sufentanil is a suitable combination for long-term anaesthesia in <b>non-recovery</b> lung pathology models in rabbits without painful procedures. ABP must be monitored carefully because of the circulatory side-effects, but it is an inappropriate surrogate marker for depth of anaesthesia. Due to the lack of neuromuscular blockade this TIVA protocol allows the adjustment of infusion rates based on reflex testing. The resulting decreased risk of unnoticed awareness is a decisive refinement in anaesthesia for similar studies including long-term mechanical ventilation in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} decades of {{research}} into corporate turnaround strategies, corporate failures persist. Knowledge of remedies {{appears to be a}} necessary but insufficient condition for turnaround. There exists yet a serious gap in extant knowledge on what motivates managers to choose or avoid well-documented restructuring strategies. Further, extant research has focused predominantly on severely distressed firms. Though contributing immensely to corporate management out of a crisis, it throws little light in the direction of management to avoid a crisis, and thus avoidance of economic value destruction. Also, no large sample analysis has properly tested the general effectiveness of prescribed turnaround strategies. This research attempts to fill these empirical gaps by exploring three key research questions: I. What are the determinants of restructuring strategy choice in response to performance decline 2. How effective are the prescribed turnaround strategies in contributing to corporate turnaround from performance decline? 3. Are the turnaround strategies equally applicable and effective to both poorly performing and financially distressed firms? We integrate the disparate studies to date and devise a coherent framework for performance decline research and corporate restructuring. We also design a comprehensive strategy determinants framework for explaining the firm strategy selection process corporating the impact of lenders, owners, corporate governance structure and control factors. We employ the standard event study methodology to examine effectiveness of strategies. We then separate implementation success from other sources of strategy effectiveness- choice, timing and intensity of restructuring strategies. We also explore differences in the determinants and effectiveness of strategies between two samples comprising nearly 300 poorly performing and 200 financially distressed firms, {{as a function of the}} extent of firms' performance decline. Our results show that turnaround strategy choices are significantly influenced by the complex interplay of the ownership structure, corporate governance and lender monitoring of the firms in decline. While there is agreement among stakeholders on certain strategies there is also evidence of conflict of interests. T he results also show the somewhat detrimental effects of dominance by certain stakeholder groups. However, no support for managerial inaction as a contributor to <b>non-recovery</b> from performance decline iss found. Instead of being paralysed by inertia, managers of on recovery firms appear to take vigorous and intensive restructuring actions.

Furthermore, Denis and Rodgers (2007) find that firms are more likely to emerge as going concerns if they realize significant, severe asset and liability cuts during retrenchment. Lamont et al. (1994) offer more restrained results by highlighting a possible trade-off, in that firms with gradual turnaround moves recover faster, but with inferior post-distress performance compared to those that employ severe and rapid structural change. Sudarsanam and Lai (2001) contradict this by stating that managers in <b>non-recovery</b> firms restructure more intensively, yet more ineffectively than turnaround firms.|$|E
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is associated with}} recurrent episodes of exacerbations that lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation. This thesis examines {{the relationship between the}} infective and inflammatory changes at exacerbation of COPD and clinical <b>non-recovery</b> and recurrence of exacerbations. Patients were recruited from the London COPD cohort and sampled prospectively in the stable state, at exacerbation and after 7, 14 and 35 days. Clinical indices, airway and systemic inflammation and lower airway bacteria were analysed at each visit. Airway inflammation was assessed by sputum interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 levels, systemic inflammation was assessed by circulating leucocytes, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL- 6. Sputum bacteria were assessed by standard cultures and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qr-PCR). The key findings were: 1) the persistence of heightened airway and systemic inflammation was associated with clinical <b>non-recovery</b> at exacerbation, 2) a higher level of serum CRP 14 days after an exacerbation was associated with a recurrent exacerbation within 50 days, 3) frequent exacerbators have reduced response to therapy and persistently high systemic inflammation compared' to infrequent exacerbators, 4) the presence of a significant relationship between the lower airway bacterial load and circulating leucocytes in stable COPD and 6) the detection of a potentially pathogenic micro-organism from sputum samples is higher by qr-PCR than by standard cultures. These new findings could form the basis of future therapeutic interventions and strategies for prevention of recurrent exacerbations. Further studies into the mechanisms explaining the differences observed between frequent and infrequent exacerbators may help reduce the high burden due to the disease. Finally refining the qr-PCR assay may help elucidate the complex links between lower airway bacteria and inflammation in COPD. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This journal issue entitled: Special Issue: Abstracts of the XX International Congress on Schizophrenia ResearchPatient’s {{perception}} of recovery from first-episode psychosis {{is a less}} well covered area in existing assessment and research. The Psychosis Recovery Inventory (PRI) is a self-administered questionnaire developed to address key issues in the recovery stage. This study applied the PRI to survey perceived extent of recovery {{and the risk of}} relapse in a sample of patients recovering from first episode psychosis. The PRI was administrated to 51 patients in the recovery period following a first psychotic episode. The PRI required patients to rate their perceived levels of recovery and risk of relapse with a visual analog scale. In addition, respondents indicated their attitudes towards 32 items covering different aspects of recovery with a 6 -point Likert scale. We explored howthese attitudes are related to the perceptions of recovery and relapse. More than 33. 3 % of patients perceived a low risk of relapse (10 % or lower), but only 7. 9 % of them recognized a high relapse risk (90 % or higher). 11. 8 % of the patients considered they had a full recovery, while on the other hand, 21. 6 % of the patients perceive they had recovered less than 50 %. Perception of non recovery is related to the presence of cognitive problems and impairment in occupational functioning. In addition, the need to continue on medication is rating as an important recovery for the {{perception of}} <b>non-recovery.</b> We successfully applied a tailor-made questionnaire to explore attitudes and perceptions of relapse and recovery in a sample of patients recovering from a first psychotic episode. Despite comprehensive psychoeducation, patients still tended to underestimate their risks of relapse. The need for continuing medication is a major contributor to the sense of <b>non-recovery</b> in first episode patient. These issues have potential therapeutic implications...|$|E
30|$|Methods: A {{retrospective}} study was performed {{at a single}} center from 2006 to 2015. We defined extreme hyperbilirubinemia as a state of total bilirubin above 20  mg/dl and selected all patients whose serum total bilirubin increased above 20  mg/dl at least once during their stay {{in the intensive care}} unit. We investigated the overall clinical course of the patients and compared the differences between one group with normalization of total bilirubin (recovery group) and the other group without normalization (<b>non-recovery</b> group). Furthermore, we evaluated the association between prognosis and various clinical factors, including the peak total bilirubin levels, increasing rate of total bilirubin (Vi), results of laboratory analyses related to hepatic function, and clinical features at the time of extreme hyperbilirubinemia. These data were analyzed using Chi-square test and Cox and logistic regression analyses.|$|E
40|$|Perennial {{species from}} the genus Sargassum are {{considered}} to be indicators of high environmental quality and are therefore used in the assessment of the Ecological Status of Mediterranean coastal waters according to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000 / 60 /EC). Over the past three decades a signifi cant decline in Sargassum populations has been reported in the Gulf of Trieste, as well as in other Adriatic and Mediterranean areas. In Slovenian coastal waters the presence of Sargassum spp. had not been confi rmed since 1980, after a severe decline due to overgrazing by the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Recently, however, some thalli of S. vulgare were found in Piran Bay. The recurrence of this species is discussed in the paper, as well as the possible causes that led to the <b>non-recovery</b> in its populations in last decades in Slovenian coastal waters...|$|E
