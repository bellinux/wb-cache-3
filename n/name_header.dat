50|$|Eastchurch {{is home to}} the Range Rovers Football Club. The {{club was}} {{established}} in September 1997 through the enthusiasm of local boys and has steadily grown, now operating 25 teams ranging from the little hurricanes soccer school, Under 7s and adults, with over 250 players registered as club members from all over the island. The first letter with the Range Rovers <b>name</b> <b>header</b> to gain permission for use of the Range Road pitch was written on 15 September 1997. Permission was granted and Range Rovers FC was formed and affiliated to the Kent County Football Association on 28 September 1997. In November 1997 the club badge was designed and the Spitfire plane was incorporated to depict the fact that the site on Range Road was a RAF airfield during the Second World War. The first formal club meeting was held on 3 December 1997, during which the first committee was formed. The club gained the FA Charter Mark in February 2005, still the only football club on the Isle of Sheppey to do so. Also in March 2007 their U13s reached the Kent County Cup Final, a notable feat for a small village side. The club now play at three sites in Eastchurch; Range Road, Shurland Meadow and Dicksons Field. They also have pitches at Seager Road, Sheerness and Halfway Houses Primary School. The club continues to grow and season 2012-13 sees an academy (Little Hurricanes) and boys teams from Under 7s through to Under 18s and two men's teams. In 2010 the club ran its third annual tournament, an event which sees nearly 200 teams from all over the South East taking part. This is currently stopped due to major refurbishment work at the IOSA. The club now has the tenancy at Seager Road in Sheerness as its new home ground. Some of Range Rovers players have gone on to be very successful in their football careers.|$|E

5000|$|Ordinaries (high-wheelers or penny farthings) {{were driven}} by cranks and pedals {{attached}} directly to an oversized front wheel. The rider was seated over the wheel, just aft {{of the wheel}} hub. Many mishaps included the projection of the rider head-first over the handle bars: an event occurring with enough frequency earn the <b>name,</b> <b>header.</b> Several manufacturers created safety models, which denoted a low-mount bicycle. Motive force came from cranks applied to a sprocket and chain creating an indirect drive {{to one of the}} wheels. The first commercially viable model was John Kemp Starley's Rover, drawing interest starting in 1885. The early Rover featured a complicated indirect steering system, but Starley replaced it with a direct steering system consisting of a single curved bar attached to the head. In 1886, after seeing some Rovers and touring a Rover-factory, Alfred Pope claimed that the safety bicycle {{was nothing more than a}} fad, and made no plans at that time to produce his own version. George Bidwell, by this time an independent agent again, recommended the safety after trying the mount in 1886. He urged Pope to design its own safety bicycle while predicting [...] "the old high wheel was doomed." [...] However, Pope did offer a safety ordinary model in 1886. This design retained the high-mount and oversized front wheel, but incorporated a chain drive to the front wheel, allowing the seating position and cranks to be positioned further back. Despite the new Columbia offering, Bidwell claimed that he never ordered another high-wheeler after trying the Rover. By 1888, Pope had reversed course and produced its own safety, the Veloce. It weighed fifty-one pounds, or fifteen pounds heavier than its ordinary. In 1889, ordinaries only accounted for twenty percent of sales, dropping to ten percent of sales the next year. Once Pope offered the Veloce for sale, the company sold only 3,000 ordinaries through 1891.|$|E

A history database was introduced, allowing articles {{to be placed in}} separate directories by newsgroup, improving retrieval speeds and easing the development of separate newsreader programs such as rn.

In this paper, we propose a Virtual Channel Reservation (VCR) scheme for service differentiation in OBS networks. It provides scalable differentiated service to each priority class without implementing buffers or extra offset time. In particular, this scheme can achieve two goals. One is to utilize bandwidth efficiently; the other is to meet the low dropping probability requirement of high priority traffic. Simulation experiments are studied for both single-node and multi-node cases. In the multi-node case, a special <b>header,</b> <b>named</b> informing <b>header</b> (i-header) is designed to improve the overall dropping performance and reduce downstream bandwidth waste.

50|$|Header {{definitions}} describe packet formats {{and provide}} {{names for the}} fields within the packet. The language allows customized <b>header</b> <b>names</b> and fields of arbitrary length, although many header definitions use widely known protocol names and fields widths. For example, an 802.3 Ethernet header definition might be called “Ethernet” and consist of the a 48-bit field named “dest” followed by a 48-bit “src” field, followed by a 16-bit “type” field. The <b>names</b> in a <b>header</b> definition are used later in the P4 program to reference these fields.|$|R

50|$|However, RFC-822 {{messages}} are inherently inefficient, as are pure name-value formats like JSON “objects”. The <b>header</b> <b>names</b> occupy substantial storage space, finding {{the boundaries of}} the header value requires slow byte-by-byte sequential scanning, and finding a particular header such as “Subject” requires sequentially scanning over all the headers at least once, if only to store them into a hash table.|$|R
50|$|More {{formally}} the semantics of {{the division}} is defined as follows:where {a1,...,an} is the set of attribute names unique to R and ta1,...,an is the restriction of t to this set. It is usually required that the attribute <b>names</b> in the <b>header</b> of S are a subset of those of R because otherwise {{the result of the}} operation will always be empty.|$|R

5000|$|Since RFC 2822, {{conforming}} message <b>header</b> <b>names</b> {{and values}} should be ASCII characters; values that contain non-ASCII data {{should use the}} MIME encoded-word syntax (RFC 2047) instead of a literal string.
