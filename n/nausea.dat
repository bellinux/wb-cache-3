5|$|A green tinge in {{the skin}} is {{sometimes}} associated with <b>nausea</b> and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or <b>nausea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with other medications for chemotherapy-induced <b>nausea</b> and vomiting.|$|E
5|$|Autonomic effects: shivering, sweating, hyperthermia, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, <b>nausea,</b> diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications. Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or <b>nausea.</b> Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, <b>nausea,</b> bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with <b>nausea</b> and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused <b>nausea,</b> vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{symptoms}} of poisoning appear within {{three hours of}} ingestion of the mushroom as visual hallucinations, <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving coma, convulsions, or death are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nausea</b> and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause <b>nausea.</b> This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{symptoms}} include: headache, <b>nausea</b> and vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter}} being an uncommon but highly specific finding.|$|E
5|$|Two {{cases from}} Liberia {{experienced}} severe neurological symptoms, including ptosis, <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. A child in Ghana died within 20 minutes after being {{bitten by a}} snake suspected to be from this species.|$|E
5|$|Unlike typical vomiting, the {{regurgitation}} {{is typically}} described as effortless and unforced. There is seldom <b>nausea</b> preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile.|$|E
5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is mostly}} {{used to treat}} anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and <b>nausea</b> due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam may also be {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder, {{as well as for the}} treatment of anxiety conditions with co-morbid depression. The FDA label advises that the physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Although the lilac-brown bolete {{was once}} {{considered}} edible, caution is typically recommended in modern field guides when considering this bolete {{for the table}} after several poisonings were reported in northeastern North America. Symptoms include severe gastrointestinal distress with vomiting, diarrhea, and <b>nausea</b> that generally lasts less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, <b>nausea,</b> and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); <b>nausea</b> (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that <b>nausea</b> or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include <b>nausea,</b> diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, <b>nausea,</b> and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, <b>nausea,</b> diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased libido, and problems with sleep. An unusual taste {{in the mouth}} and personality changes are also early signs.|$|E
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from <b>nausea</b> and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by <b>nausea</b> and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with <b>nausea</b> or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} plays {{important roles}} in executive functions, motor control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward, as well as lower-level functions including lactation, sexual gratification, and <b>nausea.</b> The dopaminergic cell groups and pathways make up the dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.|$|E
5|$|PEP {{treatment}} is recommended after {{a sexual assault}} when the perpetrator {{is known to be}} HIV positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown. The duration of {{treatment is}} usually four weeks and is frequently associated with adverse effectsâ€”where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as <b>nausea</b> (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).|$|E
5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|T. floccosus forms {{symbiotic}} (ectomycorrhizal) {{relationships with}} {{various types of}} conifer, growing in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia, from North Korea to Pakistan, and in North America, more frequently in the west, in late summer and autumn. Though mild-tasting, they generally cause gastrointestinal symptoms of <b>nausea,</b> vomiting and diarrhea when consumed. T. floccosus is eaten by local people in northeastern India, Nepal and Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The toxic {{effects of}} ingesting Narcissus {{products}} for both man and animals (such as cattle, goats, pigs and cats) {{have long been}} recognised {{and they have been}} used in suicide attempts. Ingestion of N. pseudonarcissus or N. jonquilla is followed by salivation, acute abdominal pains, <b>nausea,</b> vomiting, and diarrhea, then neurological and cardiac events, including trembling, convulsions, and paralysis. Death may result if large quantities are consumed.|$|E
5|$|The tumor may {{compress}} neighboring organs, disrupting {{digestive processes}} {{and making it}} difficult for the stomach to empty, which may cause <b>nausea</b> and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is common.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, <b>nausea,</b> and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt <b>nausea</b> every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E
5|$|Criminal {{trials for}} the accused {{commenced}} in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Three {{of the four}} arrested at the Melasti Bungalows, Nguyen, Chen and Norman, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. All defendants faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty. The trials were often delayed due to the defendants complaining of illness, headaches and <b>nausea.</b> Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian government would oppose any death sentences imposed.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and <b>nausea.</b> The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 Î¼m and a positive one when they are over 500 Î¼m.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudestâ€”much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launchâ€”and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience <b>nausea</b> after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, <b>nausea,</b> hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|His first {{assignment}} is {{to assist with}} the encoffinment of a woman who died at home and remained undiscovered for two weeks. He is beset with <b>nausea</b> and later humiliated when strangers on a bus detect an unsavoury scent on him. To clean himself, he visits a public bath which he had frequented as a child. It is owned by Tsuyako Yamashita (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), the mother of one of Daigo's former classmates.|$|E
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have {{a greater risk of}} side effects, including dizziness, <b>nausea,</b> and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
