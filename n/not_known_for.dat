5|$|Despite his wealth, he was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{a lavish}} life. His court {{of about a}} hundred people was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman vowel {{harmony and}} other aspects of Wagiman phonotactics require further investigation. It is <b>not</b> <b>known,</b> <b>for</b> instance, whether vowel harmony equally affects {{unstressed}} syllables.|$|E
5|$|Circulation {{figures were}} not {{required}} to be published annually until the 1960s, so the actual circulation figures are <b>not</b> <b>known.</b> <b>For</b> comparison, the more successful Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which had been launched the previous year, is known to have had a circulation of just under 60,000 copies for its first issue, dated Fall 1949.|$|E

While it is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> certain why White resigned his commission, White family tradition held that he left the Royal Navy after he engaged in a duel with another officer.|$|E
5|$|In his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, Sir John Eliot Gardiner {{performed}} and recorded {{the work with}} cantatas for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity, but is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> sure when in the liturgical year Bach performed it, {{and there has been}} speculation that it was written for a special occasion.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan is {{near the}} Nemaha Ridge, a long {{structure}} that is bounded by several faults. The nearby Humboldt Fault Zone in particular {{poses a threat to}} the city; though Kansas is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> earthquake activity, an earthquake could occur at any time.|$|E

5|$|Solomon Creek {{has also}} been called Chester Creek and Solomon Creek by locals. It was called Moses Creek on maps of Pennsylvania created by William Scull in the 1770s. This last name may be named after an Indian, {{although}} it is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> sure.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> forging bonds with other species, {{but it was}} {{observed}} that a bottlenose dolphin with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales. They are known to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and orca whales on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s {{when he left the}} warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership. When {{he was the}} leader of the Raptors, he was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> being vocal on the court, preferring to {{maintain}} his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Anne was courted by Henry Percy, {{son of the}} Earl of Northumberland, {{and entered}} into a secret betrothal with the young man. Thomas Wolsey's gentleman usher, George Cavendish, {{maintained}} the two had not been lovers. If Cavendish is to be believed, their relationship was celibate. The romance was broken off when Percy's father refused to support their engagement. Cardinal Wolsey refused the match for several conjectured reasons. According to Cavendish, Anne was sent from court to her family's countryside estates, but it is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> how long. Upon her return to court, she again entered the service of Catherine of Aragon. Percy was married to Lady Mary Talbot, to whom he had been betrothed since adolescence.|$|E

5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> certain why the {{albatrosses}} became {{extinct in}} the North Atlantic, although rising sea levels {{due to an}} interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.|$|E

5|$|Kleine was a philologist, his lessons {{not held}} in {{contemporary}} language, {{and it is}} <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> certain all subjects Busch and his friend were taught. Busch did learn elementary arithmetic from his uncle, although science lessons {{might have been more}} comprehensive, as Kleine, like many other clergymen, was a beekeeper, and published essays and textbooks on the subject— Busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee-keeping in his future stories. Drawing, and German and English poetry, were also taught by Kleine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> his {{offensive}} ability, Regehr ended a 100-game goal scoring drought {{early in the}} season, finishing with four for the season. He set a career high with 18 points, and was {{a key player in}} the Flames improbable run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals facing top opposition players. He played the final two games of the Stanley Cup Final despite tearing ligaments in his foot in game five. His performance in the post season earned him the praise of his opponents.|$|E
5|$|Oda's {{parents were}} Danish, {{and he may}} have been born in East Anglia. His father was said to have been a Dane who came to England in 865, {{together}} with the Viking army of Ubba and Ivar, and presumably settled in East Anglia. Oda's nephew Oswald of Worcester later became Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald's relatives Oscytel, afterwards Archbishop of York, and Thurcytel, an abbot, were also relatives of Oda, but this is <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> sure.|$|E
