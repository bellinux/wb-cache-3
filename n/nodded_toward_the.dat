60|$|Hester <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{trail that}} wormed {{its way across}} the prairie. A girl was riding toward them.|$|E
60|$|Kenwyne laughed, and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open window, {{through which}} they {{heard the sound of}} cheerful {{whistling}} approaching them along the trail.|$|E
60|$|She smiled {{permission}} and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> smoking lanai, {{where they}} found him talking sugar politics with the oldsters when the dance began to break up.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is the Jason Jones picture," [...] said an attendant, {{answering}} {{her question}} and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> admiring group; [...] "that's the prizewinner--over there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish you'd step in there," [...] <b>the</b> Squire said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> room {{opposite}} the kitchen, [...] "and bring {{me out the}} Laws of Ohio. You know where it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's eyes; I saw {{you lift}} your eyebrows, and <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> carriage, and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again," [...] cried Nat, who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Erickson?" [...] Thacher smiled. [...] "You {{look like}} a {{commercial}} man, to me." [...] He <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sample case on the floor. [...] "Am I right?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rochester {{had entered}} the library {{and closed the door}} behind him. He <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> man who rose slowly to greet him, but ignored his outstretched hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} it was a fool move to let that money lay around loose," [...] was Andy Jimson's comment, and he <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> piles of bank bills.|$|E
50|$|Years ago, as {{continuity}} strips {{gave way}} to humor strips, typeset episode subtitles vanished from strips. In a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> classic daily strips of yesteryear, Griffith keeps the tradition alive by always centering a hand-lettered subtitle above each Zippy strip.|$|R
5000|$|When a man puts on this {{authentic}} French farmer's shirt he {{may very}} well find that his hands look bigger....Is that woman over there giving him <b>the</b> eye and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> haystack? Yes, and he knows what to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{pleasant}} to see thee resting, mother, and every {{thing going on}} so well," [...] he said, glancing about the room, where the old lady sat, and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, where Christie was toasting bread in her neatest manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shirts for Boo, sir. Four, {{and this}} is the last," [...] she answered, with pardonable pride, as she held it up and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pile in her basket.|$|E
60|$|Milton smiled, {{but did not}} reply. He only <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> exhorter, a {{man with}} a puffy jumble of {{features}} and the form of a gladiator, who was uttering wild and explosive phrases.|$|E
6000|$|Alec <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> skin {{which was}} to be Spud Ely's. [...] "It's the same one," [...] said he. [...] "I've kept part of him {{ripening}} out in the storehouse against this day," [...] he explained.|$|E
5000|$|The convention's {{purpose is}} to {{celebrate}} science fiction, fantasy, and horror [...] "in all its various forms", but with a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> literary side of these closely related genres. For some years its programming has been built around a different yearly theme.|$|R
50|$|Allium phariense has 1-3 egg-shaped bulbs up to 10 15 mm in diameter. Scape {{is up to}} 15 cm long, usually <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tip. Leaves {{are about}} the same length as the scape. Umbel is a spherical cluster of many white flowers crowded together.|$|R
6000|$|One day as Becky {{came to rest}} a {{few minutes}} and shell peas, Emily put down her book to help; and as the pods flew, she said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{delicate}} ferns that grew thickly all about the trough, the rock, and the grassy bank,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Bridge <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear room. [...] "The stove is in there," [...] he said. [...] "We'd {{better go}} on and make a fire. Draw your pistol--whoever did this has {{probably}} beat it; but it's just as well {{to be on the}} safe side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{more than}} grown," [...] she smiled. [...] "I was thirty-one in May. Tell me," [...] she asked, {{choosing}} {{another of the}} beans which he still absently held, [...] "do you get them for these?" [...] And she <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Dalton Street waifs.|$|E
6000|$|He {{spoke up}} {{promptly}} and briskly {{in the outer}} office, and caused the pretty girl to look away from her copying at him. [...] "Is Mr. Lapham in?" [...] he asked; and after that moment for reflection which an array of book-keepers so addressed likes to give the inquirer, a head was lifted from a ledger and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> inner office.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, so I understood," [...] said Lapham, with a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> son. [...] "I believe Mr. Corey, here, told Mrs. Lapham." [...] He {{leaned back}} in his chair, stiffly {{resolute}} to show that he was not incommoded by the exchange of these civilities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lie {{down and}} take a good nap, mother dear, I feel first-rate, and Frank can see to me if I want anything. Do, now," [...] he added, with a persuasive <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> couch, and a boyish relish in {{stirring}} up his lazy brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cospetto!" [...] grunted Vito Viti, nudging his neighbor, <b>the</b> vice-governatore, and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other boat; [...] "if that be not little Ghita, {{who came}} into our island like a comet and went out of it--to what shall I liken her sudden and {{extraordinary}} disappearance, Signor Andrea?--" ...|$|R
60|$|An hour passed, and Dave {{was growing}} {{tired of the}} watch, when White Buffalo, who lay beside him, gave his sleeve a quick jerk and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> waterfall. As the young hunter looked in the {{direction}} he saw a sudden movement, and Pontiac emerged on the rocks, dripping wet. An instant later Foot-in-His-Mouth followed, and both climbed down {{to the side of}} the pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} and this young man," [...] said Bridge, his voice now {{suddenly}} stern. [...] "We {{have been watching}} you and followed you from the Squibbs house. We found the dead man there last night;" [...] Bridge <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> quilt enveloped thing upon the ground; [...] "and we suspect that you had an accomplice." [...] Here he frowned meaningly upon Willie Case. The youth trembled and stammered.|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s what I meant, of course," [...] said Mrs. Riddel, {{recovering}} {{herself with}} a laugh. [...] "I had no idea still—if you prefer—-" [...] The Major took her hand again, and Miss Philpotts set Mr. Halibut an example—which he did not follow—by gazing meditatively out of the window. Finally she gathered up her work and quitted the room. Mrs. Riddel smiled over at Mr. Halibut and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Major.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{wonder if}} you found that you'd brought a {{firebrand}} into the family, Alec. Two, in fact, for Phebe is a fine girl, and the lads have found it out already if I'm not mistaken," [...] added Uncle Mac, with a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other room.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's in t' blood," [...] said one, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> young man. [...] "Ay, headstrong folly's bred in t' bone of them, an' it's {{safer to}} counter an angry bull than a Thurston of Crosbie Ghyll. It's like his grandfather--roughed {{out of the}} old hard whinstane he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph {{is going}} to send my bust. He asked if he might, and mother said Yes. Mr. German thinks it very good, and I hope other people will," [...] said Jill, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> little plaster head that smiled down from its bracket with her own merry look.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I have kissed her," [...] {{answered}} Ralph, [...] "it is {{with her}} consent, and because she will be my wife; but you worked upon her pity to put her to shame and now you shall pay the price of it. Do you see that whip?" [...] and he <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sjambock that {{was lying on the}} grass. [...] "Let him who proves the best man use it upon the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{teach you}} how to camp, if you'll let me," [...] she continued. [...] "I've been on lots of surveys with father, and I always take my share of the work. I threw that hitch alone." [...] She <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pack-horse, whose neat load gave {{evidence}} of her skill. [...] "I told father this was to be a real camping expedition, and as the grouse season is on we'll live on the country. Can you fish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayhap, master. But {{for my part}} I am {{content with}} that of Murgh, which he gave us, you may remember, or so I {{understood}} him. Moreover, did he not teach that he and all are but ministers of Him above? Therefore I {{go straight to the}} head of the stair," [...] and he <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sky. [...] "I am content to skip all those steps which are called priests and altars and popes and saints and such-like folk, living or dead. If Murgh's wisdom be true, as I think, these are but garnishings to the dish which can well be spared by the hungry soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not afraid. He can't be very dreadful, for {{the box is}} not {{any longer}} than we are. Natural history is very useful; I've heard mamma say so, and I shall talk with him while we rest here," [...] {{answered}} Flo, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> eye which now took {{the place of the}} nose.|$|R
6000|$|Lowering {{his voice}} he said, with a {{significant}} <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> governess, [...] "Because I have a fancy that she {{is at the bottom}} of Sydney's mystery. He's not been himself lately, and now he is gone without a word. I rather like romances in real life, if they are not too long, or difficult to read." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{went out}} {{just before you}} came," [...] said Marcia, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> gate. She sat {{listening}} to Mrs, Halleck's talk about Ben; Mrs. Halleck took herself to task from time to time, but only to go on talking about him again. Sometimes Marcia commented on his characteristics, and compared them with Bartley's, or with Flavia's, according to the period of Ben's life under consideration.|$|R
