5|$|Upon impact, Rose lies {{unconscious}} on {{the beach}} with the fuselage survivors, but is eventually revived by Jack (Matthew Fox). During {{the first few days}} on the Island, Rose is in shock, and keeps herself away from the other survivors, attracting the attention of Jack. While Jack believes that Bernard is dead, Rose is adamant that he is still alive. After Claire (Emilie de Ravin) is kidnapped by the Island's inhabitants (known to the survivors as the Others), Rose comforts Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who believes it is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault</b> and encourages him not to lose hope and prays for him.|$|E
5|$|Amira and Anthony's {{relationship}} continues {{and after}} having a small argument with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Amira goes over to Anthony's house and the pair end up having sex for the first time. However, she later cries afterwards and appears to regret it. She tells him it felt wrong, but it is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> She then decides to leave Walford without telling him. Anthony later learns that Amira has left after Syed tells him. When Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) takes a liking to Anthony, her father Derek forces Anthony to take her out. Anthony {{is not interested in}} Alice, but is scared of Derek so cannot refuse. They have a couple of dates, but they go badly. Several weeks later, Alice receives flowers and assumes they are from Anthony. Anthony is then forced to take her out again, as {{he does not want to}} upset her.

60|$|JUNO. I'm {{prepared}} to promise never to do so. I think your husband {{has a right}} to demand that. Then if I speak to you after, it will <b>not</b> be <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> It will be a breach of my promise; and I shall not attempt to defend my conduct.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} on planet continues to spin {{out of control}} (thus {{the title of the}} book).

5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} between Kane and Gene Snitsky. At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The next night on Raw, Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, {{give him a}} rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, The Highlight Reel. Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice. Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky. During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring. This led to Kane accidentally falling {{on top of her}} after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention. The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week. On the September 27 episode of Raw, in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions. The following week, Lita gave her first interview since the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky. During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense. This led Bischoff to announce a Weapon of Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be able to vote on whether a lead pipe, a steel chain, or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.|$|E

She vanishes and leaves Marissa Tasker, her fraternal twin sister, in her place, telling him that {{he still has a}} {{daughter}} left in the world. She appears to JR on June 29 when he visits her gravesite, asking himself how he can ever live without her; he calls her by her true name, Arabella.|$|E

50|$|But {{at night}} Malini executes her revenge plan and sedates Varun and sadistically penectomises him. When he regains {{consciousness}} {{she tells him}} that she has removed his male organ through a medical surgery. While Varun finds himself in intense pain and bound to his bed, she taunts him to make him realize <b>his</b> <b>faults</b> and the gross wrongs he committed to her and rationalizes her crime. But he doesn't yield to her taunts and reveals a back-story concerning his mother and that {{his life as a}} pimp is <b>not</b> entirely <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, though this was <b>not</b> entirely <b>his</b> <b>fault</b> - there were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers. Santesson himself, despite a modicum of controversy over his heavy use of UFO and related material, was kind and helpful to writers, and was well liked as a result.|$|R
500|$|Michael Schumacher, who was {{involved}} in the first lap incident, believed that the race should have been stopped. However, he praised the work of the marshals who had assisted to recover the cars involved. He also believed that Zonta had [...] "over-estimated his ability" [...] and said he would have a [...] "quiet word" [...] with the latter. Zonta believed that the incident was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault</b> and that Michael Schumacher braked harder than him, but apologised for his retirement from the race. Fisichella also agreed that the race should have been stopped, saying, [...] "Three of the protagonists are out and it was stupid not to red flag." [...] Benetton Technical Director Pat Symonds was highly critical of the driver's actions as he believed Benetton lost valuable points towards the Constructors' Championship. [...] "The driving antics of some of our competitors at the first corner were appalling and ruined the race not only for many of the drivers but also for many of the spectators" [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Another deleted scene {{involved}} Bruce {{waking up}} after being {{shot in the}} head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the Batmobile was, and Alfred says, [...] "Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave." [...] The platform then rotates downward to another level where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special Batsuit to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault</b> after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by Rick Baker, {{who was in charge of}} the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 March 2015, the BBC {{released}} an official statement confirming that, {{as a result}} of the actions which led to his suspension, they would not be renewing his contract with the show. Following the statement, North Yorkshire Police requested to view the report and stated that [...] "action will be taken by North Yorkshire police where necessary". However, Tymon has informed the police that he does not wish to press charges against Clarkson, and Clarkson urged fans of the show to stop trolling Tymon on social media, as what happened was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> British police have announced they are investigating death threats made against BBC Director-General Tony Hall over the issue. Less than 24 hours after his dismissal, Clarkson was approached by Zvezda, a Russian state broadcaster, to present a motoring programme.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of Kima, McNulty tracks down the elusive outlaw Omar Little, gaining his respect and cooperation. Omar agrees to testify against Marquis [...] "Bird" [...] Hilton, a Barksdale soldier. His {{assistance}} also leads to McNulty inadvertently solving one of Michael Santangelo's old cases; a grateful Santangelo in turn reveals {{that he is a}} mole for Rawls, who is looking for an excuse to fire McNulty. Kima introduces McNulty to her confidential informant, Bubbles. When she is shot in a buy-bust sting operation gone wrong, McNulty is guilt-ridden, though even Rawls assures him that the shooting is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> McNulty has a frank discussion with Daniels in which he admits that the Barksdale case is no more than an exercise in intellectual vanity and an opportunity to demonstrate the BPD's shortcomings. Daniels tells him that everyone has known this all along but that the case has taken on meaning for those involved.|$|E
60|$|When Simon Glover, {{having seen}} his friend Henry duly {{taken care of}} in his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of Campsie, he found his {{daughter}} extremely ill of a fever, in consequence of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly the catastrophe of her late playmate. The affection of the glee maiden rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it should <b>not</b> be <b>his</b> <b>fault</b> if she ever touched lute again, save for her own amusement.|$|R

It is <b>not</b> always <b>his</b> <b>fault</b> if the way which is shown him to freedom must cross the rivers of blood." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{all said}} {{that she could not}} marry him. Well, perhaps it might be so; nay, when she thought of it, must not that edict too {{probably}} be true? But if so, it would <b>not</b> be <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> He was true to her, and that satisfied her pride. He had taken from her, by surprise, a confession of her love. She had often regretted her weakness in allowing him to do so; but she could not regret it now. She could endure to suffer; nay, it would not be suffering while he suffered with her.|$|R
2500|$|On the September 13 {{episode of}} Raw, during a No Holds Barred match between Kane and Gene Snitsky, Snitsky accidentally pushed Kane {{on top of}} his {{on-screen}} wife Lita, who had interfered in the match. The match came to an immediate end as trainers and Emergency medical technicians took Lita on a stretcher to an ambulance, as she needed medical attention. In the storyline Lita was pregnant {{and as a result of}} the accident she suffered a miscarriage. Despite Snitsky's protestations, that the miscarriage was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>fault,</b> Kane attacked Snitsky, leading to a bloody brawl on the October 4 episode of Raw, which led to a Weapon of Choice match between the two for Taboo Tuesday. The match was voted to be a steel chain match, where the only weapon that could be used was a steel chain. Snitsky defeated Kane at Taboo Tuesday after locking a steel chair around Kane's neck, and jumping onto it from the top rope, causing Kane to bleed from the mouth. In the following weeks, Snitsky would mock Lita's miscarriage before and during matches, using a [...] "No Babies" [...] road sign and a baby carriage in a street fight against Eugene. On the December 27 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a match between Kane and Snitsky for New Year's Revolution.|$|E

6000|$|On the whole, he {{was glad}} to feel that if one of these derelicts did not secure the [...] "good pay for the right man," [...] it would <b>not</b> be <b>his</b> <b>fault.</b> He had been the last to arrive, and he would be the last to pass through that door, which was the gateway of adventure--the door with Mr. Boole inscribed on its ground glass, behind which sat the author of the mysterious request for assistance, {{interviewing}} applicants.

6000|$|The truth is, {{that what}} has put Byron out of favour with the public of late has been <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>faults</b> but <b>his</b> excellences. His artistic good taste, his {{classical}} polish, his sound shrewd sense, his hatred of cant, his insight into humbug above all, his shallow, pitiable habit of being always intelligible--these are the sins which condemn him {{in the eyes of}} a mesmerising, table-turning, spirit-rapping, spiritualising, Romanising generation, who read Shelley in secret, and delight in his bad taste, mysticism, extravagance, and vague and pompous sentimentalism. The age is an effeminate one, and it can well afford to pardon the lewdness of the gentle and sensitive vegetarian, while it has no mercy for that of the sturdy peer proud of his bull neck and his boxing, who kept bears and bull-dogs, drilled Greek ruffians at Missoloughi, and [...] "had no objection to a pot of beer;" [...] and who might, if he had reformed, have made a gallant English gentleman; while Shelley, if once his intense self-opinion had deserted him, would have probably ended in Rome as an Oratorian or a Passionist.|$|R

60|$|Miss Miggs, {{brightening}} again, rejoined, {{with many}} breaks and pauses from excess of feeling, that temptations had been Simmuns's bane. That it was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>faults,</b> but hers (meaning Dolly's). That {{men did not}} see through these dreadful arts as women did, and therefore was caged and trapped, as Simmun had been. That she had no personal motives to serve--far from it--on the contrary, her intentions was good towards all parties. But forasmuch as she knowed that Simmun, if united to any designing and artful minxes (she would name no names, for that was not her dispositions)--to ANY designing and artful minxes--must be made miserable and unhappy for life, she DID incline towards prewentions. Such, she added, was her free confessions. But as this was private feelings, and might perhaps be looked upon as wengeance, she begged the gentleman would say no more. Whatever he said, wishing to do her duty by all mankind, even by them as had ever been her bitterest enemies, she would not listen to him. With that she stopped her ears, {{and shook her head}} from side to side, to intimate to Mr Dennis that though he talked until he had no breath left, she was as deaf as any adder.|$|R
