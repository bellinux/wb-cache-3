5|$|After the war, Texas {{returned}} to peacetime duty, interrupted by several refits. She became the station ship in Charleston, South Carolina, by 1908 and was renamed San Marcos in 1911 {{to allow her}} name {{to be used by}} a new battleship. She became a target ship that same year and was sunk in shallow water in Chesapeake Bay. She was used as a gunnery target through World War II and was finally demolished in 1959 because her remains were considered a <b>navigational</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve {{miles off the coast}} of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a <b>navigational</b> <b>hazard.</b> The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief <b>navigational</b> <b>hazard.</b> However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{agreed with}} Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had {{original}} title to Pedra Branca, rejecting Singapore's {{argument that the}} island was terra nullius. It found it was not disputed that Johor had established itself as a sovereign state with a certain territorial domain in Southeast Asia since it came into existence in 1512. As Pedra Branca had always been known as a <b>navigational</b> <b>hazard</b> in the Singapore Strait, which was a vital channel for international navigation in east-west trade between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, it was inconceivable that the island had remained undiscovered by the local community. It was therefore reasonable to infer that Pedra Branca lay within the general geographical scope of the Johor Sultanate. Further, during {{the existence of the}} old Johor Sultanate, {{there was no evidence of}} any competing claims over the islands in the Singapore Strait. It also agreed with Malaysia's submission that descriptions of the relationship between the Sultan of Johor and the Orang Laut in 19th-century official British reports proved that the Sultan exercised sovereign authority over the Orang Laut. Since the Orang Laut made the islands in the Singapore Strait their habitat, this confirmed the [...] "ancient original title" [...] of the Johor Sultanate to those islands, including Pedra Branca. As regards Singapore's argument that the traditional concept of Malay sovereignty was based on control over people rather than territory, the Court observed that sovereignty comprises control over both persons and territory. However, it was not necessary to deal with the point further as it had already found that Johor had territorial sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{prepared}} for scuttling during late 2009 and early 2010: her mast (which would have become a <b>navigational</b> <b>hazard</b> once the ship was scuttled) was removed, dangerous materials and toxins were removed, and access holes were cut in the ship's flanks. The ship {{was scheduled to be}} sunk on 27 March, [...] offshore from Avoca Beach, New South Wales, in [...] of water. Local resident action groups campaigned to prevent the scuttling, claiming that the wreck would affect tides and littoral sand drift, and that the removal of chemicals and hazardous materials in the ship had not been thorough enough, with the chance that marine life and people could be poisoned.|$|E

2500|$|Restigouche {{was paid}} off on 31 August 1994. In November 2000, she, along with sister ship , was towed to Mexico {{for use as}} an {{artificial}} reef. The acquisition of Restigouche and Kootenay for use as artificial reefs became a source of controversy in Mexico. Restigouche and Kootenay were purchased by businessmen Carlos Estrabeau and Josefat Cortés, for $160,000 from the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia (ARSBC) after {{the two men were}} inspired by ARSBC's work with other former Canadian ships off the coast of British Columbia. Supported by their government, controversy arose after an investigation by the Acapulco-based newspaper La Jornada El Sur found that $100,000 of the total amount paid for the destroyer escorts had come from a government anti-poverty fund. Dubbed [...] "Reefgate", it was later found that the owners did not have the permits to create an artificial reef and were fined by the government. The former destroyer escort was sunk off Acapulco on 11 June 2001. The ship was towed [...] into Acapulco Bay and scuttled in [...] of water by the government who feared that the derelict ship would become a <b>navigational</b> <b>hazard</b> during the hurricane season.|$|E
