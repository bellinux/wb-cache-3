5|$|In 1964, Abbe {{returned}} to Japan for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. While in his homeland, {{he met with}} Ueshiba, updated him {{on the progress of}} aikido in the UK, and asked him to send another instructor to the UK to continue teaching the art. In 1966, Ueshiba sent Kazuo (T. K.) Chiba to the UK to continue the work Abbe had begun. Henry O'Tani (2009) has stated that during Abbe's absence from the UK, a dismissed BJC senior executive and several senior instructors misappropriated his financial and organisational resources and set up their own BJC group. In 1969, Abbe {{returned to}} the UK, but was distraught by the situation with this group that he had <b>not</b> <b>authorised.</b> When he asked former colleagues to help him rebuild the organisation, they refused; he subsequently left the UK, never to return.|$|E
5|$|When Charles {{attempted}} to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom; {{his first visit}} since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted in the Anglican rite. In 1637, the king ordered {{the use of a}} new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English Book of Common Prayer, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the Kirk. Although written, under Charles's direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing the new prayer book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland. On 23 July, riots erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer book's usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the National Covenant, whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> by Kirk and Parliament. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished episcopal church government by bishops, and adopted Presbyterian government by elders and deacons.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocity <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> by Congress. FATCA as {{implemented}} by Congress included {{no mention of}} reciprocity. Rather, the Executive Branch's IGA implementation of FATCA has made reciprocity promises to foreign governments.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, section 2(1) of the 1911 Act does <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> the Commons to remove, {{attenuate}} {{or modify}} in any respect {{any of the}} conditions on which its law-making power is granted.|$|R
5000|$|Dean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307 (D.C. 1995). DC does <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> {{same-sex}} marriage; {{denial of}} a marriage license does not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.|$|R
25|$|From 1900 to 1906, Münchmeyer's {{successor}} Adalbert Fischer {{published the}} first book editions. These were revised by third hand and published under May's real name instead of pseudonym. This edition was <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> by May {{and he tried to}} stop the publication.|$|E
25|$|The only {{authorised}} expulsion at {{this time}} took place at Qisarya, south of Haifa, where Palestinian Arabs were evicted and their houses destroyed on 19–20 February 1948. In attacks that were <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> in advance, several communities were expelled by the Haganah and several others were chased away by the Irgun.|$|E
25|$|The prime {{minister}} is the President of the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power— and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is {{similar to those in}} most other parliamentary systems, but the leader of the Italian government is <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 {{he visited}} the United Kingdom to ask Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> usage of water cannons. In an {{editorial}} to The Telegraph Wagner opposed the use of water cannons.|$|R

50|$|House of Lords {{held the}} {{memorandum}} allowing carrying {{on the trade}} of mining did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> the nuisance, unless it could be proven that the trade could not otherwise be continued. There was no easement for making coal dust.|$|R
25|$|The {{intelligence}} work of Special Branch {{was often}} overlooked in some circles. This is because its role sat somewhere between {{that of the}} Security Service (MI5) {{and that of the}} Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13). Special Branch officers were usually the ones to perform arrests of suspected spies, since Security Service officers are <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> to take such actions; an example being the Portland Spy Ring.|$|E
25|$|Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham {{was advised}} of the {{sightings}} at 14:00. He was <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> {{to take any}} action against the convoy, as Britain was not at war with Japan, the Japanese intentions were still unclear, and no aggressive action had yet been taken against British or Thai territory. He put his forces in Malaya on full alert and ordered continued surveillance of the convoy.|$|E
25|$|On 27 October 2008, {{the same}} group asked {{permission}} to hold a protest in support of gay rights near the Russian Embassy in Minsk. Both events were <b>not</b> <b>authorised.</b> Because the country is currently {{not a member of}} the Council of Europe, Belarusian activists cannot appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. It is {{the same group}} which decided to organise with Russian LGBT activists a Slavic Pride which is planned to alternate between Moscow and Minsk every year.|$|E
25|$|Dawson J, in {{addition}} to holding that the 1918 Ordinance did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> genocide, held that section 122 of the Constitution would permit the Parliament of Australia {{to pass a law}} that did authorise genocide. Gummow J agreed with Dawson J.|$|R
50|$|The FCC granted six-month special {{technical}} {{authority to}} WTVE Reading, Pennsylvania in December 2006, {{allowing it to}} operate a distributed transmission system on an experimental basis but did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> the systems on any permanent, licensed basis at that time.|$|R
5|$|In late 2011, {{there were}} reports that Winehouse's former boyfriend, Reg Traviss, was {{developing}} a film about her. Winehouse's father Mitch Winehouse, who owns the copyright to his daughter's music, said he would <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> the use of her music for the film.|$|R
25|$|On 16September 2008, the Dhaka Warriors {{team was}} the ninth team {{to join the}} Indian Cricket League. The team {{consists}} of 13 Bangladeshi cricketers. The players all received 10-year bans from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for joining the league which is <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> by the International Cricket Council. Balwinder Sandhu, a former Indian all-rounder coaches the team which {{will play in the}} second season on the league, beginning on 10October 2008. The team will represent Bangladesh in the ICL World Series which follows the league.|$|E
25|$|No. 670, while {{introducing}} {{a number of}} innovations that would later become standard, was <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> to carry standing passengers, and thus lacked the necessary capacity for use on busy suburban routes. It {{was to have been}} deployed on a Rangiora service for which its generous luggage accommodation would be useful, but deregulation resulted in the license for the Rangiora service being awarded to another operator before no. 670 was delivered. Consequently, it was never used in revenue service, and was sold after being used for a series of demonstration trips.|$|E
25|$|Female police {{officers}} were initially given six-day, 48-hour work weeks, and {{were not allowed to}} work night shifts apart from when on-call duties until 1973. Female officers did in fact do a week of nights at least from 1965. Female officers were usually seconded to the Criminal Investigation Department, but in 1921 Lilian Wyles was appointed the first female Inspector to the Criminal Intelligence Department. A policy in place from 1927 until 1946 forced women to leave the Metropolitan Police if they got married. Female {{police officers}} were <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> to take fingerprints until 1937. The Police Federation, the rank-and-file staff association, let women join in 1948.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was also}} found that iiNet had in place an [...] "anti-piracy policy" [...] and while that was {{not up to the}} {{standards}} demanded of them by AFACT, it was considered acceptable to the court that iiNet did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> copyright infringing activities on their network.|$|R
50|$|Bentley Motors {{withdrew from}} racing in 1930, and closed down the {{following}} year; {{they were then}} purchased by Rolls-Royce Limited, who did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> racing for a few years. Dorothy Paget withdrew her support for Birkin's racing team in October 1930, but continued to support Birkin's in No.1.|$|R
50|$|The GSOC had {{received}} up to October 2009 {{a total of}} 111 complaints in regard to policing of the protests, of which 78 were deemed admissible. The Director of Public Prosecutions was sent seven files but did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> criminal prosecution of Gardaí {{in any of the}} seven cases.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{offensive}} was <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> {{and it was}} cancelled six hours after it had been launched. An investigation was launched by the HV, and two senior officers were relieved of their duty, before being reassigned to new positions. According to General Martin Špegelj, the decision to abort {{the offensive}} was wrong as it meant a missed opportunity to recapture Baranja which had been lost to the JNA in 1991. Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo {{pointed out that the}} offensive presented a significant political problem to Croatian leadership as it meant that the political leaders of Croatia had poor control over its military, or that Croatia was violating its international obligations towards the United Nations (UN) in respect of the Vance plan at the time the country sought to {{become a member of the}} UN.|$|E
25|$|Deng Ai pursued Jiang Wei to Yinping, {{where he}} formed {{a group of}} elite {{soldiers}} from among his troops and took a shortcut to Jiangyou (江由; north of present-day Jiangyou, Sichuan) through Handeyang Village (漢德陽亭; northwest of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), and approached Mianzhu Pass (緜竹關; in present-day Mianzhu, Sichuan), which was near the Shu capital Chengdu. He asked Zhuge Xu to join him. Zhuge Xu had received orders to block Jiang Wei's advance and was <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> to join Deng Ai in his mission, so he led his force to Baishui fort to rendezvous with Zhong Hui. Zhong Hui ordered Tian Zhang (田章) and others to lead a force to bypass the west of Jiange and approach Jiangyou. Along the way, they encountered three groups of Shu ambushers, defeated them and destroyed their camps. Deng Ai let Tian Zhang lead the vanguard and clear the path.|$|E
25|$|Unique among British cavalry regiments {{was that}} the Scots Greys fielded bagpipers. These bagpipers were {{initially}} formed by and {{paid for by the}} regiment because they were <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> pipers on strength. At various times throughout the history of the regiment, there were pipers in the regiment, but these were unofficial. While stationed in India in the 1920s, the regiment fielded its first mounted pipers. At the end of the Second World War, the British Army was contracting from its wartime strength. Despite the contraction of some Scottish Territorial and Yeomanary units, some of the personnel were retained by the army and sent to various other units. As part of this, the Scots Greys received a small pipe band from one of these demobilised units. King George VI took a particular interest in the Scots Greys' pipe band. His interest was so great that he took part {{in the design of the}} band's uniform, awarding them the right to wear the Royal Stuart tartan.|$|E
60|$|The {{reasons for}} this seemed to be, first, that Campbell states {{that he did not}} ask Lady Byron's leave, and that she did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> him to defend her; and, second, that, having asked some {{explanations}} from her, he prints a note in which she declines to give any.|$|R
2500|$|The {{international}} {{boundary of the}} Canaries {{is the subject of}} dispute between Spain and Morocco. Morocco's official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> Spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, since the Canary Islands enjoy a high degree of autonomy.|$|R
50|$|Two-party {{systems are}} similar to multiparty systems in that power is not {{concentrated}} in one party and that parties {{have to consider the}} opinion of the general public in order to retain power by winning elections. However, two-party systems restrict the people's democratic rights by <b>not</b> <b>authorising</b> the citizen's to found their own political parties.|$|R
25|$|The Weights and Measures Act of 1878 {{effectively}} {{prohibited the}} use of metric weights for trade, the United Kingdom having declined to sign the Convention of the Metre three years previously. The standard imperial yard was not stable – in 1947 its rate of shrinkage was quantified and found to be one part per million every 23 years. In April 1884 HJ Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM (custodians of the standard metre) inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the United Kingdom. Broch, director of the BIPM replied that he was <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> to perform any such calibrations for non-member states. On 17 September 1884, the British Government signed the convention {{on behalf of the}} United Kingdom. The Weights and Measures Act of 1897 authorized {{the use of}} metric units for trade; a list of metric to imperial equivalents being published the following year.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, Reza, {{along with}} five other Bangladesh players, {{informed}} the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) of {{his intention to}} retire from international and domestic cricket {{at the age of}} just 22. Reza and the others who decided to retire were summoned by the BCB to explain their decision, however they did not turn up to the meeting. Reza and 12 other Bangladeshi cricketers joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL), a Twenty20 competition <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> by the International Cricket Council; they joined the new franchise, the Dhaka Warriors, led by former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar. It was only the second team in the tournament to feature only players from one country. On 17 September 2008, the BCB announced that the 13 Bangladesh cricketers who had joined the ICL were banned for ten years. However, in June 2009 the players, including Reza, cut ties with the league; on 31 December the players became eligible for national selection.|$|E
25|$|Within Chesterfield, {{the river}} was navigable, as the Chesterfield Canal joined the river {{and used it to}} access basins on the western bank. The first basin was {{connected}} to the river near Wharf Lane footbridge, but the coming of the railway severed the link, and a new basin was constructed {{to the north of the}} Brimington Road bridge in 1890. The canal company were <b>not</b> <b>authorised</b> by their Act of Parliament to use the river, but did so despite that. This stretch of the river forms part of a £300 million redevelopment project called Chesterfield Waterside, which will provide housing and amenities in an area which is currently derelict land. The project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site. A new basin has been constructed near the site of the 1890 basin, although it has not yet been connected to the river. Outline planning permission for the whole site was granted on 15 March 2010.|$|E
50|$|The appeal {{addressed}} {{whether the}} Full Federal Court deviated in its {{application of the}} principles of authorisation and subsequently, whether the finding that iiNet did <b>not</b> <b>authorise</b> its users' copyright infringements is incorrect. The appeal also focused on whether the Full Court erred in its treatment of the amount of knowledge iiNet required to know before infringement could be validated.|$|R

25|$|I don't {{think there}} is any {{evidence}} that there have been any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is no evidence of that.
