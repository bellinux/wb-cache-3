25|$|Eliza Acton’s Modern Cookery, {{in all its}} Branches : Reduced to a System of Easy Practice, {{for the use of}} Private Families {{was first}} {{published}} in 1845 and a number of editions are in the Cookery Collection at Leeds. Acton was extremely influential because she was the first cookery book writer to list the ingredients needed in a recipe and to <b>note</b> <b>how</b> long a dish takes to cook - an innovation which has become a standard feature of modern recipes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} was better received in season 9. Many critics <b>noted</b> <b>how</b> Nellie {{would play a}} major part in the final season's story lines. Most also <b>noted</b> <b>how</b> this would give her {{a second chance to}} win critics over. Cindy White, of IGN, enjoyed the pairing of Nellie and Pam in [...] "Andy's Ancestry", <b>noting</b> <b>how</b> [...] "Nellie was a lot more tolerable with Pam along for the ride." ...|$|R

25|$|This {{is further}} {{explored}} in other novels, and is notably covered in some depth in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, where Albus Dumbledore writes notes after each story which often concerns itself with Wizard-Muggle relationships. Part of these 'observations' <b>note</b> <b>how</b> The Tales were modified {{in the face}} of anti-muggle sentiment in order to remove any pro-muggle messages for wizards who did not want their children exposed to those messages (including Lucius Malfoy who demanded that the Tales be removed from the Hogwarts).|$|E
25|$|Vertical {{currency}} {{is a type}} of currency in which the orientation has been changed from the conventional horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation. Dowling Duncan, a self-touted multidisciplinary design studio, conducted a study in which they determined people tend to handle and deal with money vertically rather than horizontally, especially when {{currency is}} processed through ATM and other money machines. They also <b>note</b> <b>how</b> money transactions are conducted vertically not horizontally. Bermuda, Brazil, Cape Verde, Israel, Switzerland, and Venezuela have adopted vertically oriented currency, although Israel is now reverting to horizontal orientation.|$|E
25|$|Our {{considerations}} also yield a free construction for morphisms that do preserve meets {{instead of}} joins (i.e. upper adjoints of Galois connections). In fact, we merely have to dualize {{what was said}} above: free objects are given as powersets ordered by reverse inclusion, such that set union provides the meet operation, and the function f° is {{defined in terms of}} meets instead of joins. The result of this construction could be called a free complete meet-semilattice. One should also <b>note</b> <b>how</b> these free constructions extend those that are used to obtain free semilattices, where we only need to consider finite sets.|$|E
500|$|In her piece {{analysing}} game morality, Katherine Cross {{highlighted the}} beggar scene on Nar Shaddaa. Cross <b>noted</b> <b>how</b> it illustrated Kreia's morality, shed doubt on [...] "tokenist" [...] moral acts, and highlighted the player's own powerlessness. Hilary Goldstein <b>noted</b> <b>how</b> her philosophical points questioned {{the roles of}} the Jedi and the Sith.|$|R

25|$|According to Carretta, Vassa's baptismal {{record and}} a naval muster roll {{document}} him as from South Carolina. Carretta interpreted these anomalies as possible evidence that Equiano had made up the account of his African origins, and adopted material from others. But, Paul Lovejoy, Alexander X. Byrd, and Douglas Chambers <b>note</b> <b>how</b> many general and specific details Carretta can document from sources that related to the slave trade in the 1750s as described by Equiano, including the voyages from Africa to Virginia, sale to Captain Michael Henry Pascal in 1754, and others. They conclude he was more likely telling what he understood as fact than creating a fictional account; his work is shaped as an autobiography.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors <b>note</b> <b>how</b> solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E
500|$|Prison reforms followed, {{including}} {{improving the}} conditions of the castle facilities, although visitors continued to <b>note</b> <b>how</b> the castle was [...] "patched and cobbled like a worn-out shoe". In 1838 the role of constable was transformed into the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests. The court and jury rooms were turned into a local school, although occasional Courts of Attachment were held in the chapel and the castle retained its function as a prison until 1842, when the remaining inmates were transferred to the prison at Littledean.|$|E

5000|$|Mr. Cable, a [...] "friend", {{comes over}} and <b>notes</b> <b>how</b> they need a farm. Da fights back, but Mr. Cable asks Devon if he can work for him for a week's wages. Devon agrees, and decides to travel the next day {{so he can get}} there sooner. Harper <b>notes</b> <b>how</b> much she misses Devon, and guesses that Caffy misses Tin, but Mam and Da argue that Caffy doesn't know Tin and he can't miss what he never had.Devon comes home a week later, and starts crying. He <b>notes</b> <b>how</b> Mr. Cable sent him home without a penny and an hour's {{instruction}} to build the fences. His dream to own a pony named Champion was ruined and he ignores everyone for a whole week. Da tries to talk to Mr. Cable, but he <b>notes</b> <b>how</b> Devon made two of his sows run away with his [...] "lousy" [...] fences. Da apologizes and goes back, saying [...] "Mr. Cable has no heart, you can't talk him out of it." ...|$|R

500|$|The episode's premise {{began with}} the idea of a {{computer}} virus being able to spread to humans, which then evolved into the story of a man who comes into his unique abilities. Series consultant Glen Whitman noted the premise was based on the [...] "very very weak magnetic field" [...] of electrical energy surrounding humans that an EEG detects, and the writers simply amplified this. The special effects crew undertook much preparation to simulate a chase sequence involving an exploding transformer, leading guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach to <b>note</b> <b>how</b> scary the effect was to film.|$|E
500|$|Another theme found {{throughout}} {{the book is the}} hardship of life in the wild. Reviews have <b>note</b> <b>how</b> the story does not cover up the hardships of Clan life. School Library Journal commented on how the story describes the hardships and difficulties of a feral cat's life in detail and how there is no sugarcoating of the violence. Fantasy Book Review also wrote [...] "Erin Hunter does not spare the reader from the grim realities of living in the wild". Kirkus Reviews noted that doing so shows how the Clans are on the brink of survival.|$|E
500|$|The {{carnival}} atmosphere attracted {{many voters}} {{at a time}} when there was little public entertainment, and the Whig ticket won easy majorities in both the popular and electoral vote. Harrison was inaugurated in March 1841; his death a month later marked the first time an American president had failed to complete his term. While some historians view Harrison's victorious campaign askance because of the role emotion played in it, others <b>note</b> <b>how</b> it originated techniques used in later presidential races. The unofficial campaign motto, [...] "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too", has been called the most famous presidential campaign slogan in American history.|$|E

500|$|Several props {{included}} large {{screens and}} LED lights that {{were placed in}} a three-wall room, omitting the front wall in order to shoot the video. Suzuki explained that the scenery is not in fact [...] "a night club", as she believed that it has [...] "no story" [...] and only works by the [...] "feel-good" [...] vibe of the song itself; however, she did <b>note</b> <b>how</b> the lights {{made it look like}} one. Nakata made a cameo appearance in the visual, appearing in the static televisions that were placed in the room. Length-wise, it took Akihisa one day to complete filming, with the entire crew and Suzuki spending majority of the entire day, and finishing at approximately 3am.|$|E
500|$|According to Sreehari Nair of Rediff.com, Maheshinte Prathikaaram has the key {{qualities of}} a great short story; he found it closer to the {{creative}} non-fiction style specialised by the writers of Esquire magazine in 1960s in terms of rhythm and pacing. Nair noted strong left-wing ideology in the film due to Pothan's political philosophy, with the director indirectly using the idea of equality inherent in his characters' belief system: [...] "A game one can play on every subsequent viewing of the movie is to <b>note</b> <b>how</b> a major character in one scene had appeared as a minor character in some scene before". Each of the film's characters was unique. Pushkaran later clarified that the film did not reflect his personal or political views.|$|E
500|$|Let Me In was {{not well}} {{received}} by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims {{that he was not}} remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote [...] "The movie he’s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it’s almost impossible to differentiate between them." [...] In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, [...] "Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in Let Me In than in the Alfredson version." [...] Beth Accomando wrote, [...] "How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you <b>note</b> <b>how</b> similar the script and the direction are to the original." [...] In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake [...] "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity." [...] Mark Kermode called it [...] "the most utterly redundant remake of the year".|$|E

500|$|Polish {{historian}} Henryk Samsonowicz echoes Michnik's {{essay in}} his introduction to a recent (2008) edition of Trzej kronikarze, describing Jasienica as a person who did much to popularize Polish history. Hungarian historian Balázs Trencsényi notes that [...] "Jasienica's impact of the formation of the popular interpretation of Polish history is hard to overestimate". British historian Norman Davies, himself an author of a popular account of Polish history (God's Playground), notes that Jasienica, while more of [...] "a historical writer than an academic historian", had [...] "formidable talents", gained [...] "much popularity" [...] and that his works would find no equals in the time of communist Poland. Samsonowicz notes that Jasienica [...] "was a brave writer", going against prevailing system, and willing to propose new hypotheses and reinterpret history in innovative ways. Michnik notes how Jasienica was willing to write about Polish mistakes, for example in the treatment of Cossacks. Ukrainian historian Stephen Velychenko also positively commented on Jasienica's extensive coverage of the Polish-Ukrainian history. Both Michnik and Samsonowicz <b>note</b> <b>how</b> Jasienica's works contain hidden messages in which Jasienica discusses more contemporary history, such as in his Rozważania....|$|E
500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to <b>note</b> <b>how</b> much better informed she was than I." ...|$|E
500|$|Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer <b>note</b> <b>how</b> Cordelia is also {{a subversive}} {{representation}} of feminine stereotypes, describing [...] "Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to {{the stereotype of the}} insensitive bitch", what she actually does is [...] "offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in [...] "Earshot", where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, [...] "her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical" [...] and because of this she embodies an [...] "antithesis of female self-sacrifice" [...] in these years but also [...] "the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women". Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia's [...] "lack of depth" [...] becoming [...] "her strength". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid however, pointing out [...] "Cordy's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible." [...] Jowett feels Cordelia's confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, [...] "bitchiness enhances Cordelia's comic appeal", as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth-telling.|$|E
