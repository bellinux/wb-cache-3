Hot compression tests were firstly conducted {{to obtain the}} magnesium alloy’s plastic flow stresses at high temperatures. These data {{are used in the}} finite element simulations of the thin strip extrusion process. Using the FE simulations, the flow pattern of the magnesium alloy billet within the die, the temperature variation and the thickness distribution at the die exit were analyzed. The effects of different die <b>bearing</b> <b>height</b> design, initial billet temperatures and ram speed on the extrusion load, the temperature at the die exit and the product thickness distribution were also discussed. Finally, hot extrusion experiments were conducted and the experimental values of the extrusion load and dimensions of the products were compared with the analytical values to validate the analytical model. Sound products were obtained using the best designed <b>bearing</b> <b>heights</b> and other appropriate extrusion conditions...|$|R

An infinite laminate case was analyzed for each laminate. Orthotropy had a significant influence on the tensile stress concentration at the hole. For example, the stress concentration factors for the infinite laminate cases ranged from 0. 82 to 2. 16, compared with 0. 87 for the quasi-isotropic laminate. The finite widths and edge distances strongly influenced the tensile stress concentration. For the practical range w/d or = 3, the peak tensile stresses were as much as 80 % larger than the infinite laminate reference value.

40|$|Abstract — Failure prognostics {{can help}} {{improving}} {{the availability and}} reliability of industrial systems while reducing their maintenance cost. The main purpose of failure prognostics is the anticipation {{of the time of}} a failure by estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In this case, the fault is not undergone and the estimated RUL can be used to take appropriate decisions depending on the future exploitation of the industrial system. This paper presents a data-driven prognostic method based on the utilization of signal processing techniques and regression models. The method is applied on accelerated degradations of bearings performed under the experimental platform called PRONOSTIA. The purpose of the proposed method is to generate a health indicator, which will be used to calculate the RUL. Two acceleration sensors are used on PRONOSTIA platform to monitor the degradation evolution of the tested bearings. The vibration signals related to the degraded bearings are then compared to a nominal vibration signal of a nondegraded <b>bearing</b> (<b>nominal</b> <b>bearing).</b> The comparison between the signals is done by calculating a correlation coefficient (which is considered as the health indicator). The values of the calculated correlation coefficient are then fitted to a regression model which is used to estimate the RUL. I...|$|R

This semi-analytical model uses a fluidic network of resistances and capacities to solve the pressure field in the bearing channel.

40|$|Designing a {{planetary}} suit is very complex and often requires difficult trade-offs between performance, cost, mass, and system complexity. In order to verifying that new suit designs meet requirements, full prototypes must eventually be built and tested with human subjects. Using computer models {{early in the}} design phase of new hardware development can be advantageous, allowing virtual prototyping to take place. Having easily modifiable models of the suit hard sections may reduce {{the time it takes}} to make changes to the hardware designs and then to understand their impact on suit and human performance. A virtual design environment gives designers the ability to think outside the box and exhaust design possibilities before building and testing physical prototypes with human subjects. Reductions in prototyping and testing may eventually reduce development costs. This study is an attempt to develop computer models of the hard components of the suit with known physical characteristics, supplemented with human subject performance data. Objectives: The primary objective was to develop an articulating solid model of the Mark III hip bearings to be used for evaluating suit design performance of the hip joint. Methods: Solid models of {{a planetary}} prototype (Mark III) suit s hip bearings and brief section were reverse-engineered from the prototype. The performance of the models was then compared by evaluating the mobility performance differences between the nominal hardware configuration and hardware modifications. This was accomplished by gathering data from specific suited tasks. Subjects performed maximum flexion and abduction tasks while in a <b>nominal</b> suit <b>bearing</b> configuration and in three off-nominal configurations. Performance data for the hip were recorded using state-of-the-art motion capture technology. Results: The results demonstrate that solid models of planetary suit hard segments for use as a performance design tool is feasible. From a general trend perspective, the suited performance trends were comparable between the model and the suited subjects. With the three off-nominal bearing configurations compared to the <b>nominal</b> <b>bearing</b> configurations, human subjects showed decreases in hip flexion of 64 %, 6 %, and 13 % and in hip abduction of 59 %, 2 %, and 20 %. Likewise the solid model showed decreases in hip flexion of 58 %, 1 %, and 25 % and in hip abduction of 56 %, 0 %, and 30 %, under the same condition changes from the nominal configuration. Differences seen between the model predictions and the human subject performance data could be attributed to the model lacking dynamic elements and performing kinematic analysis only, the level of fit of the subjects with the suit, the levels of the subject s suit experience...|$|R

However, {{in order to allow}} a uniform air pressure even with only some nozzles, air bearing manufacturers take constructive techniques.

During the development {{period of the}} suit numerous design iterations need to occur before the hardware meets human performance requirements. Using computer models early in the design phase of hardware development is advantageous, by allowing virtual prototyping to take place. A virtual design environment allows designers to think creatively, exhaust design possibilities, and study design impacts on suit and human performance. A model of the rigid components of the Mark III Technology Demonstrator Suit (planetary-type space suit) and a human manikin were created and tested in a virtual environment. The performance of the Mark III hip bearing model was first developed and evaluated virtually by comparing the differences in mobility performance between the <b>nominal</b> <b>bearing</b> configurations and modified bearing configurations. Suited human performance was then simulated with the model and compared to actual suited human performance data using the same bearing configurations. The Mark III hip bearing model was able to visually represent complex bearing rotations and the theoretical volumetric ranges of motion in three dimensions. The model was also able to predict suited human hip flexion and abduction maximums to within 10 % of the actual suited human subject data, except for one modified bearing condition in hip flexion which was off by 24 %. Differences between the model predictions and the human subject performance data were attributed {{to the lack of}} joint moment limits in the model, human subject fitting issues, and the limited suit experience of some of the subjects. The results demonstrate that modeling space suit rigid segments is a feasible design tool for evaluating and optimizing suited human performance.

40|$|The use of {{tilting pad}} journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) {{has increased in}} recent years due to their stabilizing effects on the rotor bearing system. Most of the studies addressing steady state and dynamic behaviors of TPJBs have been evaluated by means of thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) models, assuming nominal dimensions for the bearing, (i. e., the physical dimensions of all pads are identical and loads applied along the vertical direction). However machining errors could lead to actual bearing geometry and dimensions different from the nominal ones. In particular, for TPJB the asymmetry of the bearing geometry has not been well-investigated {{and can lead to}} an unexpected behavior of the bearing. The asymmetry of the bearing geometry can arise from large machining errors on only one or more pads, as a consequence of a pivot failure or after bad-mounting of the pads during assembly. These conditions can sometimes be detected by high values of the pad temperature, as measured by the temperature probes installed on the bearing pads, or by the abnormal vibration caused by pad-flutter phenomena. In this paper the authors investigate large machining errors on the pad thickness for a five-pad TPJB and analyze their effects on the bearing operating characteristics. Pad thickness errors correspond to a different preload factor or clearance for each pad. A sensitivity analysis was performed for several combinations of pad thickness using a THD model and the behavior of the bearing was analyzed, including dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients, clearance profile, shaft locus, minimum oil-film thickness, power loss, flow rate, and maximum pressure. The experimental case of a five pads TPJB with an intentional large machining error on the thickness of the pads is also described in the paper. The <b>bearing</b> has a <b>nominal</b> diameter of 100 mm, a diameter to length ratio (L/D) equal to 0. 7 and can run at up to 3000 rpm. The experimental measurements are compared with the results obtained from the analytical model. The results show that the effects of asymmetry of the bearing geometry are more evident if the direction of the static load applied on the rotor bearing system, which is different from the vertical load, is also considered. For instance, the shape of shaft locus obtained by experimental tests changing the static load direction at a constant speed is an irregular pentagon if it is compared to the case of the <b>nominal</b> <b>bearing.</b> Based on our findings, we concludes that the machining error on the pads has a large influence on the shaft locus, minimum oil-film thickness and maximum pressure on pads, especially at high rotational speed, but has little effect on the flow rate and power loss. In addition, this error significantly affects the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients, both in terms of rotational speed and load direction...|$|R
40|$|Seismic isolators, {{and more}} specifically, triple {{friction}} pendulum (TFP) bearings are ideal earthquake protection technologies {{for use in}} performance-based design {{because they can be}} designed to achieve multiple performance objectives corresponding to different levels of ground shaking. TFP bearings can limit structure displacement during a design basis (or maximum considered) earthquake while the still effectively isolating the structure under the service level earthquake, reducing seismic demands on the structure and its non-structural components. Furthermore, TFP bearings allow for a gradual transfer of force to the superstructure at ultimate displacement. 	This dissertation presents an advanced bidirectional model for the TFP bearing that is based on the kinematic and compatibility relationships of the components of the bearing. To validate the model, experimental characterization tests were conducted on the shake table at the University of California, Berkeley. Two distinct types of experiments were conducted: (a) displacement-controlled tests in which the bearings were cycled through specified orbits and (b) unrestrained tests in which the table replicated ground motions recorded during earthquakes. The bidirectional displacement-controlled tests, which are the first of their kind, generated new knowledge to aid in the development and validation of TFP numerical models. The experimental results provided valuable insight into TFP bearing response and showed that the developed bidirectional model accurately captured the observed behavior of the TFP bearing. The advanced model, which includes translational and rotational degrees of freedom in both horizontal directions, tracks all component displacements as well as the change in <b>bearing</b> <b>height</b> during lateral displacements. The model is general so that no a priori conditions regarding bearing properties are required for the validity of the model. These properties make the advanced TFP model a valuable tool to explore the use TFP technology in novel applications. 	To further the use of seismic isolation in more standard applications, simplified methods are needed for design. This dissertation investigates the use of generalized modal response spectrum methods to approximate global responses of isolated buildings without the need for costly non-linear numerical simulations. The advanced nonlinear TFP model is used for evaluation of the simplified methods. 	Advanced isolation models are important and necessary for understanding the complex nonlinear dynamic behavior exhibited by seismically isolated structures, and to have confidence that performance goals are achieved under a wide variety of seismic hazards. Such models can, as shown in this dissertation, also be used to assess and improve simplified analysis methods suitable for use in routine design...|$|R
