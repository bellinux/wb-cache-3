40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, the {{development}} of <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled machines has seen a plethora of part programming languages being developed. The large majority of these languages {{are based on the}} ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled machines and also from <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing part programs cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled part programming languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled machine activities and interpret/represent process information within <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled part programs written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different part programming languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> controlled machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the part programs and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market...|$|R
