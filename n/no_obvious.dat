5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E

5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, {{although there was}} <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> reason for the disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer cost would be about £645,000 for each. This was almost double the original cost and made them more expensive {{than any of the}} other monitors.|$|E

5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar Lucien Stiernon places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek Apostolos D. Karpozilos rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. {{referred}} to above, {{which was the}} largest yet to use purely molecular data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and {{a core group of}} Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, with the exception of stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> equivalent).|$|E
5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in transplacental transport.|$|E
5|$|Obama, at age 38, was a {{lecturer}} at the University of Chicago and a two-term state Senator. Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> reason to displace him to the voters, Obama ran anyway because of his frustration with what he claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature and the feeling Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate {{who worked as a}} clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E

60|$|The {{accumulated}} {{proof of}} which the Theory of Dew has been found susceptible, is a striking instance of the fullness of assurance which the inductive evidence of laws of causation may attain, in {{cases in which the}} invariable sequence is by <b>no</b> means <b>obvious</b> to a superficial view.|$|R
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. <b>No</b> <b>obvious</b> changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|The Fianchetto Variation {{has never}} been {{considered}} particularly dangerous for Black to meet, since White's setup does not put Black's position under immediate pressure. However, it also offers Black <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> target to attack—the fianchettoed bishop covers e4 and d5 and also protects White's king. Since the same bishop no longer covers the a6-f1 diagonal, White typically plays Nf3-d2-c4 to help defend against Black's queenside expansion. After further preparatory moves such as Bf4 and Re1, White {{may be able to}} push forward in the centre with e2-e4-e5. Noted proponents of the Fianchetto Variation have included strong positional players such as Viktor Korchnoi, Gennadi Sosonko and Predrag Nikolić, and after a recommendation by the influential theorist Boris Avrukh in 2010, the line has become more topical.|$|E

5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan of , {{are almost as}} large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>obvious</b> {{single source}} for the plot of The Tempest, but {{researchers}} have seen parallels in Erasmus's Naufragium, Peter Martyr's De orbe novo, and eyewitness reports by William Strachey and Sylvester Jordain of the real-life shipwreck of the Sea Venture on the islands of Bermuda, and the subsequent conflict between Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers. In addition, one of Gonzalo's speeches is derived from Montaigne's essay Of the Canibales, and much of Prospero's renunciative speech echoes a speech by Medea in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses. The masque in Act 4 {{may have been a}} later addition, possibly in honour of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. The play was first published in the First Folio of 1623.|$|E
50|$|Art {{supposedly}} {{gives us}} aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity {{of art to}} redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide <b>no</b> such <b>obvious</b> safety net.
