40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop anthropometrical {{reference}} data for women of <b>Uzbek</b> <b>nationality.</b> In total, 1413 women of <b>Uzbek</b> <b>nationality</b> aged ≥ 35 years were studied. BMI was calculated for 411 women. The reference values of BMI for Uzbek women vary from 19. 4 to 24. 8 kg/m 2; BMI 22. 7 kg/m 2 corresponds to the 50 th percentile. These results correspond to the WHO criteria for European populations. The reference values of WC vary from 65. 0 to 90. 0 cm. The conventional cut-off for normal WC (80 cm) corresponded to the 75 th percentile of the analysis among women of <b>Uzbek</b> <b>nationality</b> without any carbohydrate metabolism disorders and with normal BMI. WC equal to 76 cm corresponds to the 50 th percentile. Thus, the cut-off of WC for Uzbek women is 90. 0 cm, which is a mismatch to the European criteria. Average value of WHR was 0. 80 ± 0. 07. Reference values of WHR vary of 0. 69 to 0. 93. WHR 0. 8 corresponds to the 80 th percentile. The obtained reference ranges are recommended to reveal the prevalence of MS and its components at the stage of revealing of risk groups in Uzbek women...|$|R

The TFR for Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, and Koreans in Kyrgyzstan are considerably higher than in their home countries, possibly due to the much lower cost of living.|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{bases of}} predictive medicine are being actively developed at present. Conceptual basis for predictive medicine is presented by notion of genetic polymorphism. Among {{the set of}} candidate genes, the FcεRIβ gene being {{an important component of}} the hereditary component of susceptibility to asthma and atopyoccupies big interest. We studied the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of polymorphic gene variant of high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRIβ) in patients in with different phenotypic variants of bronchial asthma and healthy individuals of <b>Uzbek</b> <b>nationality.</b> Material for the study included DNA samples from patients with asthma and healthy adolescents of <b>Uzbek</b> <b>nationality.</b> Amplification of loci was performed by PCR, genotyping was performed by polymorphism of length of restrictive fragments. The results of investigations of the polymorphic gene variant of high affinity IgE receptor have shown that markers of increased risk of allergic form of bronchial asthma in adolescents of Uzbek ethnicity are genotype FcεRIβ- 109 T/T and allele FcεRIβ- 109 T, markers of low-risk are FcεRIβ- 109 C/C and allele FcεRIβ- 109 C...|$|R

It {{is located}} on the road and railway between Bukhara and Samarkand. The name is Turkic and means [...] "large town or kurgan". The town {{does not appear to be}} of any great antiquity, {{although}} after Alexander the Great's sack of Marakanda (Samarkand) the centre of cultural life in that part of the Zeravshan valley may briefly have shifted west to the region around Katta-Kurgan. According to F.F. Pospelov a fortress was built on the current site by the local saint Sufi Allahyar and his two brothers, Farhat-Atalyk and Allah-Nazar-bii, in 1095 AH/1684 AD, and the town subsequently grew up around it. It was the seat of a Bek (local Governor) under the rule of the Bukharan Manghit dynasty. In 1868, following the fall of Samarkand to the Russians and the annexation of the Upper Zeravshan Valley from Bukhara, it became the border town between Russian Turkestan and the Bukharan Emirate, and the centre of a district. In 1924 both entities were dissolved by the Soviet regime, and Katta-Kurgan was incorporated in the new Uzbek SSR.It is currently the second largest city in Samarkand Region. Population of Kattakurgan is of <b>Uzbek</b> <b>nationality,</b> there used to be quite a big Russian minority, which is not the case anymore.|$|R
