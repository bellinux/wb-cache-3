5|$|Oobi is an American children's {{television}} series created by Josh Selig of Little Airplane Productions. It {{began as a}} series of shorts commissioned by the <b>Noggin</b> network during a three-year period in which all of the channel's programming was co-produced by Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop. Full-length episodes of the show began airing on April 7, 2003, and the series ended its run on February 11, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Selig {{created the}} series shortly after leaving Sesame Street, {{which he had}} worked on since it began {{production}} in the late 1960s. He developed the idea for Oobi while watching bare-handed puppeteers audition for Ulica Sezamkowa, the Polish adaptation of Sesame Street. Roles on Oobi were offered to veteran puppeteers from related Sesame Workshop shows. The Jim Henson Company, which designed and built the puppets on Sesame Street, held a stake in <b>Noggin</b> {{at the time of}} Oobis inception. Principal photography took place at Kaufman Astoria Studios, where Sesame Street is also taped.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. It {{was the first}} {{televised}} production from Selig's Little Airplane studio, and the company's first years in business were spent creating Oobi shorts with Muppet performers. After the original interstitials aired, <b>Noggin</b> ordered thirteen half-hour episodes of Oobi. These finished production in February 2003 and were first announced by the network in March of the same year. Nickelodeon ordered {{a second set of}} half-hour episodes shortly after the first; these were filmed from January to February 2004.|$|E
50|$|Two long-standing public houses {{survive in}} this locality: The Falconers Arms and the King George. The King George {{was built in}} 1911 but can trace its roots to an earlier inn on the same site, The <b>Noggins,</b> which dates from the early 1700s.|$|R
5000|$|Fields recounted a {{difficult}} shooting day during Tillie and Gus where a short scene was repeatedly ruined by Baby LeRoy's crying until he surreptitiously devised a solution: [...] "I quietly removed the nipple from Baby LeRoy's bottle, dropped {{in a couple}} of <b>noggins</b> of gin, and returned it to Baby LeRoy. After sucking on the pacifier for a few minutes, he staggered through the scene like a Barrymore." ...|$|R
5000|$|Luke Buckmaster of Crikey.com gave a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "Director Simon Wincer {{was not the}} right person to avoid certain temptations, like dunking the audience's <b>noggins</b> into a honey pot of clichés." [...] Mike McGranaghan of Aisle Seat thought the film was a [...] "pleasant-enough viewing experience. At the same time, I was never as riveted as I have been by other, similarly-themed films. It makes you feel good without ever truly stirring the soul." ...|$|R
5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of <b>Noggin.</b> Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E

25|$|Both chordin and <b>noggin</b> are antagonists of BMPs. They bind BMPs {{preventing}} the binding of the ligand to the receptor. It {{has been demonstrated}} that Chordin and <b>Noggin</b> dorsalize mesoderm. They are both found in the dorsal lip of Xenopus and convert otherwise epidermis specified tissue into neural tissue (see neurulation). <b>Noggin</b> {{plays a key role}} in cartilage and bone patterning. Mice Noggin-/- have excess cartilage and lacked joint formation.|$|E

25|$|TV Land also {{included}} a temporary block of <b>Noggin</b> programming in 1999. Spanning two hours, it primarily showcased The Electric Company, along with commercials for <b>Noggin.</b> On-air continuity during the block included guest appearances by Mel Brooks, Bill Cosby, Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno, and Joan Rivers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Noggin</b> {{consistently}} received {{substantially higher}} ratings than Nickelodeon's other sister channels. It was viewed {{by an average}} of 529,000 households daily in early 2009, while The N was viewed by about 210,000 each day. At the time of its closure, <b>Noggin</b> reached over 64 million households in the United States (as opposed to the 1.5 million subscribers it reached upon being launched).|$|E
25|$|A {{streaming}} service featuring {{episodes of}} <b>Noggin</b> shows {{was announced in}} January 2015. Most programs on the app were cancelled prior to its development. The application was unveiled in February 2015 and released on March 5 for iOS systems. It is updated monthly and includes full seasons of productions from Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop and Nelvana. In May 2015, many shows {{that had previously been}} available on Amazon Instant Video were moved to the <b>Noggin</b> app as a result of low sales. On November 18, 2015, it was made available for Android, Apple TV and Kindle. On April 8, 2016, Alcatel Mobile announced that the <b>Noggin</b> app would come pre-loaded on its Alcatel Xess tablet.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, {{the group}} added bassist Michael Kane to their line-up {{and put out}} two more albums Good & Dusty (1971), which {{featured}} an answer to Merle Haggard's Okie from Muskogee, [...] "Hippie from Olema", and High on a Ridgetop (1972) before disbanding. Young, Levinger and Bauer all went on to solo careers, of which only Young had any notable success. Levinger, Bauer and Kane were part of another group, <b>Noggins,</b> in 1972 that only lasted for one album, Crab Tunes. Bauer died of a brain tumor in September 1982, {{at the age of}} 40.|$|R
60|$|They tied {{their horses}} to bushes, {{for the number}} so tied already showed that the stables were full, and shoved {{their way through a}} crowd of peasants who stood about the door, and went into the great hall where the dance was. The labourer, the half-witted fellow, the farmer and the two lads mixed with a group of {{servants}} who were looking on from an alcove, and Duallach sat with the pipers on their bench, but Costello made his way through the dancers to where Dermott of the Sheep stood with Namara of the Lake pouring Poteen out of a porcelain jug into horn <b>noggins</b> with silver rims.|$|R
50|$|Greenwich {{has been}} {{primarily}} agricultural in nature since being first settled by families including the Bishop and Forsyth families, who settled here in 1760 as New England Planters; {{both of these}} families still farm in Greenwich today. Five farm markets in this small community make it the destination of choice for in-season produce in Kings County. Hennigar's, {{one of the oldest}} farm markets in the province, opened in 1921. Elderkin's Farm Market, located on Broadview Farms - one of the first farms created when Greenwich was settled - has been family owned and operated since 1760. <b>Noggins</b> Corner Farm Market is on the site of Timothy and William Bishop's farm and is run by members of the Bishop family.|$|R
25|$|<b>Noggin</b> {{commissioned}} {{its first}} half-hour original series for teenagers in April 2000, titling it A Walk In Your Shoes. A live game show aimed at pre-teens, Sponk!, premiered a year afterwards. This {{was one of}} many <b>Noggin</b> series that focused primarily on viewer-submitted content, along with the animated Phred on Your Head Show and its spin-off The URL with Phred Show. A block of preschool-oriented series had become a staple of the network by 2002.|$|E
25|$|The series debuted on September 18, 2006 on the Nick Jr. block. It debuted on <b>Noggin</b> on December 27, 2006, {{and ended}} on July 20, 2013.|$|E
25|$|<b>Noggin</b> is an {{entertainment}} brand, launched on February 2, 1999 as {{a joint venture}} between Viacom and Sesame Workshop. The Jim Henson Company also held a stake in the company when it was founded. <b>Noggin</b> was initially advertised as both a linear television network and a website. The brand has since expanded to include three mobile subscription services, a second website, and four defunct programming blocks worldwide. It was initially aimed at a pre-teen audience and shifted its target demographic to preschool-aged children in April 2002.|$|E
50|$|While in flight, the two mice {{fall from}} the sleigh into the labs, unintentionally {{damaging}} Brain's hypnotic control equipment. As they rush to repair it, Pinky discovers his list was never delivered and breaks down into tears. As Pinky sobs uncontrollably, Brain angrily reads the letter and is surprised to see Pinky asked for nothing for himself, requesting all of his gifts be delivered to the Brain instead. Brain is deeply moved, and when Pinky informs him the Noodle <b>Noggins</b> are working, Brain is too emotional to demand world domination. He orders everyone to have a Merry Christmas instead, and smashes the equipment. On Christmas Day, Pinky and the Brain exchange gifts, an Earth-shaped keychain for the Brain and a spell checker for Pinky.|$|R
6000|$|At last he {{saw that}} the moment to end had come, and, in a pause after a dance, cried out from where the horn <b>noggins</b> stood that his {{daughter}} would now drink the cup of betrothal; then Oona came over to where he was, and the guests stood round in a half-circle, Costello close to the wall to the right, and the piper, the labourer, the farmer, the half-witted man and the two farm lads close behind him. The old man took out of a niche in the wall the silver cup from which her mother and her mother's mother had drunk the toasts of their betrothals, and poured Poteen out of a porcelain jug and handed the cup to his daughter with the customary words, 'Drink to him whom you love the best.' ...|$|R
500|$|The {{comments}} of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or {{cited in the}} writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other show runners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, [...] "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic <b>noggins</b> together". In another case, writer Ian Maxtone-Graham made comments about the fans on the Internet in an interview with The Independent, calling them [...] "beetle-browed" [...] and saying, [...] "That's why they're on the Internet and we're writing the show." [...] Writer Bill Oakley used to respond to select Simpsons fans through e-mail in a friendly manner, but by 1996 claimed [...] "here are people who take it seriously to the point of absurdity".

25|$|Two {{international}} applications {{based on}} <b>Noggin</b> have been launched. In November 2015, a Spanish streaming app was released under the <b>Noggin</b> title in Latin America. It includes games based on Nick Jr. programs and full episodes of shows unavailable on the English app (such as the Spanish dubs of Roary the Racing Car and Rugrats and current Nick Jr. shows like PAW Patrol, Shimmer & Shine and Rusty Rivets). The app currently has a Facebook page and {{a section on}} the MundoNick website. A Portuguese version was released to Google Play and the Brazilian App Store on November 21, 2015.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 2017, {{the first}} season (20 episodes) of the show were made {{available}} for streaming on the <b>Noggin</b> video subscription service. The remaining three seasons (46 episodes) will be launched soon.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{months after}} the airing of a first episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", the {{newsgroup}} alt.tv.simpsons was created by Gary D. Duzan during {{the third week of}} March 1990. It was created before there was a world wide web, which emerged in 1993, so those earliest discussions were held on text-only platforms. According to Turner, the newsgroup was among the most trafficked newsgroups of the early 1990s. The comments of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or cited in the writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other showrunners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, [...] "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic <b>noggins</b> together".

60|$|The Eden {{of one man}} may be the Inferno of his neighbor, and now I am {{to throw}} to the winds, like leaves of a {{worthless}} manuscript, some years of time, and introduce you to a new Kentucky,--a Kentucky that was not for the pioneer. One page of this manuscript might have told of a fearful winter, when the snow lay in great drifts in the bare woods, when Tom and I fashioned canoes or <b>noggins</b> out of the great roots, when a new and feminine bit of humanity cried in the bark cradle, and Polly Ann sewed deer leather. Another page--nay, a dozen--could be filled with Indian horrors, ambuscades and massacres. And also I might have told how there drifted into this land, hitherto unsoiled, the refuse cast off by the older colonies. I must add quickly that we got more than our share of their best stock along with this.|$|R
60|$|Mr Armstrong {{descended to}} the drawing-room, before dinner, looking most respectable, {{with a stiff}} white tie and the new suit {{expressly}} prepared for the occasion. He was introduced to Lady Cashel and Lady Selina as a valued friend of Lord Ballindine, and was received, by the former at least, in a most flattering manner. Lady Selina had hardly reconciled herself to the return of Lord Ballindine. It was from no envy at her cousin's happiness; she was really too high-minded, and too falsely proud, also, to envy anyone. But it was the harsh conviction of her mind, that no duties should be disregarded, and that all duties were disagreeable: she was always opposed to the doing of anything which {{appeared to be the}} especial wish of the person consulting her; because it would be agreeable, she judged that it would be wrong. She was most sincerely anxious for her poor dependents, but she tormented them most cruelly. When Biddy Finn wished to marry, Lady Selina told her it was her duty to put a restraint on her inclinations; and ultimately prevented her, though there was no objection on earth to Tony Mara; and when the widow Cullen wanted to open a little shop for soap and candles, having eight pounds ten shillings left to stock it, after the wake and funeral were over, Lady Selina told the widow it was her duty to restrain her inclination, and she did so; and the eight pounds ten shillings drifted away in quarters of tea, and most probably, half <b>noggins</b> of whiskey.|$|R
25|$|The first service {{released}} {{under the}} <b>Noggin</b> brand name was a satellite television network, which operated from February 2, 1999 until September 28, 2009. Noggin's lineup {{during its first}} years consisted almost entirely of titles from Sesame Workshop's library, with occasional reruns of Nickelodeon and Jim Henson series. Most of the content was aimed at teenagers and Generation Xers. The two providers had over 5,000 hours of library material to broadcast and did not produce original programming until a full year on the air had passed. The network shared its channel space with The N from 2002 until 2007, when <b>Noggin</b> became a 24-hour network.|$|E
25|$|<b>Noggin</b> was {{featured}} as a programming block on Nick Jr. UK from May 2004 until August 2005. It ran {{for two hours}} every night and included reruns of syndicated British television series for children. The timeslot was renamed Nick Jr. Classics on September 1, 2005.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 2016, {{the first}} 20 episodes were made {{available}} for streaming on the <b>Noggin</b> video service. The remaining episodes {{will most likely be}} added to the app in the future. The first three seasons of the series are available to buy on Amazon Video.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{lifted her}} eyes and gazed at Costello, and in her gaze was that trust of the humble in the proud, the gentle in the violent, {{which has been the}} tragedy of woman from the beginning. Costello led her among the dancers, and they were soon drawn into the rhythm of the Pavane, that stately dance which, with the Saraband, the Gallead, and the Morrice dances, had driven out, among all but the most Irish of the gentry, the quicker rhythms of the verse-interwoven, pantomimic dances of earlier days; and while they danced there came over them the unutterable melancholy, the weariness with the world, the poignant and bitter pity for one another, the vague anger against common hopes and fears, which is the exultation of love. And when a dance ended and the pipers laid down their pipes and lifted their horn <b>noggins,</b> they stood a little from the others waiting pensively and silently for the dance to begin again and the fire in their hearts to leap up and to wrap them anew; and so they danced and danced Pavane and Saraband and Gallead and Morrice through the night long, and many stood still to watch them, and the peasants came about the door and peered in, as though they {{understood}} that they would gather their children's children about them long hence, and tell how they had seen Costello dance with Dermott's daughter Oona, and become by the telling themselves a portion of ancient romance; but through all the dancing and piping Namara of the Lake went hither and thither talking loudly and making foolish jokes that all might seem well with him, and old Dermott of the Sheep grew redder and redder, and looked oftener and oftener at the doorway to see if the candles there grew yellow in the dawn.|$|R
5000|$|Alonso Duralde of The Wrap {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "This is Rodriguez's second sequel {{in a row}} in which he turns sex, violence and exploitation into an occasion for dullness. For a film loaded with decapitations and gun-toting ladies in bondage gear, Sin City gets really tedious really quickly." [...] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Rare indeed is the movie that features this many bared breasts, pummeled crotches and severed <b>noggins</b> and still leaves you checking your watch every 10 minutes." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As an exercise in style, it's diverting enough, but these mean streets are so well traveled that it takes someone like Eva Green to make the detour through them worth the trip." [...] Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "This new Sin City features the signature characteristics and many of the original's characters but seems less adventurous. It feels a little flabby and self-satisfied. The element of surprise is gone." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "It's 100 solid minutes of wearying pastiche, and I found myself checking my watch a lot." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "Sin City: A Dame To Kill For doesn't explode onscreen the way the first one did. Miller's monochrome palette, splashed with color that shines like a whore's lip gloss, doesn't startle as it once did." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of five stars, saying [...] "It is, in almost every way, inferior to its predecessor. It's poorly paced and repetitive." ...|$|R
40|$|Now I {{know how}} the Munchkins felt. Here I have been, toiling {{in the fields of}} Evidenceland for some years, laboring along with others to show how use of Bayesian {{probability}} theory can assist in the analysis and understanding of evidentiary problems. 2 ̆ 7 In doing so, we have had to wage continuous battle against the Bayesioskeptics-the wicked witches who deny much value, even heuristic value, for probability theory in evidentiary analysis. 2 Occasionally, I have longed for law-and-economics scholars to help work this field, which should be fertile ground for them. 3 So imagine my delight when the virtual personification of law and economics himself, Judge Richard Posner, came down from a star to help till the evidentiary soil with his powerful economic tools. 4 And imagine my further delight when his house landed square on the <b>noggins</b> of the Bayesioskeptics. I do not suppose this will be a fatal blow. Like Napoleon 2 ̆ 7 s Old Guard, they refuse to surrender-but neither will they die. Still, I appreciate having such an ally. It may seem that I should be very gracious and roll out the welcome carpet to Evidenceland for Judge Posner. But I confess that my graciousness is tempered by the fact that Judge Posner commits a serious error in the use of Bayesian analysis. He asserts that an unbiased fact-finder should begin consideration of a disputed case with 2 ̆ 2 prior odds of 1 to 1 that the plaintiff or prosecutor has a meritorious case. 2 ̆ 25 Indeed, Judge Posner considers this starting point the essence of the definition of an unbiased fact-finder. I believe that this view is wrong in principle as a matter of probability theory. It is indeterminate and also fundamentally at odds with the presumption of innocence. Finally, it leads to bizarre results that expose Bayesian analysis to gratuitous ridicule from the wicked Bayesioskeptics...|$|R
