5|$|In {{the first}} match, Cesaro {{defeated}} Sami Zayn. In {{the first half}} of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept getting up to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature <b>Neutralizer,</b> but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the <b>Neutralizer</b> on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E
5|$|The pre-show {{match was}} a fatal-four-way {{elimination}} tag team {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship between defending champions The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso), RybAxel (Ryback and Curtis Axel), Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando), accompanied by El Torito, and The Real Americans (Jack Swagger and Cesaro), accompanied by Zeb Colter. The match was changed to an elimination style match shortly before it got underway. Five minutes into the match, Swagger forced Fernando to submit to his signature Patriot Lock to eliminate Los Matadores, followed by Cesaro hitting a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air then delivering his signature <b>Neutralizer</b> to pin Ryback and eliminate RybAxel at the eleven-minute mark. Later, after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger, Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos landed a double superkick and then a double top rope diving splash on Cesaro to win the match and retain the titles. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock. Colter demanded that they put their differences aside, but Cesaro put Swagger in the giant swing and then walked off.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} works {{investigated the}} application of adaptive vibration absorbers (<b>neutralizers)</b> to an airconditioning unit to reduce the vibration due to the disturbance force of rotational systems with fixed excitation frequency. The work {{presented in this paper}} now takes the next step by applying the adaptive vibration <b>neutralizers</b> to a compressor with variable rotational speed driven by a frequency converter. In order {{to have the ability to}} cover a broad scope of application, the vibration <b>neutralizers</b> are developed from modular components to ensure scaling possibility. The vibration <b>neutralizers</b> are built from masses attached to the ends of two cantilever beams, acting as springs, with attached piezoelectric patch transducers. Corresponding to the rotational speed of the air conditioning compressor, three vibration <b>neutralizers</b> with resonance frequency of 24. 2 Hz are manufactured. The resonance frequency can be tuned dynamically by emulate either "virtual" dynam ic mass or "virtual" dynamic stiffness respectively. The "virtual" dynamic stiffness will be implemented in this paper by feeding back the strain of the beam with corresponding gain factor to achieve the needed resonance frequency. The control method is implemented separately in each mounting point of the adaptive vibration <b>neutralizers</b> at the compressor. The gain for tuning the virtual mass is adapted in real-time due to the difference in phase between the acceleration of the masses and the mounting. The effects of the adaptation of the vibration <b>neutralizers</b> compared to the passive vibration <b>neutralizers</b> are shown by the reduction of the acceleration of the compressor mounting plate at the disturbance frequency...|$|R

In practical situations however, a number of devices might {{be considered to be}} distributed over an elastic host structure. Then numerical optimization methods have to be applied to the problem instead of using the well-known design rules which were originally developed for single-degree-of-freedom systems. Furthermore, adaptation of the tuning frequency of the <b>neutralizers</b> might be considered in order to suppress vibration over a wider bandwidth. In this paper, we will report on the results obtained in the framework of the LOEWE center AdRIA regarding those practical issues in the design and implementation of vibration <b>neutralizers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} sound {{transmission}} through partitions {{are well known}} as far as homogeneous materials are concerned. However, in reality {{only a small fraction}} of materials are literally homogenous. In recent years, considerable interest has been taken in theoretical models of inhomogeneous structurcs. First results have revealed the opportunity to modify the sound transmission loss at selected frequencies due to inhomogeneous material properties. Using the concepts of forced inhomogencities, increasing efforts have been made into the development of new materials or structures with higher sound transmission loss at certain frequencies. This paper presents the implementation of local resonance systems into lightweight partitions in order to improve the sound insulation of lightweight structures at lower frequencies. The benefits of double-panel partitions are combined with the frequency dependent effect of distributed vibration <b>neutralizers.</b> The main focus is placed on the location and number of vibration <b>neutralizers.</b> Based on the modal expansion method a beam model has been derived taking the modal behaviour of both panels into account. The radiated power has been calculated using modal radiation efficiencies. The effects of the vibration <b>neutralizers</b> have been quantified in terms of the resulting sound transmission loss. Results are presented of parameter studies that demonstrate the behaviour of lightweight structures dependent on the properties, the distribution and number of the internal vibration <b>neutralizers...</b>|$|R

Understanding the likelihood of bacterial survival in eye creams begins with sensitive and accurate methods {{for the detection of}} bacterial contamination; therefore, we investigated optimal culture conditions, including <b>neutralizers,</b> dilution broths, and selective media for the detection of Bacillus in eye cream. Samples of three different brands of eye creams were first mixed with Tween 80, Tween 20, or a blend of Tween 60 and Span 80, then neutralized and non-neutralized samples were individually inoculated with B. cereus strains, B. mycoides, a mislabeled B. megaterium, B. subtilis or B. thuringiensis at a final concentration of 5 log CFU/g. The inoculated samples, with and without <b>neutralizers,</b> were spiral-plated and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h to 48 h. Presumptive colonies of Bacillus were enumerated on U. S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA-BAM) referenced agars Bacillus cereus rapid agar (BACARA) and mannitol-egg yolk-polymixin agar (MYP). Our results show significant differences among the <b>neutralizers,</b> plates, and products. The combination of Tryptone- Azolectin-Tween and Tween 80 (TAT and T 80) produced higher levels of Bacillus, estimated at 4. 18 log CFU/g compared to growth on Modified letheen broth and Tween 80, which produced 3. 97 log CFU/g (P < 0. 05). Colony counts of B. cereus cells on MYP agar were significantly higher, than those on BACARA agar, showing an average of 4. 25 log CFU/g versus 3. 84 log CFU/g, respectively (P < 0. 05).
