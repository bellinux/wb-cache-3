500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> is the person <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> ... When you get into trust, that’s when things get emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E

It was agreed that Reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates, plus compensation for the layover time.

500|$|Form and Fuller {{recognized}} the iconic {{status of the}} music used {{in the first four}} Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't believe that, when you watch a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with the London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Since the {{previous}} episode [...] "Occupation" [...] {{focused on the}} resistance, writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they are way down, baby, in this situation, when you are in a foxhole, who do you want <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> You want Colonel Tigh 'cause he is gonna get your ass out of there." [...] The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore's favourite scenes, as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to [...] "root for," [...] since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans, but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings.|$|E

[...] In a {{different}} perspective, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly considered these couplets from the song, ("I used to know my place was the spot <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> / Now I’m searching the room for an empty seat / ‘Cause lately I don’t even know what page you’re on"), {{as one of the}} best couplets from Speak Now sheet.
