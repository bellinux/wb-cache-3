40|$|The {{inverted}} {{growth of}} III-V solar cells presents some specific challenges {{that are not}} present in regular, <b>non-inverted</b> growths. Because the highly doped top contact layer is grown first, followed by the lengthy high-temperature growth of {{the remainder of the}} structure, there is ample time for the dopants in the contact layer to diffuse away. This leads to an increase in the contact resistance to the top layer, and a corresponding drop in voltage. The diffusion of dopants in other layers is similarly altered with respect to the <b>non-inverted</b> configuration because of the change in growth sequence. We compare the dopant profiles of inverted and <b>non-inverted</b> structures by using secondary ion mass spectroscopy and correlate the results with the observed performance of the devices. We also describe a technique for growing a GaInAsN contact layer in the inverted configuration and show that it achieves a specific contact resistance comparable to what is normally observed in <b>non-inverted</b> cells...|$|R

40|$|Languages {{differ in}} how they {{represent}} numerical information, and specifically whether the verbal notation of numbers follows the same order as the symbolic notation (in <b>non-inverted</b> languages, e. g. Hebrew, 25, twenty-five) or whether the two notations diverge (in inverted languages, e. g. Arabic, 25, five-and-twenty). We examined how the structure of number-words affects how arithmetic operations are processed by bilingual speakers of an inverted and a <b>non-inverted</b> language. We examined Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals' performance in the first language, L 1 (inverted) {{and in the second}} language, L 2 (<b>non-inverted).</b> Their performance was compared to that of Hebrew L 1 speakers, who do not speak an inverted language. Participants judged the accuracy of addition problems presented aurally in L 1, aurally in L 2 or in visual symbolic notation. Problems were presented such that they matched or did not match the structure of number words in the language. Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals demonstrated both flexibility in processing and adaptation to the language of aural-verbal presentation – they were more accurate for the inverted order of presentation in Arabic, but more accurate for <b>non-inverted</b> order of presentation in Hebrew, thus exhibiting the same pattern found for native Hebrew speakers. In addition, whereas native Hebrew speakers preferred the <b>non-inverted</b> order in visual symbolic presentation as well, the Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals showed enhanced flexibility, without a significant preference for one order over the other, in either speed or accuracy. These findings suggest that arithmetic processing is sensitive to the linguistic representations of number words. Moreover, bilinguals exposed to inverted and <b>non-inverted</b> languages showed influence of both systems, and enhanced flexibility in processing. Thus, the L 1 {{does not seem to have}} exclusive power in shaping numerical mental representations, but rather the system remains open to influences from a later learned L 2...|$|R

40|$|Periodic domain {{inversion}} in a {{ferroelectric material}} (lithium niobate) {{has been studied}} using high-resolution x-ray diffraction topography. A domain-inverted structure of period 30 mu m was fabricated in a LiNbO 3 crystal with a thickness of 300 mu m via electric-field poling. The synchrotron-radiation x-ray experiments were carried out at the ESRF micro-fluorescence, imaging and diffraction beamline (ID 22). The experimental topograms and numerical simulations show that the image contrast can be {{explained in terms of}} a phase shift of the polarizability coefficient, chi(h), in the domain-inverted region relative to the <b>non-inverted</b> part. This phase shift, 1. 72 pi, was found to be equivalent to the reflection, 00 (6) over bar, from the domain-inverted part of the structure rather than to the reflection, 006, from the <b>non-inverted</b> part. The numerical simulation shows that the width of the transition region between inverted and <b>non-inverted</b> domains (domain walls) is 0. 3 mu m...|$|R

25|$|In the Soviet Union, ROs {{were used}} for signal {{compression}} in long-distance telephony.

We visually inspected attenuation maps of 283 brain or head/neck (H/N) patients, classified them as <b>non-inverted</b> or inverted, and calculated the fat/water tissue fraction. We selected ten FDG-PET brain patients with <b>non-inverted</b> attenuation maps for further analysis. Tissue inversion was simulated, and PET images were reconstructed using both original and inverted attenuation maps.

25|$|Without {{negative}} feedback, {{and perhaps}} with positive feedback for regeneration, an op-amp {{acts as a}} comparator. If the inverting input is held at ground (0V) directly or by a resistor Rg, and the input voltage Vin applied to the <b>non-inverting</b> input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if Vin is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an open-loop circuit acting as a comparator.|$|E
25|$|Common-mode gain: A perfect {{operational}} amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages {{that are common}} to both. However, the differential input stage of an {{operational amplifier}} is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the common-mode rejection ratio (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in <b>non-inverting</b> amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.|$|E
25|$|The input {{impedance}} of the simplified <b>non-inverting</b> amplifier is high, of order Rdif × AOL times the closed-loop gain, where Rdif is the op amp's {{input impedance}} to differential signals, and AOL is the open-loop voltage gain of the op amp; {{in the case}} of the ideal op amp, with AOL infinite and Rdif infinite, the input impedance is infinite. In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the mismatch between the impedances driving the V+ and V− op amp inputs.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{an image}} tube was first {{proposed}} by G. Holst and H. De Boer (Netherlands) in 1928 , but early attempts to create one were not successful. It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared converter tube. This tube consisted of a photocathode in proximity to a fluorescent screen. Using a simple lens, an image {{was focused on the}} photocathode and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the photocathode by photons to strike the fluorescent screen. This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was <b>non-inverting.</b> With this image converter type tube, it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.|$|E
500|$|The {{station for}} {{the roller coaster}} is quite {{different}} than traditional stations. As the train enters, it slows down but does not stop. There is a moving sidewalk {{on both sides of}} the station moving at the same speed as the train so riders can load and unload. Riders have about 45 seconds to take their seat, lower the lap-bar and make their song choice. After the restraints are checked, the train immediately begins to climb the [...] vertical chain lift and the song that the rider picked begins to play while the on-ride video recorder begins recording. When the train reaches the top of the lift, it drops back to the ground reaching a maximum speed of [...] Following the drop, the train goes through a <b>non-inverting</b> loop (meaning that the train doesn't go through an inversion), which is nicknamed [...] "The Double Take". Then the train makes an upward right turn into one of the several mid-course brakes. It then drops back down going through a hole in a wall before entering a left upward helix. This section of the coaster is nicknamed [...] "The Treble Clef". Next the train enters a quick element nicknamed, [...] "The Jump Cut" [...] which is similar to a <b>non-inverting</b> corkscrew. The train then drops back down before climbing back up into the second mid-course brakes. Following a small drop to the left, it travels straight before making a right turn, followed by a left, and then another right leading into the third set of mid-course brakes. Another drop is followed by the brakes leading into an s-bend/turn. The train then travels into an inclined loop, then the train enters the fourth set of brakes after going back up. Finally, the train drops back down, and goes over a small hill before entering the final brake run where the train enters the station and the riders song ends.|$|E

[...] Next, the train rises into a [...] dive loop. Following this, the train enters a <b>non-inverting,</b> highly banked 360 degree turn that is located over the station. Following the 360 degree turn, riders enter a [...] inclined loop - a standard loop tilted at a 45 degree angle. From here, the ride makes an up-hand right turn into the mid-course brake run. At this point, the track drops into a Corkscrew, and finish off with a figure-eight turn. The train then enters the final brake run, and heads back into the station.|$|E
