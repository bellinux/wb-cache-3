40|$|Background: Workers are {{vulnerable}} to heat stress when they perform tasks in hot environments. Personal cooling systems (PCSs) are designed to reduce heat strain. A cooling vest with ventilation fans {{is a type of}} PCS that can blow air around the body to facilitate convective and evaporative cooling. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the performance of a <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> for a tailor-made cooling vest designed to protect construction workers from heat stress. The performance of this newly designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> (Unit B) was compared with that of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> used in a commercially available cooling vest (Unit A). Method: The designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> consists of a pair of ventilation fans and a portable battery pack. A hot wire anemometer was used to measure the air flow rate of the fan. The air flow rate and work duration of different <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were compared. The sweating manikin test was conducted to further compare the cooling powers of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Result: Compared with Unit A powered by the alkaline AA battery (6 V, 2122 mAh), Unit B powered by the rechargeable lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery (7. 4 V, 4400 mAh) achieved a higher air flow rate (8 22 L/s vs. 0 - 13 L/s) and longer work duration (7. 05 h vs. 6. 22 h). The average cooling power of Unit B on the sweating manikin was 68 W, which was higher than that of Unit A (51 W). Practical applications: Results showed that the newly designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited higher air flow rate and cooling power. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> designed in this study will be incorporated into a tailor-made PCS for protecting workers in the heat. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|Small central <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> for {{apartments and}} single family houses have {{in most cases}} the {{disadvantage}} of not being equipped with a cooling function. For summer operation at high ambient temperatures a bypass is generally used or the devices are switched off. In winter operation state-of-the-art <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> work with high efficient heat recovery. To enable summer operation of these <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> an extension of functionality by implementing indirect evaporative cooling is under development. Although indirect evaporative cooling is a well-known physical concept, the challenges for its implementation in common heat recovery <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are many-sided, especially when aiming at small size <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> The main focus of the development is {{to make use of the}} energy-efficient evaporative cooling effect and provide additional comfort to users of heat recovery <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Work on novel compact and easy-to-clean wetting structures is presented. This includes the presentation of newly designed evaporation structures, their surface characteristics and their wetting and water holding capacity. Working with low pressure nozzles is aimed at in order to reduce the energy consumption of the water spray system. In the presentation an overview is given on the approach and on first experimental results with special focus on the parameters influencing the energy efficiency of the ventilation device.

40|$|This study reports {{ventilation}} {{measurement and}} occupant questionnaire results from newly built 102 Finnish detached houses. The {{results show that}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were used constantly and the fan speed setting was changed very seldom. There was a slight tendency to use higher speed in the summer than in winter. <b>Ventilation</b> <b>units</b> provide an average actual air change rate of about 0. 4 ach (13 L/s,pers) both in winter and summer which {{is less than the}} code value of 0. 5 ach. Airflow measurements at design fan speed show that only 57 % of houses comply with regulations. Low actual air change rates were caused by low fan speeds used by occupants as 52 % of houses in the winter and 47 % in the summer used the lowest possible fan speed. Correspondingly, actual supply airflow rates in bedrooms were low, in average 4 L/s. Occupant complaints about ventilation noise correlated with noise level in bedrooms. It is concluded that ventilation noise is an important factor affecting the use of <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Inspection of drawings and ventilation systems showed that in houses not complying with ventilation regulations either <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were undersized or sound attenuation was poor...|$|R

The main objective of the system was implemented to provide air balance and temperature necessary conditions and to control airflow system for <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> in operating room. The operation room can be controlled with fuzzy expert system and describes the desired outputs. Input parameters such as temperature, humidity, oxygen and particle are used and output parameters are chosen as air conditioning motor speed and exhaust motor speed.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the various design {{features}} of ventilated garments on cooling performance. Five jackets with small <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and closable openings were designed. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> with a flow rate of 12 l/s were placed at five different torso sites. They were examined on a sweating thermal manikin in four clothing opening conditions in a warm environment (Ta=Tmanikin= 34 °C, RH= 60 %, Va= 0. 4 m/s). Total torso cooling was increased by 137 to 251 %, and clothing total dynamic evaporative resistance was decreased by 43 to 69 %. Neither the ventilation location nor the opening design had a significant difference on total torso cooling. The ventilation location had a significant difference on localized intra-torso cooling, but not the opening design. When the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were placed at the local zone where it was ventilated, that zone underwent the highest cooling than other local zones. The study indicated that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> should be placed at the region where it required the most evaporative cooling, e. g. along the spine area and the lower back. The openings could be adjusted (closed or opened) to make comfortable air pressure for the wearers but without making significant difference on the whole torso cooling under this flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures have}} been analysed for a building of around 24000 m 2 from 1978. The property is used by different businesses. The specific energy use for this property is 75 kwh/m 2  for electricity and 114  kwh/m 2  for district heating. This projects ambition is to go lower than the Norrbotten county councils specific energy objective for their real estate facilities. The specific energy objective for year 2020 is {{that the use of}} electricity should be maximum 68  kwh/m 2  and 102  kwh/m 2  for district heating.   The result of the energy audit for the biggest energy consumption users (ventilation, heat and cooling) for the property is that 56 % of the electric consumption and 15 % of the district heating demand was identified. The 56 % can be divided in different parts: 44 % ventilation, lighting 22 %, climate control equipment 16 %, cooling equipment 10 % and engine warmers 8 %. In this project 14 of 19 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are studied and the reason that all {{are not part of the}} study is lack of information. The proposal for action was determined for 10 of the 14 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> The 4 remaining <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were not possible to analyse partly because of lack of logging of energy consumption where frequency converter were used. One of the omitted units had only a fan for supply air and no heat exchanger.   For each of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> in the group of the 10 selected an analysis was made selecting the most cost effective measures of the alternatives; installing a new <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit,</b> installing a frequency converter or replacing the motor of the unit.   The result of energy audit showed that adding extra insulation to the roof and upgrade of the ventilation system are recommended actions. All recommendations are estimated based on an evaluation of the power consumptions in real use denoted as average power of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b>   Proposal A suggests to install one new <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit,</b> install frequency converters in  5 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and replace motors in 4 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Energy saving of electricity of these actions is 232 MWh and 174 MWh for district heating and the payback time is around 2, 7 years.   Proposal B suggests that 10 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are replaced with new ones. The energy savings of electricity will be 206 MWh and for district heating 237 MWh and the resulting payback time is about 6, 4 years.   Proposal C is adding extra insulation to the roof and this provides a very cost-effective energy saving. If the roof was insulated with 20 cm the energy saving would be about  260 MWh and the payback time would be around 1, 6 years.   If additional insulation of the roof is installed as proposed in combination with upgrade of the ventilation system, the total energy consumption saving of 15 % is achieved from  4427 MWh to about 3761 MWh depending on choice of ventilation upgrade. (Proposal A+C 3761 MWh and proposal B+C 3724 MWh).   The investment cost is around 1, 5 million kr for proposal A+C and the yearly saving is  0, 7 million kr resulting in a payback time of 2, 3 years. The specific electric consumption would be 65, 3  kwh/m 2  and the specific district heat consumption would be 95  kwh/m 2.   The investment cost is around 3, 3 million kr for proposal B+C and the yearly saving is  0, 7 million kr resulting in a payback time of 4, 7 years. The specific electric consumption would be 66  kwh/m 2  and the specific district heat consumption would be 93  kwh/m 2.

40|$|Sound {{emissions}} of <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are mostly {{referred to as}} noise and are subject to a minimization policy. Silencing causes technical effort and sometimes even higher energy consumption. Additionally, this study reveals that silencing may be counterproductive in open-plan offices, since employees may even benefit from higher volume ventilation sound. This positive effect occurs when disturbing background speech is masked by ventilation sound. In this study acoustics of an open-plan office at one receiver positon incorporating background speech were auralized. Then ventilation sounds of two different decentralized <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> at three <b>ventilation</b> rates producing sound emissions in between 25 and 45 dB(A) were added. Participants were exposed to these sound scenarios during a laboratory experiment. Results reveal that participants performed better at a working memory task during presentation {{of one of the}} high volume ventilation sounds and acoustic comfort and privacy were judged to be better as well. However, sound quality of ventilation sounds needs to be investigated and purposefully adapted since different effects were found for the two <b>ventilation</b> <b>units,</b> although the overall A-weighted sound pressure levels were comparable...|$|R
