40|$|The {{synthesis}} of different photo-reactive poly(alkenyl <b>norbornenes)</b> and poly(oxonorbornenes) containing benzophenone (BP) via ring-opening metatheses polymerization (ROMP) is described. These polymers are UV irradiated to form well-defined surface-attached polymer networks and hydrogels. The relative propensity of the polymers to cross-link is evaluated by studying their gel content and its dependency on BP content, irradiation wavelength (254 or 365 nm) and energy dose applied (up to 11 J·cm− 2). Analysis of the UV spectra of the polymer networks {{demonstrates that the}} poly(oxonorbornenes) show the expected BP-induced crosslinking behavior at 365 nm, although high irradiation energy doses and BP content are needed. However, these polymers undergo chain scission at 254 nm. The poly(alkenyl <b>norbornenes),</b> on the other hand, do not cross-link at 365 nm, whereas moderate to good cross-linking is observed at 254 nm. UV spectra demonstrate that the cross-linking at 254 nm is due to BP cross-linking combined with a [2 + 2] cylcoaddition of the alkenyl double bonds. This indicates limitations of benzophenone as a universally applicable cross-linking for polymer networks and hydrogels...|$|R
