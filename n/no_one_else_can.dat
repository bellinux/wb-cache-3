500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{thought it was a}} [...] "confident finale" [...] to the fifth season, which [...] "had seen the series become progressively more surreal and self-aware." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he thought the episode ended the season with a [...] "high note", and that Homer’s insensitive gossiping about his relationship [...] "presents lots of good bits. It completes this excellent year well." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was [...] "This is a place of learning, not a house of hearing about things!", which Homer tells his class after they demand him to reveal more secrets about him and Marge. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A−, and commented that episodes focusing on the relationship between Homer and Marge can [...] "never fail", and there are [...] "numerous opportunities for some classic Homer-isms" [...] in the episode. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. One-time Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] his fifth favorite episode of the show, and commented that Homer's line to Marge, [...] "I know now what I can offer you that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can.</b> Complete and utter dependence," [...] is [...] "so sweet, because he's right!" [...] It was placed at number seven on MSNBCs top ten The Simpsons episodes list. They felt the episode embodied Homer's qualities of being [...] "stupid, good-natured and mildly pathetic, [...] from his conversations with his brain [...] to his final proclamation that the one thing he can give Marge that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> is 'complete and utter dependence'." ...|$|E

500|$|Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra [...] "is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director I had so much trust on her that I felt that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> essay this role as brilliantly as she would do". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance.|$|E

After seeing his idol mobbed to the ground by fans, Grampa becomes aware of his mortality and gives the family their inheritances early. He leaves the family a box of old silver dollars that they decide to spend at the mall right away. At the mall, Lisa sees the new talking Malibu Stacy doll in a toy store. Throughout the trip home, Grampa constantly tells stories and spouts useless advice, making the family shun him. Back home, Lisa is anxious {{to hear what the}} talking Malibu Stacy has to say, but is disappointed with her sexist phrases (such as [...] "Don't ask me, I'm just a girl" [...] and [...] "Thinking too much gives you wrinkles"). Lisa is angry that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> see the ridiculousness of the doll. She and Grampa sit at the kitchen table, bemoaning how they are treated because of their age while both of them decide to change, Grampa to get a job, and Lisa to find Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell.|$|E
500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} video and noted that [...] "the crazy twitchy behavior she exhibited in 'Telephone' returns to much delight, but with a wardrobe that's pure housewife instead of cold-blooded drag-queen murderer." [...] Odell also praised the playsuits in the video, which according to here were [...] "a classier, more mature version of 'tards." [...] In another review, Odell concluded [...] "It {{would be easy to}} credit the look of Beyoncé's new video to Lady Gaga's influence." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video, writing, [...] "The retro-glam outfits, the oversized martini glass, the rolling around on the bed sobbing with eye makeup running down her face... this is our favorite Bey video ever. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> make doing household chores (dusting Grammys!) simultaneously look this good and this sad." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised Knowles' [...] "strong look" [...] completed by lumberjack shirt, bandana and denim hotpants in the video further comparing it with Amy Winehouse's. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine described the video as a [...] "Douglas Sirk film through the eyes of David LaChapelle" [...] and noted that several scenes looked like Knowles was being photographed for Vogue magazine on the set of The Brady Bunch. He concluded that [...] "If Beyoncé was lobbying for a temptress role on Mad Men, 'Why Don't You Love Me,'... would make the perfect audition reel." ...|$|E

2500|$|If all {{the players}} choose to not take the card, then the dealer calls, [...] "Second", which means there is another chance in taking the card.

That is a {{significant}} advantage of buying Sun in the second round over the first; that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> take it from you even if they were of a higher priority. They lose that right by saying no in the second round. But if someone takes it as Hokom, then the Hokom must be something different from the suit of the public card because it is on the second mode. Other players can take the card as Sun. The player that takes it as Hokom, has the option to choose between three suits before lifting up the two cards that the dealer just gave. Or it is Sun if the player lifts up the two cards before naming a suit for Hokom. There is not [...] "Ashkal" [...] in the second round.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} witch in {{the series}} is Granny Weatherwax, who at first glance {{seems to be a}} taciturn, bitter old crone, from the small mountain country of Lancre.

Her closest friend is Nanny Ogg, a jolly, personable witch with the [...] "common touch" [...] who enjoys a smoke and a pint of beer, often leading to her singing bawdy folk songs including the notorious [...] "Hedgehog Song". The two take on apprentice witches, initially Magrat Garlick, then Agnes Nitt, and then Tiffany Aching, who in turn go on to become accomplished witches in their own right, and, in Magrat's case, Queen of Lancre.|$|E

At her funeral, many of these vampires visit to feed on the now corpulent and grown slugs infesting her body. Eventually after both his sister and his fiancee contract cancer, Louis discovers that he can kill cancer vampires by taking radioactive isotopes into his body; these isotopes act as a beacon to the slugs, who are poisoned when they flock to it. In turn, these slugs poison the vampires who eat them when the vampires themselves flock to Louis.|$|E

2500|$|Doug Jones as the Faun and the Pale Man. As the Faun, Jones guides Ofelia to {{the fantasy}} world. As the Pale Man, {{he plays a}} {{grotesque}} monster with an appetite for children. Jones had previously worked with del Toro on Mimic and Hellboy, and said the director sent him an email saying, [...] "You must be in this film. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> play this part but you." [...] Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, {{which he did not}} speak. Jones says he was [...] "terrified" [...] and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, [...] "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in," [...] using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words. Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Adán, [...] "an authoritative theatre actor", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements. Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man (along with the toad) is either a creation of the Faun, or the Faun himself in another form.|$|E
