DTH, a relatively new broadcasting technology has attained significant popularity in the Television segment. The introduction of private FM has given a fillip to the radio broadcasting in India. Telecommunication in India has greatly been supported by the INSAT system of the country, one of the largest domestic satellite systems in the world.

3000|$|<b>Next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>networks</b> (NGN) (or 4 G, as {{they are}} better known) are to provide voice, data and {{multimedia}} access to users on an [...] "anytime" [...] and [...] "anywhere" [...] basis. This vision of 4 G forms the requirement to achieve high throughput, high energy efficiency and low latency to provide quality of service (QoS) and efficient utilization of the scarce bandwidth. Therefore 4 G networks are expected {{to result in a}} better quality of life and environment. Another important requirement for <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>networks</b> is backward compatibility with existing networks. In today's world, due to reasons such as cost and lack of infrastructure, it may not be possible for all to adapt new networks at once and make the existing ones obsolete. This may happen eventually with time; however, we expect to have a hybrid of the new and existing networks for quite some time. It is of high importance to have smooth interaction between existing <b>networks</b> and <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>networks.</b> This intermediate period where both networks will coexist is an important step towards complete transition to <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>networks</b> which ensures a better quality of life and environment. For developed and developing countries which have made much investment on existing networks and due to high number of users, it may take longer to completely migrate to <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>networks.</b> However for underdeveloped countries who still lacks infrastructure the adaptation may be easy but there are cost constraints for them as well.|$|R

The crucial issue is whether an extension of current regulatory obligations onto future networks would hamper the investment by large European operators. The paper applies a real option model to explain the investment decision in <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>networks.</b> One important result of the model is that regulation affects the investment decision only in the initial period when uncertainty is still very high. The real option model has been calibrated with parameters drawn from real data for a new entrant and from educated estimates for an established operator. Four different regulatory regimes and their impact on the timing of the investments have been simulated: a temporary regulatory holiday is shown to be an effective regulatory tool in order to induce immediate investments. real options; telecommunication; regulated industries; <b>Next</b> <b>Generation</b> <b>Networks.</b> ...|$|R
