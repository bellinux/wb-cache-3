30|$|In 2006, the CALD status {{variable}} {{and a number}} of other CALD related variables showed a significant association with reported gambling problems.

The variable combining country of birth and main language spoken at home was also significantly associated with reported gambling problems, with people not born in Australia and <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>English</b> at home (equivalent to the CALD population) being associated with reduced reporting of gambling problems, while people born in Australia and <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>English</b> at home had marginally non-significant association with increased reporting of gambling problems (OR 2.14, CI 0.95 to 4.85). People who spoke either a southern, south-eastern or eastern Asian language reported fewer gambling problems (OR 0.14, CI 0.04 to 0.54), though this was marginally non-significant (p[*]=[*] 0.067), while people <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>English</b> very well, also reported significantly (p[*]=[*] 0.015) fewer gambling problems (OR 0.30, CI 0.14 to 0.65).

The latest census at the time reported that 50% of Richmond's population was of Chinese descent and their campaign highlighted the language barrier faced by those who did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English,</b> for example tax notices were only available in English. They participated in the all-candidate forums that were translated in Cantonese and Mandarin. None of its candidates were elected with Wei Ping Chen receiving 7% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this {{community-based}} {{study was to determine}} factors associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening compliance and non-compliance among Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Cambodian adults with varying levels of English language proficiency. Methods A cross-sectional design was used consisting of a sample of 1, 603 Asian adult men and women. Results Overall, 71. 4 % of the sample reported having never been screened and 28. 6 % reported being screened for HBV Demographic, acculturation, and barrier factors were differentially associated with screening rates among the subgroups. Demographic factors associated with never-screened were: lower education, younger age, being male, and no insurance for Chinese; lower education, lower income and no insurance for Cambodians; younger age and unmarried for Koreans; and no health insurance for Vietnamese; Acculturation factors associated with never-screened were: <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>English</b> for Chinese; <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>English,</b> <b>not</b> reading newspapers in English, and watching TV in one's native language for Cambodians; <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>English</b> for Koreans; while no significant factors were found for Vietnamese. All barriers were associated with never-screened for Cambodians and Chinese. Those who lacked knowledge about HBV and had language and transportation barrier {{were more likely to be}} never-screened for Koreans. There were no significant relationships between the barriers and the screening status for Vietnamese. Conclusions High incidence of HBV and liver cancer in Asian Americans mandates a more vigorous and more culturally and linguistically appropriate educational effort to increase screening and vaccination for HBV in these underserved and mostly uninsured populations...|$|R
