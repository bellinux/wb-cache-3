40|$|BACKGROUND: Because {{maternal}} mortality {{is a rare}} event, {{it is important to}} study maternal <b>near-miss</b> as a complement to evaluate and improve the quality of obstetric care. Thus, the study was conducted with the aim of assessing the incidence and causes of maternal <b>near-miss.</b> METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in five selected public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016. All maternal <b>near-miss</b> cases admitted to the selected hospitals during the study period were prospectively recruited. World Health Organization criteria were used to identify maternal <b>near-miss</b> cases. The number of maternal <b>near-miss</b> cases over one year per 1000 live births occurring during the same year was calculated to determine the incidence of maternal <b>near-miss.</b> Underlying and contributing causes of maternal <b>near-miss</b> were documented from each participant's record. RESULTS: During the one-year period, there were a total of 238 maternal <b>near-miss</b> cases and 29, 697 live births in all participating hospitals, which provides a maternal <b>near-miss</b> incidence ratio of 8. 01 per 1000 live births. The underlying causes of the majority of maternal <b>near-miss</b> cases were hypertensive disorders and obstetric hemorrhage. Anemia was the major contributing cause reported for maternal <b>near-miss.</b> Most of the maternal <b>near-miss</b> cases occurred before the women's arrival at the participating hospitals. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a lower maternal <b>near-miss</b> incidence ratio compared to previous country-level studies. The majority of the <b>near-miss</b> cases occurred before the women's arrival at the participating hospitals, which underscores the importance of improving pre-hospital barriers. Efforts made toward improvement in the management of life-threatening obstetric complications could reduce the occurrence of maternal <b>near-miss</b> problems that occur during hospitalization...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the Global Network <b>Near-Miss</b> Maternal Mortality System and its application in seven sites. METHODS: In a population-based study, pregnant women eligible for {{enrollment in the}} Maternal and Newborn Health Registry at seven sites (Democratic Republic of the Congo; Guatemala; Belagavi and Nagpur, India; Kenya; Pakistan; and Zambia) between January 2014 and April 2016 were screened to identify those {{likely to have a}} <b>near-miss</b> event. The WHO maternal <b>near-miss</b> criteria were modified for low-resource settings. The ratio of <b>near-miss</b> events to maternal deaths was calculated. RESULTS: Among 122 707 women screened, 18 307 (15. 0 %) had a potential <b>near-miss</b> event, of whom 4866 (26. 6 %; 4. 0 % of all women) had a <b>near-miss</b> maternal event. The overall maternal mortality ratio was 155 per 100 000 live births. The ratio of <b>near-miss</b> events to maternal deaths was 26 to 1. The most common factors involved in <b>near-miss</b> cases were the hematologic/coagulation system, infection, and cardiovascular system. CONCLUSION: By using the Global Network <b>Near-Miss</b> Maternal Mortality System, large numbers of women were screened for <b>near-miss</b> events, including those delivering at home or a low-level maternity clinic. The 4. 0 % incidence of <b>near-miss</b> maternal mortality is similar to previously reported data. The ratio of 26 <b>near-miss</b> cases to 1 maternal death suggests that near miss might evaluate the impact of interventions more efficiently than maternal mortality...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Multicenter {{surveillance}} {{has been}} carried out on maternal <b>near-miss</b> in the hospitals with sentinel units. <b>Near-miss</b> is recognized as the predictor of level of care and maternal death. Reducing maternal mortality ratio is one of the challenges to achieve Millennium Development Goal. Objective was to determine the frequency and the nature of <b>near-miss</b> (severe acute maternal morbidity) events and analysis of <b>near-miss</b> morbidities among pregnant women. Methods: Prospective surveillance was done for a year in 2012 in nine hospitals in Kathmandu valley. Cases eligible by definition recorded as a census based on WHO <b>near-miss</b> guideline. Similar questionnaire and dummy tables were used to present the result by non-inferential statistics. Results: Out of 157 cases identified with <b>near-miss</b> rate of 3. 8, severe complications were PPH (40 %) and preeclampsia-eclampsia (17 %). Blood transfusion (65 %), ICU admission (54 %) and surgery (32 %) were the common critical intervention. Oxytocin was the main uterotonic used both prophylactically (86 %) and therapeutically (76 %), and 19 % arrived health facility after delivery or abortion. MgSO 4 was used in all cases of eclampsia. All of the laparotomies were performed within 3 hours of arrival. <b>Near-miss</b> to mortality ratio was 6 : 1 and MMR 62. Conclusions: Study result yields similar pattern amongst developing countries and same <b>near-miss</b> conditions as the causes of maternal death reported by national statistics.

40|$|Background In India {{there is}} a thrust towards {{promoting}} institutional delivery, resulting in problems of overcrowding and compromise to quality of care. Review of <b>near-miss</b> obstetric events has been suggested to be useful to investigate health system functioning, complementing maternal death reviews. The aim of this project was to identify the key elements required for a <b>near-miss</b> review programme for India Methods A structured review was conducted to identify methods used in assessing <b>near-miss</b> cases. The findings of the structured review were used to develop a suggested framework for conducting <b>near-miss</b> reviews in India. A pool of experts in <b>near-miss</b> review methods in low and middle income countries (LMICs) was identified for vetting the framework developed. Opinions were sought about the feasibility of implementing <b>near-miss</b> reviews in India, the processes to be followed, factors that made implementation successful and the associated challenges. A draft of the framework was revised based on the experts’ opinions Results Five broad methods of <b>near-miss</b> case review/audit were identified: Facility-based <b>near-miss</b> case review, confidential enquiries, criterion-based clinical audit, structured case review (South African Model) and home-based interviews. The opinion of the 11 stakeholders highlighted that the methods that a facility adopts should depend on the type and number of cases the facility handles, availability and maintenance of a good documentation system, and local leadership and commitment of staff. A proposed framework for conducting <b>near-miss</b> reviews was developed that included a combination of criterion-based clinical audit and <b>near-miss</b> review methods. Conclusion The approach allowed for development of a framework for researchers and planners seeking to improve quality of maternal care {{not only at the}} facility level but also beyond, encompassing community health workers and referral.

40|$|Objective: In Morocco, {{medical care}} for women with severe obstetric {{complications}} (<b>near-miss</b> cases) ends at discharge from the hospital. Little information exists regarding what happens after returning home. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the physical and mental health consequences of <b>near-miss</b> events on Moroccan women 8  months after childbirth. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 76 <b>near-miss</b> women was conducted in three hospitals. For every case, we recruited at least two women from the same hospital who had uncomplicated deliveries (n =  169). We used a mixed-methods approach. For the quantitative part, we analysed sociodemographic characteristics collected via a questionnaire and medical complications extracted from the medical records during a medical consultation at 8  months post-partum. Forty in-depth interviews were also conducted with 20 <b>near-miss</b> cases and 20 women with uncomplicated deliveries. Results: The <b>near-miss</b> women were poorer and less educated than those who had uncomplicated deliveries. The proportion of physical consequences (serious illness) was higher among <b>near-miss</b> cases (22 %) than uncomplicated deliveries (6 %, P =  0. 001). The risk of depression was significantly higher among <b>near-miss</b> cases with perinatal death (OR =  7. 16; [95 % CI: 2. 85 – 17. 98]) than among those who had an uncomplicated delivery. Interviews revealed that the economic burden of <b>near-miss</b> care contributed to social problems among the women and their households. Conclusion: A <b>near-miss</b> event has consequences that go beyond the first days after delivery. Developing new mechanisms for maternal and newborn health follow-up is essential and should address the mother's physical and mental health problems and involve husbands and family members.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Near-miss</b> events {{represent}} {{an opportunity to}} identify and correct errors that jeopardize pa-tient safety. This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a <b>near-miss</b> reporting system in pri-mary care practices and to describe initial reports and practice responses to them. Methods: We implemented a web-based, anonymous <b>near-miss</b> reporting system into 7 diverse practices, collecting and categorizing all reports. At {{the end of the}} study period, we interviewed practice leaders to de-termine how the <b>near-miss</b> reports were used for quality improvement (QI) in each practice. Results: All 7 practices successfully implemented the system, reporting 632 <b>near-miss</b> events in 9 months and initiating 32 QI projects based on the reports. The most frequent events reported were breakdowns in office processes (47. 3 %); of these, filing errors were most common, with 38 % of these errors judged by external coders to be high risk for an adverse event. Electronic medical records were the primary or secondary cause of the error in 7. 8 % and 14. 4 % of reported cases, respectively. The pat-tern of <b>near-miss</b> events across these diverse practices was similar. Conclusions: Anonymous <b>near-miss</b> reporting can be successfully implemented in primary care prac-tices. <b>Near-miss</b> events occur frequently in office practice, primarily involve administrative and commu-nication problems, and can pose a serious threat to patient safety; they can, however, be used by prac-tice leaders to implement QI changes.

40|$|Background: The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} in the Danish sector of the North Sea has always focused on reducing work-related accidents. Over the years, accident rates have been reduced, and <b>near-miss</b> reporting has gained in importance, because it allows the industry to learn from experience and prevent further accidents. Because of this importance, oil and gas companies use many resources to register and analyse near misses. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate <b>near-miss</b> reporting for the Danish offshore installations and to examine what the industry learns from <b>near-miss</b> reporting and how these reports can be used in the prevention of accidents. Data: Data are derived from three oil and gas companies in the Danish sector of the North Sea. The material consists of documentary data such as procedures and reports as well as interviews and a database including <b>near-miss</b> reports.

Though reporting and investigating injuries present a more detailed picture, {{this is still a}} lagging indicator — measuring after the event. Recording and investigating near misses, on the other hand, {{can be used as a}} positive indicator of performance tool to fix problems before injuries occur. Employers are obligated to inform about <b>near-miss</b> to the workers so that they are aware what a <b>near-miss</b> is, how to report a <b>near-miss</b> and whom to report to. By definition, <b>near-miss</b> leaves no injuries, nor property or equipment damage. They also leave little (or no) evidence that they even occurred and as such, easy to ignore. As a result, workers have no reason to believe reports will be viewed positively and acted on. This study aims to investigate how well informed construction workers are about <b>near-miss</b> reporting. Importantly, investigations will be performed to identify factors that influence workers' willingness to report near misses that they were exposed to or had observed. To achieve the aims, a deductive approach was adopted. Interviews were conducted with 37 construction workers from two districts, all within the same contractor's organisation. Although results indicated that majority of the interviewees are familiar with the definition of a <b>near-miss</b> and routines of reporting, the willingness to report near misses is still low.

In November, the ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she escorted several convoys. She struck a mine in January 1941 and was towed to Malta for repairs. These were proved extensive and Gallant was further damaged by <b>near-misses</b> during an air raid in April 1942, before they were completed.

5|$|As the new {{ball was}} due {{soon after the}} start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many <b>near-misses.</b> He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Investigation of {{maternal}} <b>near-miss</b> {{is a useful}} complement to the investigation {{of maternal}} mortality {{with the aim of}} meeting the United Nations' fifth Millennium Development Goal. The present study was conducted to investigate the frequency of <b>near-miss</b> events, to calculate the mortality index for each event and to compare the socio-demographic and obstetrical data (age, parity, gestational age, education and antenatal care) of the <b>near-miss</b> cases with maternal deaths. Methods <b>Near-miss</b> cases and events (hemorrhage, infection, hypertensive disorders, anemia and dystocia), maternal deaths and their causes were retrospectively reviewed and the mortality index for each event was calculated in Kassala Hospital, eastern Sudan over a 2 -year period, from January 2008 to December 2010. Disease-specific criteria were applied for these events. Results There were 9578 deliveries, 205 <b>near-miss</b> cases, 228 <b>near-miss</b> events and 40 maternal deaths. Maternal <b>near-miss</b> and maternal mortality ratio were 22. 1 / 1000 live births and 432 / 100 000 live births, respectively. Hemorrhage accounted for the most common event (40. 8 %), followed by infection (21. 5 %), hypertensive disorders (18. 0 %), anemia (11. 8 %) and dystocia (7. 9 %). The mortality index were 22. 2 %, 10. 0 %, 10. 0 %, 8. 8 % and 2. 4 % for infection, dystocia, anemia, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders, respectively. Conclusion There is a high frequency of maternal morbidity and mortality at the level of this facility. Therefore maternal health policy needs to be concerned not only with averting the loss of life, but also with preventing or ameliorating maternal-near miss events (hemorrhage, infections, hypertension and anemia) at all care levels including primary level. </p...|$|R
