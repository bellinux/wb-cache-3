The overall fabric surface roughness {{before and after the}} singeing process has been estimated and evaluated comprehensively, specifically experimenting for darker shade samples that are prone to visual inspection errors. The energy, entropy, inertia, and homogeneity parameters of images of the fabric after and before singeing have been identified as the suitable descriptors of fabric surface roughness. A new integrating sphere imaging system that has been designed indigenously was used for image capture and analysis of unsinged and singed fabric with a digital DSLR camera. The imaging system ensures controlled, diffused and uniform illumination across the samples. The proposed evaluation method is found to be suitable and economic for analysis of singeing <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Institute</b> of Textiles and ClothingDepartment of Computin...|$|R

40|$|In {{the textile}} and {{clothing}} industry, marker planning {{is a critical}} operation in the fabric-cutting room, in which pattern pieces of different sizes and styles of a garment are laid out {{on a sheet of}} paper with fixed width and arbitrary length in order to achieve the highest fabric utilization (marker efficiency). The layout always contains areas of unusable fabric due to the irregular shapes of garment pattern pieces. The minimization of fabric wastage is crucial to the reduction of production costs. In this study, a methodology that hybridizes a heuristic packing (HP) approach based on grid approximation with an integer representation-based (μ + λ) evolutionary strategy (ES) is proposed in order to obtain an efficient layout of garment patterns so as to optimize the fabric utilization. The performance of the proposed methodology is validated by the experiments and the results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective means by which to increase the marker <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Institute</b> of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel unsupervised approach to detect dominant colour regions standing out conspicuously in yarn-dyed fabric images. For a dominant colour region of a yarn-dyed fabric, measured by an imaging system, its individual yarn has an irregular three-dimensional shape resulting in significant colour difference among pixels of the yarn. This difference leads to difficulty in segmenting yarns into dominant colour regions. A probabilistic model is proposed {{in this study}} to associate the colour of a dominant colour region with the colours of its yarns. Based on this model, the colour histograms of a dominant colour region are first estimated from those of yarns in a yarn-dyed fabric image. Then, a hierarchical segmentation structure is devised to detect dominant colour regions in the image. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed approach achieves satisfactory performance for dominant colour region segmentation in yarn-dyed fabric images, with high computational <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Institute</b> of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

Among the factors studied using these techniques are the abundance of subsidies, strong competition between regions worldwide {{and the need for}} efficient production systems. In some countries like Portugal, this sector is being revitalized in face of the need for reducing imports. The editors draw on a 3 -year project that analyzed a Portuguese area in detail, comparing this study with papers from other regions. Applications include the estimation of technical efficiency in agricultural grazing systems (dairy, beef and mixed) and specifically for dairy farms. The conclusions indicate that it is now necessary to help small dairy farms in order to make them more efficient. These results can be compared with the technical efficiency of a sample of Spanish dairy processing firms presented by Magdalena Kapelko and co-authors.

40|$|Multispectral {{imaging system}} is of wide {{application}} in relevant fields for its capability in acquiring spectral information of scenes. Its limitation is that, {{due to the}} large number of spectral channels, the imaging process can be quite time-consuming when capturing high-resolution (HR) multispectral images. To resolve this limitation, this paper proposes a fast multispectral imaging framework based on the image sensor pixel-binning and spectral unmixing techniques. The framework comprises a fast imaging stage and a computational reconstruction stage. In the imaging stage, only a few spectral images are acquired in HR, while most spectral images are acquired in low resolution (LR). The LR images are captured by applying pixel binning on the image sensor, such that the exposure time can be greatly reduced. In the reconstruction stage, an optimal number of basis spectra are computed and the signal-dependent noise statistics are estimated. Then the unknown HR images are efficiently reconstructed by solving a closed-form cost function that models the spatial and spectral degradations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated using real-scene multispectral images. Experimental results validate that, in general, the method outperforms the state of the arts in terms of reconstruction accuracy, with additional 20 × or more improvement in computational <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Institute</b> of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

Teledermatology has been widely used in daily practice in the Netherlands since 2005 and is fully reimbursed. This study prospectively investigated the effect of teledermatology on efficiency, quality and costs of care when integrated in daily practice and applied following patient selection by the general practitioner (GP). Teledermatology consultations between GP and regional dermatologist were performed in daily GP practice in the <b>Netherlands.</b> <b>Efficiency</b> of care was measured by the {{decrease in the number of}} physical referrals to the dermatologist. Quality of care was measured by the percentage of teleconsultations for second opinion, physical referrals resulting from these teleconsultations, the response time of the dermatologists and educational effect experienced by the GP. Costs of conventional healthcare without teledermatology were compared with costs with teledermatology. One thousand, eight hundred and twenty GPs and 166 dermatologists performed teledermatology, and 37, 207 teleconsultations performed from March 2007 to September 2010 were included. In the group of patients where the GP used teleconsultation to prevent a referral (n = 26, 596), 74 % of physical referrals were prevented. In the group of patients where the GP used teleconsultation for a second opinion (n = 10, 611), 16 % were physically referred after teleconsultation. The prevented referral rate in the total population was 68 %. The mean response time of dermatologists was 4 · 6 h (median 2 · 0). GPs indicated that there was a beneficial educational effect in 85 % of the teleconsultations. The estimated cost reduction was 18 %. Teledermatology can lead to efficient care probably at lower cost. We are therefore of the opinion that teledermatology following GP selection should be considered as a possible pathway of referral to secondary car...|$|R

40|$|Foam cup {{moulding}} of seamless and traceless undergarments is {{an important}} manufacturing technique for the intimate apparel industry. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about the optimization of the main moulding parameters. In this study, Response Surface Methodology (RSM), based on a Box-Behnken Design (BBD), was {{used to analyze the}} effects of the three main moulding factors (moulding temperature, dwell time and size of mould head) on the shape conformity of moulded bra cups and formulate a prediction model in a second-order polynomial form. Design and analysis of experimental data were carried out by the Minitab R 15. 1. 30. 0. The analyses revealed that moulding temperature greatly affected the shape conformity of moulded bra cup, and the interactions between moulding temperature and dwell time have major influence on the control of bra cup moulding process. The optimal cup shape conformity and the corresponding settings of the selected variables in bra cup moulding process were obtained by solving the quadratic regression model, as well as by analyzing the response surface contour plots. When moulding temperature and dwell time were set as 200 ◦ and 140 s for a mould head size of 36 C, the optimum shape conformity of the moulded bra cup was predicted as 83 %. The adopted model was proved reasonably and effectively.
