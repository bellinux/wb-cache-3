5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Parliament of Norway {{are elected}} based on party-list {{proportional}} representation in plural member constituencies. This means that representatives from different political parties are elected from 19 constituencies, which are {{identical to the}} 19 counties. The electorate does <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party. This means that the person {{on top of the}} list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot. Parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E
5|$|Harrison won 19 of the 26 states, {{including}} New York (home to Van Buren), Kentucky (to Johnson) and Tennessee (Jackson). Van Buren did win in Virginia, {{the state}} of birth of both Whig candidates, and in Illinois, with Lincoln defeated for elector. The electoral vote count was 234 for Harrison and 60 for Van Buren, with the popular vote closer at 1,275,390 for Harrison to 1,128,854 for Van Buren. Of the 60 Van Buren electors, 12 did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Johnson, with 11 (all from South Carolina) choosing Littleton W. Tazewell for vice president, and one (from Virginia) favoring Governor James K. Polk of Tennessee. Turnout was 81 percent of eligible voters, setting a record since surpassed only in 1860 and 1876. The Whigs took both houses of Congress, {{and a majority of}} state governorships.|$|E
5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2017, this {{remains the}} last {{election}} in which Illinois and New Jersey have <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the same candidate - {{and the only one}} since 1888.|$|R
50|$|An optimal {{approval}} <b>vote</b> always <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> {{the most}} preferred candidate {{and not for}} the least preferred candidate. However, an optimal vote can require <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> a candidate and <b>not</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.|$|R
50|$|After the election, reports {{claimed that}} Assyrians {{had been fired}} from their jobs because they were {{suspected}} of <b>not</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> the pro-Kurdish Ishtar Patriotic List, which won the seat reserved for an Assyrian candidate.|$|R
5|$|Since its inception, {{the scheme}} {{has been widely}} criticised. It has been {{considered}} undemocratic as it allows candidates {{who do not have}} the mandate of the people to air their views in Parliament. Furthermore, members of the opposition have criticized the scheme for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to argue that the electorate need <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in Parliament. Despite this critique, several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats, including Lee Siew-Choh, J. B. Jeyaretnam, Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim. NCMPs have raised notable points in Parliament with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure, education, health and social welfare.|$|E
25|$|Two Trump electors in Texas did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Trump (one vote went to John Kasich, one to Ron Paul); one elector did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Pence {{and instead}} voted for Carly Fiorina for Vice-President; a third {{resigned}} {{before the vote}} rather than vote for Trump {{and was replaced by}} an alternate.|$|E
25|$|For the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger {{endorsed}} fellow Republican John Kasich. However, {{he announced}} in October {{that he would}} <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the that year's United States presidential election, with this being {{the first time he}} did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{an offence}} to {{threaten}} {{a person to}} <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a candidate or <b>not</b> to <b>vote.</b> In 2004 this was extended to include [...] "spiritual threats". This {{was due to the}} Islamic Party of Malaysia(PAS) told citizens in less developed parts of the country <b>not</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> the PAS is forbidden and that a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> them would be rewarded by God.|$|R
50|$|As of 2017, this is {{the last}} of only two {{elections}} when Kansas and Nebraska have <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the same candidate. It is also the last election in which a Republican won the presidency without winning Nebraska.|$|R
2500|$|Senator Kerry, {{after talking}} to several {{co-workers}} and family and friends, I asked the ones {{who said they were}} <b>not</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> you, why. They said that you were too wishy-washy. Do you have a reply for them? ...|$|R

50|$|President Obama won {{the state}} of Washington comfortably, taking 56.16% to Mitt Romney's 41.29%, a 14.87% margin of victory. The {{election}} continued the state's blue trend; Washington has <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> a Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2016 one {{councillor}} {{resigned from}} the SNP over Grahame's intervention, claiming it represented a [...] "lack of support" [...] for SNP councillors {{and that he had}} <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> her in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.|$|R

25|$|The Twelfth Amendment {{stipulates}} that each elector must cast distinct votes for President and Vice President, {{instead of two}} votes for President. Additionally, electors may <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> presidential and vice-presidential candidates who both reside in the elector's state—at {{least one of them}} must be an inhabitant of another state.|$|E
25|$|Many {{opinion leaders}} {{predicted}} that Barr could siphon off conservative votes {{that would have}} otherwise gone to McCain. John Linder, who defeated Barr for the Republican nomination in a 2002 congressional race, said that Barr could cause serious problems for McCain in some states. Barr repeatedly rejected this assertion as scapegoating, responding that small-government Republicans would <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> McCain anyway, nor would civil liberties advocates vote for Obama.|$|E
5000|$|Florida <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Donald Trump by {{a margin}} of 1.2%. Trump's victory {{continued}} Florida's tradition of being a swing state in presidential elections, having <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> a losing candidate since 1992. Moreover, it was the fifth-closest state result, with only Wisconsin, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania closer.|$|R
5000|$|Georges Bernanos {{described}} him as a [...] "Maupassant of sub-prefecture", because he had <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the Voyage au bout de la nuit by Louis-Ferdinand Céline at the 1932 edition of the prix Goncourt (Le Figaro, 13 December 1932).|$|R
50|$|Parker County, {{like most}} {{suburban}} {{counties in the}} Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area, has been a Republican stronghold for decades. Republicans have held all public offices since 1999 and the county has <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> a Democratic Presidential candidate since 1976.|$|R
25|$|Out of all {{the states}} that Nixon had {{previously}} carried in 1960, Maine and Washington {{were the only two}} states that did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> him again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{many of the}} {{residents}} of the Piedmont and western areas of the state were Unionist, and Guilford County did <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> secession. But, once North Carolina joined the Confederacy, some citizens joined the Confederate cause, forming such infantry units as the Guilford Grays to fight in the Civil War. From 1861 to March 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the war, although residents {{had to deal with the}} regional shortages of clothing, medicines, and other items caused by the US naval blockade of the South.|$|E
25|$|Intimidation {{was also}} prevalent, with Kurdish separatist PKK militants {{allegedly}} raiding shops and cafes in the Kurdish-majority south east and demanding {{votes for the}} HDP. It was also alleged that the state-owned Anatolia Agency press organisation marked a voter's house in Diyarbakır after {{they said they would}} <b>not</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the HDP. Controversies also arose in regards to the HDP's political adverts, which were perceived to be threatening violence if the party didn't cross the 10% threshold and also regarding whether Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would invite the opposition to form a government should the AKP not win a parliamentary majority.|$|E
50|$|During the Virginia Secession Convention, Hampshire County {{voted against}} secession, {{but much of}} this vote was within what {{is now part of}} heavily Unionist and Republican Mineral County, which was {{detached}} from it after the war. Following the detachment of Mineral - which was not to give a Democratic majority before 1936 or after 1976 - Hampshire County became solidly Democratic, <b>not</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> any Republican candidate between 1868 and 1952 inclusive. However, since 1968 Hampshire County has <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> any Democratic presidential candidate apart from Jimmy Carter in 1976, and since 2000 it has suffered the same drastic declines in Democratic support as the rest of socially conservative West Virginia.|$|R
50|$|During the Virginia Secession Convention, Hardy County {{voted against}} secession, {{but much of}} this vote was within {{fiercely}} Unionist and overwhelmingly Republican Grant County, which was detached from it after the war. Following the detachment of Grant - which was frequently {{to be among the}} nation’s most Republican counties in the subsequent century and a half - Hardy County became solidly Democratic, <b>not</b> <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> any Republican candidate between 1868 and 1964 inclusive. However, since 1968 Hardy County has <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> any Democratic presidential candidate apart from Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1996, whilst since 2000 it has suffered the same drastic declines in Democratic support as the rest of socially conservative West Virginia.|$|R
25|$|However, Queens has <b>not</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> a Republican {{candidate}} {{in a presidential}} election since 1972, when Queens voters chose Richard Nixon over George McGovern.
