25|$|When they {{initially}} {{captured the}} bridge, the American engineers were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> could support {{the weight of}} the tanks, but they only had about 120 troops on the east side and they needed to reinforce them immediately. At about midnight the engineers opened the bridge to armor. At 12:15 am on 8 March, two platoons of nine Sherman tanks from Company A, 14th Tank Battalion, gingerly crept across the bridge in close formation following white tape left by the engineers outlining the holes. When they successfully reached the east bank, they moved into blocking positions to secure the bridgehead. Immediately behind the Shermans, an M10 Tank Destroyer from the 656th Tank Destroyer Battalion fell part way into the hole in the bridge deck left by the German demolition charge. The engineers briefly considered pushing the tank destroyer into the river, but decided they might further damage the bridge. They worked all night to jack the tank up and at 5:30 am finally got a tank on the east side to come back and pull the tank destroyer across the hole.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Onions The A.V.

[...] He added that after the opening exchange between Olivia and Fauxlivia, the episode [...] "settles into a fairly typical" [...] Fringe formula involving a [...] "villain of the week" [...] and a freakish event. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times praised Anna Torv's two performances and believed [...] "the containment built around 'the Machine'" [...] may [...] "have been my favorite part of the episode." ...|$|E

Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one.

500|$|DR's Per Juul Carlsen {{declared}} {{that although the}} film is visually beautiful, he is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> should be this way: [...] "Had it not been better and more correct {{to tell the story}} really ugly and blurry in the rain instead of sunshine... with realism instead of polished exquisiteness". He also criticized it for sharing too much of the American gangster and spy film clichés. The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one can say about this film, if it is nice, is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses. Quite apart from that {{about a third of the}} dialogue is hard to understand, because the players do not articulate appropriately." ...|$|E

The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was the essence of what U2 is good at... we have to do what we do best and we have to focus on that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that." [...] Guetta clarified that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono.|$|E

500|$|In January 2015, Michael Doran of Newsarama and Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter had a [...] "point-counterpoint" [...] {{debate in}} {{response}} to the first Ant-Man trailer. Doran stated, [...] "Marvel has raised the bar [...] high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [...] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it". McMillian responded, [...] "at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> can offer up something like [...] it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it [...] offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience [...] expecting something to knock their socks off." [...] Doran concluded, [...] "That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... Marvel [...] going to eventually falter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1553 Servetus {{published}} Christianismi Restitutio (English: The Restoration of Christianity), {{in which}} he rejected the Christian doctrine of the Trinity {{and the concept of}} predestination. In the same year, Calvin's representative, Guillaume de Trie, sent letters alerting the French Inquisition to Servetus. Calling him a [...] "Spanish-Portuguese", suspecting and accusing him of his recently proved Jewish converso origin. De Trie wrote down that [...] "his proper name is Michael Servetus, but he currently calls himself Villeneuve, practising medicine. He stayed for some time in Lyon, and now he is living in Vienne." [...] When the inquisitor-general of France learned that Servetus was hiding in Vienne, according to Calvin under an assumed name, he contacted Cardinal François de Tournon, the secretary of the archbishop of Lyon, to take up the matter. Servetus was arrested and taken in for questioning. His letters to Calvin were presented as evidence of heresy, but he denied having written them, and later said he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was his handwriting. He said, after swearing before the holy gospel, that [...] "he was Michel De Villeneuve Doctor in Medicine about 42 years old, native of Tudela of the kingdom of Navarre, a city under the obedience to the Emperor". The following day he said: [...] "..although he was not Servetus he assumed the person of Servet for debating with Calvin". He managed to escape from prison, and the Catholic authorities sentenced him in absentia to death by slow burning.|$|E
500|$|Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear (aged 23 and 24, respectively) were {{attacked}} on the Eastbank Esplanade on May 22, 2011, after holding hands while {{walking across the}} Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Oregon. Details of the attack were released by Portland Police on May 24. Forkner and Rosevear said a group of five men followed them from Tom McCall Waterfront Park across the bridge, then beat them as they came down a ramp along the Esplanade. According to the description released by Portland Police, [...] "as [...] walked they knew several men were behind them talking, laughing and pointing but they were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was directed at them." [...] Three of the five men attacked the couple from behind. Forkner was pushed into a railing and punched multiple times before breaking away to call 9-1-1. The attackers reportedly continued hitting Rosevear on the head, face, back and ribs until Forkner was able to call for police help. Forkner later recalled {{that he did not}} hear specific homophobic remarks, but believed the attackers may have been yelling in a foreign language. Forkner had swelling on his face, and Rosevear required stitches in his lip. The victims said that several witnesses were nearby, but did not offer help in any form. Police investigated the case as a [...] "bias crime", noting the lack of provocation. The five men who attacked Forkner and Rosevear have so far not been identified.|$|E
