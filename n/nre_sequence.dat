40|$|The {{structure}} of the 28 kDa complex {{of the first two}} RNA binding domains (RBDs) of nucleolin (RBD 12) with an RNA stem–loop that includes the nucleolin recognition element UCCCGA in the loop was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The {{structure of}} nucleolin RBD 12 with the nucleolin recognition element (NRE) reveals that the two RBDs bind {{on opposite sides of the}} RNA loop, forming a molecular clamp that brings the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of the recognition sequence close together and stabilizing the stem–loop. The specific interactions observed in the structure explain the sequence specificity for the <b>NRE</b> <b>sequence.</b> Binding studies of mutant proteins and analysis of conserved residues support the proposed interactions. The mode of interaction of the protein with the RNA and the location of the putative NRE sites suggest that nucleolin may function as an RNA chaperone to prevent improper folding of the nascent pre-rRNA...|$|E
40|$|The noncoding {{region of}} the highly oncogenic, epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated human {{papillomavirus}} type 8 contains a negative regulatory element (NRE). Quantitative RNase protection analysis confirmed that the <b>NRE</b> <b>sequence</b> acts as a silencer of transcription. A 38 -bp sequence upstream of late promoter P 7535 down-regulated expression from the homologous P 7535 promoter, {{as well as the}} heterologous tk gene promoter, independently of its orientation relative to the test promoters. It also reduced gene expression when cloned downstream of the transcription units. Transient expression assays with keratinocytes and fibroblasts of epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients and controls demonstrated that the NRE activity is not cell specific. Gel retardation tests suggested that NRE specifically interacts with only one nuclear factor. Mutational analysis identified three NRE mutants which no longer formed a detectable DNA-protein complex but still repressed transcription, indicating that protein-DNA interaction is not relevant for the silencer function. The NRE contains a binding site of viral trans activator protein E 2. It was shown that expression of E 2 overrides the inhibitory effect of the NRE sequences. Binding of E 2 and that of the cellular factor were mutually exclusive. The bifunctional nature of NRE acting as a silencer and a target site for viral trans activator E 2 offers an interesting opportunity to regulate the switch from early to late transcription in the human papillomavirus life cycle...|$|E
40|$|DBA/ 2 J mouse {{contains}} two renin gene loci (Ren 1 d and Ren 2 d). Ren 2 d but not Ren 1 d {{is expressed in}} submandibular gland (SMG) while both are expressed in the kidney. Based on vitro studies, we have postulated that a negative regulatory element (NRE) in the renin gene promoter is involved in its tissue-specific expression. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism at the in vivo level using direct gene transfer. Fragments of the Ren 1 d or Ren 2 d promoter were fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression vector. These constructs complexed in fusogenic liposomes were injected directly into the mouse SMG or intraarterially into the mouse kidney via the renal artery. The vector containing the CAT exhibited readily detectable in vivo expressions in both SMG and kidney. In the SMG, Ren 1 d fragment containing the NRE abolished CAT expression while deletion of the NRE restored CAT expression. The homologous fragment from the Ren 2 d promoter did not inhibit CAT expression while deletion of the 150 -bp insertion resulted in the inhibition. Cotransfection of Ren 1 d construct with Ren 1 d-NRE oligonucleotides as transcriptional factor decoy restored CAT expression. Contrary to the SMG, transfection with Ren 1 d fragment-CAT construct or Ren 2 d fragment-CAT construct into the kidney resulted in similar levels of CAT expression. Interestingly, human c-myc NRE oligonucleotides which share homology with Ren 1 d-NRE competed effectively with these oligonucleotides for the regulation of Ren 1 d gene expression in vivo. This <b>NRE</b> <b>sequence</b> is also homologous to silencer elements found in multiple mammalian genes, suggesting {{the presence of a}} family of NRE/NRE binding proteins regulating expression of diverse genes...|$|E
40|$|Nucleolin, a {{multi-domain}} protein {{involved in}} ribosome biogenesis, {{has been shown}} to bind the consensus sequence (U/G) CCCG(A/G) {{in the context of a}} hairpin loop structure (nucleolin recog-nition element; NRE). Previous studies have shown that the ®rst two RNA-binding domains in nucleolin (RBD 12) are responsible for the interaction with the in vitro selected NRE (sNRE). We have previously reported the structures of nucleolin RBD 12, sNRE and nucleolin RBD 12 ±sNRE complex. A comparison of free and bound sNRE shows that the NRE loop becomes structured upon binding. From this obser-vation, we hypothesized that the disordered hairpin loop of sNRE facilitates conformational rearrange-ments when the protein binds. Here, we show that nucleolin RBD 12 is also suf®cient for sequence-speci®c binding of two <b>NRE</b> <b>sequences</b> found in pre-rRNA, b 1 NRE and b 2 NRE. Structural investiga-tions of the free NREs using NMR spectroscopy show that the b 1 NRE loop is conformationally het-erogeneous, while the b 2 NRE loop is structured. The b 2 NRE forms a hairpin capped by a YNMG-like tetraloop. Comparison of the chemical shifts of sNRE and b 2 NRE in complex with nucleolin RBD 12 suggests that the NRE consensus nucleotides adopt a similar conformation. These results show that a disordered <b>NRE</b> consensus <b>sequence</b> is not a prerequisite for nucleolin RBD 12 binding...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} deletions within three {{functional}} {{regions of the}} long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 upon {{the ability of the}} long terminal repeat to direct production of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene product and upon the ability of viruses that carry the mutations to replicate in human cell lines was investigated. The results show that the enhancer and TATAA sequences were required for efficient virus replication. Deletion of the negative regulatory element (NRE) yielded a virus that replicated more rapidly than did an otherwise isogeneic NRE-positive virus. The suppressive effect of the NRE did not depend upon the negative regulatory gene (nef), as both NRE-positive and NRE-negative viruses were defective for nef. We conclude that factors specified by the cell interact with the <b>NRE</b> <b>sequences</b> to retard human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication...|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} regulatory element (NRE) {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) long terminal repeat (LTR) is a defined region that {{has been reported to}} downregulate LTR-directed HIV gene expression. However, information on the precise role of this region in regulating HIV gone transcription is lacking. We have investigated the possibility that these <b>NRE</b> <b>sequences</b> regulate HIV transcription by a mechanism mediated through a nuclear matrix-specific DNA-protein interaction. We find a nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR) present within the NRE of the HIV- 1 LTR that recognizes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein present in the nuclear matrix of HIV infected cells. Moreover, we also show that the purified DNA-binding nuclear matrix protein (NMP) specifically represses the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB. It is likely that the MAR and MAR-enriched specific DNA-binding NMP are brought into juxtaposition by the non-chromatin scaffolding of the nucleus, thus influencing NF-kappaB (and other nuclear proteins) DNA-binding activity through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Our date suggest that one possible role of the NRE could be to act as a matrix attachment site in the nuclear matrix, thus, allowing interaction with a sequence-specific trans-acting factor. The negative effect on NF-kappaB activity due to this MAR-NMP-specific interaction provides a mechanism by which the NRE downregulates HIV gene expression...|$|R
40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{previously}} {{carried out to}} identify HCC-associated genomic markers on HBV. Some of them are clustered at the preS 1 and X promoter regions of HBV genotype B and core promoter of HBV subgenotype Cs. The functional significance of these markers to the virus was investigated in our study. Our result showed {{that one of those}} markers, the G 1613 A mutation on core promoter, can significantly increase the promoter activity in a genotype-dependent manner and the effect is reversible by the A-to-G back mutation. We have established an in vitro full-length HBV genome transfection system and the result suggested that the G 1613 A mutation suppressed the e antigen (HBeAg) secretion and enhanced virus DNA production by downregulating the precore (preC) mRNA transcription. In consistence to the clinical study, the mutation was associated to serum HBV DNA level higher than 6 log copies/ 1 M in female HBV carriers in a univariate analysis. In addition, we demonstrated that the G 1613 A mutation is a hot spot mutation situated on the negative regulatory element (NRE) on the core promoter in an alignment analysis. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of the mutation, two unknown protein complexes had been shown to bind on the NRE. They showed different binding affinity to the G 1613 -wild-type and A 1613 -mutant <b>NRE</b> <b>sequence.</b> Moreover, we showed that in vitro synthesized RFX 1 protein could bind to the mutated NRE probe at a higher affinity than that to wild-type NRE probe. Overall, our result suggests that the G 1613 A mutation exerts its effect by differential binding to some proteins via the NRE region. Studying the mechanism of the mutations may provide insights to the viral pathogenesis and HBV-associated HCC, which has long been a health burden in Asia-Pacific countries. Infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis and is closely associated with the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Approximately 60 - 80 % of world's HCC is related to HBV, and it is the third most common cause of cancer death in Asia-Pacific region. Almost 400 million people are chronically infected with HBV and one-third was likely to die of complications of cirrhosis, including liver failure and HCC. As {{there is a shortage of}} effective curative treatments, detection and prognosis of the risk of cancer development will be essential to improve survival of patients with chronic HBV infection.

40|$|A novel {{class of}} RNA-binding proteins, Puf, regu-lates {{translation}} and RNA stability by binding to speci®c sequences in the 3 ¢-untranslated region of target mRNAs. Members of this protein family share a conserved Puf domain consisting of eight 36 amino acid imperfect repeats. Here we report two Puf family member genes, PfPuf 1 and PfPuf 2, {{from the human}} malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both genes are spliced with four and three introns clustered within or near the Puf domains, respect-ively. Northern and RT±PCR analysis indicated that both genes were differentially expressed in gameto-cytes during erythrocytic development of the para-site. Except for similarities in the Puf domain and expression pro®le, the deduced PfPuf 1 and PfPuf 2 proteins differ considerably in size and structure. PfPuf 1 has 1894 amino acids and a central Puf domain, whereas PfPuf 2 is much smaller with a C-terminal Puf domain. The presence {{of at least two}} Puf members in other Plasmodium species sug-gests that these proteins play evolutionarily similar roles during parasite development. Both in vivo studies using the yeast three-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays using the recombinant Puf domain of PfPuf 1 expressed in bacteria demon-strated intrinsic binding activity of the PfPuf 1 Puf domain to the <b>NRE</b> <b>sequences</b> in the hunchback RNA, the target sequence for Drosophila Pumilio protein. Altogether, these results suggest that PfPufs might function during sexual differentiation and development in Plasmodium through a con-served mechanism of translational regulation of their target mRNAs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{elucidate}} {{the role of the}} Drosophila translational repressor Pumilio (Pum) in regulating neuronal excitability. It is already known that in the posterior region of the Drosophila embryo Pum acts as a translational repressor of the maternally transcribed hunchback (Izb) gene by interacting with it's 3 'Nanos response element (NRE), playing a role in abdominal segmentation. Studies from our lab have shown that the levels of Pum have a positive correlation with synaptic activity but a reciprocal correlation with neuronal excitability. A bioinformatics search has lead to the identification of the similar <b>NRE</b> <b>sequences</b> in the Drosophila sodium channel gene paralytic. (para). I am testing hypothesis that neuronal excitability is dependent on the regulatory activity ofPum; Pum can regulate novel NRE linked messages in an activity-dependent manner I have created transgenic flies expressing lllmclzback NRE-Iuciferase reporter constructs that can respond to different levels of Pum! synaptic activity. I have used these flies to test the hypothesis that changing levels of Pum! activity mediate neuronal homeostasis. This provides strong evidence that Pum! activity can regulate NRE linked mRNAs in the nervous system, but has no direct implication on para. I have mapped the untranslated region (UTR's) of the para transcript(s). I have done this work using RACE (Rapid Amplication of eDNA Ends) analysis and extended PCRs As UTR regions have documented role in localization of transcripts, I have cloned this novel para RACE clones in mGFP vector to study their localization in the nervous system. I have also expressed these clones in over-expression of pumilio background to monitor whether NRE-linked messages can be regulated by pumilio. This will provide in vivo molecular evidence for the action ofPum on para translation. These novel RACE sequences have been cloned into UAS-luciferase vector and transfected into Drosophila Schneider cell line (S 2) cells to study their different level of expression.

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, {{specification}} of wing vein cells and sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells, which later {{give rise to}} a bristle, requires EGFR signaling. Here, we show that Pumilio (Pum), an RNA-binding translational repressor, negatively regulates EGFR signaling in wing vein and bristle development. We observed that loss of Pum function yielded extra wing veins and additional bristles. Conversely, overexpression of Pum eliminated wing veins and bristles. Heterozygotes for Pum produced no phenotype on their own, but greatly enhanced phenotypes caused by the enhancement of EGFR signaling. Conversely, over-expression of Pum suppressed the effects of ectopic EGFR signaling. Components of the EGFR signaling pathway are encoded by mRNAs that have Nanos Response Element (<b>NRE)</b> –like <b>sequences</b> in their 3 ’UTRs; NREs are known to bind Pum to confer regulation in other mRNAs. We show that these NRE-like sequences bind Pum and confer repression on a luciferase reporter in heterologous cells. Taken together, our evidence suggests that Pum functions as a negativ...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{is a human}} retrovirus and the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Genetic analysis has revealed that the HIV- 1 LTR contains a potential negative regulatory element (NRE) with an E box, the recognition sequence for the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcription factors. Furthermore, the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) has been implicated as a negative regulator of HIV- 1 expression. Here, we report that the NRE is a composite element and that both C/EBP&#x 3 b 4; and USF can specifically bind to the <b>NRE.</b> The recognition <b>sequence</b> for C/EBP&#x 3 b 4; overlaps with the E box in the NRE of HIV- 1.

40|$|The c-mos {{proto-oncogene}} {{is specifically}} expressed in {{female and male}} germ cells. Previous studies identified a negative regulatory element (NRE) upstream of the c-mos promoter that suppresses c-mos transcription in transfected NIH 3 T 3 cells. In this study, we used gel shift assays to detect proteins in nuclear extracts of NIH 3 T 3 cells that bind to the c-mos NRE in a sequence-specific manner. One protein was found to bind to a region of the NRE which was shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be required for suppression of c-mos transcription. This factor was present in nuclear extracts of several somatic cell lines and tissues but not in male germ cells in which c-mos is transcribed, suggesting {{that it is a}} somatic cell repressor of c-mos transcription. The binding site of the candidate repressor within the c-mos <b>NRE</b> consists of <b>sequences</b> related to putative NREs identified in two other male germ cell-specific genes (encoding protamine 2 and phosphoglycerate kinase 2). The c-mos repressor bound and could be UV cross-linked to these protamine 2 and phosphoglycerate kinase 2 gene sequences as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa. The repressor binding site is also conserved in two other germ cell-specific genes (encoding testis-specific cytochrome c and heat shock-like protein 70), suggesting that the c-mos repressor may be generally involved in suppressing transcription of germ cell-specific genes in somatic cells...|$|R
40|$|The Ku {{autoantigen}} (Ku 70 / 80) is {{a versatile}} DNA binding protein with prominent DNA-end and sequence-specific binding activities. It {{participates in the}} repair of DNA double stranded breaks (DSB) {{as a component of}} the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) apparatus, which also includes DNA-PKcs, XRCC 4 and DNA ligase N. The Ku autoantigen is also integral to V(D) J recombination, a physiological process whereby the diversity of the immune repertoire is generated by the somatic assembly of the variable (V), diversity (D), or joining (J) gene segments in the immunoglobulin (Ig) or T cell receptor (TCR) variable chain gene in lymphocytes. As a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, the Ku autoantigen is also implicated in transcriptional regulation and control of DNA replication. The overall goal of the present research project was to identify novel specific DNA binding sites for the Ku autoantigen and to link DNA sequence-specific binding by the Ku protein to specific cellular functions. The first principal objective was to directly compare DNA binding activities of Ku 70 / 80 to disparate specific DNA <b>sequences,</b> <b>NRE</b> 1 and A 3 / 4, through reciprocal competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and protein-DNA UV-crosslinking studies. The second principal objective was to identify novel classes of Ku 70 / 80 -specific DNA binding sites by the systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) with recombinant human Ku 70 / 80, and investigate the functional implications of the interaction of Ku 70 / 80 with the specific DNA binding sites of interest evolved through SELEX. In the present study, the sequence-specific binding activities of the Ku autoantigen to the negative regulatory element 1 (NRE 1) in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and the A 3 / 4 sequence, a sequence homologous to the various mammalian replication origins (ors), were investigated by reciprocal competitive EMSAs and protein-DNA UV-crosslinking experiments. The results demonstrated that the Ku protein binds to nonspecific DNA ends, NRE 1 and A 3 / 4 with apparently distinct affinities. Furthermore, its two subunits were shown to make differential contacts with nonspecific DNA ends, NRE 1 and A 3 / 4 in the absence or presence of Mg 2 + and ATP. These findings establish A 3 / 4 as a direct sequence-specific DNA binding site for the Ku autoantigen, which is distinct from either NRE 1 or nonspecific DNA ends.
