Romero showed exceptional proficiency as an apprentice. Santos wanted to offer his son the skill of a trade, because in El Salvador studies seldom led to employment.

Smith's performance was reviewed as [...] "undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician" [...] and an [...] "excruciating [...] nightmare".

[...] Producer Jeremy Bolt also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film, that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility. [...] In June 2008, Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film. In December 2008, Anderson stated that he was working on the script.

500|$|Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel {{were thrilled}} by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has [...] "freshened {{the whole place}} up." [...] In comparison, David was {{initially}} hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David [...] "has {{a soft spot for}} Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she never had that sort of affection when she was growing up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should <b>not</b> <b>surprise</b> him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E
500|$|The {{first meeting}} of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable Strand {{district}} of London. [...] Catesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with Thomas Wintour and John Wright to kill the King and his government by blowing up [...] "the Parliament House with gunpowder". [...] Wintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby {{to travel to the}} continent to seek help. [...] Wintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain. [...] Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country. [...] Wintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help. [...] Wintour told Fawkes of their plan to [...] "doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England. [...] Wintour's news did <b>not</b> <b>surprise</b> Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that [...] "the deeds would nott answere".|$|E

[...] Alia later noted, [...] "The Soviets' aim was to ensure that Comrade Enver did not speak openly in Moscow, that, at the most, he should restrict himself to general criticisms on a theoretical plane... they brought all-sided pressure to bear on our delegation... even us the official reception for the celebration of November 7 against our delegation for these purposes." [...] On November 5 a 125-page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and [...] "malign the Party of Labour of Albania." [...] Later noting this letter in regards to China, Hoxha wrote that, [...] "They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting, in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties, and to intimidate the Chinese, to compel them to take a moderate stand, if they would not submit. This anti-Chinese material did <b>not</b> <b>surprise</b> us, but it strengthened the conviction {{we had in the}} correctness of the line and the Marxist-Leninist stands of our Party in defence of the Communist Party of China." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did <b>not</b> <b>surprise</b> Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, you {{knew he was going to}} get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Turan cited Ball's lack of {{constraint}} {{when writing}} {{the film as}} the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone. McCarthy said the script was [...] "as fresh and distinctive" [...] as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue [...] "tart" [...] and said the characters—Carolyn excepted—were [...] "deeply drawn". One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked [...] "hoary Freudianism". Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a [...] "wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy". He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with [...] "unexpected nuance". Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense. McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating [...] "ironic counterpoint" [...] to the story. Hentzi concluded that American Beauty was [...] "vital but uneven"; he felt the film's examination of [...] "the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives" [...] was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside [...] "the most enduring literary treatments" [...] of the theme, such as Lolita. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were [...] "hackneyed". McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a [...] "starting point" [...] from which to tell its [...] "subtle and acutely judged tale". Maslin agreed; she said that while it [...] "takes aim at targets that are none too fresh", and that the theme of nonconformity did <b>not</b> <b>surprise,</b> the film had its own [...] "corrosive novelty". Ebert awarded American Beauty four stars out of four, and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex, and surprising, concluding it was [...] "a hell of a picture".|$|E
