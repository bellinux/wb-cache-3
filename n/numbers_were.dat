5|$|One of the Han's {{greatest}} mathematical advancements was the world's {{first use}} of negative numbers. Negative numbers {{first appeared in the}} Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods, where positive <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> represented by red counting rods. Negative <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus around 275 AD, and in the 7th-century AD Bakhshali manuscript of Gandhara, South Asia, but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century AD.|$|E
5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. Ticket {{prices were}} low and passenger <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> significantly below the pre-opening estimates. The lower than expected passenger <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> partly {{the result of}} competition between the UERL's lines {{and those of the}} other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.|$|E
5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, a {{transcendental}} <b>number</b> <b>is</b> a real or complex <b>number</b> that <b>is</b> not algebraic—that is, {{it is not}} a root of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients. The best-known transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> [...] and e. Though only a few {{classes of}} transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> known (in part because it can be extremely difficult to show that a given <b>number</b> <b>is</b> transcendental), transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> not rare. Indeed, almost all real and complex <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> transcendental, since the algebraic <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> countable while the sets of real and complex <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> both uncountable. All real transcendental <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> irrational, since all rational <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> algebraic. The converse is not true: not all irrational <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> transcendental; e.g., the square root of 2 is irrational but not a transcendental <b>number,</b> since it <b>is</b> a solution of the polynomial equation [...] Another irrational <b>number</b> that <b>is</b> not transcendental is the golden ratio, [...] or , since it is a solution of the polynomial equation [...]|$|R

5|$|Although the {{extension}} of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path {{on the east side of}} the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by Lord Parry, the chairman of the Wales Tourist Board. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000passenger journeys made, <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> to decline consistently until the 1990s. Preliminary work on the conversion of Irish Pete for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were put into storage at Pendre.|$|E
5|$|An {{operator}} {{inside the}} machine also had tools {{to assist in}} communicating with the presenter outside.

5|$|The State Bank was {{not sure}} how much it {{actually}} lost from the robbery, but the best estimates were around 341,000 rubles, worth around 3.4million US dollars as of 2008. About 91,000 rubles were in small untraceable bills, with the rest in large 500-ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their serial <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> known to the police.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the entire}} crusader army is {{difficult}} to estimate; various <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian David Nicolle considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000–35,000 crusaders, including 5,000 cavalry. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 infantry and 1,200 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack by {{elements}} of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July. The limited number of anti-tank guns present were exposed and quickly immobilised or forced to withdraw. This left the infantry to be surrounded and large <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> forced to surrender. Some soldiers {{made it to the}} positions of 19th Battalion, but it too became surrounded. By nightfall, the brigade had been overrun. Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact. Of the 20th Battalion, nearly 200 men were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, {{including}} al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics {{for many years in}} the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E
5|$|Dr. William M. Gray of Colorado State University issued {{forecasts}} on May29 and July28 indicating within both forecasts {{the anticipation}} of a below normal hurricane season.

5|$|Exit <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} sequential but {{are assigned}} today by mileage from south to east, the same numbering system {{used by the}} majority of U.S. states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the mileage of Interstate 70 (I-70) east from the Colorado border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in discontinuous exit numbers on I-70.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population <b>numbers</b> <b>were</b> higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E
