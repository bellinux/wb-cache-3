5|$|The {{decline and}} fall of Pedro II of Brazil {{occurred}} {{over the course of}} the 1880s, with the underlying factors accumulating and coming increasingly into focus after 1881.

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the championship, each {{participating}} <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected.

It {{was the second time}} that the <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> qualified for the team event, having previously appeared in 2008. Shaza Abdelrahman and Dalia El-Gebaly, veterans of the 2008 tournament, represented Egypt in the duet, where they placed 24th and last. In the team competition, the nation finished seventh out of eight nations, ranking higher than Australia.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Games in London {{increased}} {{this record}} to 206 nations, even though only 204 NOCs were represented.

5|$|The Marshall Islands are a Micronesian island nation, {{located in}} the western Pacific Ocean midway between Hawaii and Australia. As of 2016 the <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> a {{population}} of approximately 53,000. The islands were under Spain's influence until their annexation by Germany in 1885. Japan occupied the Islands during World War I and formally annexed {{them as part of}} its postwar South Pacific Mandate. The Marshall Islands were placed under United States control in 1944. The islands granted independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.|$|E
5|$|After England {{lost the}} first three Tests (which {{included}} a 46 all out in the second innings of the third Test) {{there was talk of}} another blackwash series. England secured a victory in the fourth Test however, with Stewart’s two centuries and Fraser’s eight wickets being the main contributors to the win. This {{was the first time in}} 59 years that a visiting <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> won at the Kensington Oval. The main highlight of the series was to come in the final Test at Antigua, where Brian Lara broke Sobers' Test world record score of 365 not out, set 36 years earlier, by scoring 375. Lara was congratulated by Sobers, who was present on the ground to see his record broken.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E

25|$|UEFA {{coefficients}} {{were introduced in}} 1980 and, until 1999, they gave {{a greater number of}} berths in UEFA Cup to the more successful <b>nations.</b> Three <b>nations</b> <b>had</b> four places, five <b>nations</b> <b>had</b> three places, thirteen <b>nations</b> <b>had</b> two places, and eleven nations only one place. Since 1999, a similar system has been used for the UEFA Champions League. Before 1980, the entrance criteria of the last Fairs Cup was used.|$|R
5|$|All {{seventeen}} UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited {{and were}} obliged to attend the race. In January 2015, five UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard places into the race by the race organisers– Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) – to complete the 22-team peloton. Among the wildcard teams was , the first African trade team {{to participate in the}} Tour. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton on the first stage consisted of 198 riders. These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately a fifth of the peloton – were French; no other <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> more than 20 riders in the race. Merhawi Kudus and Daniel Teklehaimanot were the first ever Eritrean riders to participate in the Tour.|$|E

5|$|Entering the Olympics, the Australian public {{expected}} Thorpe {{to deliver}} multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's Daily Telegraph posted a front-page spread headlined Invincible. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400m {{on the first}} morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers' odds to 50–1. By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified—the host <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino was within a body length at the 300m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths. This set a new world record of 3min 40.59s. Secret tests {{carried out by the}} Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of human growth hormone. Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist Klete Keller fifteen metres in arrears.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
5|$|Grant won the {{election}} by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an electoral college landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, {{at the age of}} 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was a triumph of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states. Grant was the first president to be elected after the <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South. Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African American voters.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. Although much of the <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying {{to reach an agreement}} under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{wished to}} secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was {{interest}} in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new <b>nation</b> <b>had</b> a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt {{that would have to}} be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.|$|E
