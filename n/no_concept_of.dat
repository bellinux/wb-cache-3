5|$|Calafia meets Radiaro, a Moslem warrior who convinces {{her that}} she should join him in retaking Constantinople from the Christian armies holding it. Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take their ships, weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, though she has <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> {{what it means to}} be Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, as there is no other metal in California. They fill their ships with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} and was acquitted two years later. During the investigation, Jackson's profile was {{examined}} by Stan Katz, a mental health professional, who spent several hours with the accuser as well. According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old. Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> what a Borg was {{prior to}} the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners really had <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E

30|$|Note that Definition  3.2 is {{accurately}} {{suitable for}} any periodic time {{scale in the}} sense of Definition  1.1, which implies that the almost periodic functions investigated in [13, 14, 16 – 18] are just some particular cases of Definition  3.1. In fact, the almost periodic phenomenon reflected by Example  3.1 would be impossible to be studied in the previous literature works because there have been <b>no</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> almost periodic functions under non-translational shifts until now.|$|R
5|$|Unlike westernized instrumentation, {{there is}} no set tuning for kulintang sets {{throughout}} the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set {{due to differences in}} make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Taoism had <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Hell, as {{morality}} {{was seen}} to be a man-made distinction and there was <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> an immaterial soul.

25|$|Most Christian traditions teach {{belief in}} {{life after death}} as a central and {{indispensable}} tenet of their faith. Critics argue that the Christian conception of the afterlife is inconsistent with that described in the Old Testament. George E.

The presumption is that the deceased are inert, lifeless, and engaging in no activity.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1813, {{some of the}} Tejanos who colonized Texas in the Spanish Colonial Period {{established}} a government in Texas that desired independence from Spanish-ruled Mexico. In those days, there was <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> identity as Mexican. Many Mexicans were more loyal to their states/provinces than to their country as a whole, which was a colony of Spain.

25|$|In Indian {{classical}} music and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears {{little resemblance to}} the European mandolin, is usually tuned E–B–E–B. As there is <b>no</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> absolute pitch in Indian {{classical music}}, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C–G–C–G, which corresponds to sa–pa–sa–pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra, dance music popular in Punjabi culture.|$|E

The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct surfaces (or 2-manifolds) classified in low-dimensional topology. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all continuous bijections. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of graph theory that deals with planar graphs, and results such as the four color theorem.|$|E

In 1985, the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru (formerly known as Ayers Rock) to the Pitjantjatjara Aboriginal people. In 1992, the High Court of Australia reversed Justic Blackburn's ruling and handed down its decision in the Mabo Case, declaring the previous legal concept of terra nullius to be invalid and confirming the existence of native title in Australia.|$|E
