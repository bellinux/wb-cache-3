The initiation of {{the transition from the}} liquid state to ice is called nucleation. Substances that facilitate this transition so that it takes place at a relatively high sub-zero temperature are called ice <b>nucleators.</b> Many living organisms produce ice <b>nucleators.</b> In some cases, plausible reasons for their production have been suggested. In bacteria, they could induce frost damage to their hosts, giving the bacteria access to nutrients. In freeze-tolerant animals, {{it has been suggested that}} ice <b>nucleators</b> help to control the ice formation so that it is tolerable to the animal. Such ice <b>nucleators</b> can be called adaptive ice <b>nucleators.</b> There are, however, also examples of ice <b>nucleators</b> in living organisms where the adaptive value is difficult to understand. These ice <b>nucleators</b> might be structures with functions other than facilitating ice formation. These structures might be called incidental ice <b>nucleators...</b>|$|R
40|$|Spindles are self-organized microtubule-based {{structures}} that segregate chromosomes during cell division. The {{mass of the}} spindle {{is controlled by the}} balance between microtubule turnover and nucleation. The mechanisms that control the spatial regulation of microtubule nucleation remain poorly understood. Previous work has found that microtubule <b>nucleators</b> bind to microtubules in the spindle, but it is unclear if this binding regulates the activity of those <b>nucleators.</b> Here we use a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling to investigate this issue. We measure the concentration of tubulin and microtubules in and around the spindle. We found a very sharp decay in microtubules at the spindle interface, which is inconsistent with the activity of microtubule <b>nucleators</b> being independent of their association with microtubules and consistent with a model in which microtubule <b>nucleators</b> are only active when bound to a microtubule. This strongly argues that the activity of microtubule <b>nucleators</b> is greatly enhanced when bound to microtubules. Thus, microtubule <b>nucleators</b> are both localized and activated by the microtubules they generate...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{supercooling}} {{xylem parenchyma}} cells (XPCs) in Katsura tree contain flavonol glycosides with high supercooling-facilitating capability in solutions containing the ice nucleation bacterium (INB) Erwinia ananas, which {{is thought to}} have an important role in deep supercooling of XPCs. The present study, in order to further clarify the roles of these flavonol glycosides in deep supercooling of XPCs, the effects of these supercooling-facilitating (anti-ice nucleating) flavonol glycosides, kaempferol 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside (K 3 Glc), kaempferol 7 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside (K 7 Glc) and Quercetin 3 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside (Q 3 Glc), in buffered Milli-Q water (BMQW) containing different kinds of ice <b>nucleators,</b> including INB Xanthomonas campestris, silver iodide and phloroglucinol, were examined by a droplet freezing assay. The results showed that all of the flavonol glycosides promoted supercooling in all solutions containing different kinds of ice <b>nucleators,</b> although the magnitudes of supercooling capability of each flavonol glycoside changed in solutions containing different kinds of ice <b>nucleators.</b> On the other hand, these flavonol glycosides exhibited complicated nucleating reactions in BMQW, which did not contain identified ice <b>nucleators</b> but contained only unidentified airborne impurities. Q 3 Glc exhibited both supercooling-facilitating and ice nucleating capabilities depending on the concentrations in such water. Both K 3 Glc and K 7 Glc exhibited only ice nucleation capability in such water. It was also shown by an emulsion freezing assay in BMQW that K 3 Glc and Q 3 Glc had no effect on homogeneous ice nucleation temperature, whereas K 7 Glc increased ice nucleation temperature. The results indicated that each flavonol glycoside affected ice nucleation by very complicated and varied reactions.

50|$|The ESCRT-III complex {{differs from}} all other ESCRT {{machinery}} in that it exists only transiently and contains both essential and nonessential components. The essential subunits must assemble in the proper order (Vps20, Snf7, Vps24, then Vps2) for the machinery to function. Nonessential subunits include Vps60, Did2, and Ist1. Vps20 initiates assembly of ESCRT-III by acting as a <b>nucleator</b> of Snf7 polymer assembly. Vps24 then associates with Snf7 to cap the complex and recruit Vps2. Vps2 then brings Vps4 to the complex. All “free” cytosolic forms of each subunit are considered closed. That is, the carboxy-terminal portion of each subunit folds up onto itself in an autoinhibitory manner stabilizing the monomeric subunits. The carboxy-terminus of most ESCRT-III subunits, both essential and nonessential, contain MIMs (MIT (microtubule interacting and transport domain) interacting motif) motifs. These motifs are responsible for binding Vps4 and the AAA-ATPase spastin.|$|E

40|$|SummaryOocytes mature into eggs by {{extruding}} half {{of their}} chromosomes in a small cell termed the polar body. Asymmetric oocyte division is essential for fertility [1], but despite its importance, {{little is known about}} its mechanism. In mammals, the meiotic spindle initially forms close {{to the center of the}} oocyte. Thus, two steps are required for asymmetric meiotic division: first, asymmetric spindle positioning and second, polar body extrusion. Here, we identify Spire 1 and Spire 2 as new key factors in asymmetric division of mouse oocytes. Spire proteins are novel types of actin <b>nucleators</b> that drive nucleation of actin filaments with their four WH 2 actin-binding domains [2 – 6]. We show that Spire 1 and Spire 2 first mediate asymmetric spindle positioning by assembling an actin network that serves as a substrate for spindle movement. Second, they drive polar body extrusion by promoting assembly of the cleavage furrow. Our data suggest that Spire 1 and Spire 2 cooperate with Formin- 2 (Fmn 2) to nucleate actin filaments in mouse oocytes and that both types of <b>nucleators</b> act as a functional unit. This study not only reveals how Spire 1 and Spire 2 drive two critical steps of asymmetric oocyte division, but it also uncovers the first physiological function of Spire-type actin <b>nucleators</b> in vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Elucidation of {{the early}} events in amyloidogenesis is key to {{understanding}} the pathology of, and developing therapies for, amyloid diseases. Critical informants about these early events are amyloid assembly proteins that facilitate the transition from monomer to amyloid fiber. Curli are a functional amyloid whose in vivo polymerization requires a dedicated <b>nucleator</b> protein, CsgB, and an assembly protein, CsgF. Here we demonstrate that without CsgF, curli subunits are released from the cell into the media and are inefficiently polymerized, resulting in fewer and mislocalized curli fibers. CsgF is secreted to the cell surface, where it mediates the cell-association and protease-resistance of the CsgB <b>nucleator,</b> suggesting that CsgF is required for specific localization and/or chaperoning of CsgB for full <b>nucleator</b> activity.

Overall, for the substrates considered, we find that neither the symmetry of the OH patterns nor the similarity between a substrate and ice correlate well with the IN ability. Instead, we find that the OH density and the substrate-water interaction strength are useful descriptors of a material's IN ability.
