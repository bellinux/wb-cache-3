5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region,</b> Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was {{motivated}} by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. Elizabeth brought an entourage of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E

5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E
25|$|Despite the 1920 {{treaty of}} non-aggression, Soviet Russia’s 11th Red Army invaded Georgia on February 11, 1921, and marched on Tbilisi. Almost simultaneously, 9th (Kuban) Army entered Abkhazia on February 19. Supported {{by the local}} pro-Bolshevik guerillas, the Soviet troops took control of most of Abkhazia {{in a series of}} battles from February 23 to March 7, and {{proceeded}} into the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Mingrelia.|$|E
25|$|Another mention, though indirect, {{stems from}} the end of the {{conflict}} between the Jacobites and Maronites. Profiting from the troubles in Jebbet Bsharri (or maybe called upon for help by the Jacobites), the Muslim Muqaddams of the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Ďanniyeh attacked Ehden in 1489 hoping for a quick victory. The inhabitants of Ehden and of the neighbouring villages, including Kfarşghab, despairing of the help of the Muqaddam of Bsharri, ‘Abdel Mon‘em, pushed back the attackers.|$|E

25|$|Once an {{eruption}} occurs, a large CO2 cloud forms above {{the lake and}} expands to the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region.</b> Because CO2 is denser than air, it {{has a tendency to}} sink to the ground while pushing breathable air up. As a result, life forms that need to breathe oxygen suffocate once the CO2 cloud reaches them, as there is very little oxygen in the cloud. The CO2 can make human bodily fluids very acidic, potentially causing CO2 poisoning. As victims gasp for air they actually hurt themselves more by inhaling the CO2 gas.|$|E
25|$|After several staff tours, {{during which}} time he was {{promoted}} to group captain on 1 January 1962, Beetham was appointed Station Commander RAF Khormaksar (in Aden) in November 1963. At the time of his arrival, Khormaksar was the RAF's largest overseas base and markedly overcrowded. That December saw the start of a major attacks against British forces in Aden (the Aden Emergency) and {{over the next two years}} Beetham spent considerable time dealing with the security of his overcrowded station. However the security problems did not prevent the aircraft based at Khormaksar being used on operations in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Radfan.|$|E
25|$|In late August and September 1999, Russia {{mounted a}} massive air {{campaign}} over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan the previous month. On 26 August 1999, Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya. The Russian air strikes {{were reported to}} have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal {{with tens of thousands of}} refugees. On 2 October 1999, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations admitted that 78,000 people have fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them were heading for Ingushetia, where they were arriving at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day.|$|E

500|$|Lycia did not, in {{contrast}} to other Roman provinces, possess a very developed road system. While the north–south traffic was conducted primarily through the few river valleys, the east–west routes led, unlike today, mostly on and along the mountain ridges. This particular road, leading from Limyra over the Alakır Çayı and into the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Pamphylia and Attaleia, must have been of special importance, since the two regions were united in a single province, Lycia et Pamphylia, until the 4thcentury. In comparison to the main arterial roads of the Roman Empire however, the roads of Lycia were, with [...] width, rather modest and confined to pedestrian and pack animal traffic. This is further corroborated {{by the fact that}} no wagon ruts are evident on the paving of the Limyra bridge, nor any traces of a parapet or breastwork.|$|E
500|$|A move to [...] "permanent {{daylight}} saving time" [...] (staying on summer hours all year {{with no time}} shifts) is sometimes advocated, and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Chile, Iceland, Singapore, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Turkey. It could {{be a result of}} following the timezone of <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region,</b> political will or other causes. Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts. However, many remain unconvinced of the benefits, citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails. Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter, so the country switched permanently back to [...] "standard" [...] or [...] "winter" [...] time in 2014. The United Kingdom also experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971, and put clocks forward by an extra hour during World War II.|$|E

By the mid 1500s, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada. Canada became the name of a colony in New France that stretched along the St. Lawrence River. [...] The terms [...] "Canada" [...] and [...] "New France" [...] were often used interchangeably during the colonial period.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the tents}} were banned, the Muscovite architects had {{to replace them}} with {{successive}} rows of corbel arches (kokoshniki), and this decorative element {{was to become a}} hallmark of 17th-century Moscow flamboyant style. An early example of the flamboyant style is the Kazan Cathedral on Red Square (1633–36). By the end of the century, more than 100 churches in the fiery style were erected in Moscow, and perhaps as many again in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region.</b> Among the more splendid examples are the Moscow churches of the Holy Trinity at Nikitniki (1653), St Nicholas at Khamovniki (1682), and Holy Trinity at Ostankino (1692). Probably the most representative flamboyant-style structure was the Church of St Nicholas (the [...] "Grand Cross") in the Kitai-gorod, brutally destroyed at Stalin's behest.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{previous}} scholars had {{defended the}} birth of Michael in Tudela in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but never with the theory of [...] "Servetus" [...] being a pseudonym. The established academic consensus on {{the matter is that}} he was born in Villanueva de Sijena, in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>region</b> of Aragon, as Servetus himself claimed in his early works and during the whole trial at Geneva; but with no documents, as stated in the judgement that ultimately led him to his death at the stake. Scholarly debate may be tarnished by local and regional interests, because González and some other scholars claim that the true reason behind the non-acceptance of these new works by several institutions studying Servetus has to do more with his line of research on the identity of Michael, and his consequent different birthplace, which would be highly inconvenient for these institutions, with many trustees and members from Villanueva de Sijena, or even located there. González (Aragonese, born in Zaragoza, where he stayed until he obtained his baccalaureate) lives and works in Tudela, where he claims that [...] "De Villanueva" [...] was actually born, and his research on the 10 new works by Servetus has been {{supported by a grant from}} the Health Department of the regional government of Navarre, but even while he was still defending his birthplace in Aragon, for he had not done any research on his identity. In a similar way events on this issue organized in Villanueva de Sijena and in Zaragoza have been supported by the regional government of Aragon.|$|E
