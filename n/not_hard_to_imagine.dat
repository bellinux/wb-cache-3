This isn't your assembly-line teen horror thriller". Additionally, he complimented Fox as [...] " [...] through" [...] in her portrayal and [...] "play the role straight". He gave the film {{three out of four}} stars. [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone stated it is [...] "Hot! Hot! Hot!" [...] and that [...] "Director Karyn Kusama is torn between duty to female empowerment and slasher convention". He credited Fox's portrayal as showing [...] "a comic flair" [...] that Transformers [...] "never investigated". Tom Charity of CNN said [...] " [...] last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was Twilight, which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller" [...] and [...] "Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> she can have anyone who takes her fancy". Charity credited the dialogue as [...] "bitingly smart, funny teen-speak ...along with sharp pop culture references".|$|E

It was {{inspired}} by meeting fellow travellers at various roadhouses throughout Australia [...] "when you are that strung out and tired, there is an unspoken camaraderie with those with whom you share the night and the distance. You might not speak {{but there is a}} kinship. It's <b>not</b> too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> their story". He toured eastern Australia in support of the album during May to June 2008.

2500|$|.....People have entertained {{themselves}} with spooky stories for centuries". It is <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> cavemen {{sitting around a}} fire telling stories of demons, spirits, beasts and their deities. The tradition {{of this type of}} storytelling can certainly {{be traced back to the}} ancient Greeks and beyond. However, the creation of an actual haunted attraction is a relatively recent phenomenon. According to one source, the first recorded purpose-built haunted attraction was the Orton and Spooner Ghost House, which opened in 1915 in Liphook, England. This attraction actually most closely resembles a carnival fun house, powered by steam. The House still exists, in the Hollycombe Steam Collection.|$|E
2500|$|John Hick {{used the}} term [...] "soul-making" [...] in his theodicy Evil and the God of Love to {{describe}} the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem that it is <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed {{in such a way}} as to remove reasonable non-belief, then [...] "any desire that we might have to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed." ...|$|E

[...] In this painting, Louis XIII, represented as an adult, is depicted as Apollo. The hydra's death is not at the hand of Apollo as might be expected. Instead it is left to an Amazon-like vision of Providence/Fate. [...] With the removal of the scales she carried in an earlier sketch that would have connected her to Louis XII, we are left with an entity who with no help from Louis, slays the adversary as he appears oblivious and unconcerned. [...] Marie de’ Medici however, emerges as a loving mother, ready to forgive all evils and pain endured.|$|E

30|$|Also {{important}} are the insights from a related literature that considers {{the interactions between}} preference heterogeneity and incentive contracts (see Dohmen 2014 for a review). In particular, workers sort themselves into alternative compensation schemes partially {{on the basis of}} their economic preferences, and these choices have important implications not only for workers themselves but also for aggregate workforce composition. It is an open question whether a similar sorting occurs with respect to workers’ perceptions of control. Locus of control is associated with occupational sorting, for example, but it is unclear whether this is the result of firms using locus of control as a screening device in their hiring decisions or workers taking compensation arrangements into account when choosing occupations. It is <b>not</b> that <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> for example, that individuals with an internal locus of control might be more inclined to choose steeper compensation schedules which heavily reward their own effort – as they might if they were aware of their own self-control issues.|$|R
2500|$|The wings {{themselves}} are sometimes {{said to be}} highly modified (tracheal) gills. And {{there is no doubt}} that the tracheal gills of the mayfly nymph in many species look like wings. By comparing a well-developed pair of gill blades in the naiads and a reduced pair of hind wings on the adults, it is <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that the mayfly gills (tergaliae) and insect wings have a common origin, and newer research also supports this. [...] The tergaliae are not found in any other order of insects, and they have evolved in different directions with time. In some nymphs/naiads the most anterior pair has become sclerotized and works as a gill cover for the rest of the gills. Others can form a large sucker, be used for swimming or modified into other shapes. But it doesn't have to mean that these structures were originally gills. It could also mean that the tergaliae evolved from the same structures which gave rise to the wings, and that flying insects evolved from a wingless terrestrial species with pairs of plates on its body segments: three on the thorax and nine on the abdomen (mayfly nymphs with nine pairs of tergaliae on the abdomen exist, but so far no living or extinct insects with plates on the last two segments have been found). If these were primary gills, it would be a mystery why they should have waited so long to be modified when we see the different modifications in modern mayfly nymphs.|$|E
2500|$|With 2002's Scrisori din Washington, Tismăneanu {{constructs}} {{a retrospective}} {{overview of the}} 20th century, which he sees as dominated by the supremacy of communism and fascism. Structured around reviewed Deutsche Welle broadcasts, it also includes short texts on diverse subjects, such as essays about Marxist resistance to established communism, {{an analysis of the}} Western far right, conclusions about the Kosovo War, a debate around the political ideas of interwar novelist Panait Istrati, and praises of the Romanian intellectuals Virgil Ierunca and Dan Pavel. Mircea Iorgulescu criticizes the work for not discussing other relevant phenomena (such as the successes of feminism, decolonization and the environmental movement), and argues that many of the pieces seem American-centered, unfocused or outdated. Iorgulescu also objects to the book's verdict on Istrati's political choices after his split with communism, claiming that Tismăneanu is wrong in assuming that Istrati eventually moved to the far right. He nevertheless argues: [...] " [...] provides an impressive image of the extraordinary American effort to research, analyze and interpret communism and post-communism." [...] Iorgulescu, who views Tismăneanu as a Romanian equivalent to Michnik, adds: [...] "The circumstance of his living in the United States [...] protects him, for it is <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how one would have viewed and behaved toward a Romanian from Romania who has the courage to speak, for instance, about the existence of an anti-Bolshevik Bolshevism.

40|$|Rutherford {{scattering}} experiment 1 is {{so important}} that it is seldom not mentioned in any introductory modern physics course. For those non-calculus classes, it would be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discuss many details, such as the derivation of the differential cross section, about it. Even so, some quantitative discussion on how the scattering angle depends on the impact parameter, based on the classical Coulomb model, will give students a better physical picture. The more complete approach that derive the hyperbolic trajectory by solving the New-ton’s second law, using differential equations 2, is obviously not suitable for this purpose. The derivation using the impulse-momentum relation 3, 4, without knowing the exact form of the trajectory, is neat, but still require integration. This may be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> teach to a non-calculus class. The method that Rutherford himself and others used 1, 4 is indeed non-calculus. It assumes the trajectory to be a branch of a hyperbola. Students should <b>not</b> be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that the trajectory is hyperbola-like, because of the scattering {{nature of the problem}} and that the forces between the particles is repulsive. However, this method also assumes the heavy nucleus to be at the outer focus of the hyperbola. This is not so easy to understand...|$|R
500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} album's concept, and for being more humorous than the band's preceding albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said: [...] "In {{an era when}} heavy rockers {{have no idea what}} happened in the '80s, much less the '30s, it's <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> warm to this, even if his music isn't your own personal bag." [...] Barry McCallum of Independent Online called the album [...] "reckless and uninhibited—but it's <b>not</b> all that <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> Manson letting go; he's had fun here." [...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it might be one of the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice." [...] Entertainment.ie called it an entertaining pop album, and summarized that [...] "the pop world would be a much more boring place without —and that's what really counts." ...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{features}} {{differ in}} how mentally tranformable they are. A robin that does <b>not</b> eat is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> than a robin {{that does not}} chirp. We argue that features are immutable {{to the extent that}} they are central in a network of dependency relations. The immutability of a feature reflects how much the internal structure of a concept depends on that feature; i. e., how much the feature contributes to the concept's coherence. Complementarily, mutability reflects the aspects in which a concept is flexible. We show that features can be reliably ordered according to their mutability using tasks that require people to conceive of objects missing a feature, and that mutability (conceptual centrality) can be distinguished from category centrality and from diagnosticity and salience. We test a model of mutability based on asymmetric, unlabeled, pairwise dependency relations. With no free parameters, the model provides reasonable fits to data. Qualitative tests of the model show that mutability judgments are unaffected by the type of dependency relation and that dependency structure influences judgments of variability...|$|R

Tonight it was more {{pleasant}} than ever, and when darkness fully settled down it was even thrilling. We talked about bears.

When the wind came up and moaned through the trees it was <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> we were out in the wilderness. This had been a favorite game for Hal and me; only tonight there seemed some reality about it.

But our slumbers were broken. Hal often had nightmares even on ordinary nights, and on this one he moaned so much and thrashed about the tent so desperately that I knew the lions were after him.|$|E

Can’t you see it? 2 : Just watch now. I turn the top stick, little by little. The top and bottom spaces get smaller, the side spaces get bigger. 1 : All right. 2 : What if I stop now?
