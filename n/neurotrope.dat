[...] Scientists from that institute started a company called <b>Neurotrope,</b> and launched another clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease, preliminary results of which were released in 2017.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{taxonomy}} of Ochroconis (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina, Venturiales, Sympoventuriaceae) has been revised with {{the recognition of}} an additional genus, Verruconis. Ochroconis comprises mesophilic saprobes that occasionally infect vertebrates which mostly are cold-blooded, while Verruconis contains thermophilic species which is a <b>neurotrope</b> in humans and birds. On the basis of molecular data {{it is noted that}} only a single Ochroconis species regularly infects immunocompetent human hosts. Here we report a subcutaneous infection due to Ochroconis mirabilis in a 50 -year-old immunocompetent female patient. In vitro antifungal susceptibility tests revealed that terbinafine was the most effective drug. The patient was successfully cured with oral administration of terbinafine 250  mg daily in combination with 3 times of topical ALA-photodynamic therapy for 9 months...|$|E
40|$|In {{the monkey}} (M. mulatto) the virus of pseudorabies, pantropic in the rabbit, behaves as a strict <b>neurotrope.</b> Infection, usually fatal, readily follows {{intracerebral}} and intracisternal inoculation of rabbit virus, and often intrasciatic inoculation; the symptomatology of the ensuing disease is described. In {{a limited number}} of experiments no infection resulted from intradermal, intramuscular or intravenous inoculation. Nerve and glial cells are primarily attacked by the virus, but no cytological or other evidence of susceptibility of non-nervous tissue or of growth of virus outside the nervous system was obtained. Certain cortical areas, of which the principal are the pyriform area, cornu Ammonis, island of Reil, lower lip of the Sylvian fissure and basal surface of the frontal lobe, are affected far more severely than are other parts of the nervous axis; the reasons for this elective distribution of the most severe lesions, seen alike after intracerebral and intrasciatic inoculation and analogous perhaps to that in poliomyelitis and louping-ill, are not obvious. Other areas of the nervous system are relatively insusceptible to the action of the virus. Cases showing clinically only a febrile reaction without definite nervous symptoms may later exhibit marked residual lesions at the sites of election. The blood and cerebrospinal fluid play no apparent rôle in disseminating the virus, which, after intrasciatic inoculation, spreads upwards by the nervous path. Some suggestion was received from the experiments that in monkeys possessed of immunity to B virus (Sabin and Wright, 1934) pseudorabic infection is less likely to prove fatal than in animals not so immune, but the observations made were insufficiently numerous to be of statistical value. The sera of 6 out of 26 monkeys were found to contain antibodies neutralising B virus; these 6 monkeys were all included in one batch of 7 received at one time from the dealer...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} report (1) the profound modifications in the pathogenic {{properties of the}} West Nile virus brought about through in vitro cultivation were described: in brief, the virus, with continued passage in culture media, eventually lost its capacity to produce fatal infections in mice and in hamsters on peripheral inoculation, although its virulence by the cerebral route was retained essentially unchanged. The inability of such a variant to invade {{the central nervous system}} from the periphery has obvious implications in the broad field of immunization a~ainst the neurotropic viruses, and the possibility that similar variants of other <b>neurotropes</b> might be produced by in vitro cultivation was investigated. This paper describes the results obtained thus far with the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus. Material and Methods Virus Stragn. [...] The V- 1938 strain (2, 3), employed in previous studies (4, 3) in this laboratory and found to be readily cuitivable in Maitland type media (6), was used...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (Hurst, 1933) the histology of pseudorabies in the rabbit has been considered. While clearly possessed of neurotropic affinities, in this animal the virus does not behave as a strict <b>neurotrope,</b> but produces intranuclear inclusions in cells derived from any embryonic layer. It is interesting now to compare, from the experimental standpoint, {{the manner of}} spread of this virus {{with that of the}} more purely neurotropic viruses (poliomyelitis, rabies, Borna). Technique The incubation periods in four rabbits inoculated subcutaneously with 1 co. of the supernatant fluid from a 10 per cent unglycerinated brain suspension lasted 51, 52, 54 and 57 hours respectively. With amounts of suspension near the minimal infecting dose, or with very old glycerinated material, the incubation period may be 8 days or longer. In all the passage experiments listed in the following tables fresh material was employed, and a long incubation period was taken as indicating the presence of a minimal amount of virus; except where otherwise stated 1 co. of a 10 per cent suspension constituted the test dose. The minimal infecting dose of the Iowa strain of virus was determined for rabbits by Shope (1933) to be not greater than 0. 01 rag. wet brain for intracerebral inoculation, and 0. 1 nag. for subcutaneous inoculation. Recent tests indicate that the latter dose lies between 0. 1 and 0. 01 mg., and is often nearer the second figure. Where exact amounts of virus are mentioned in the ensuing experiments the inoculum was titrated for potency at the time of use and the quantities are stated in terms of the minimal dose for subcutaneous inoculation. Dr. M. H. Merrill has found the minimal subcutaneous infecting dose of the Aujeszky virus employed to lie between 0. 05 and 0. 025 nag. wet brain...|$|E
