5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the sand}} devil {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4–25 pups in spring or early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt to bite if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E

5000|$|They are {{viviparous}} fishes, {{in which}} the embryo is <b>nourished</b> directly <b>by</b> the mother, {{as well as the}} yolk. This gives the family its scientific name, from Greek embios meaning [...] "persistent" [...] and tokos meaning [...] "birth".|$|R
5|$|Presently {{the only}} major streams {{entering}} the basin come from mountains {{to the west and}} northwest, but during the Pleistocene they likely transported more water. When lower sea levels entrenched a more southerly course of the Colorado River, Lake Cahuilla may have been <b>nourished</b> solely <b>by</b> local runoff during the Wisconsin glaciation.|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{porcupine}} ray consists {{mainly of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes, which it digs {{up from the}} sea floor. It is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The porcupine ray has long been valued for its rough and durable skin, which {{was made into a}} shagreen leather once used for various utilitarian and ornamental purposes, such as to cover sword hilts and shields. It is caught incidentally by coastal fisheries. Because it must be handled carefully due to its thorns, its commercial significance is limited. Unregulated fishing has led to this species declining in many parts of its range, and thus has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
40|$|A {{reconnaissance}} of {{the land}} forms and Quaternary sediments of the uppermost Gordon River Valley and adjacent Guelph River Valley indicates {{that at least two}} and probably three glaciations are represented. The most striking landforms produced by glacial erosion of the King William Range appear to date from glaciations that predate those recorded during this survey. When the ice cover was most extensive, the Gordon Glacier was <b>nourished</b> partly <b>by</b> diffluent ice from the Derwent and Guelph Valleys, but during the late Last Glacial Stage the Gordon Glacier was <b>nourished</b> primarily <b>by</b> local sources. The glacial sediments as far as 11 km from the head of the Gordon Valley are weathered to only a moderate extent and appear much younger than the heavily weathered drifts that define the maximum glacier limits in almost all other Tasmanian valleys studied previously. This suggests that the tills identified to date in the Gordon Valley are not likely to represent the maximum down-valley extent of the Gordon Glacier. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E
5|$|For {{attack and}} defense, the common torpedo can deliver a strong {{electric}} shock {{of up to}} 200 volts. It is a solitary, nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn, after a gestation period of 4–8 months; the specifics vary between geographical regions. The common torpedo's shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans. Its electrogenic properties led it {{to be used in}} medicine by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In modern times, it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and pending more data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E

5|$|Gregarious in nature, {{the pink}} whipray {{has been known}} to form large active and resting aggregations, and {{associate}} with other large ray species. It preys mainly on prawns, but also consumes other benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Across much of its range, substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of fishing gear and marketed for meat, skin, and cartilage. It is also of importance to ecotourism, being attracted to visitors with bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas, such as northern Australia. However, its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure, and there it has been assessed as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Atlantic torpedo {{is capable}} of {{generating}} up to 220volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend itself against predators. Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes, though it also feeds on small sharks and crustaceans. It is an aplacental viviparous species, wherein the developing embryos are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year. The electric shock of this species can be quite severe and painful, {{though it is not}} fatal. Because of its electrogenic properties, the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon. Prior to the 19th century, its liver oil was used as lamp fuel, but it is no longer of any economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers, but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} prey of {{the common}} stingray are bottom-dwelling crustaceans, though it also takes molluscs, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear 4–9 young twice per year in shallow water, after a gestation period of four months. The common stingray can inflict a painful, though rarely life-threatening, wound with its venomous tail spine. During classical antiquity, its sting was ascribed many mythical properties. This species is not sought after by commercial fisheries, but is taken in large numbers as bycatch and utilized for food, fishmeal, and liver oil. Its population is apparently dwindling across its range, though there is not yet sufficient data for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

40|$|Maebama beach has {{extremely}} been eroding by Tropical Typhoon waves since 1994. Some people say, {{without any}} scientific evidence, the erosion {{is due to}} some effect {{of the construction of}} KURIMA bridge. There are no data of waves and currents. But, there are much data of Typhoons, passed near Okinawa Islands, and the profile of the beach. Analyzing the available data and the photographs of the beach, it become clear that the beach has been <b>nourishing</b> <b>by</b> wind waves and swell from Typhoons. Wind waves incoming to the beach are caused by seasonal wind blown from the north sea of the Island. The courses of the Typhoons passed near MIYAKO Island are classified in two patterns. One of them corresponds to the course of Typhoons passed through the south western sea of the Island, and the other is the course of Typhoons passed through the north eastern sea of the Island. Few Typhoon, passed the north eastern sea of the Island, has been occurred for two years in last twenty years. The swell from the Tyhoon passing the Island has been acting to the sands on the beach to transport to the north side. This seems to be the main reason of the erosion of MAEBAMA beach...|$|R
5|$|The {{sluggish}} and nocturnal coffin ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats, {{where it}} can bury itself during daytime. It can produce a powerful electric shock reaching 200 volts for attack and defense. This species is a voracious predator that feeds mainly on benthic bony fishes, often tackling fish approaching or exceeding itself in size. On occasion, it may also consume invertebrates and even small penguins and rats. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> yolk and maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). The female gives birth to 4–8 pups during summer. The coffin ray can deliver a severe, albeit non-fatal, shock to a human. Not valued commercially, it is very hardy and can usually survive being captured and discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as its population does not seem threatened by human activity.|$|E
5|$|When {{searching for}} food, diamond {{stingrays}} may form groups {{of up to}} hundreds of individuals. It is most active at night and preys mainly on burrowing invertebrates and small bony fishes, which are extracted from the bottom via suction or digging. This species is aplacental viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply, they are <b>nourished</b> <b>by</b> histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear 14 pups every summer in estuaries; mating {{is followed by a}} ten-month period of either sperm storage or arrested embryonic development, after which the embryos rapidly mature over 23 months. The slowest-growing stingray known, this species is not resilient against fishing pressure. It is caught for food by artisanal fishers in Latin America, particularly in Mexico where {{it is one of the}} most economically important rays. This has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in Mexico by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the species as a whole is listed as Data Deficient. Though innocuous towards humans, the diamond stingray's long, venomous tail spine is potentially dangerous.|$|E
