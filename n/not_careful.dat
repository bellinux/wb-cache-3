5|$|The grenade {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was <b>not</b> <b>careful</b> after freeing the grenade from its casing, it could easily stick to his uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to the grenade going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades.|$|E

25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are <b>not</b> <b>careful,</b> they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in a place you never thought you'd be, doing things you never thought you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're going down. There's too much going against us. If we're <b>not</b> <b>careful,</b> we're going to crash and burn".|$|E
500|$|Opening track [...] "Against Privacy" [...] was {{described}} by Willett as a [...] "bohemian manifesto" [...] made by a person with an affinity {{for the arts and}} wanting to live on an art commune. [...] "Mexican Dogs" [...] was written by the band during a trip in Mexico City where they saw a pack of unnamed three-legged dogs running wild across the field. Maust said that he saw it as a metaphor for how the band operates as a whole, in their conduction of both art and business, and how their song craft is [...] "very community oriented and very democratic." [...] The overall sound of the track is reminiscent of boogie rock. The track [...] "Every Valley Is Not a Lake" [...] was a song that was left off Robbers & Cowards. It tells the story about a mother lecturing her daughter about going wild {{in the world and the}} consequences she may face if <b>not</b> <b>careful.</b> The song utilizes jazz piano for its melodies. [...] "Something Is Not Right with Me" [...] is an upbeat track about a person losing touch with the revolving world and its constant changes from people to technology. Critics described the song as having [...] "Stones-styled bluesy licks" [...] and [...] "Lodger-era Bowie rhythms." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 14 November 2008, in an {{intervention}} {{described by the}} BBC's Nick Robinson as [...] "pretty extraordinary", Osborne publicly warned that the more the government borrows, the less attractive sterling becomes to hold. He said: [...] "We are in danger, {{if the government is}} <b>not</b> <b>careful,</b> of having a proper sterling collapse, a run on the pound." [...] Labelling Gordon Brown's tactic a [...] "scorched-earth policy" [...] that a future Conservative government would have to clear up, Osborne continued: [...] "His view is he probably won't win the next election.

2500|$|The first {{documented}} {{mention of}} Sangiovese {{was in the}} 1590 writings of Giovanvettorio Soderini (also known under the pen name of Ciriegiulo). Identifying the grape as [...] "Sangiogheto" [...] Soderini notes that in Tuscany the grape makes very good wine but if the winemaker is <b>not</b> <b>careful,</b> it risks turning into vinegar. While there is no conclusive proof that Sangiogheto is Sangiovese, most wine historians generally consider {{this to be the}} first historical mention of the grape. Regardless, it would not be until the 18th century that Sangiovese would gain widespread attention throughout Tuscany, being with Malvasia and Trebbiano the most widely planted grapes in the region.|$|E

5000|$|The {{characters}} {{appearing in}} the cycle are essentially gods from the pre-Christian pagan past in Ireland. Commentators exercising caution, however, qualify them as representing only [...] "godlike" [...] beings, and not gods. This is because the Christian scribes who composed the writings were generally (though <b>not</b> always) <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> {{to refer to the}} Tuatha Dé Danann and other beings explicitly as deities. The disguises are thinly veiled nonetheless, and these writings contain discernible vestiges of early Irish polytheistic cosmology [...]|$|R
2500|$|On September 17, 2007, the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) {{issued a}} report on the attempt by American-inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools. It concludes [...] "If we are <b>not</b> <b>careful,</b> creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe... The war on the theory of {{evolution}} and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy." [...] The Council of Europe firmly rejected creationism.|$|E

[...] It rejects that creationism in any form, including [...] "intelligent design," [...] can be considered scientific (Para. 4), but considers possible its inclusion in religion and cultural classes (Para. 16). The resolution concludes that teaching creationism in school as a scientific theory may threaten civil rights (Paras. 13 and 18). The resolution summarizes itself in Para. 19: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a TV show, President Traian Băsescu {{reacted to}} {{declarations}} of PSD senator, Gabriela Firea, stating: „She better stays {{in her seat}} and would handle {{what happens on the}} estate of her husband. Because she could no longer find him at home, if she is <b>not</b> <b>careful.</b> I understand that in his parish enough bad things happen”. Victor Ponta quickly reacted to these statements by drawing up a penal complaint against President Traian Băsescu. In this complaint, the President is accused of blackmail and threat. European Socialist leader Sergey Stanishev condemned the statements made by Traian Băsescu, claiming that declarations to Gabriela Firea are provocative and inflammatory, and the suggestion that her husband could [...] "disappear" [...] is beyond the limits of decency.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{example of}} the [...] "story within a story" [...] {{technique}} {{can be found in}} the One Thousand and One Nights, which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the Panchatantra of ancient Sanskrit literature. The Nights, however, improved on the Panchatantra in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the Panchatantra, stories are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase [...] "If you're <b>not</b> <b>careful,</b> that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you." [...] In the Nights, this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{a disgruntled}} {{employee}} at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a [...] "half cup") of heavy {{water from the}} primary heat transport loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were <b>not</b> <b>careful</b> to distinguish these points, {{and some of the}} public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.|$|E
