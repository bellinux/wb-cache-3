40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{practical}} range of <b>net</b> power <b>capacity</b> available from conventional and enhanced geothermal wells {{as a function}} of temperature and productivity index. For a temperature range of 100 °C to 190 °C, which is the operating temperature limit of presently available downhole pumps, wells are typically pumped and power is usually generated in a binary-cycle plant, and in rare cases in a flash-cycle or hybrid-cycle plant. In this temperature range, the <b>net</b> MW <b>capacity</b> of a well has an upper limit of about 7. 3 MW, irrespective of how high the well’s productivity index is. This capacity limit cannot be improved unless technology can be improved to allow setting pumps deeper in the well than the current limit of 457 m (1, 500 feet) and pumping at a higher rate than the present limit of about 160 ℓ/s (2, 500 gallons per minute). For resource temperatures greater than 190 °C, wells must be self-flowed, and power is generated from such wells in a flash-cycle or hybrid-cycle plant. In the temperature range of 190 °C to nearly 220 °C a self-flowing well’s <b>net</b> power <b>capacity</b> (irrespective of its productivity index) is less than the maximum of 7. 3 MW for a pumped well. Above 220 °C, the <b>net</b> power <b>capacity</b> of a well increases rapidly with increasing temperature and productivity index, and there is no practical upper limit. The maximum <b>net</b> power <b>capacity</b> available from an EGS well depends on reservoir depth and local temperature gradient; the optimum depth being increasingly shallow for higher temperature gradients. The trend of decrease in the optimum depth with temperature gradient applies whether this optimum is defined in terms of the maximum <b>net</b> MW <b>capacity</b> of a well or the minimum drilling cost per <b>net</b> MW <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

The cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL {{may be a better}} CV risk predictor than HDL concentrations. We hypothesized that HDL's cholesterol efflux capacity is impaired and inversely associated with coronary atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Methods: We measured the <b>net</b> cholesterol efflux <b>capacity</b> of apolipoprotein B depleted serum and coronary artery calcium score in 134 patients with RA and 76 control subjects, frequency-matched for age, race and sex. The relationship between <b>net</b> cholesterol efflux <b>capacity</b> and coronary artery calcium score and other clinical variables of interest was assessed in patients with RA. Results: <b>Net</b> cholesterol efflux <b>capacity</b> was similar among RA (median [IQR]: 34 % removal [28, 41 %]) and control subjects (35 % removal [27 %, 39 %]) (P =  0. 73).
