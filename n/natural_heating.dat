The area consists mainly of the igneous rock basalt, which was used as the primary building material. Basalt also served as a natural insulation which was extremely important in the area. In the cool winter months the basalt blocks would trap the heat from the sun and then radiate that heat throughout the structure, thus acting as a <b>natural</b> <b>heating</b> source.

5000|$|Evidence at Zhoukoudian cave in China {{suggests}} {{control of}} fire {{as early as}} 460,000 to 230,000 BP. Fire in Zhoukoudian {{is suggested by the}} presence of burned bones, burned chipped-stone artifacts, charcoal, ash, and hearths alongside H. erectus fossils in Layer 10, the earliest archaeological horizon at the site. This evidence comes from Locality 1, also known as the Peking Man site, where several bones were found to be uniformly black to grey. The extracts from the bones were determined to be characteristic of burned bone rather than manganese staining. These residues also showed IR spectra for oxides, and a bone that was turquoise was reproduced in the laboratory by heating some of the other bones found in Layer 10. At the site, the same effect might have been due to <b>natural</b> <b>heating,</b> as the effect was produced on white, yellow, and black bones. Layer 10 itself is described as ash with biologically produced silicon, aluminum, iron, and potassium, but wood ash remnants such as siliceous aggregates are missing. Among these are possible hearths [...] "represented by finely laminated silt and clay interbedded with reddish-brown and yellow brown fragments of organic matter, locally mixed with limestone fragments and dark brown finely laminated silt, clay and organic matter." [...] The site itself does not show that fires were made in Zhoukoudian, but the association of blackened bones with quartzite artifacts at least shows that humans did control fire {{at the time of the}} habitation of the Zhoukoudian cave.|$|E

40|$|Space weather impacts {{related to}} {{particle}} precipitations are common and first are impacting Earths upper atmosphere at high latitudes. There trans‐ionospheric radio {{signals from the}} sparsely distributed global navigation satellite system are frequently disturbed. The aim of this presentation is to discuss high latitude ionospheric radio disturbance phenomena seen in GNSS signals caused both by artificial and natural ionospheric heating. Artificial ionospheric heating {{can be obtained by}} induced and controlled electron temperature increase, which leads to localized and temporal disturbances. This can be produced by the EISCAT heating facility. First investigations using a 2 D 3 fluid model were showing that similar to <b>natural</b> <b>heating</b> and ionization, a variation of TEC of the order of some tenth of a TEC Unit can be expected from F‐region artificial heating. The use of artificial HF heating provides the opportunity of conducting a controlled experiment for TEC variation. The result of a controlled input causing an ionospheric response, in terms of plasma density, electron/ion temperature and vertical ion velocity, is measured. Stronger space weather impacts are seen in TEC variations due to <b>natural</b> <b>heating</b> caused by, e. g., the aurora phenomena. During active geomagnetic conditions and aurora displays TEC variations can be derived from the GNSS measurements of the order of several TEC units.

40|$|The {{kindergarten}} through third grade elementary {{school will be}} based on Howard Gardner's seven multiple intelligences and in concept will be similar to Key schools found across the country. Most important to Gardner's theory and central to the innovative Key schools is the importance of a well-rounded education that prepares students for excellence in the community. This theme of community will be found throughout the design of Muncie's Gardner Elementary School. Situated along the White River and near cultural amenities such as Minnetrista and the Cardinal Greenway, the site offers unique interaction. There will be easy access to both local facilities and to on-site amenities. A nature park and agricultural field will be found on-site for the children's education. The school will be site specific, acknowledging the terrain and slopes leading to the White River. It will also be based on an open, transparent plan, reflecting the ideas of community and nature as one. Many spaces will be capable of opening up into one another, creating a plan that is adaptable for different uses. The building itself will "open" onto the site, at times creating a limited barrier between interior and exterior. Spaces may not necessarily be defined by walls, but clear distinctions in use may preside. For example, a commons space may be defined by a terraced seating arrangement, but may be part of a more open corridor. Constructed, the elementary school will take on an educational role in itself– expressing unique characteristics through the use of materials. Exposed materials such as wood and brick will not only reflect a greater sense of transparency between the indoors and outside world, but will also enhance visual, spatial, and textural educational cues with richness in form, texture, and color. Finally, the building will function based on <b>natural</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling proposals. Exterior walls and rooms may serve to naturally heat the building at night, while keep it cool during the day. Incorporating the terrain as a wall or roof may add to <b>natural</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling benefits as well. Heating and cooling equipment will serve only as a back-up system.
