40|$|In the United States, {{the decline}} of summertime daytime peak ozone in the last 20 years has been clearly {{connected}} to reductions in anthropogenic emissions. Yet questions remain on how and through what mechanisms ozone at other times of day have changed over the recent decades.

Interannual climate variability has mainly been associated with the de-trended fluctuation in the US annual daytime ozone over 1990 – 2014, with a much smaller effect on the <b>nighttime</b> <b>ozone.</b> Reductions in anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides have led to substantial growth in the US annual average <b>nighttime</b> <b>ozone</b> due to reduced ozone titration, while the summertime daytime ozone has declined.

40|$|The Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) {{instrument}} {{on board}} the European Space Agency's Envisat satellite measures ozone {{and a few other}} trace gases using the stellar occultation method. Global coverage, good vertical resolution and the self-calibrating measurement method make GOMOS observations a promising data set for building various climatologies. In this paper we present the <b>nighttime</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> distribution measured by GOMOS in 2003. We show monthly latitudinal distributions of the ozone number density and mixing ratio profiles, as well as the seasonal variations of profiles at several latitudes. The stratospheric profiles are compared with the Fortuin-Kelder daytime ozone climatology. Large differences are found in polar areas and they can be shown to be correlated with large increases of NO 2. In the upper stratosphere, <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> from GOMOS are systematically larger than in the Fortuin-Kelder climatology, which {{can be explained by the}} diurnal variation. In the middle and lower stratosphere, GOMOS finds a few percent less ozone than Fortuin-Kelder. In the equatorial area, at heights of around 15 – 22 km, GOMOS finds much less ozone than Fortuin-Kelder. For the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, there has previously been no comprehensive <b>nighttime</b> <b>ozone</b> climatology. GOMOS is one of the first new instruments able to contribute to such a climatology. We concentrate on the characterization of the ozone distribution in this region. The monthly latitudinal and seasonal distributions of ozone profiles in this altitude region are shown. The altitude of the mesospheric ozone peak and the semiannual oscillation of the number density are determined. GOMOS is also able to determine the magnitude of the ozone minimum around 80 km.

The series shows a steady decline in <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in the spring months over the period, and this is consistent with data from an earlier decade that has been published but not re-evaluated. Of exceptional note is the monthly mean for January 1992 which was very significantly reduced from the normal value, and was the lowest so far measured for this month. This winter was also noteworthy for a prolonged period during which a blocking anticyclone dominated the region, and the possibility existed that this was related to the ozone anomaly.

A linear regression analysis of <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> deviation against 100 hPa temperature deviations was used to reduce <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> to those expected in the absence of high pressure. The assumption was made that the normal regression relation was not affected by atmospheric anomalies during the winter. This showed that vertical motions in the stratosphere only accounted for part of the ozone anomaly and that the main cause of the ozone deficit lay either in a reduced stratospheric circulation to which the anticyclone may be related or in chemical effects in the reduced stratospheric temperatures above the high pressure area.

Ozone was monitored at altitudes of 0, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 m from November 23 to 25 in 2005. The potential temperature profiles revealed a stable atmosphere {{during the study}} period, {{largely because of the}} dominance of the high-pressure system and nocturnal radiation cooling close to the surface. The mixing height was low (50 - 300 m), particularly in the late night and early morning. The surface ozone concentrations that were predicted using TAPM (The Air Pollution Model) were high (33. 7 - 119 ppbv) in the daytime (10 : 00 - 16 : 00) and were low (10 - 40 ppbv) at other times; the predictions of which were consistent with the observations. The simulated surface ozone concentrations reveal that costal lands typically had higher ozone concentrations than those inland, because most industrial parks are located in or close to the boundaries of Kaohsiung City. Both measurements and simulations indicate that daytime ozone concentrations decreased quickly with increasing height at altitudes below 300 m; while <b>nighttime</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations were lower at low altitudes (50 to 300 m) than at higher altitudes, partly because of dry deposition and titration of surface ozone by the near-surface nitrogen oxides (NOx) and partly because of the existence of the residual layer above the stable nocturnal boundary layer.

We have found that easterly winds prevail in the lower troposphere but transition to westerly winds at pressure levels lower than 500 hPa. A persistent anticyclone over West Africa at 700 hPa is responsible for strong easterly winds, which causes a net outflow of ozone/ozone precursors from biomass burning in West Africa across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America. The lowest outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and highest precipitation rates are generally found over the central Atlantic, some distance downstream of fires in West Africa making the vertical transport of ozone and ozone precursors less likely and ozone destruction more likely.

The daily total <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in Murmansk for six days before and six days after the REP events are compared. In seven of eight events {{a decrease in the}} total ozone of about 20 DU is observed. In one event of 25 March, 1986, the mean total <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> for six days before the REP is bigger than that for six days after, but this a case of an extremely high ozone increase (144 DU during the six days). However, on days 3 and 4 there was a minimum of about 47 DU with regard to REP days, so this case also con®rms the concept of the ozone decrease after REP. The di€erence between mean <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> for periods six days before and six days after the REPs was found also for 23 points in Arctic on TOMS data. The di€erence was negative only in Murmansk longitudinal sector. Along the meridian of the trace it was negative at high latitudes in both hemispheres and was near zero at low latitudes.

40|$|During the Northern {{hemisphere}} winter season, biomass burning {{is widespread}} in West Africa, yet the total tropospheric column <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> (&lt; 30 DU) {{over much of}} the Tropical Atlantic Ocean (15 &deg; N&ndash; 5 &deg; S) are relatively low. At the same time, the tropospheric column <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in the Southern Tropical Atlantic are higher than those in the Northern Hemisphere (ozone paradox). We examine the causes for low tropospheric column <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> by considering the horizontal and vertical transport of biomass fire emissions in West Africa during November through March, using observed data which characterizes fires, aerosols, horizontal winds, precipitation, lightning and outgoing longwave radiation. We have found that easterly winds prevail in the lower troposphere but transition to westerly winds at pressure levels lower than 500 hPa. A persistent anticyclone over West Africa at 700 hPa is responsible for strong easterly winds, which causes a net outflow of ozone/ozone precursors from biomass burning in West Africa across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America. The lowest outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and highest precipitation rates are generally found over the central Atlantic, some distance downstream of fires in West Africa making the vertical transport of ozone and ozone precursors less likely and ozone destruction more likely. However, lightning over land areas in Central Africa and South America can lead to enhanced ozone levels in the upper troposphere especially over the Southern tropical Atlantic during the Northern Hemisphere winter season...|$|R
