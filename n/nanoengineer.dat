Moreover, such colloidal spheres show versatile encapsulation of various guest molecules including small organic molecules and biomacromolecules. The pH and redox dual-responsiveness facilitates the rapid release of the payload in an acidic and reductant-enriched ambient such as in lysosomes.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} to <b>nanoengineer</b> multi-functional polymer–metal hybrid nanostructures is reported. By using this protocol the hurdles {{of most of}} the current developments concerning covalent and noncovalent attachment of polymers to preformed inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are overcome. The strategy is based on the in situ reduction of metal precursors using the polymeric nanoparticle as a nanoreactor. Gold nanoparticles and poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid), PLGA, are located in the core and shell, respectively. This novel technique enables the production of PLGA NPs smaller than 200 nm that bear either a single encapsulated Au NP or several smaller NPs with tunable sizes and a 100 % loading efficiency. In situ reduction of Au ions inside the polymeric NPs was achieved on demand by using heat to activate the reductive effect of citrate ions. In addition, we show that the loading of the resulting Au NPs inside the PLGA NPs is highly dependent on the surfactant used. Electron microscopy, laser irradiation, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy characterization techniques confirm the location of Au nanoparticles. These promising results indicate that these hybrid nanomaterials could be used in theranostic applications or as contrast agents in dark-field imaging and computed tomograph...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} sociotechnical practices through which nanoengineering is produced {{as a new}} disciplinary and professional site of “innovation {{for the benefit of}} society. ” I argue that innovation constitutes a rationalizing discourse that serves to justify the establishment of a field, department, and major. Additionally, it serves as an organizing logic that constitutes the <b>nanoengineer</b> as an inherently ethical actor, and nanoengineering as a benefactor of a universalized consumer-subject. I contribute an empirically grounded feminist science studies perspective on how material and discursive practices of innovation rationalize, define, and justify a new scientific discipline; how moral and ethical reasoning is figured within technical practices and pedagogies; and how sociocultural, historical, political, and technical imaginaries figure and are themselves refigured in the constitution of nanoengineering. My analysis is based on an ethnography I conducted from 2010 - 2014 of one of the world’s first nanoengineering departments and its new undergraduate nanoengineering major, located at the University of California, San Diego. This included observing most of the undergraduate courses; conducting 85 interviews with faculty, students, and administrators; observing a nanoengineering laboratory; participating in department meetings and events; collaborating with the department to produce a new department newsletter; and analyzing the media used in the department and curriculum. More specifically, my dissertation chapters examine how popular culture is enrolled in the consolidation of a new discipline; how a particular ethos, with a moral stance and value positions, gets taught in the context of technical education; how liberal and neoliberal logics of rational individualism, autonomy, and the invisible hand get worked into the material and discursive practices of self-assembly in the nanoengineering laboratory; how the institutional goal of producing human capital manifests in the undergraduate major in the form of entrepreneurialism; how translational research as a paradigm of innovation becomes the right tool for the job of aligning nanoengineering’s commitments to innovation and utility with the institutional imperative to produce intellectual capital; and how the higher-ed science classroom is an important site for considering the ethics and politics of knowledge production.

40|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{of electronic}} devices demands innovative cooling technologies to dissipate the heat {{over a small}} area. Dropwise condensation, capable of enhancing heat transfer by {{an order of magnitude}} than filmwise condensation, is of great interest for the development of two-phase thermal management systems. Previous research has shown <b>nanoengineered</b> superhydrophobic surfaces are promising to enable sustained dropwise condensation over long duration because these surfaces are usually designed to be Cassie stable and favor the condensate drop departure. However, the air underneath the Cassie drops can act as a barrier to heat transfer and degrade overall heat and mass transfer performance. In this thesis, we aim to investigate the condensation heat transfer on nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces. Experimental and theoretical studies of dropwise condensation were conducted on both nanostructured superhydrophobic and flat hydrophobic copper surfaces. Superhydrophobic copper surfaces with nanoribbon structures using wet chemical oxidation followed by fluorization treatment, which yield a water contact angle of 160 ° and contact angle hysteresis less than 5 °. Condensation experiments in ambient condition and environmental scanning electron microscope condition revealed that long duration dropwise condensation were archived and the condensate drop growth cycle of from nucleation to departure was also relatively long on nanostructured surfaces. The heat flux and heat transfer coefficient of dropwise condensation were measured in an in-house built condensation system. The condensate drop growth and departure were recorded simultaneously using a high-speed camera. Our results show the dropwise condensation heat transfer performance on the <b>nanoengineered</b> superhydrophobic surfaces has a ~ 30 % degradation compared with than flat hydrophobic surfaces due to mixtured droplet morphologies on the <b>nanoengineered</b> superhydrophobic surfaces. Applying a single droplet growth model and population balance droplet distribution model, the experimental results were compared with modeling results. Even though the heat transfer model could predict heat transfer performance on flat hydrophobic surface accurately, it failed to perfectly apply to the <b>nanoengineered</b> superhydrophobic surfaces.

Here {{we report on the}} in vitro and in vivo immunostimulatory capabilities of LbL-assembled disulfide cross-linked poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA(SH)) hydrogel capsules as a delivery strategy for protein and peptide vaccines using robust transgenic mice models and ovalbumin (OVA) as a model vaccine. We demonstrate that OVA protein as well as multiple OVA peptides can be successfully encapsulated within <b>nanoengineered</b> PMA(SH) hydrogel capsules. OVA-containing PMA(SH) capsules are internalized by mouse APCs, resulting in presentation of OVA epitopes and subsequent activation of OVA-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cells in vitro. OVA-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cells are also activated to proliferate in vivo following intravenous vaccination of mice with OVA protein- and OVA peptide-loaded PMA(SH) hydrogel capsules. Furthermore, we show that OVA encapsulated within the PMA(SH) capsules resulted in at least 6 -fold greater proliferation of OVA-specific CD 8 T cells and 70 -fold greater proliferation of OVA-specific CD 4 T cells in vivo compared to the equivalent amount of OVA protein administered alone.

40|$|Nanomaterials and {{nanotechnology}} {{methods have}} been {{an integral part of}} international research over the past decade. Because many traditional water treatment technologies (e. g. membrane filtration, biofouling, scale inhibition, etc.) depend on nanoscale processes, it is reasonable to expect one outcome of nanotechnology research to be better, nano-engineered water treatment approaches. The most immediate, and possibly greatest, impact of nanotechnology on desalination methods will likely be the development of membranes engineered at the near-molecular level. Aquaporin proteins that channel water across cell membranes with very low energy inputs point to the potential for dramatically improved performance. Aquaporin-laced polymer membranes and aquaporin-mimicking carbon nanotubes and metal oxide membranes developed in the lab support this.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>nanoengineered</b> particles, such as polymersomes, liposomes, and polymer capsules, {{has the potential}} to offer significant advances in vaccine and cancer therapy. However, the effectiveness of these carriers {{has the potential to}} be greatly improved if they can be specifically delivered to target cells. We describe a general method for functionalizing <b>nanoengineered</b> polymer capsules with antibodies using click chemistry and investigate their interaction with cancer cells in vitro. The binding efficiency to cells was found to be dependent on both the capsule-to-cell ratio and the density of antibody on the capsule surface. In mixed cell populations, more than 90 % of target cells bound capsules when the capsule-to-target cell ratio was 1 : 1. Strikingly, greater than 50 % of target cells exhibited capsules on the cell surface even when the target cells were present as less than 0. 1 % of the total cell population. Imaging flow cytometry was used to quantify the internalization of the capsules, and the target cells were found to internalize capsules efficiently. However, the role of the antibody in this process was determined to enhance accumulation of capsules on the cell surface rather than promote endocytosis. This represents a significant finding, as this is the first study into the role antibodies play in internalization of such capsules. It also opens up the possibility of targeting these capsules to cancer cells using targeting molecules that do not trigger an endocytic pathway. We envisage that this approach will be generally applicable to the specific targeting of a variety of <b>nanoengineered</b> materials to cells. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

It has been found that the <b>nanoengineered</b> gold layer causes higher confinement of power in silicon, which can be further controlled by suitably adjusting its thickness.
