50|$|Between 1979 and March, 1986, KUHF's format was NPR {{news and}} jazz. In March 1986 local {{commercial}} classical music station KLEF changed its format and donated its 12,000+ disc library {{of music to}} KUHF, {{with the proviso that}} the University of Houston commit KUHF to a format that served Houston's classical music audience, recently disfranchised by the loss of KLEF. The broadcasting of classical music was explained by citing that the charter of KUHF was to provide music unavailable, otherwise, to Houston. KUHF began airing classical music during the day and late night jazz from 10PM to 5AM, with <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> the morning and afternoon drive time hours. During the summer, former KLEF Operations Manager John Proffitt was hired as the new General Manager for KUHF, and he arrived at his new position on August 3. After the next on-air fundraiser in October, which was aimed at NPR, classical and jazz listeners, KUHF eliminated its remaining jazz broadcasting. KUHF GM Proffitt defended eliminating several genres of jazz from Houston radio on the basis that the number of daytime classical listeners far exceeded the overnight number of jazz listeners.|$|E

50|$|WRKF was {{launched}} on January 18, 1980. Initial programming was typical for a community-based {{public radio station}} of that time. It included classical, jazz, folk, big-band standards, and <b>NPR</b> <b>news.</b> Studios were <b>in</b> a temporary building at the transmitter site on Frenchtown Road.

50|$|In September 2004, KOSU {{moved to}} a new 1,100-foot tower near Guthrie that gave it primary {{coverage}} of Oklahoma City. Previously, <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk had gotten spotty reception in much of the area since KCSC went all-classical in 1996. The University of Oklahoma's NPR outlet, KGOU, needed a second full-power station, KROU, to cover a large portion of Oklahoma City, and even then this left much of central Oklahoma without a clear signal for <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> programming until KOSU activated its new tower.|$|R

5000|$|Interlochen Center for the Arts {{acquired}} {{and launched}} sister station WICA in 2000 to feature a news- and talk-oriented format, {{and since that}} time WIAA and its two satellites (WICV and WIAB) have devoted almost all of their broadcast schedule to classical music and have not aired <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> shows such as [...] "Morning Edition" [...] and [...] "All Things Considered", although they do feature hourly <b>news</b> updates from <b>NPR.</b> <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> shows are, however, available over a portion of IPR Music Radio's listening area on CMU Public Radio, and within the coverage areas of the IPR News Radio stations (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Until 2001, the {{stations}} {{were known as}} the [...] "South Carolina Educational Radio Network," [...] airing a mix of classical music and <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk.

Four stations continued to air a mix of classical music and NPR programming, while three aired an expanded schedule of <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk. The eighth station, WNSC-FM in Rock Hill, began airing exclusively jazz music {{in order to avoid}} programming duplication with WFAE in Charlotte.|$|R
