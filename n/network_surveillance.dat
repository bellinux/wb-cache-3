25|$|Onion routing is {{implemented}} by encryption {{in the application}} layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal only the next relay in the circuit in order to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or even knowing, the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single {{point at which the}} communicating peers can be determined through <b>network</b> <b>surveillance</b> that relies upon knowing its source and destination.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular topics of {{discussion}} in regards to Internet privacy is China. The main concern with privacy of Internet users in China is the lack thereof. China has a well known policy of censorship {{when it comes to the}} spread of information through public media channels. Censorship has been prominent in Mainland China since the communist party gained power in China over 60 years ago. With the development of the Internet, however, privacy became more of a problem for the government. The Chinese Government has been accused of actively limiting and editing the information that flows into the country via various media. The Internet poses a particular set of issues for this type of censorship, especially when search engines are involved. Yahoo! for example, encountered a problem after entering China in the mid-2000s. A Chinese journalist, who was also a Yahoo! user, sent private emails using the Yahoo! server regarding the Chinese government. The Chinese staff of Yahoo! intercepted these emails and sent the journalist’s reportedly bad impression of the country to the Chinese government, which in turn sentenced the journalist to ten years in prison. These types of occurrences have been reported numerous times and have been criticized by foreign entities such as the creators of the Tor anonymity network, which was designed to circumvent <b>network</b> <b>surveillance</b> in multiple countries.|$|E

40|$|<b>Networked</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems {{provide an}} {{extended}} perception and distributed reasoning capability in monitored environments {{through the use}} of multiple <b>networked</b> sensors. <b>Surveillance</b> can be defined as continuous monitoring and tracking of multiple targets in a region so that they do not leave the field of view of the sensors observing them and maintain discernable resolution for feature identification. Due to the inherent complexity of large networked systems and the diversity of the sensors used, the first challenge is to design an efficient modeling and analysis tool for <b>networks</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems. The next challenge is to devise stable control algorithms for accomplishing the surveillance task. Current feature (point) based visual servoing and tracking techniques generally employed do not provide an optimal solution for the surveillance task. This paper presents a mutational analysis approach for shapes, and shape based control to model and design surveillance mechanisms for such active surveillance systems. Communication is essential for cooperation and coordination of multiple sensor nodes to effectively perform the surveillance task. Due to the large number and heterogeneity of nodes involved and the large amount of information transfer required, designing effective communication techniques for longevity of operation of such mobile <b>surveillance</b> <b>networks</b> is also a major challenge. This paper presents a discussion of the issues related to networking of large scale mobile <b>surveillance</b> <b>networks.</b> Finally, experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for tracking targets over a large area...|$|R
2500|$|Tor is free {{software}} for enabling anonymous communication. The name {{is derived from}} an acronym for the original software project name [...] "The Onion Router". Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting <b>network</b> <b>surveillance</b> or traffic analysis.

40|$|Advances {{in digital}} signal {{processing}} technology {{make it possible to}} embed the low-level functions performed by a video surveillance system into cameras. The result is metadata cameras, like MPEG- 7 cameras, that provide descriptions of what they see in the form of XML documents served over a network. We use this concept to build video information servers that are conceptually similar to MPEG- 7 cameras, but differ in that they interact with client applications and can be configured dynamically to perform different functions. We demonstrate the use of these video information servers in some simple surveillance applications. Dynamic configuration of the servers allows them to do more than describe video content. For example, we present a functioning surveillance system, built with content description servers, that describes the activity in a hockey game based on the observations of several cameras.
