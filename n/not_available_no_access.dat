40|$|The {{later stages}} in the pathway of {{biosynthesis}} of phycocyanobilin, the chromophore of phycocyanin, were studied by using radiolabelled intermediates. Three possible pathways from biliverdin IX-alpha to phycocyanobilin were considered. 14 C-labelled samples of key intermediates {{in two of the}} pathways, 3 -vinyl- 18 -ethyl biliverdin IX-alpha and 3 -ethyl- 18 -vinyl biliverdin IX-alpha, were synthesized chemically and were administered to cultures of Cyanidium caldarium that were actively synthesizing photosynthetic pigments in the light. Neither of these two compounds was apparently incorporated into the phycobiliprotein chromophore, suggesting that two of the three pathways were not operative. By elimination, the results imply that the third possible pathway, which involves phytochromobilin, the chromophore of phytochrome, represents the route for biosynthesis of phycocyanobilin. Unfortunately, since 14 C-labelled phytochromobilin is <b>not</b> <b>available,</b> <b>no</b> direct proof of this pathway could be obtained.

Also, although size and form correspond with cystozoites of Sarcocystis, the number of cystozoite-like structures observed in the samples investigated was very low, suggesting that no intact cysts were present in the tissue. Sarcocystis are known to be very specific with regard to the choice of the intermediate host, which is restricted to only one species. It is not clear which species could be the natural intermediate host in the temperate climate. It is recommended to further investigate the presence of cysts of Sarcocystis in human muscle tissue...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{portfolios}} comprising high‐ranked corporate social performance (CSP) firms out/underperform portfolios comprised of low‐ranked CSP firms. The authors employed a US sample covering the period 1998 ‐ 2007. Design/methodology/approach – In the context of the Fama and French model augmented by momentum and industry factors, the authors test the significance of the alpha for a CSP difference portfolio, defined as high‐ranked minus low‐ranked CSP stocks. Findings – The results are consistent with the “no‐linkage” hypothesis, which argues that no significant difference in the risk‐adjusted performance is expected between high‐ and low‐ranked CSP‐formed portfolios. Furthermore, little evidence was found that high‐ or low‐ranked CSP‐formed portfolios, irrespective of the portfolio formation type, systematically differ with regard to performance, size, book‐to‐market or momentum factors. Originality/value – The authors employ sustainability CSP rankings that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality factors, in contrast to many prior studies that solely use KLD ratings or just focus on a subarea of CSP. Moreover, the authors' dataset considerably improves upon previous studies employing similar data in which individual company rankings are <b>not</b> <b>available.</b> <b>No</b> Full Tex...|$|R
