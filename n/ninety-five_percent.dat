The objectives of this research included designing, implementing, and evaluating a system for automatically notifying paratransit customers in advance of the upcoming arrival of their ride. The core of the Vehicle Arrival Notification System (VANS) was an algorithm that estimated the time remaining until the vehicle's arrival at future passenger pick-up points, based on GPS-based Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) and the vehicle's scheduled itinerary of stops. A twenty-two (22) day demonstration of the notification system was conducted with Texas A&M University's paratransit service. At the time of the demonstration, there were nine (9) regular users of the service; of these, eight (8) chose to participate in the demonstration and were supplied with personal alphanumeric pagers. Equipment-related problems during the demonstration prevented the AVL-equipped vehicle from transmitting data. In the absence of AVL information, VANS simply sent messages to passengers a few minutes before the scheduled arrival time of their ride. The accuracy of the new system's arrival-time prediction with AVL data was evaluated via computer simulations. The reliability of the page-sending process was between forty-four (44) and sixty-four (64) percent during the demonstration; all but five (5) percent of this unreliability was due to known and preventable causes such as the computer hardware being unplugged. The computer simulations predicted that, in future applications, VANS could predict arrival times accurate to within plus or minus five (5) minutes for at least <b>ninety-five</b> (95) <b>percent</b> of trips. Passengers using the system generally favored future notification programs. The demonstration's effects, if any, on the paratransit agency's operational characteristics were uncertain. The objectives of this research were accomplished, as a viable notification system was designed, implemented, and evaluated. Future studies may involve improving the VANS software, investigating funding alternatives for notification, developing transportation networks tailored to fit paratransit operations, and measuring the benefits and other effects of implementing a notification system, from the perspective of both the paratransit provider and the paratransit customer...|$|R

Indepth interviews were conducted using the questions from Tough's Interview Schedule for Studying Some Basic Characteristics of Learning Projects and a probe sheet to identify obstacles to conducting self-directed learning projects. The interviews focused on the learning activities of older adults during the previous year. The 120 subjects of this study conducted a total of 239 learning projects in the previous year, an average of 1. 99 self-directed learning projects per person. <b>Ninety-five</b> (95 %) <b>percent</b> of the persons interviewed reported to have conducted at least one learning project in the past year.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of vancomycin in hospitals {{has resulted in a}} standard practice to monitor serum vancomycin levels because of possible nephrotoxicity. However, the routine monitoring of vancomycin serum concentration is under criticism and the cost effectiveness of such routine monitoring is in question because frequent monitoring neither results in increase efficacy nor decrease nephrotoxicity. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to determine factors that may place patients at increased risk of developing vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity and for whom monitoring may be most beneficial. ^ From September to December 1992, 752 consecutive in patients at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, were prospectively evaluated for nephrotoxicity in order to describe predictive risk factors for developing vancomycin related nephrotoxicity. <b>Ninety-five</b> patients (13 <b>percent)</b> developed nephrotoxicity. A total of 299 patients (40 percent) were considered monitored (vancomycin serum levels determined during the course of therapy), and 346 patients (46 percent) were receiving concurrent moderate to highly nephrotoxic drugs. ^ Factors that were found to be significantly associated with nephrotoxicity in univariate analysis were: gender, base serum creatinine greater than 1. 5 mg/dl, monitor, leukemia, concurrent moderate to highly nephrotoxic drugs, and APACHE III scores of 40 or more. Significant factors in the univariate analysis were then entered into a stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine independent predictive risk factors for vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. ^ Factors, with their corresponding odds ratios and 95 % confidence limits, selected by stepwise logistic regression analysis to be predictive of vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity were: Concurrent therapy with moderate to highly nephrotoxic drugs (2. 89; 1. 76 - 4. 74), APACHE III scores of 40 or more (1. 98; 1. 16 - 3. 38), and male gender (1. 98; 1. 04 - 2. 71). ^ Subgroup (monitor and non-monitor) analysis showed that male (OR = 1. 87; 95 % CI = 1. 01, 3. 45) and moderate to highly nephrotoxic drugs (OR = 4. 58; 95 % CI = 2. 11, 9. 94) were significant for nephrotoxicity in monitored patients. However, only APACHE III score (OR = 2. 67; 95 % CI = 1. 13, 6. 29) was significant for nephrotoxicity in non-monitored patients. ^ The conclusion drawn from this study is that not every patient receiving vancomycin therapy needs frequent monitoring of vancomycin serum levels. Such routine monitoring may be appropriate in patients with one or more of the identified risk factors and low risk patients do not need to be subjected to the discomfort and added cost of multiple blood sampling. Such prudent selection of patients to monitor may decrease cost to patients and hospital. ...|$|R
