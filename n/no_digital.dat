The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselvesJohn Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.|$|E

5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain <b>no</b> <b>digital</b> circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E

25|$|Developers {{chose to}} use this engine because it {{would allow them to}} enhance the game by adding more {{expansive}} worlds, and less linearity. In May 2008, Ubisoft released two official videos of a concept artist designing the Prince character and Elika. One video shows the Prince character being drawn, while the other details Elika. Yet another fast-forward concept art emerged in July 2008, this time depicting an antagonist: the Hunter.

500|$|Felix Bohatsch of Broken Rules {{reported}} in May 2009 that {{sales of the}} PC version were [...] "not at a level we were expecting". <b>No</b> <b>digital</b> rights management (DRM) protection {{was placed on the}} game because [...] "we ... believe that any game will be cracked, no matter how we try to protect it, so our philosophy is that adding DRM or anything similar only annoys the people who actually pay for it." [...] The bootlegging rate was approximately 95.5%, meaning [...] "for every game [...] there are 22 cracked version [...] being played". Bohatsch speculated that the poor sales were partly caused by the levels demonstrated in the free game demo, which did not focus enough on the game's puzzles. More than 370,000 units of the game were sold as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the launch}} {{was not without}} its {{problems}} when three major supermarkets did not stock copies. On launch day, Sainsbury's said that its tills had not been updated in time {{to enable them to}} sell the paper, but that it would begin doing so from the following day, while Tesco and Morrisons planned to monitor sales before deciding whether or not to stock it. Morrisons also said that it did not have the space to sell the newspaper without doing so at the expense of local titles. On 27 November, The Guardian reported that the distribution issues had been resolved, while STV News suggested the distribution problems were responsible for the fewer number of printed copies {{in the latter part of}} the launch week. Stewart Kirkpatrick, the former digital chief of Yes Scotland noted that The National had <b>no</b> <b>digital</b> presence at the time of its launch, something that prompted him to observe [...] "We're in the age of 'digital first' not 'digital when we get round to it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Turing {{completeness}} of the Chinese room {{implies that}} it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to Stevan Harnad, are [...] "no refutation (but rather an affirmation)" [...] of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that <b>no</b> <b>digital</b> computers can have a mind.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{there were}} <b>no</b> <b>digital</b> video outputs such as DVI or HDMI on the Xbox 360; instead, HD-quality output {{could only be}} {{produced}} over [...] component video (used by both the 3 RCA component cable and the Japanese D-terminal cable) and later [...] VGA (via a software update).

A wide array of SDTV and HDTV resolutions are supported by the console hardware; up to 1080p after the October 2006 software upgrade. While most games are rendered natively at 720p, the video from all games can be scaled by the hardware to whatever resolution the user has set in the console's settings; from 480i NTSC and 576i PAL all the way to 1080p HDTV.|$|E

[...] Another time when asked whether Portman did all the dancing, he replied [...] "Not everything, but a lot of it. That shot, in the opening prologue when she walks off into the light and she’s flapping her wings, and she’s on pointe, that is 100%, untouched, <b>no</b> <b>digital</b> Natalie Portman. When the camera pulls out on her and she’s on top of the ramp and she’s bleeding, and she’s on pointe, right before she jumps—that is Natalie Portman en pointe".|$|E
