Oedipus, to the {{surprise}} of the messenger, is made ecstatic by this news, for it proves one half of the prophecy false, for <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> never kill his father. However, he still fears that he may somehow commit incest with his mother. The messenger, eager to ease Oedipus's mind, tells him not to worry, because Merope was not in fact his real mother.|$|E

2500|$|Edelmann {{states that}} the dichotomies present in the Puranas {{literature}} of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into {{the knowledge of the}} self. Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as [...] "narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves".|$|E

[...] As late as 25 February 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm. As Blair made clear in a statement to the House of Commons, [...] "I detest his regime. But even <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> save it by complying with the UN's demand. Even now, we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cannonball is a mutant who {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} bodily generate thermo-chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through {{the air like a}} rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> fire it from almost any part of his body, {{to a wide variety of}} effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible [...] "blast field" [...] that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2011 and 2014, several events {{occurred}} that created rifts in the party. In 2011, after {{years out of}} the political spotlight, Deri announced an interest in returning to politics. After Aryeh Deri announced his return to politics, and following a series of highly publicised {{events that led to}} an increase in the tensions between the Haredi public and the non-Haredi public, Shas's popularity began to falter according to most polls. As a result, Shas chairman Eli Yishai requested that Aryeh Deri join the party instead of establishing an independent party. Shas spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef offered Aryeh Deri the 3rd position on the party list, but Deri rejected it at first and was believed to want to lead the party, start his own party (which according to polls might win as many as 7 seats), or not participate in the election at all. On 16 October a compromise was reached: Shas would not have a formal chairman, but would instead be jointly led by Deri, Yishai and Housing and Construction Minister Ariel Atias. In May 2013, some months after internal rift following Deri's political comeback, Yishai was ousted and Deri was once again renamed {{as the leader of the}} Shas party. Ovadia Yosef, the Sephardi sage and Shas spiritual leader said regarding his decision to oust Yishai [...] "It was a deposit that he held, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> redeem it." [...] Yosef also said he had told Deri at the time of his imprisonment that the position of party leader would be returned to him. 2013 [...] also marked the death of Ovadia Yosef, the party's spiritual leader.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Ebersol (as Mr. Fix) {{appears in}} , voiced by Donny Lucas. He {{is a genius}} {{inventor}} and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the Maggia. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. In the episode “Whiplash”, Mr. Fix orders Whiplash to kill Pepper Potts’ FBI agent father (who is close to apprehending him); then, Mr. Fix sends Whiplash after Pepper herself. Whiplash fails at both tasks; ultimately, Iron Man defeats him. In the episode “Man and Iron Man”, Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge against Iron Man. He is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In the episode [...] "Don’t Worry, Be Happy", Iron Man suggests that Mr. Fix is trying to eliminate Unicorn and Killer Shrike upon learning that Mr. Fix hired them to perform a robbery, but, unbeknownst to them, equipped them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city. Mr. Fix later returns in the second season under the employ of a shadowy figure and has Whiplash kidnap Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer (who had orchestrated his own kidnapping). After escaping from Iron Man, Mr. Fix learns that his mysterious benefactor was Hammer. Hammer's assistant Sasha then implants a nano-virus into Mr. Fix which Hammer would activate if Mr. Fix threatens him or leaves his services. In the episode [...] "Look Into the Light" [...] Mr. Fix gives Justin Hammer a disk with the information needed to complete Project Titanium. In the episode [...] "Titanium vs. Iron", Mr. Fix completes the Titanium Man armor yet Hammer wants to test drive it. Growing impatient that Mr. Fix had not yet {{found a way to}} properly bond titanium to vibranium following his first outing as Titanium Man, Hammer activates the nano-virus killing his physical body. However, Hammer removed a flash drive with Mr. Fix's consciousness on it from him and places it into a nearby console. Hammer tells Mr. Fix that his consciousness has evolved at the cost of his body and that <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> work on Hammer's other projects 24/7. In the episode [...] "The Hawk and the Spider", Hammer speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the Titanium Man armor. Hammer tells Mr. Fix 2.0 {{to find a way to}} make it work or he will destroy him. In the episode [...] "Hostile Takeover", Mr. Fix 2.0 works on the 'dissection' of Iron Man (whose armor was under lock-down to save enough power upon being knocked down by Titanium Man) even when the Iron Man armor is accidentally recharged during Killer Shrike and Unicorn's fight. When Hammer receives a shock trying to remove the Iron Man helmet, Mr. Fix 2.0 tells Hammer that War Machine is approaching Hammer Multinational. In the episode [...] "The Hammer Falls", Mr. Fix 2.0 creates the Zombie Gas which Hammer tests on Count Nefaria. When Mr. Fix 2.0 is unable to trace the call of an individual who recently started blackmailing Hammer, Hammer threatens him. It is revealed that Mr. Fix 2.0 was responsible for the blackmail and had helped Iron Man expose Hammer as part of his revenge for what Hammer did to him. After Hammer is dropped from his Titanium Man armor, Mr. Fix 2.0 then traps Hammer in a Zombie Gas chamber which results in Iron Man blasting the console Mr. Fix 2.0 is in causing Mr. Fix 2.0 to disintegrate.|$|E
