40|$|This {{technical}} brief is {{the extension}} of our previous work developed by Zhang et al. (2016, "Effects of Process Parameters on White Layer Formation and Morphology in Hard Turning of AISI 52100 Steel," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 138 (7), p. 074502). We investigated the effects of sequential cuts on microstructure alteration in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. Samples undergone five sequential cuts are prepared with different radial feed rates and cutting speeds. Optical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are employed to analyze the microstructures of white layer and bulk materials after sequential cutting processes. Through the studies we first find out the increasing of white layer thickness in the sequential cuts. This trend in sequential cuts does work for different process parameters, belonging to the usually used ones in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. In addition, {{we find that the}} white layer thickness increases with the increasing of cutting speed, as recorded i <b>n</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> To reveal the mechanism of white layer formation, XRD measurements of white layers generated in the sequential cuts are made. As a result retained austenite in white layers is identified, which states that the thermally driven phase transformations dominate the white layer formation, rather than the severe plastic deformation in cuts. Furthermore, retained austenite contents in sequential cuts with different process parameters are discussed. While using a smaller radial feed rate, the greater retained austenite content found in experiments is attributed to the generated compressive surface residual stresses, which possibly restricts the martensitic transformation...|$|E

Both disorders present {{in a similar manner}} and at present there are no clinical signs that distinguish between them. Latrogenesis may occur when psychogenic seizures are treated medically and sometimes aggressively in order to control seizure activity. Quality of life is negatively impacted on in both patient groups and stigmatisation and social isolation frequently occur. Psychiatric comorbidity is associated with both epilepsy and psychogenic seizures. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} explore the possibility of finding a definitive means of discriminating between the two patient groups. This study assessed quality of life and psychiatric dysfunction in both patient groups using the QOLIE- 31 and the SCL- 90 -R instruments, respectively. The Seizure Questionnaire was used to assess qualitative aspects. The sample (n = 19) was made up of 10 females and nine males with a mean age of 30. 6 years (S D = 8. 9, range l 8 - 44 years). One case of mixed seizures was excluded. The sample was taken from an epilepsy monitoring unit in a hospital in Durban, South Africa. On the scales of the SCL- 90 -R, Anxiety showed significant difference between groups and on the QOLIE- 31 scales, Energy/Fatigue, Cognitive Functioning and Overall score showed significant differences.

First, it would combine existing preferential trading arrangements of which NAFTA and MERCOSUR are the two most significant ones. Second, each of the schemes has an undisputed regional leader: the U. S. and Brazil. However, two hegemons do not agree on a common vision for the hemispheric project. Third, the small membership of the two schemes is to be elevated to an area encompassing 34 states, i. e. to a situation of large <b>n.</b> <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> maintains that the provision of a collective good becomes more difficult the larger the number of members party to the scheme.

In the case of the Americas, the solution offered by the literature is the very problem for efforts to integrate the hemisphere. The FTAA negotiations are stalled because the attempt to forge collective action among 34 member states is sought by two countries simultaneously. This thesis suggests that the large n problem of hemispheric integration will be resolved by the hegemon more successful in subdividing the group size and imposing its vision.

We disagree with many of his criticisms. In this reply, we argue that he misinterprets our results and policy implications and that his results are really not much different from ours; in fact, sometimes his results provide stronger support of our hypothesis. Optimal lag length Chowdhury criticizes our estimation procedure which utilizes symmetric lags from two to five periods as arbitrary. We make two points. One, we did not arbitrarily choose a single lag structure but analyzed the causal patterns over a relatively long range (up to five years). In the univariate and multivariate equations estimated by Chowdhury, the lag length which minimizes the Final Prediction Error (FPE) is selected by varying the lag length from 1, [...] ., n (where n = 5 in Chowdhury's paper). However, if the selected lag length equals n or is very close to <b>n,</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> suggests that the search of lag length be extended beyond n in order to determine if the optimal lag is greater than n. In the regressions with local government revenues as the dependent variable, Chowdhury selects a four period lag. However, lag lengths exceeding five peri-ods are 'arbitrarily ' not examined to check if the FPE can be lowered by includ-ing lags greater than five.

Moreover, we suggested that the observed differences in the biological activity and the rate of the autoxidation reactions of the four pentoses are due to their configurational difference, since the order [(3) > (2) > (4) > (1) ] is the same both in rhe activity and in the reaction rate, and the similar effect of configuration on the rate of the oxidation reaction and enolization of aldopentoses was reportedi <b>n</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> Aldohexoses are in general less reactive than aldopentoses in oxidations (e. g [...] halogen oxidation of free sugars) and have been reported to exhibit very weak nucleic acid-cleaving activity.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{presentation}} of some suggestions for development of a class of interplanetary and heliospheric lightsails that are very simple, very light, and, therefore, very fast. The suggestions are combinations of concepts put forth by Dyson, Forward, Drexler, Burke, Cotter, Colombo and others. It is suggested that the construction and deployment of sails with lightness number 10 is easily within the capability of our technology. Such craft could reach distances of 100 au within about four years. The problems, then, are how to communicate with the craft and how to attach to them any substantial amount of payload. Suggestions for distribution of payloads on the surfaces of the sails are put forward, and a workable scheme is offered for a deep-space retro-reflector, long the dream of Professor Colombo, that could make use of the Sun as a source of signal. The retro-reflector could facilitate the preliminary study of the density of the interstellar medium beyond the heliopause, within a few decades. Discussion One of the myths that has accompanied the paper development of the solar sail i <b>n</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> is that they are very slow, suitable only for very long trips to carry non-perishable supplies and equipment. There is a good reason for this myth. The value of scientific or life-support spacecraft is normally measured in the mass required to acquire certain traditional measurements, typically video images, or to support life for a given amount of time. Therefore, when analysts in the past have put forth designs for solar sailing spacecraft, the designs have been very heavily loaded with traditional instruments and power systems. For these designs, the characteristic accelerations of the spacecraft have been very low so as to trade time for payload. In this paper, it is pointed out that solar sails need not be slow. Indeed, they can be designed to provide incredibly fast transfers for small payloads. Followin...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY — Technical aspects and {{anatomical}} difficulties {{involved in}} the management of this entity and the risks associated give giant aneurysms a special place in the treatment of aneurysms as a whole. The direct attack needs careful planning and the right choice of instruments, especially clips. In spite of the progress in recent years, the rate of mortality is still very high. The indirect approach requires in many cases the occlusion of a major cerebral vessel, which in some cases could result in cerebral ischemia. However, by means of extra-intracranial by-pass operation this risk could be reduced. The method of baloon embolisation has progressed recently. This procedure brings the least discomfort to the patient. Results of this method of treatment must be observed critically for future assessment. Conduta em aneurismas gigantes. RESUMO — Os aneurismas gigantes merecem atenção especial no que se refere a seus aspectos anatômicos, riscos e, principalmente, dificuldades técnicas ao seu manuseio. A abordagem de tais aneurismas necessita de planejamento adequado e, sobremaneira, de material apropriado para sua clipagem. A mortalidade ainda permanece alta, apesar dos recentes progressos observados nos últimos anos. For outro lado, a abordagem indireta requer, muitas vezes, oclusão de um vaso cerebral importante, o que pode acarretar isquemia cerebral. Entretanto, por anastomose extra-intracraniana tais riscos podem ser diminuídos. O método de embolização por balões tem-se mostrado eficaz. Este processo oferece menor incômodo ao paciente. Os resultados deste método devem ser observados criteriosamente para melhor avaliação no futuro. Giant aneurysms are defined as those larger than 25 mm in diameter 7, 13, 14. i <b>n</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> the frequency of occurence of these malformations is rated between 3 % and 6 %. In our own material we found giant aneurysms at the rate of 3. 8 %.

Further, how do these effects differ between men and women? The Public Use Microdata Sample from the 2000 U. S. decennial census is used to calculate migration rates by occupation and education. The analysis estimates the effects of these occupational mobility measures on the migration of couples and the earnings of married individuals. I fi nd that migration rates in both the husband’s and wife’s oc-cupations affect the household migration decision, but mobility in the husband’s occupation matters considerably more. For couples in which the husband has a college degree (regardless of the wife’s educational level), a husband’s mobility has a large, signifi cant negative effect on his wife’s earnings, whereas a wife’s mobility has no effect on her husband’s earnings. This negative effect does not exist for college-educated wives married to non-college-educated husbands. <b>n</b> <b>the</b> substantial <b>literature</b> on <b>the</b> relationship between migration and earnings, an impor...|$|R
40|$|The twisted cube is an {{important}} variation of the hypercube. It possesses many desirable properties for interconnection networks. In this paper, we study fault-tolerant embedding of paths in twisted cubes. Let TQ n(V, E) denote the n-dimensional twisted cube. We prove that a path of length l can be embedded between any two distinct nodes with dilation 1 for any faulty set F ⊂ V(TQ n) ∪ E(T Q n) with |F |�n − 3 and any integer l with 2 n− 1 − 1 �l �|V(TQ n − F) |− 1 (n� 3). This result is optimal {{in the sense that}} the embedding has the smallest dilation 1. The result is also complete {{in the sense that the}} two bounds on path length l and faulty set size |F | for a successful embedding are tight. That is, the result does not hold if l � 2 n− 1 − 2 or|F |�n− 2. We also extend the result on (n− 3) -Hamiltonian connectivity of TQ <b>n</b> in <b>the</b> <b>literature...</b>|$|R
40|$|Interval graphs—the {{intersection}} graphs of one-dimensional intervals—are {{considered one}} of the most useful mathematical structures to model real life applications. Interval graphs have been widely studied since they first appeared in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> in 1957. In 1976, Booth and Lueker introduced a data structure called PQ-trees that could recognize interval graphs in linear time; since then, several simpler linear-time algorithms have been proposed for the problem. We investigate a lesser-studied variation of interval graphs called edge-weighted interval graphs. A graph with weights on its edges is an edge-weighted interval graph if we can assign intervals to its vertices so that the weight of an edge (u, v) is equal to the length of the intersection of the intervals assigned to u and v. In 2012, Kobler, Kuhnert, and Watanabe gave an algorithm to recognize such graphs in time O(m · n), where m and <b>n</b> are <b>the</b> number of edges and vertices, respectively, of the given graph. In this thesis, we give an algorithm to recognize complete edge-weighted interval graphs in time O(m · log n). We then observe some additional properties of PQ-trees for interval graphs, and use these properties to improve the runtime of the algorithm given by Kobler et al. for recognizing general edge-weighted interval graphs to O(m · log <b>n).</b> As <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> for finding representations of weighted intersection graphs is scarce, we hope that the techniques presented in this thesis can be used to obtain algorithms or approximation algorithms for recognition of other kinds of weighted intersection graphs...|$|R

In this article, a review of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on “Name Techniques” was conducted, with interpretation and synthesis by the author. One hundred and eleven articles were found. These were: technique discussions (N = 39), case studies (N = 25), case series (N = 5), experimental studies (N = 25) and clinical trials (<b>N</b> = 17). <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> suggested that prone leg length testing and some x-ray mensurations may have acceptable inter and intra-rater reliability. In addition, there are several case studies that reported significant clinical benefits by patients receiving Activator, Alexander, and Upper Cervical treatments.

We review {{recent work}} on the {{accuracy}} of group judgmental processes a a function of (a) the competences (judgmental ccuracies) of individual group members, (b) the group decision procedure, and (c) group size. This work on individual competence and group accuracy represents {{an important contribution to}} democratic theory and a useful Complement to <b>the</b> usual emphasis <b>n</b> <b>the</b> social choice <b>literature</b> on individual preference and preference aggregation mechanisms. The work reported on is rooted in a tradition which goes back to scholars such as Condorcet, Poisson, and Bayes. "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free". New Testament, John 8 : 13. "The many, when taken individually, may be quite ordinary fellows, but when they meet together, they may well be found collectively better than the few". Aristotle...|$|R

It fi rst describes <b>the</b> <b>N</b> 170 component, how it can be defi ned, and its relationship to the vertex positive potential (VPP) response to faces that was reported prior to <b>the</b> <b>N</b> 170 in <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> It then addresses the question of the origin of <b>the</b> largest <b>N</b> 170 to faces in terms of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, neural sources, and functional processes that lead to this effect. It also discusses the controversial issue of whether <b>the</b> <b>N</b> 170 refl ects underlying processes that can be at least partly recruited for processing nonface objects following extensive visual experience with these objects. The chapter summarizes the evidence showing that <b>the</b> <b>N</b> 170 refl ects both the initial basic-level categorization of the stimulus as a face through the activation of neural face representations and the coding of individual face representations. It then briefl y discusses why <b>the</b> <b>N</b> 170 may be a critical time window for other types of face categorizations before summarizing the chapter and addressing the question of how <b>the</b> <b>N</b> 170 can be taken as a tool to clarify the dynamics and the nature of early face processes in future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{transcendental}} phenomenological study was to describe lived experience during School Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS) implementation for School Wide Positive Behavior coaches in Pennsylvania public schools. Participants, identified as co-researchers throughout this study, included 11 SWPBS coaches selected from seven elementary schools who are implementing the program with fidelity, as defined by Pennsylvania Positive Behavior Support Network (PAPBS, <b>n.</b> d.). <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> surrounding <b>the</b> SWPBS program is largely quantitative and {{does not include the}} coaches 2 ̆ 7 experiences. Thus, this research filled an important gap in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on <b>the</b> crucial issue of providing positive behavior support that is facing schools across the United States today. The central question driving the study was: What are the coaches’ experiences during the school wide implementation year? Data was collected through individual face-to-face interviews, an online bulletin board focus group, and a document analysis comprised of letters written by each of the co-researcher coaches addressed to new or prospective SWPBS coaches giving them insight, advice, and information about this role. Throughout the study I practiced epoche by recording my personal experiences and thoughts in a journal. Data analysis followed Moustakas’ (1994) approach to phenomenological research by defining preliminary groupings though horizonalization, identifying themes, constructing structural and textural descriptions, and finally, producing the essence of the experience. The information gleaned from this study illustrated to schools how this program influenced those leading it within the school...|$|R
