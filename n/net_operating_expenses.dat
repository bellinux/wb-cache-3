To {{increase}} local growth linkages of smallholder broiler {{enterprises in}} rural areas a single-phase, on-farm processed, mash diet, consisting of boiled and ground full-fat soya beans and ground yellow maize grain fortified with lysine, methionine and selected mineral nutrients was first developed and then tested. Financial analysis showed that <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> of broiler enterprises that used the experimental diet were {{higher than those of}} similar enterprises using the control diet, but differences in net operating income were only significant in one of the two runs of the experiment. The main economic benefit of using the experimental diet was the added value to the local economy, which increased from 20 % of the retail value of broiler chickens in the case of enterprises using the control diet to 70 % when using the experimental diet...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{identify}} the main factors which contributed to decline of profitability in Serbian banking sector {{during the period of}} global economic crisis. There are presented different theories of banking sector profitability and results of scientifically significant empirical researches from economic literature. Following ratios were used as measure of profitability: return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), net interest gain to total revenue, net fees and commissions gain to total revenue, and net pre-tax profit/loss to total revenue ratio. The profitability was analyzed for the whole Serbian banking sector in the period 2008 - 2012 and particularly for the 15 largest banks according to total assets value in 2012. The empirical analysis indicated {{that one of the most}} important factors contributing to high amounts of losses of commercial banks in the previous period includes an increase of <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenses,</b> especially expenses on account of a write-off of non-performing loans (NPL). Furthermore, there were analyzed the dynamics of interest rates and interest spread as a factor with certain impact on profitability of banks. Finally, it is estimated that the prospects for intensive growth of profitability in the banking sector of Serbia in the mid-term are poor...|$|E

Of all the components, profit margin and owners’ equity per employee showed the most rapid growth during the analysed period.

50|$|In a {{commercial}} income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This {{can be done}} using revenue multipliers or capitalization rates applied to a <b>Net</b> <b>Operating</b> Income (NOI). Usually, an NOI has been stabilized {{so as not to}} place too much weight on a very recent event. An example of this is an unleased building which, technically, has no NOI. A stabilized NOI would assume that the building is leased at a normal rate, and to usual occupancy levels. The <b>Net</b> <b>Operating</b> Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective Gross Income) less <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation charges applied by accountants).|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to develop a {{realistic}} model of an oil company which can be used to evaluate alternative systems of petroleum accounting. The model is used to simulate several accounting variables produced by the full cost and successful efforts methods of accounting. The simulated accounting variables are <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income, <b>net</b> oil properties, <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> and return on investment. This study also evaluates the oil company models used in prior petroleum accounting research. There are currently two systems of petroleum accounting (full cost accounting and successful efforts accounting) that are generally accepted. The full cost method basically requires the capitalization of all exploration and development costs while the successful efforts method does not permit the capitalization of either geological survey costs or the costs of dry exploratory wells. A petroleum accounting model should satisfy three requirements. The model should incorporate all significant revenues and expenditures. The values of these revenues and expenditures should be realistic and the timing of the business transactions must be realistic. Earlier accounting studies employed deterministic and stochastic models which failed to satisfy one or more of the three requirements of a petroleum accounting model. Because there are many significant differences between these models and the oil companies which they claim to represent, the findings of these studies cannot be considered to be realistic. The model developed for this study represents the exploration, development and production activities of an oil company. Multinomial probability distributions are used to model exploratory drilling success. A binomial distribution is used to model development drilling success. Exponential decline curves are used to represent oil production. The model displays the type of behavior that is predicted by the economic theory of exhaustible resources and it satisfies the three modeling requirements stated previously...|$|R

In the example above, the purchased building will be fully capitalized (pay for itself) after ten years (100% divided by 10%). If the capitalization rate were 5%, the payback period would be twenty years.Note that a real estate appraisal in the U.S. uses <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income. Cash flow equals <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income minus debt service. Where sufficiently detailed information is not available, the capitalization rate will be derived or estimated from <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to determine cost, value or required annual income.An investor views his money as a [...] "capital asset". As such, he expects his money to produce more money. Taking into account risk and how much interest is available on investments in other assets, an investor arrives at a personal rate of return he expects from his money. This is the cap rate he expects. If an apartment building is offered to him for $100,000, and he expects to make at least 8 percent on his real estate investments, then he would multiply the $100,000 investment by 8% and determine that if the apartments will generate $8000, or more, a year, after <b>operating</b> <b>expenses,</b> then the apartment building is a viable investment to pursue.|$|R

40|$|Overview The Commonwealth government’s perilous {{financial}} position is well known, but the finances {{of state government}} also warrant our attention. In aggregate, since plunging heavily into deficit after 2007, the states’ fiscal position has improved markedly in recent years, marked by a return to <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> surpluses, much reduced fiscal deficits, and stabilization of net debt. Growth of <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> has been held below revenue growth. However, the aggregates mask major differences among the states.

In fiscal year 2003, USAID estimates that it will obligate about $ 13 billion for assistance programs in almost 160 countries. In recent years, demands on USAID's budget and workforce have increased as the agency strives to meet emerging requirements, such as reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and increased funding for health programs. However, USAID officials have expressed concern that funds provided for its administrative or <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> have not kept pace with the agency's requirements. Since 1976, Congress has included a separate appropriation to consolidate USAID's <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> into a single budget item. Congress intended that USAID pay for the administrative costs of delivering foreign assistance (its "cost of doing business") from an <b>operating</b> <b>expense</b> account separate from its humanitarian and development assistance program funds.
