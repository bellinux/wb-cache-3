25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, <b>no</b> <b>adjustment</b> is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E

25|$|Bolivia, {{like much}} of Latin America, is a highly class-segregated society, in this case along ethnic lines: European-Indio. European {{descendants}} tend to monopolize political and economic power {{and in fact the}} republican institutions are drawn along the lines of European schools of thought with little or <b>no</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the indigenous tradition. This makes it much harder for the indigenous to integrate into society and to achieve personal success. Since the late 1990s, the indigenous communities have become radicalized throughout the Andes, pressing for political reform in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, loosely coordinated in the Pachacuti movement. The Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) is perhaps the strongest political expression of this movement in Bolivia, coordinating a wide range of community-based organizations mostly reflecting Aymara political aspirations.|$|E
2500|$|The first strobe tuner {{dates back}} to 1936 and was {{originally}} made by the Conn company; {{it was called the}} Stroboconn and was produced for approximately 40 years. However, these strobes are now mainly collector pieces. They had 12 strobe discs, driven by one motor. The gearing between discs was a very close approximation to the 12th root of two ratio. This tuner had an electrically driven temperature-compensated tuning fork; the electrical output of this fork was amplified to run the motor. The fork had sliding weights, an adjustment knob, and a dial to show the position of the weights. These weights permitted setting it to different reference frequencies (such as A4 = 435Hz), although over a relatively narrow range, perhaps a whole tone. [...] When set at A4 = 440Hz the tuning fork produced a 55Hz signal, which drove the four-pole 1650 RPM synchronous motor to which the A disc was mounted. [...] (The other discs were all gear-driven off of this one.) [...] Incoming audio was amplified to feed a long neon tube common to all 12 discs. Wind instrument repair people liked this tuner because it needed <b>no</b> <b>adjustment</b> to show different notes. [...] Anyone who had to move this tuner around was less inclined to like it because of its size and weight: two record-player-sized cases of 30-40 pounds each.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} Edsel shares its basic {{technology}} with other Ford products, {{a number of}} issues caused reliability problems, mostly with the 1958 models. [...] Reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced, due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other Ford models. Ford never dedicated a stand-alone factory solely to Edsel model production. [...] The first-year (1958) Edsels were assembled in both Mercury and Ford factories. [...] The longer-wheelbase models, Citation and Corsair, were produced alongside the Mercury products, while the shorter-wheelbase models, Pacer and Ranger, were produced alongside the Ford products. [...] Workers assembling Fords and Mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional Edsel that moved down the line burdensome, because it required them to change tools and parts bins, then switch back to resume assembling Fords or Mercurys after completing assembly on the Edsel. [...] The workers were also expected to accommodate Edsel assembly with <b>no</b> <b>adjustment</b> in their hourly quota of Ford and Mercury production. [...] Consequently, the desired quality control of the different Edsel models proved difficult to achieve, even when the Fords and Mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines. [...] Many Edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished. [...] Uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics, some of whom never installed the additional parts at all. [...] Some dealers did not even receive all the parts.|$|E
