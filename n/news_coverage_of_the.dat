40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the frames used during the South Dakota <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elijah Page death penalty case and detect patterns of frame usage, valence <b>of</b> <b>news</b> <b>coverage</b> and source usage. A content analysis of 163 South Dakota news reports from three years <b>of</b> <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> was conducted. The {{study found that the}} procedural frame was used most often in the South Dakota <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elijah Page death penalty case, followed by the morality frame and then the distributive justice frame. The media used, whether newspaper or television broadcast, did not significantly affect the frame usage. The frames used, however, did differ by year <b>of</b> <b>coverage.</b> <b>The</b> valence <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> was found to be mostly neutral, with increases in positive and negative valence as the death penalty case entered its last year <b>of</b> <b>coverage.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source usage during <b>the</b> death penalty <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elijah Page case found that there was overreliance on official sources, such as state elected officials and law enforcement. Trends in source use also revealed that the frames shifted depending on the source cited in the <b>news</b> media <b>coverage.</b> This study concludes that while coverage was overall neutral and objective, <b>the</b> overreliance <b>of</b> one source over another may have affected <b>the</b> framing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elijah Page case in South Dakota.
