40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in modeling time-varying higher-order conditional moments in the density estimation context. These studies employ a moment-based methodology to test their specification of higher-order conditional moments. We compare the size and power of these moment-based tests with the size and power of a recently developed set of <b>nonparametric</b> <b>tests.</b> The results show that the moment-based tests have good size only for conditional skewness and have a large size distortion when all the moment conditions are tested jointly and used as an overall specification <b>test.</b> The <b>nonparametric</b> <b>tests</b> have a slight size distortion for conditional higher moments, which can be eliminated. The power of the <b>nonparametric</b> <b>tests</b> for detecting overall misspecification and lack of dynamics in the conditional higher moments is better than the power of the moment-based tests. ...|$|R

It is widely used in clinical trials to establish the efficacy of a new treatment in comparison with a control treatment when the measurement {{is the time to}} event (such as the time from initial treatment to a heart attack). The test is sometimes called the Mantel-Cox test, named after Nathan Mantel and David Cox. The log-rank test can also be viewed as a time-stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.|$|E

50|$|The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) is a <b>nonparametric</b> <b>test</b> of the {{equality}} of continuous, one-dimensional probability distributions {{that can be used}} to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution (one-sample K-S test), or to compare two samples (two-sample K-S test), thus, it can be used to test the comparisons of the distributions of the nine subsamples. However, the K-S test can only be used for one dimensional data - it cannot be used for sets of data involving two dimensions such as the clustering. However, a 1983 paper by J.A. Peacock suggests that one should use all four possible orderings between ordered pairs to calculate the difference between the two distributions. Since the sky distribution of any object is composed of two orthogonal angular coordinates, the team used this methodology.|$|E
