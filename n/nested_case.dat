The study provides insights to inform EETDP curriculum development that is enabling of reflexive environmental education and training processes. The study develops an understanding of workplace epistemologies related to environment and education, the structural factors that enable and constrain agency of environmental educators {{and the role of}} reflexivity in practice and in education in two nested cases: the agricultural and local government sectors. It draws on findings from workshops, semistructured interviews and document analysis of education materials in these two <b>nested</b> <b>cases.</b> The study notes that there are diverse and seemingly ambiguous understandings of both environment/sustainability and education processes in the two <b>nested</b> <b>cases.</b> This ambiguity seems to relate to environmental education practitioners drawing on different forms of knowledge, including differentiated or theoretical knowledge, and 'common-sense' ways of knowing, in their education practice. The understandings related to theoretical knowledge are, in both <b>nested</b> <b>cases,</b> dominated by scientific or technical understandings where environment is understood in the terms of the natural sciences and education is seen in instrumentalist terms as the transfer of mainly technical environmental knowledge to learners in order to effect behaviour change. The study opens up deeper understandings of the epistemological, socio-cultural and structural features of context, in the two <b>nested</b> <b>cases,</b> that have a bearing on environmental educators. It provides insights into workplace structures that can be both enabling and constraining of agency and notes that the causal power of structures to enable or constrain does not lie only in the structures but also in relation to the intentionality of the environmental education practitioners/agents. The study then examines reflexivity as one of the means through which environmental educators in the <b>nested</b> <b>cases</b> are able to consider appropriate actions or responses to structural constraints or enablements. Based on the insights offered by the research findings, the study makes recommendations for the EETDP curriculum development.

40|$|Background. Several {{trials of}} {{antibiotic}} {{use for the}} secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases have been performed but individual studies have produced conflicting and inconclusive results. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of published studies to synthesize the evidence. We also examined a large cohort of previously revascularized patients to assess if a small but meaningful benefit of antibiotic exists. Research question. Whether antibiotic use, compared to non-use, can reduce future cardiovascular events in a population of previously revascularized patients. Method. A meta-analysis and a <b>nested</b> <b>case</b> control study were both conducted to answer the research question. In the meta-analysis, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Registry of controlled trials were searched for studies published between January 1 1994 and December 31 2004 using keyword 'antibiotic use' and 'cardiovascular diseases'. 232 published papers were initially identified and 12 randomized trials meet our inclusion criteria. The data were combined using a random effects model. A sensitivity analysis with a fixed effects model was also performed. Our <b>nested</b> <b>case</b> control study was conducted on a cohort of all individuals ≥ 65 years of age who had a revascularization procedure from 1995 to 2000 and were registered in the Quebec universal health databases. The discharge date of each patient after revascularization was date of cohort entry. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infraction and repeat revascularization. For each case, five controls were randomly selected and matched by date of cohort entry and age to the cases. Current users of antibiotics, those whose last prescription overlapped with the index date, were compared to individuals who were not exposed to antibiotics in the year preceding the event. Similarly the risk of recent (1 - 6 month) and past (6 - 12 months) antibiotic exposure was estimated. Odds ratios were calculated by using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for potential confounders. Results. Our meta-analysis identified the 12 studies which randomized 10 231 patients to antibiotic treatment and 10 144 patients to control. The odds ratio for the composite event endpoint of death, myocardial infarction or revascularization was 0. 92 (95 CI%: 0. 84 - 1. 02). A similar result was found using a fixed effect model. No evidence for publication bias was found. Our <b>nested</b> <b>case</b> control study included 6 117 cases and 30 573 controls. The adjusted odds ratios of cardiac events for any current, recent and past antibiotic use were 1. 12 [95 %CI: 0. 98 - 1. 29], 1. 21 [95 %CI: 1. 07 - 1. 28] and 1. 31 [95 %CI: 1. 15 - 1. 48], respectively. Conclusion. No prevention association between antibiotic use and future cardiovascular events was shown either in the meta-analysis or our <b>nested</b> <b>case</b> control study. On the contrary, our <b>nested</b> <b>case</b> control study suggested increased risk long term following antibiotic exposure.

We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two idempotents to be equivalent or similar. Our criterion yields examples illustrating pathology and {{also shows that}} to each equivalence class of idempotents there corresponds a “dimension function” from β × β into N ∪ { ∞ }. We complete the characterization of the algebraic equivalence classes by proving that any dimension function corresponds to an equivalence class of idempotents. Also, to each sequence of dimension functions, there corresponds a commuting sequence of idempotents. A criterion is obtained for when an idempotent {{is similar to a}} subidempotent of another. The mapping which sends an equivalence class (or idempotent) to its associated dimension function plays a role in the nest algebra theory analogous to the role played by the mapping sending a projection in a Type I W∗-algebra to its center valued trace. We prove that almost commuting, similar idempotents are homotopic; this contrasts with the situation in certain C∗-algebras.

In {{addition to the}} usual 0 -mode cooperon and diffuson, there exist π-mode cooperon and diffuson in the unitary limit due to the particle-hole symmetry. The diffusive π-modes are gapped by the deviation from the exactly-nested Fermi surface. The conductivity diagrams with the gapped π-mode cooperon or diffuson are found to give rise to unconventional features of the QI effect. Besides the inelastic scattering, the thermal fluctuation is shown to be also an important dephasing mechanism in the QI processes related with the diffusive π-modes. In {{the proximity of the}} <b>nesting</b> <b>case,</b> a power-law anti-localization effect appears due to the π-mode diffuson. For large deviation from the nested Fermi surface, this anti-localization effect is suppressed, and the conductivity remains to have the usual logarithmic weak-localization correction contributed by the 0 -mode cooperon. As a result, the dc conductivity in the unitary limit becomes a non-monotonic function of the temperature or the sample size, which {{is quite different from the}} prediction of the usual weak-localization theory.
