5|$|During {{the battle}} of Khafji, these {{upgraded}} T-55s survived impacts from MILAN anti-tank missiles. These divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as the BMP-1, scout vehicles such as the BRDM-2, and several types of artillery. Also deployed along {{this portion of the}} front, though <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> to participate in the invasion, were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along the border.|$|E
5|$|O'Gara won a cap for Ireland A on 9 April 1999, against Italy A {{during a}} friendly. He was {{selected}} in Ireland's preliminary training squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, but was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for the tournament, with the Irish management deciding {{to take two}} fly-halves and an extra prop instead of three fly-halves. O'Gara was in the Munster team that beat Ireland in a warm-up for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The City of Windsor also hired New York traffic {{consultant}} Sam Schwartz {{to design}} a parkway to the border. Schwartz's proposal would eventually inspire the DRIC's own design, but his route was <b>not</b> <b>chosen,</b> with the DRIC opting instead to take a northern route.|$|E

5|$|After Groundskeeper Willie {{takes away}} Bart's {{skateboard}} for destroying his leaf pile, Bart fills up Willie's shack with creamed corn {{as he is}} sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show {{to make room for}} a kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> at first, but is made sportscaster after he complains to Marge.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of fighting, the division was based around Aulnoye-Aymeries in France. The division was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> {{to be part of}} the British Army of the Rhine, the British occupation force to be based in the Rhineland. Instead, it was demobilised over a period of months. The first 3,000 soldiers were sent home during December, and the division ceased to exist by March 1919. Prior to the division's disbandment, the remaining men were visited by Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII).|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Enola Gay {{returned}} to the United States, where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. In May 1946, it was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific, but was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll. Later that year it {{was transferred to the}} Smithsonian Institution, and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a {{heavy dose of}} influenza that forced him to miss the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams had}} {{provided}} players to the England national football team {{earlier in the}} month for a match against Scotland, with Arsenal providing George Male, Jack Crayston and Cliff Bastin, while Sheffield United gave Bobby Barclay. Alex James, despite being Arsenal's captain and having previously played for the Scottish international team, was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for that match, {{which resulted in a}} 1–1 draw, enabling Scotland to win the 1936 British Home Championship.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{made his}} Premier League debut for Manchester City {{in the opening}} game of the {{following}} season on 18 August, against Aston Villa. He was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for the starting eleven but replaced Valeri Bojinov, who suffered an injury during the pre-game warm-up. Evans scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester City against Portsmouth on 21 September, scoring the fifth goal as City {{went on to win}} 6–0. With City's acquisition of Craig Bellamy and later Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz and Carlos Tevez, Evans opted to leave in 2009 in order to get more first team football.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} were rewarded with selection for an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain and Harvey was not able to exhibit his talents on a sticky wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came in after the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, Ray was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5|$|Hiddink {{resigned}} {{and was replaced}} by his assistant Frank Rijkaard, who rarely picked Hasselbaink at international level. He next played on 18 August 1999, alongside Kluivert and Ruud van Nistelrooy in a friendly against Denmark; he was taken off for Clarence Seedorf and the game ended 0–0. He next appeared six months later, playing ten minutes against Germany and 70 minutes against Scotland, and despite van Nistelrooy being injured Hasselbaink was not selected for UEFA Euro 2000 as the five forwards chosen were Bergkamp, Kluivert, van Hooijdonk, Roy Makaay and Peter van Vossen. He {{had been part of the}} 25 man initial squad but, along with André Ooijer and Winston Bogarde, was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for the final 22.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, Breathitt was one {{of several}} {{candidates}} put before the General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate. He received 66 of 137 votes, 3 votes short of a majority. Other unsuccessful nominees included John J. Crittenden (68 votes), Richard Mentor Johnson (64 votes), and Charles A. Wickliffe (49 votes). After 15 ballots, the Assembly still had <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> a nominee, and postponed the matter until the next session. At that session, Henry Clay was chosen to fill the seat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 1888–89 season, Biggs was reselected for the Welsh team {{as part of}} the 1889 Home Nations Championship. He was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> for {{the first}} game of the season against Scotland, but was {{accepted}} for the second and final game to Ireland. Under the captaincy of Arthur Gould, Biggs was partnered on the wing by Abel Davies of London Welsh. Wales lost to Ireland by two tries to nil, the first time the Irish had won on Welsh soil. Biggs and Davies were both dropped for the next season.|$|E

It was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field, California, the next day.|$|E
5|$|Ralph was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> {{archbishop}} of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election involved an {{assembly of the}} lords and bishops meeting with King Henry I of England. Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II, rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it. As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive {{of the rights of}} the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland. Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II.|$|E
5|$|Simone was {{the first}} African-American lesbian to be {{featured}} on daytime television. Passions also made history by becoming the first daytime television series to show two women having sex. The soap opera won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality and her relationship with Rae, with Doe accepting the award on the show's behalf. Doe was also listed as a pre-nominee for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards alongside co-star Emily Harper, but was <b>not</b> <b>chosen</b> {{as one of the}} final nominees.|$|E
