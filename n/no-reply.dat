5000|$|Although {{infinite}} loops in {{a single}} program are usually easy to predict, a loop caused by several entities interacting is much harder to foresee. Consider a server that always replies with an error message {{if it does not}} understand the request. Apparently, there is no possibility for an infinite loop in the server, but if there are two such servers (A and B), and A receives a message of unknown type from B, then A replies with an error message to B, B does not understand the error message and replies to A with its own error message, A does not understand the error message from B and sends yet another error message, and so on ad infinitum. One common example of such situation is an email loop.An example of an email loop is if someone receives mail from a no reply inbox, but their auto-response is on. They will reply to the no reply inbox, triggering the [...] "this is a no reply inbox" [...] response. This will be sent to the user, who then sends an auto reply to the <b>no-reply</b> inbox, {{and so on and so}} forth.|$|E
40|$|THE FUNDAMENTAL {{requirement}} for {{ethical treatment of}} research participants is that they give informed consent for their participation. Although {{there have been a}} few empirical studies of the consequences of informed consent (e. g., Singer, 1978), researchers need to know much more about the impact of this requirement on research results. This paper reports our findings regarding the consequences of ob-taining written parental permission for research participation by minor students. Abstract The parents of an eligible sample of 1618 students in grades four through twelve were contacted to obtain written permission for their children to complete questionnaires related to alcohol and drugs. The distributions of students across the parental response categories (consent-denied, <b>no-reply,</b> or consent-granted) were com-pared on the student variables of sex, grade level, ethnic group, and reading and vocabulary test scores. The explicit consent procedure produced a sample that was approximately half the size of the eligible population and overrepresented white stu...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Disordered eating {{behavior}} and body dissatisfaction affect {{a large proportion}} of the Dutch population and account for severe psychological, physical and social morbidity. Yet, the threshold for seeking professional care is still high. In the Netherlands, only 7. 5 % of patients with bulimia nervosa and 33 % of patients with anorexia nervosa are treated within the mental health care system. Easily accessible and low-threshold interventions, therefore, are needed urgently. The internet has great potential to offer such interventions. The aim of this study is to determine whether a web-based treatment program for patients with eating disorders can improve eating disorder psychopathology among female patients with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and eating disorders not otherwise specified. Methods/design: This randomized controlled trial will compare the outcomes of an experimental treatment group to a waiting list control group. In the web-based treatment program, participants will communicate personally and asynchronously with their therapists exclusively via the internet. The first part of the program will focus on analyzing eating attitudes and behaviors. In the second part of the program participants will learn how to change their attitudes and behaviors. Participants assigned to the waiting list control group will receive <b>no-reply</b> email messages once every two weeks during the waiting period of 15 weeks, after which they can start the program. The primary outcome measure is an improvement in eating disorder psychopathology as determined by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include improvements in body image, physical and mental health, body weight, self-esteem, quality of life, and social contacts. In addition, the participants' motivation for treatment and their acceptability of the program and the therapeutic alliance will be measured. The study will follow the recommendations in the CONSORT statement relating to designing and reporting on RCTs. DISCUSSION: This study protocol presents the design of a RCT for evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based treatment program using intensive therapeutic support for female patients with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and eating disorders not otherwise specified...|$|E
