5|$|A 2006 International Energy Agency forum {{presented}} {{costs for}} managing intermittency {{as a function}} of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|Care <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when {{machining}} hafnium {{because it}} is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled {{as if they were}} toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> more often.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{understanding}} is a cerebral mode of comprehension, it {{is a way}} of thinking, and thus is not dependent upon external expression. Yet it requires external manifestation in order to be communicated. The expression of critical understanding can take various forms including formal or informal speech, academic writing, creative prose or poetry or visual outcomes. It can take different forms in different cultures and this <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into consideration when assessing critical results.|$|E

Lighter, dry styles can pair well with light dishes such as salads, fish, and chicken. The sweeter styles of Chenin blanc can balance the spicy heat of some Asian and Hispanic cuisines. The acidity and balance of medium-dry styles can pair well with cream sauces and rich dishes like pâté.|$|E

50|$|Every morning, Karber {{went to the}} Pentagon or used a red {{phone to}} call the {{secretary}} and chairman to discuss the scenario being played out. They then talked about what actions <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by discussing US policy, possible alliance reactions, {{as well as what}} moves <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> next. These scenarios took place so reaction times could be improved if something <b>were</b> <b>to</b> happen.|$|R
25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation. Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim {{to make a very}} narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonspecificity}} of Jaffe's reaction causes falsely elevated creatinine {{results in}} the presence of protein, glucose, acetoacetate, ascorbic acid, guanidine, acetone, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (mainly streptomycin), ketone bodies, α-keto acids, and other organic compounds. Ammonium is also an interferent; if the sample is plasma, care <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> that ammonium heparin has not been used as an anticoagulant. Nonspecificity is markedly decreased in urine samples since urine creatinine levels are much higher than blood and it generally does not contain significant levels of interfering chromogens.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, Health Canada {{announced}} that they were assessing whether acrylamide, which occurs naturally during the cooking of French fries, potato chips, and other processed foods, is a hazard to human health and whether any regulatory action <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Currently, they are collecting information on the properties and prevalence of acrylamide {{in order to make}} their assessment. In December 2009, after a positive reception from the food industry, Health Canada invited comment from the public on this proposal. The European Chemical Agency added acrylamide to the list of substances of very high concern in March 2010.|$|E

25|$|Care <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when {{handling}} hooks as {{they can}} 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut {{the eye of the}} hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|E
25|$|Apple head Chihuahuas {{can have}} moleras, or {{a soft spot}} in their skulls, {{and they are the}} only breed of dog to be born with an {{incomplete}} skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury.|$|E
25|$|It is TGA-labeled for {{migraine}} prevention, also {{in cases}} of neuropathic pain disorders, fibromyalgia and nocturnal enuresis. Amitriptyline is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> regularly to work and has a generally poor tolerability profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. Amitriptyline {{can also be used}} as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression also needs to be treated. Amitriptyline is the most widely researched agent for prevention of frequent tension headaches.|$|E

25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> care of by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E
