500|$|... "Empty Orchestra" [...] {{follows a}} {{relatively}} simple narrative of co-workers on a night out, telling several interweaved stories through body language, muffled conversations and relevant song lyrics. Phil Harrison, writing for The Guardian, characterised the episode as [...] "a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them". Possibilities for macabre developments are seeded in the early episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, these possibilities are cut off; for example, Duane's [...] "pills" [...] are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list—as revealed in his [...] "David Brentish" [...] speech—has no sinister purpose. Viewer expectations (and possible criticisms) are anticipated by Pemberton's Roger saying [...] "it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be one song after another, is it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E

60|$|In short, {{they who}} have not {{attended}} particularly to this subject are but little aware to what an extent quadrupeds and birds are employed, especially in the fall, in collecting, and so disseminating and planting the seeds of trees. It is the almost constant employment of the squirrels at that season and you rarely meet with one that has not a nut in its mouth, or is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get one. One squirrel-hunter of this town {{told me that he}} knew of a walnut-tree which bore particularly good nuts, but that on going to gather them one fall, he found that he had been anticipated by a family of a dozen red squirrels. He took out of the tree, which was hollow, one bushel and three pecks by measurement, without the husks, and they supplied him and his family for the winter. It would be easy to multiply instances of this kind. How commonly in the fall you see the cheek-pouches of the striped squirrel distended by a quantity of nuts! This species gets its scientific name Tamias, or the steward, from its habit of storing up nuts and other seeds. Look under a nut-tree a month after the nuts have fallen, and see what proportion of sound nuts to the abortive ones and shells you will find ordinarily. They have been already eaten, or dispersed far and wide. The ground looks like a platform before a grocery, where the gossips of the village sit to crack nuts and less savory jokes. You have come, you would say, after the feast was over, and are presented with the shells only.|$|E

50|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} very {{shortly after the}} Slippery When Wet Tour, because the band wanted {{to prove that they}} were <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a one hit wonder. The album was initially planned to be a double album; however, this idea was rejected by the record company because they were skeptical about the higher price point and decided they would only release a single album. One working title for the album was Sons of Beaches, which parodied the title of their previous album, Slippery When Wet.|$|E
50|$|We {{just try}} to obey basic rules of continuity. We try to avoid stories where a {{character}} is taking a big step like marriage and then {{not going back to}} it. I think by doing that, then in the future when we have big changes, the audience knows that they're going to be living with those changes for a while. So it's not just a thrown-away bit. It kind of endows that story beat with more power because it's going to last. It's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a reset button.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph {{elaborated}} by saying: [...] "So {{the agent}} called and they said, 'Well, {{this is what}} you got to do.' And I'm like, 'Okay.' And he sent me the script and they phoned back and said, 'Oh, bring Ellie along.' And I was like, 'No, no, no. Don't bring Ellie along. I'm <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring her to audition.' And they said, 'Okay.' I put the phone down, they ring back up and said, 'Okay, they'll see Ellie.'

We have to feel inspired. All I can say is I do see somewhere where we can take Carcass if we choose to do another album and personally I do want to do another album.

5000|$|In November 2011, Ronson {{released}} the album Chasing the Reds {{on her own}} label, Broken Toy Records. The album showcased her songwriting abilities, drawing inspiration from events in her life. In an interview with American Songwriter, she stated, [...] "I {{grew up in the}} studio with songs. My stepdad wrote some pretty f—ing incredible songs. My brother and musician Mark Ronson made his records because he likes making songs. So, the standard was set pretty high for being true to what you want to do.

5000|$|In December 2015, Krone sent {{a series}} of profane and belittling texts to a woman {{with whom he had}} a prior relationship, and who was a {{defendant}} in a case being prosecuted by the office he worked for. Krone sent the woman several taunting and threatening text messages, admonishing her for supporting a previous political opponent and asking whether she should be tested for sexually transmitted diseases. He told the Cody Enterprise that, though he had been drinking alcohol {{at the time of the}} incident, alcohol did not play a role in his texting. Krone told the Enterprise in March 2016: “I’m <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drink anymore. Period. I’m <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it.” He confirmed in a March 2016 interview with the Powell Tribune that he was fired as a result of sending the texts, which his boss, Park County Attorney Bryan Skoric, described as [...] "disgusting." ...|$|R

My wife {{is going to be the}} person kind of facilitating everything—all of the paperwork and all of the things it will take to connect people with events and connecting players with employers.

5000|$|In May 2016, Billy {{confirmed}} the band's forthcoming album would be entitled Brotherhood of the Snake. Of the album's lyrical content, he commented, [...] "The Brotherhood of the Snake {{was actually a}} society about 6,000 years ago that debarred all religions. It was just a fascinating topic that caught our eye and attention and spawned a lot of songs. We're going with that vibe. There will be some songs that deviate, but the majority will be around that and aliens and religion. Then I'll probably tap into my native heritage and write some songs about that. It's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be one concept, {{but there is some}} interesting stuff that we're finding to write about." [...] Brotherhood of the Snake was released on October 28, 2016, and shortly after its release, Testament embarked on an international tour with Amon Amarth, and toured North America in April-May 2017 with Sepultura, Prong, Infernal Tenebra and Dying Gorgeous Lies. Brotherhood of the Snake received generally positive reviews from critics, and scored Testament their second-highest chart position on the Billboard 200, reaching at number twenty.|$|E
