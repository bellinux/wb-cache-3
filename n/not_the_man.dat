5|$|On Saturday August 21, while Palomeque {{was either}} {{lost in the}} hills or already dead, someone worked as Abismo Negro on an AAA show in Cancun. In the past, the wrestler known as Black Abyss had worked as Abismo Negro when Palomeque failed to show, but this time Black Abyss was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> behind the mask, as {{he was on the}} {{opposing}} team that night. Following the discovery of Palomeque's body, the deception in Cancun received national coverage in Mexico and the local promoter responsible for the show, Renán Martínez, was suspended for two years by the Benito Júarez Boxing and Wrestling commission.|$|E
5|$|Susan, a {{divorced}} mother, takes interest in Mike Delfino (James Denton), a plumber who has {{recently moved to}} Wisteria Lane; however, she faces competition with neighbor Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), a promiscuous serial divorcée. Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with the pretense of borrowing sugar. While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass measuring cup. Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> with whom Edie was fornicating. Meanwhile, Lynette, a former career woman, is frustrated with raising four young children while her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), is constantly away on business.|$|E
5|$|The longest serving {{manager was}} Wilf Wild, {{who was in}} charge from 1932 to 1946, for a total length of 14 years 9 months. However, as Wild's tenure covered {{the entire length of the}} Second World War, in which no {{competitive}} football was played, he is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> with the most games served as manager. Les McDowall, {{who was in charge}} from 1950 to 1963, a period of 13 years, managed the club for the most competitive games, a total of 592 games - a full 240 games more than Wild, who recorded the second most. The most successful Manchester City manager in terms of major trophies won is Joe Mercer, who won four trophies in six years from 1965 to 1971. Pep Guardiola is City's current manager.|$|E

5000|$|Long told an inquest that it read, [...] "The Juwes [...] are <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{that will}} <b>not</b> {{be blamed for}} nothing." [...] Superintendent Arnold wrote a report which agrees with his account.Detective Constable Daniel Halse of the City of London Police, arrived a short time later, and took down a {{different}} version: [...] "The Juwes are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who will be blamed for nothing." [...] A third version, [...] "The Juws [...] are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> To be blamed for nothing", was recorded by City surveyor, Frederick William Foster. A copy according with Long's version of the message was attached to a report from Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to the Home Office. A summary report on the writing by Chief Inspector Swanson rendered it as [...] "The Jewes [...] are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to be blamed for nothing." [...] However, it is uncertain if Swanson ever saw the writing.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of the Axeman's victims were Italian immigrants or Italian-Americans, leading many {{to believe that the}} crimes were ethnically motivated. Many media outlets sensationalized this aspect of the crimes, even suggesting Mafia involvement despite lack of evidence. Some crime analysts have suggested that the killings were related to sex, and that the murderer was perhaps a sadist specifically seeking female victims. Criminologists Colin and Damon Wilson hypothesize that the Axeman killed male victims only when they obstructed his attempts to murder women, supported by cases in which the woman of the household was murdered but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> A less plausible theory is that the killer committed the murders in an attempt to promote jazz music, suggested by a letter attributed to the killer in which he stated that he would spare the lives of those who played jazz in their homes.|$|E

Timicin realizes that he is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to forge a cultural revolution, and agrees to return to Kaelon II. Lwaxana, despite her disagreement, realizes that Timicin's decision is his to make.

500|$|Like {{the vision}} of Banquo's lineage, the banquet scene has also {{been the subject of}} criticism. Critics have {{questioned}} whether not one, but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene: Banquo and Duncan. Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king. [...] "Thou canst not say I did it", for example, can mean that Macbeth is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who actually killed Banquo, or it can mean that Duncan, who was asleep when Macbeth killed him, cannot claim to have seen his killer. To add to the confusion, some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost, such as [...] "Thy bones are marrowless", cannot rightly be said of Banquo, who has only recently died.|$|E
500|$|When {{his parents}} fell in love, their {{relationship}} met with resistance from Luisa Santiaga Márquez's father, the Colonel. Gabriel Eligio García was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> the Colonel had envisioned winning {{the heart of}} his daughter: he (Gabriel Eligio) was a Conservative, and had the reputation of being a womanizer. Gabriel Eligio wooed Luisa with violin serenades, love poems, countless letters, and even telephone messages after her father sent her away with the intention of separating the young couple. Her parents tried everything {{to get rid of the}} man, but he kept coming back, and it was obvious their daughter was committed to him. Her family finally capitulated and gave her permission to marry him (The tragicomic story of their courtship would later be adapted and recast as Love in the Time of Cholera.) ...|$|E
500|$|Bellingham's main {{witnesses}} were Ann Billett and her friend, Mary Clarke, {{both of whom}} testified to his history of [...] derangement, and Catherine Figgins, a servant in Bellingham's lodgings. She had found him recently confused, but otherwise an honest and admirable lodger. As she stood down, Alley informed the court that two more witnesses had arrived from Liverpool. However, when they saw Bellingham, they realised that he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to whose derangement {{they had come to}} attest, and withdrew. Mansfield then began his summing up, during the course of which he clarified the law: [...] "The single question is whether at the time this act was committed, he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong". The judge advised the jury before they retired that the evidence showed Bellingham to be [...] "in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions".|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the actual}} {{production}} of the film, but the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer provided {{some insight into the}} production. The review and the synopsis are at odds on several aspects including on whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was fired for drunkenness or for no reason. In this case, it can be assumed that a drunken state was either not depicted or done inadequately. The reviewer states the [...] "impossible parts of the plot are gracefully omitted" [...] in reference to the abduction of the little girl played by Marie Eline and the overpowering of the chauffeur. Here the synopsis also differs, saying the girl is enticed away instead of being kidnapped. Though the overpowering of the chauffeur is required and acknowledged in the synopsis, the reviewer makes clear the actual method is not depicted. The reviewer also had a keen eye for detail, stating that the passengers disembarked {{into the middle of the}} street instead of on the sidewalk. The final scene's setting is captured in a surviving film still that shows the little girl persuading her parents to hire Jim in the police station with three officers looking on in the background.|$|E
500|$|He {{signed as}} a {{professional}} footballer for Leicester City in August 1944, choosing them ahead of local club Middlesbrough primarily due to the close links between Middlesbrough Swifts and Leicester City; he also worked as an apprentice bricklayer. Leicester originally thought him {{not good enough to}} turn professional, but he was taken under the wing of Leicester player Sep Smith who mentored Revie on many of his ideas about the game. Smith instructed Revie that [...] "When not in position, get into position; never beat a man by dribbling if you can beat him more easily with a pass; it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger; and the aim is to have a man spare in a passing move. Soccer would then become easy." [...] He played in the wartime league, before making his debut in the Football League on the opening day of the 1946–47 season, a 3–0 defeat to Manchester City, who would go on to win the Second Division that season. He showed good form at Filbert Street before breaking his right ankle in three places after a tackle from Tottenham Hotspur's Ron Burgess; the injury could have ended his career, but he recovered to full fitness within 19 weeks.|$|E
