5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E

5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could {{be said for the}} souls of the family, both living and dead. It was built by Peter Lyte in about 1343, and was completed by 1358, and would have served both the original manor which <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer survives and later {{the existing}} house. It has a small window, or squint, that permitted servants and others to observe communion from the house.|$|E
5|$|The commote of Glynrhondda was coterminous {{with the}} earlier parish of Ystradyfodwg, but little is known of the Celtic saint Tyfodwg, or Dyfodwg after whom the parish is named. Saint Tyfodwg {{is thought to have}} existed around 600AD, and {{although}} the parish bears his name there are <b>now</b> <b>no</b> religious monuments or places of worship named after him within the Rhondda boundaries. There are two churches in South Wales outside the area named after the saint; Y Tre Sant in Llantrisant and Saint Tyfodwg’s in Ogmore Vale.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Exeter, Band served in junior officer {{appointments}} in HMS Lewiston and HMS Rothesay. He was confirmed in {{the rank of}} sub-lieutenant on 1 September 1971. In the mid 1970s, he undertook an exchange programme with the United States Navy and served on board the guided missile cruiser, USS Belknap, which is <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer in service. He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 January 1974. Following warfare training in 1976 and 1977 he served for two years as the principal warfare officer and operations officer on board the frigate HMS Eskimo. This appointment included deployments to the West Indies and South Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae).

5|$|On arrival {{the ship}} was {{unloaded}} and stripped of most of its masts and spars, for use on the island. It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January, either as an agreed precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act by Quintal—in either case, there was <b>now</b> <b>no</b> means of escape. The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers—uninhabited, virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water and fertile land. For a while, mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably. Christian settled down with Isabella; a son, Thursday October Christian, was born, as were other children. Christian's authority as leader gradually diminished, and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 MIGA paid {{its first}} {{insurance}} claim since the agency's founding. In 2001 MIGA's issuance of new investment guarantees grew to $2billion. The agency launched its Small Investment Program in 2005 {{in an effort}} to promote investment among small and medium enterprises. That same year, MIGA set up its Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility {{in an effort to}} promote FDI into Afghanistan. In 2007 MIGA issued investment guarantees for a Djibouti port, marking its first support in the form of Islamic finance. The agency also launched PRI-Center.com (<b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer active) as a portal for information on political risk management and investment insurance, which also contained its FDI information services. In 2009, the Board of Directors enacted changes to MIGA's operating procedures and authorized coverage for default of sovereign financial obligations. The agency also launched an annual publication titled World Investment and Political Risk which reports on trends in worldwide investment and corporate perceptions of prospects and risk, as well as shifts in the political risk insurance industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} ending the war, Macedon {{was made a}} member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been {{stripped}} from Phocis. This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes. The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip {{had no choice but to}} impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war. Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' of no more than fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year; the Phocians were not, however, destroyed, and they retained their land. The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly. Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, he went back to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning the closest town to Thermopylae, Nicaea with Thessalian troops.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could <b>now</b> <b>no</b> longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E
