5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile1 marker. The next two miles (3.2km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the Lake Shore <b>Nature</b> <b>Trail,</b> a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods {{on one side and the}} beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E

5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle {{on public land}} that would later {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a <b>nature</b> <b>trail</b> in the RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

5|$|The {{rest of the}} SSSI {{is close}} to the A149 coast road, and can be {{accessed}} at many points by footpaths or roads. The main nature-orientated facilities are on the major reserves. Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme-next-the-Sea. It has a visitor centre, three bird hides, one of which has disabled access, and a 4km (2.5mi) <b>nature</b> <b>trail.</b> The other reserves are all adjacent to the A149. Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of Titchwell village and has a visitor centre, café and hides. Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible, but {{the last part of the}} footpath to the beach is rough, and crosses a steep bank. The two bird hides at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne's Drive in Holkham village; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road, Wells-next-the-Sea. Cley Marshes visitor centre and car park are to the south of the A149, opposite the main reserve. The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the clan}} {{is alive and}} lives as the Clan Maclachlan Society and the Lachlan Trust. The Clan Maclachlan Society {{consists}} of eight branches around the world, including Australia, Britain & Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The Lachlan Trust is a registered Scottish charitable organisation which takes donations to preserve the heritage of Clan Maclachlan. The trust, in part with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund, helped raise £100,000 {{for the preservation of}} Kilmorie Chapel, the traditional burying place of the chiefs. The project was completed in 2006, as a memorial to the twenty-fourth chief (the present chief's mother). Further funding from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund has since been approved for the conservation of the old castle and {{the construction of a new}} footbridge over the River Lachlan. Work began in the spring of 2013 with the erection of scaffolding around the west corner of the old castle. The plan is to develop the site for the enjoyment of visitors, with improved pathways, a <b>nature</b> <b>trail</b> and information points about the heritage of the area.|$|E
