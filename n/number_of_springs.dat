5|$|The two subcommunities of MG5, characterised by species rich {{grassland}} form a belt {{across the}} site, {{but they do}} not cover the whole site. Towards the north there is a community dominated by False oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), a constant species in the MG1 and MG2 communities of the British NVC and therefore not typical of an MG5 community. At Whitton Bridge Pasture it is growing on alluvial soils located at the northern edge of the site, which have most likely been formed by Whitton Beck just to the north. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>springs</b> at the site are associated with flushes of the Pale sedge (Carex pallescens), which form small populations.|$|E

After passing through Wardown Park the path joins the A6 road and goes through the town centre passing St Mary's Church as it heads close to the runways of Luton Airport. The A505 road is crossed as the trail makes its way through open countryside towards Harpenden.|$|E
25|$|Pampa de Achala {{is located}} in the {{province}} of Cordoba in Argentina. The northern boundary consists of the mountains of Los Gigantes, and the southern boundary of the northern portion of the Sierra de Comechingones, with the Summits of Achala located in the central area of the region. It is a rugged area, whose small plains and low slopes are responsible for its classification as 'plains'. These slopes and plains allowed for the formation of an intricate underground water network that supplies a great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>springs.</b> Within this region, there are numerous deep ravines with vertical walls between 600m and 800m high, many of which are more than 1,000m wide. The most important and popular ravines are the Quebrada del Condorito and the Quebrada de Yatán.|$|E

25|$|The Valley of Mexico is {{a closed}} basin which geologically divides into three hydrologic zones, the low plain, which is {{essentially}} the bed of now-extinct lakes, the piedmont area and the surrounding mountains. The old lakebeds correspond to the lowest elevations of the valley in the south are mostly clay with a high water content and are almost entirely covered by urban development. In the piedmont area, these clays become mixed with silts and sands, and in some areas close to the mountains, the piedmont is largely composed of basalt from old lava flows. The valley is enclosed completely by mountain ranges, from which flow rain and melting snow into the valley's hydraulic system. This groundwater flow produces a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>springs</b> in the foothills and upwellings in the valley floor. This underground flow {{is the source of}} the five aquifers that provide much of the drinking water to Mexico City located in Soltepec, Apan, Texcoco, Chalco-Amecameca and underneath Mexico City itself.|$|E

40|$|The tree-ring cores of Tianshan spruces {{collected}} from nine {{sites in the}} Urumqi River drainage of the middle Tianshan Mountains were used to establish three types of the tree-ring width chronologies over the last 370 years, using the international standard method of dendrochronology. Our study demonstrates that dendrochronology can be better used to reconstruct the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the precipitation day than to reconstruct the precipitation amount in middle Tianshan Mountains. It is found that the residual chronology among the three tree-ring width chronologies has the best relationship with <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> precipitation days from May 20 to June 8. The chronologies at Haxionggou B site and Zaierdegou site in the Urumiqi drainage have the highest correlation with the observed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> precipitation days at Daxigou meteorological station, and are used to reconstruct the spring precipitation days over the last 370 years in the drainage. The main significant decreasing trend <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spring</b> precipitation days occurred during 1665 - 1717, while the significant increasing trends happened during 1805 - 1841 and 1914 - 1943.

The long cycle of 32 years is shown quite clearly in the 10 -year smoothed sequence. The maximum spring precipitation days occurred mainly in the 1630 s, 1840 s and 1940 s, while the lowest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> precipitation days for the 10 -year average occurred in the 1710 s...|$|R

60|$|The {{first of}} all these passes was called Tempe, and a body of troops was sent to guard it; but they found that this was useless and impossible, and came back again. The next was at Thermopylae. Look in your map of the Archipelago, or Aegean Sea, {{as it was then}} called, for the great island of Negropont, or by its old name, Euboea. It looks like a piece broken off from the coast, and to the north is shaped like the head of a bird, with the beak running into a gulf, that would fit over it, upon the main land, and between the island and the coast is an {{exceedingly}} narrow strait. The Persian army would have to march round the edge of the gulf. They could not cut straight across the country, because the ridge of mountains called Ceta rose up and barred their way. Indeed, the woods, rocks, and precipices came down so near the seashore, that in two places there was only room for one single wheel track between the steeps and the impassable morass that formed the border of the gulf on its south side. These two very narrow places were called the gates of the pass, and were about a mile apart. There was a little more width left in the intervening space; but in this there were a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>springs</b> of warm mineral water, salt and sulphurous, which were used for the sick to bathe in, and thus the place was called Thermopylae, or the Hot Gates. A wall had once been built across the western-most of these narrow places, when the Thessalians and Phocians, who lived on either side of it, had been at war with one another; but it had been allowed to go to decay, since the Phocians had found out that there was a very steep narrow mountain path along the bed of a torrent, by which it was possible to cross from one territory to the other without going round this marshy coast road.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine deflections of fiber glass leaf spring depending on these parameters: form <b>of</b> the leaf <b>spring,</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leafs in <b>spring</b> and contact between spring leafs (comparing springs with lubricated and non-lubricated leaf surfaces). Primarily, the mechanical properties and surface friction coefficient of the fiber glass was measured to get enough information about material used for the study. According selected leaf <b>spring</b> geometry, samples <b>of</b> fiber glass leaf springs were made. Stiffness of these samples was determined during bending tests. Finite element method and analytical formulas was also used to evaluate accuracy of experimental results. Experimentally found, that leaf springs with less uneven form has a greater stiffness. Also found that twice reduced <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leaf <b>spring</b> sheets (and doubled sheet thickness) resulted from 2, 86 to 3, 44 times greater leaf spring stiffness.
