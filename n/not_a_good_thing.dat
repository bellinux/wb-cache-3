When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him that that is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and {{can not afford to}} ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to {{be friends}} with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} to do. After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

500|$|Some {{groups within}} the Christian metal {{movement}} have criticized bands within the industry for isolating the genre from general industry too avidly. For example, Christer Espevoll of Extol stated in 2003: [...] "I wish the scenes were more together. [...] For a long time {{there has been a}} huge – and still growing – distance between Christian and secular music industries. This is the situation peculiarly in the US but also in Scandinavia. In my opinion this kind of polarization is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> Music is first and foremost about music so why should every band or artist that represents a religion or lack of it have its own industry? Music has no religious borders." [...] However, most Christian bands today oppose to being isolated in the Christian music industry and have become mainstream successes, such as Virgin Black, and Norma Jean.|$|E
500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

[...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bob Geldof, {{then the}} lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, read about the {{incident}} when a news story about it came off the telex at WRAS, the campus radio station at Georgia State University in Atlanta. He was particularly struck by Spencer's claim that she did it {{because she did not}} like Mondays, and began writing a song about it, also incorporating the reporters' [...] "Tell me why?", called [...] "I Don't Like Mondays". It was released in July 1979 and was number 1 for four weeks in the UK, and was the band's biggest hit in their native Ireland. Although it did not make the Top 40 in the U.S. it still received extensive radio airplay (outside of the San Diego area) despite the Spencer family's efforts to prevent it. Geldof has later mentioned that [...] " [...] wrote to me saying she was glad she'd done it because I'd made her famous, which is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to live with." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} the recording sessions for [...] "Eureka", {{he returned to}} the recording studio to work on the rest of [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion". During these sessions, Yamaguchi improvised an entirely different song, purely using musical techniques that he personally wanted to explore. The composition, [...] "Good-Bye", reminded Yamaguchi of the period when he first started making music. Originally he saw the song as an album track or a B-side, but found the melody had consumed him, and his confidence in the song grew. Yamaguchi felt distressed that he could not complete [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] during his sickness and exhaustion, and instead developed a strong desire to release [...] "Good-Bye" [...] in its place. Yamaguchi felt embarrassed at this, seeing it as selfishness as a musician. While talking to Tatsuya Nomura (the band's executive producer) about the situation, Nomura reassured him that although suddenly changing plans were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> it was necessary for him to address his feelings about releasing [...] "Good-Bye". Yamaguchi asked Victor Entertainment's management to liaise with Tōshin High School, to see if they would accept [...] "Good-Bye" [...] in the place of the already submitted chorus of [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion". Though they liked the song, the commercial had already been completed, so they were unable to replace the song, and began airing the commercials with the original song in September 2013.|$|E
