5|$|In 1904, {{there was}} a {{religious}} revival (known by some as the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> converting to nonconformist and Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church. The Apostolic Church holds its annual Apostolic Conference in Swansea each year, usually in August.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{underground}} newspapers also {{formed a}} big part of resistance activity. The newspapers provided information censored in the approved press and also patriotic propaganda. Some underground papers, most notably La Libre Belgique (The Free Belgium) and De Vlaamsche Leeuw (The Flemish Lion), could reach large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Underground newspaper were produced in a variety of formats and geographic areas, sometimes targeting specific demographics.

Diseases like diabetes, asthma, goitre and other thyroid disorders were found in large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Tropical diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya are prevalent in Kolkata, though their incidence is decreasing. Kolkata is one of the districts in India with a high number of people with AIDS; it has been designated a district prone to high risk.|$|E
5|$|Gatwick Airport, {{nowadays}} one of Britain's busiest international airports, {{opened on}} the edge of the town in the 1940s, encouraging commercial and industrial growth. After the Second World War, the British Government planned to move large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England. The New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of one of these. A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town over a few decades.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, {{a status}} quo {{agreement}} {{issued by the}} mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up {{from time to time}} when large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> gathered to pray.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 the centenary of {{the branch}} saw a revival of {{interest}} in the line. Over the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E
5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level.

Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> exposed and the public health toll it takes.

5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
5|$|The panic was {{triggered}} by the failed attempt in October 1907 to corner the market on stock of the United Copper Company. When this bid failed, banks that had lent money to the cornering scheme suffered runs that later spread to affiliated banks and trusts, leading a week later to {{the downfall of the}} Knickerbocker Trust Company—New York City's third-largest trust. The collapse of the Knickerbocker spread fear throughout the city's trusts as regional banks withdrew reserves from New York City banks. Panic extended across the nation as vast <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> withdrew deposits from their regional banks.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in the gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E

30|$|Summarizing the above, for crowd {{management}} purposes {{we need to}} be able to reliably distinguish between a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different density states (e.g. less than 2, around 2, around 4, around 6 persons per square meter, etc.). How does that relate to the margin of error described above? The answer is: through spatial resolution. The margin of error is given as absolute <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Integrating the density over an area also gives us an absolute <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The larger the area the larger not only the absolute <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> but also the absolute <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> by which the relevant density states differ.|$|R
