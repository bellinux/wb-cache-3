40|$|Easy {{and fast}} {{detection}} of diseases is now demand {{of time for}} monitoring the health conditions and sustaining the ever-improving lifestyle in both of the developed as well as developing countries. Biosensors are analytical devices that transform a biological response into an electrical signal. Biosensors are extremely specific and are independent of physical parameters such as pH and temperature and should be ecofriendly. Development of biosensors such as enzyme sensors, immune-sensors, microbial sensors, ion channel sensors etc. is one of fast growing sectors and is being actively promoted world-wide. Some {{of the most commonly}} used biosensors include Enzyme sensors for the measurement of blood glucose level using glucose oxidase activity measurement, immune-sensors and ELISA. Since detector is one of the important part of biosensors, fluorescence detection has a great potential for the detection of trace amount of analytes due to high sensitivity measurement as compared with the optical absorption especially for very dilute samples. Fluorescent biosensors {{plays a key role in}} discovery of drugs and in cancer. Single chain FRET biosensor is potential example which consists of a pair of auto fluorescent protein (AFP`s) where fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs between them when brought close together. Conventionally, FRET based biosensor using visible fluorescent molecules is influenced by auto-fluorescence from the clinical samples like blood, serum or other body fluids leading to low signal to noise (SN) ratio and attainment of high sensitivity is hampered significantly. A FRET biosensor utilizing NIR fluorescent and quenchers can easily detect resulting fluorescence signals from the body of several 10 cm from a detector outside the body with high SN ratio (high sensitivity). This means that it is very suitable for pathological imaging in vivo. In order to increase the sensitivity of the biosensor using <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> FRET, it is desirable that the wavelengths of the dye absorption and fluorescence emission should perfectly match. It is also necessary to adjust the peptide sequence of the enzyme active site so that the position of the quenching group and the fluorescent group are within the Forster radius. Protein and peptide biosensors are manufactured easily through synthetic chemistry followed by enzymatic labelling using synthetic fluorophores. A biosensor based on NIR-FRET system is advantageous for high sensitivity in terms of not being easily influenced by auto-fluorescence of water or biomolecules and high penetrability of <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>rays.</b> At the same time, by changing the peptide sequence between the dyes having fluorescent groups and quenching groups in different wavelength ranges, it is possible to control the absorption wavelength specifically for the enzyme. This means that simultaneous measurement of multiple specimens is possible, and the detected image leads to the construction of a disease database enabling multifaceted examination as a disease pattern and diagnosis with higher accuracy. By immobilizing to the substrate, it can be applied to onchip biosensor in-vitro too. Fluorescent biosensors are potentially employed for early detection of biomarkers in clinical and molecular diagnostics for disease progress monitoring and response to treatment. In the development of <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> FRET biosensor, development of NIR dyes (fluorescent group and quenching group) and design of enzyme recognition site are necessary. Current thesis gives the insights about the synthesis and characterization of far-red sensitive squaraine dyes with varying wavelengths and NIR cyanine dyes. Apart from this, an effort has been made to evaluate amino acid sequences that are selective for specific enzymes and incorporating them to develop model NIR-FRET system. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号：生工博甲第 301 号 学位授与年月日：平成 29 年 9 月 22 日 1 Point-of-Care Biosensor Systems their applications as diagnostic tools for healthcare| 2 Instrumentation and Characterization| 3 Synthesis, Photophysical Characterization and Binding Interactions of Far Red Sensitive Symmetrical Squaraine Dyes with BSA| 4 Synthesis, Photophysical Characterization and Binding Interactions of Unsymmetrical Cyanine Dyes with BSA| 5 <b>Near</b> <b>Infrared</b> Fluorescence Detection of Elastase Enzyme Activity Using Peptide-Bound Unsymmetrical Squaraine Dye九州工業大学平成 29 年...|$|R

40|$|The latest {{generation}} of high quality, narrow gap, superconducting tunnel junctions (STJs) exhibits a steady-state and time-dependent behavior which cannot be described satisfactorily by previous treatments of nonequilibrium quasiparticle (qp) dynamics. These effects are particularly evident in experiments using STJs as detectors of photons, {{over the range}} from <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> to x <b>ray.</b> In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the spectral and temporal evolution of the nonequilibrium qp and phonon distributions in such STJs excited by single photons, {{over a wide range}} of excitation energy, bias voltage, and temperature. By solving the coupled set of kinetic equations describing the interacting excitations, we show that the nonequilibrium qp distribution created by the initial photoabsorption does not decay directly back to the initial undisturbed state in thermal equilibrium. Instead, it undergoes a rapid adiabatic relaxation to a long-lived, excited state, the spectral distribution of which is nonthermal, maintained by a balance between qp creation, recombination, and trapping. The model is able to describe successfully photoabsorption data taken on several different aluminum STJs, using a single set of parameters. Of particular note is the conclusion that the local traps responsible for qp loss are situated specifically in the region of Nb contacts...|$|R

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of earth surface processes at {{a global scale}} requires high temporal frequency remote sensing observations provided up to now by moderate spatial resolution sensors (from 250 m to 7 kin). Non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables derived from remote sensing data can be biased by the surface spatial heterogeneity within the moderate spatial resolution pixel. Quantifying this surface spatial heterogeneity is thus required to correct non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables. The first step in this process is to properly characterize the scale of spatial variation of the processes structuring the landscape. Since the description of land surface processes generally involves various spectral bands, a multivariate approach to characterize the surface spatial heterogeneity from multi-spectral remote sensing observations has to be established. This work aims at quantifying the landscape spatial heterogeneity captured by red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> high spatial resolution images using direct and cross-variograms modeled together with the geostatistical linear model of coregionalization. This model quantifies the overall spatial variability and correlation of red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> reflectances over the scene. In addition, it provides an explicit understanding of the landscape spatial structures captured by red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> reflectances and is thus appropriate to describe landscapes composed of areas with contrasted red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> spectral properties. The application of the linear model of coregionalization to 18 contrasted landscapes provides a spatial signature of red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> spectral properties characterizing each type of landscape. Low vegetation cover sites are characterized by positive spatial correlation between red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared.</b> The mosaic pattern of vegetation fields and bare soil fields over crop sites generates high and negative spatial correlation between red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> and increases the spatial variability of red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared.</b> On forest sites, the important amount of vegetation limits the spatial variability of red and the shadow effects mainly captured by <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> induce a low and positive spatial correlation between red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared.</b> Finally, the linear model of coregionalization applied to red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> is shown to be {{more powerful than the}} univariate variogram modeling applied to NDVI because the second order stationarity hypothesis on which variogram modeling relies is more frequently verified for red and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> than for NDVI...|$|R

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> spectroscopic fiber optic probe was placed over the hypothenar eminence. Reference Po 2 and pH sensors were inserted in the abductor digiti minimi (V). Data were collected every 30 secs during surgery and for 6 hrs following cardiopulmonary bypass.

The analysis of the S 192 imagery and digital tape data from five EREP passes, two from the SL- 2 mission and three from the SL- 4 mission, indicates {{a sharp drop in}} reflectance of snow in the <b>near</b> <b>infrared,</b> with snow becoming essentially nonreflective in Bands 11 (1. 55 - 1. 75 microns) and 12 (2. 10 - 2. 35 microns). The results are in good agreement with the results of laboratory experiments. Two potential applications to snow mapping of measurements in the <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> spectral region are possible: (1) the use of a <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> band in conjunction with a visible band to distinguish automatically between snow and water droplet clouds, and (2) the use of one or more <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> bands to detect areas of melting snow...|$|R
