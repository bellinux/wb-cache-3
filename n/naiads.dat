5|$|Immature {{insects that}} go through {{incomplete}} metamorphosis are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also <b>naiads.</b> Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are not developed until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The <b>naiads</b> of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. <b>Naiads</b> can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Epicoxal hypothesis: This theory {{suggested}} that a possible origin for insect wings {{might have been the}} movable abdominal gills found in many aquatic insects, such as on <b>naiads</b> of mayflies. According to this theory these tracheal gills, which started their way as exits of the respiratory system and over time were modified into locomotive purposes, eventually developed into wings. The tracheal gills are equipped with little winglets that perpetually vibrate and have their own tiny straight muscles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Naiad</b> - The <b>naiad</b> {{is small}} about 16 to 20 mm in length. It has the typical slender shape of an {{immature}} damselfly. The <b>naiad</b> is light to dark brown in color.|$|R

5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic <b>naiads</b> of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly <b>naiads</b> use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
25|$|The <b>naiads</b> are top predators {{in their}} aquatic habitats, feeding on the larvae of {{mosquitoes}} and other flies, tadpoles, and the <b>naiads</b> {{of their own}} and other odonate species.|$|E

Then on 10 September <b>Naiad</b> detained the American ship Wells, of eleven Men and 205 tons. Wells was sailing from Salem to Marseilles with a cargo of sugar and coffee.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, <b>Naiad,</b> {{like many}} other Leanders, {{took part in the}} Fleet Review, of the Royal Navy at Spithead in celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. <b>Naiad</b> was {{positioned}} between Brighton and her sister-ship Andromeda. In 1979 <b>Naiad</b> deployed to the Far East once again.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} damselflies, the young—known as <b>naiads,</b> nymphs, or larvae—are carnivorous. The most {{ubiquitous}} prey {{in the tree}} holes they inhabit are mosquito larvae, but they will also feed on tadpoles, syrphid fly and chironomid fly larvae, and other odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) <b>naiads.</b> The three leaflike caudal lamellae {{at the end of}} the abdomen, which serve as gills, are broad and elaborately folded, an adaptation to intermittent low oxygen availability in its habitat. Each lamella has a conspicuous white spot, making Megaloprepus easy to distinguish from other tree-hole damselflies.|$|E

25|$|Potamides , (Greek: Ποταμίδες), were a type {{of water}} nymphs of Greco-Roman mythology. They were {{assigned}} as a class of nymphs of fresh water known as <b>naiads,</b> and as such belonged to a category that presided over rivers and streams.|$|E
50|$|In January 1824, <b>Naiad</b> and Cameleon visited Algiers, {{following}} {{a violation of}} the British consul's offices, in order to demand satisfaction from the Dey. By 31 January it was apparent that British citizens living in Algiers were no longer safe so they were taken on board. On departing from the harbour, <b>Naiad</b> sighted the Algerine corvette Tripoli, which had recently committed depredations on Spanish trade, in contravention of the Treaty of 1816. Fire from <b>Naiad</b> reduced Tripoli to a wreck. A party from Cameleon boarded Tripoli before <b>Naiad</b> ordered them to abandon the vessel. Captain Spencer of <b>Naiad</b> was particularly pleased to discover that by capturing the Algerine he had liberated 17 Spaniards that were being carried into slavery.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout most of 1802 <b>Naiad</b> was in {{ordinary}} but on 9 September orders came down {{for her to}} be commissioned in place of [...] to be paid off and for <b>Naiad</b> to be commissioned in Fisgards place.

25|$|As H.J. Rose states, all {{the names}} for various classes of nymphs are plural {{feminine}} adjectives agreeing with the substantive nymphai, {{and there was no}} single classification that could be seen as canonical and exhaustive. Thus, the classes of nymphs tend to overlap, which complicates the task of precise classification. Rose mentions dryads and hamadryads as nymphs of trees generally, meliai as nymphs of ash trees, and <b>naiads</b> as nymphs of water, but no others specifically.|$|E
25|$|Several factors make large tree holes more {{valuable}} to Megaloprepus than small ones. Not only can their greater volume accommodate more <b>naiads</b> at a time, {{they have a}} higher density of prey {{in the form of}} tadpoles and mosquito larvae; this allows the <b>naiads</b> to grow more rapidly and reach adulthood sooner. In forests with a dry season, larger tree holes can last nearly a month longer before drying out completely. As a result, large tree holes can produce three cohorts per season, totalling perhaps a few dozen new adults, while only one or two emerge from a small hole. Large tree holes also give Megaloprepus better chances of surviving to emerge if one of its slower-growing relatives in genus Mecistogaster is already present. In a tree hole small enough to be effectively patrolled by a single naiad, the first species to hatch is likely to eat all newcomers, but in a large one Megaloprepus can escape long enough to outgrow and eventually eat an older resident. Finally, probably due to the greater abundance of prey, larger tree holes produce larger males that will be better able to defend a territory themselves when they reach reproductive maturity.|$|E

50|$|Brittle <b>naiad</b> was {{introduced}} to the United States, where it is considered an invasive species or noxious weed, in the 1900s. Brittle <b>naiad</b> in the United States is established in the Mid-Atlantic States. Established populations are found as far west as Oklahoma and Ontario, Canada in the north. The presence of this plant is a problem because its dense growth covers wide areas, inhibiting the growth of native species of aquatic macrophytes. The thick, clustering growths of brittle <b>naiad</b> can make fishing access or the operation of a boat difficult in a pond or lake. Brittle <b>naiad</b> may spread to new areas by stem fragments carried on a boat's hull, deck, propeller, or trailer. Control measures for brittle <b>naiad</b> include the use of aquatic herbicides, but application of chemicals may not destroy the seeds. Grass carp are another widely used control measure and have been known to readily consume brittle <b>naiad</b> plants. Mechanical harvesting of brittle <b>naiad</b> is difficult, as the brittle stems readily break and are easily disbursed throughout the system. As with most invasive species, prevention of an infestation is easier than eradication.|$|R
50|$|The Napier <b>Naiad</b> was a British {{turboprop}} gas-turbine engine {{designed and}} built by D. Napier & Son in the late 1940s. It was the company's first gas turbine engine. A twin version known as the Coupled <b>Naiad</b> was developed but both engine projects were cancelled before finding a market. The <b>Naiad</b> was also used, in adapted form, in the Napier Nomad turbo-compound engine design.|$|R
5000|$|Next, <b>Naiad</b> and [...] {{captured}} a French brig from the Straits and a Dutch sloop, {{also from the}} Straits, carrying drugs and medicines. <b>Naiad</b> and Doris also took a French corvette from Gorée laden with gum and ivory.

25|$|La magicienne premiered on 17 March 1858 at the Théâtre de l'Académie Impériale de Musique in Paris in {{a lavish}} {{production}} attended by Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie. The elaborate stage settings {{were created by}} a team of designers and painters that included Joseph Nolau, Auguste-Alfred Rubé, Joseph Thierry and Charles Cambon. As is traditional in the grand opera genre, the production contained several ballets, including one in the second act depicting a human chess game. The supernatural themes were reflected in several scenes populated by large numbers of mythical creatures. One of the ballets in the first act specified 40 fairies and 6 genies. The fourth act ballet had an even greater variety of creatures: 18 nymphs, 18 <b>naiads</b> and sirens, 14 fairies, 8 genies, and an assortment of butterflies, salamanders, gnomes, and ondines.|$|E
25|$|The Magician's Nephew {{suggests}} {{two opposing}} approaches to nature, a good approach associated with Aslan as creator and an evil approach associated with human deviation from divine intentions and the harmony {{of a natural}} order. On the one hand there is the beauty of Aslan's creation of Narnia, which is suggested as having a natural order {{by the use of}} musical harmony to bring landscapes and living things into being. There is also a distinct order to the process of creation, from earth to plants to animal, which evokes the concept of The Great Chain of Being. Lewis himself was a strong believer in the intrinsic value of nature for itself, rather than as a resource to be exploited. This is perhaps reflected in how Aslan also gives speech to spiritual aspects of nature, such <b>naiads</b> in the water and dryads in the trees. Andrew Ketterley and Jadis represent an opposite, evil approach of bending the forces of nature to human will for the purpose of self gain. They see nature solely as a resource to use for their plans and thus disturb and destroy the natural order.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, Catherine {{increased}} {{the element of}} dance in her festive entertainments, and it became the norm for a major ballet to climax each series of magnificences. The Ballet Comique de la Reine, devised under Catherine's influence, by Queen Louise for the Joyeuse Magnificences of 1581, is regarded by historians as {{the moment when the}} ballet de cour assumed the character of a new art form. The theme of the entertainment was an invocation of cosmic forces to aid the monarchy, which at that time was threatened by the rebellion not only of Huguenots but of many Catholic nobles. Men were shown as reduced to beasts by Circe, who held court in a garden {{at one end of the}} hall. Louise and her ladies, costumed as <b>naiads,</b> entered on a chariot designed as a fountain and then danced a ballet of thirteen geometric figures. After being turned to stone by Circe, they were freed to dance a ballet of forty geometric figures. Four groups of dancers, each wearing a different-coloured costume, moved through a sequence of patterns, including squares, triangles, circles, and spirals.|$|E
50|$|On 31 January 1804 Captain J. Pellew was {{appointed}} to command <b>Naiad</b> while Wallis was dangerously ill at home in Storehouse. At some point Captain Thomas Dundas took command of <b>Naiad</b> in 1804.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 April 1798 <b>Naiad</b> {{captured}} the Mary and Elizabeth. Sixteen days later, <b>Naiad,</b> [...] and [...] were in sight when [...] {{captured the}} French gun-brig Arrogante.
