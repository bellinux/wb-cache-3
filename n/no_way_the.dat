5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Torch {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during the torch relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights {{the fire in the}} stadium's cauldron. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.|$|E

25|$|In January 1995, it was {{proposed}} that {{a joint venture}} would be created between LKAB, SJ and NSB. The Norwegian Union of Railway Workers protested the proposal, and the Norwegian Centre Party stated that their feared {{this was the first}} step into converting NSB to a limited company. By February the negotiations were in a deadlock, and SJ and NSB stated that they were issuing an invitation to tender for a new class of locomotives. In March, LKAB again applied for permit to operate their own trains in Norway and stated that they would only join a joint venture if they were the majority owner. On 8 June, LKAB established a Swedish and a Norwegian subsidiary dedicated to rail transport. This would bypass the rationale provided by the Ministry of Transport in denying them traffic rights, and LKAB stated that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian authorities now could deny them such rights, given EU Directive 91/440.|$|E
25|$|Gordon and his Delta Force sniper {{teammates}} Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart and Sergeant First Class Brad Hallings, {{who were}} providing sniper cover from the air, {{wanted to be}} dropped at the second crash site {{in order to protect}} the four critically wounded crew, despite the fact that large numbers of armed, hostile Somalis were converging on the area. Mission commanders denied Gordon's request, saying that the situation was already too dangerous for the three Delta snipers to effectively protect the Blackhawk crew from the ground. Command's position was that the snipers could be of more assistance by continuing to provide air cover. Gordon, however, concluded that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Black Hawk crew could survive on their own, and repeated his request twice until he finally received permission. Sergeant First Class Brad Hallings had assumed control of a minigun after a crew chief was injured and was not inserted with Shughart and Gordon.|$|E
25|$|Around March 29, 2010, Joran van der Sloot {{contacted}} Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. Kelly said that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On May 10, Van der Sloot accepted the amount of $15,000 by wire transfer from Birmingham to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Natalee's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham later claimed in a joint statement that they were working as quickly as possible and that the Lima murder was in <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> result of them allowing Van der Sloot to flee Aruba with the extorted money.|$|E

500|$|When the STAC {{plans were}} {{presented}} to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that [...] "the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including {{the recent history of}} the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £150million [...] to turn out much too low." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} commemoration, Larson's opponents from 1984 {{were invited}} back to be contestants on Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck playing against Larson's brother, James, with Tomarken {{returning}} to host the question round. Despite {{the fact that the}} board was now more random (host Todd Newton called it [...] "Larson-proof"), and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> same trick could have been performed, Long and Litras (who had remarried and took the surname Litras-Dakan) still lost. When James Larson hit the Big Bank space on his first spin of the first round, Long proceeded to joke with host Newton that he had [...] "seen this before". At one point, Litras-Dakan advanced to first place before hitting a Double Whammy shortly afterward, effectively giving James Larson the win.

[...] Rothbard {{warned that the}} mid-East conflict would draw the U.S. into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and [...] opposed U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard criticized the Camp David Accords for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In his essay, [...] "War Guilt in the Middle East," [...] Rothbard states that Israel refused [...] "to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them." [...] He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying: On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who {{come from all over}} the world, and who claim the entire land area as [...] "given" [...] to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no [...] "peace" [...] in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one.

500|$|The company {{contemplated}} {{purchasing the}} Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen {{to add the}} team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort {{that would be required}} to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. [...] In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. [...] A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. [...] On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close {{at the end of the}} year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. It is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying [...] "the NFL is telling them that if you want an NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay."
