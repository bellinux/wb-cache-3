25|$|With stores mainly {{based in}} the North of England, the newly focused food retail group {{expanded}} further south in 1989 by buying the large format stores of rival Gateway Superstores for £705million. City estimates suggested that Asda had overpaid by around £300 million for 61 of the largest Gateway stores, two undeveloped store sites and a distribution centre. That was far above the <b>net</b> <b>book</b> <b>value</b> of the locations {{some of which were}} poorly sited. Asda has subsequently relocated or rebuilt more than 30 of the original Gateway stores since the late 1990s. This move overstretched the company and by 1991, it found itself in serious financial trouble and saddled with £1 billion worth of debt The situation was so dire Asda was close to breaching its banking covenants and came very close to bankruptcy. The city at that point widely regarded Asda as a basket case and predicted an early demise for the chain. As a result, it was forced to raise money from shareholders in both 1991, and 1993, through two major rights issues. Asda was back in the black by late 1993, and completely transformed and revived by 1995, {{in one of the most}} successful turnaround stories in British retail history under the leadership of Archie Norman, who later became a front bench Conservative MP. CEO from 1991, Norman was chairman of the company during the period 1996–99, and remodelled the store along the lines of the world's largest retailer, Walmart, sending protégé Allan Leighton to Bentonville, Arkansas to assess and photograph the systems and marketing deployed by Walmart.|$|E

After controlling for nonlinearities and stock price inefficiencies, we find that the value relevance of "core" accounting earnings has not declined. A possible exception is found for small stocks.

The similar ratio {{is also used}} in the study of Altman (1968) on US manufacturing companies. In the current study market value of equity is replaced by <b>book</b> <b>value</b> of equity. The current study uses data of both publicly and privately held firms. In order to calculate market value of equity, stock price data (Altman, 1993) is required. The same principle is employed while re-estimating Altman’s model. The ratio is found to be most effective predictor of bankruptcy than a similar, more commonly used ratio: <b>net</b> worth/total <b>book</b> <b>value</b> of debt. The indicator explains how much the firm’s asset can decline in value before the liabilities exceed the assets, and the firm becomes bankrupt.

Greece is a code-law country with strong tax conformity, bank orientation and conservative accounting rules which {{have a negative effect on}} the value relevance of financial statements. As IFRS adoption promotes fair value accounting and weakens the link between taxation and accounting rules we expect earnings and <b>book</b> <b>value</b> to become more value relevant ceteris paribus. We report that the adoption of IFRS positively affected the value relevance of consolidated <b>net</b> income and <b>book</b> <b>value</b> although it had no effect on their unconsolidated counterparts and that consolidated accounting numbers are by far more value relevant than unconsolidated ones in both periods and, unexpectedly, this superiority is more pronounced after IFRS adoption. We also report that disaggregating net income increases the explanatory power of the earnings – <b>book</b> <b>value</b> capitalization (EBVC) model. Finally, we report that although the overall explanatory power of the model increases, the incremental explanatory power of both net income and financial income decreases. These last findings question the expected benefits of specific IFRS rules concerning the measurement of these income components. Nevertheless, assuming that the total impact of IFRS adoption is captured by the overall explanatory power of the models which actually increased, we conclude that mandating IFRS may prove beneficial even in an unfavorable context. ...|$|R

We justify modeling price in terms of <b>book</b> <b>value</b> and dividends in two ways. First, using Modigliani and Miller's (1959) argument, dividends may have a stronger correlation with permanent earnings than reported earnings. Second, we derive a model of price in terms of <b>book</b> <b>value</b> and dividends from basic analytical relationships. Three sets of findings are reported. First, overall, the variables, <b>book</b> <b>value</b> and dividends, have almost the same explanatory power as <b>book</b> <b>value</b> and reported earnings.
