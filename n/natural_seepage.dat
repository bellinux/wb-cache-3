In 1966, ARCO built Platform Holly, in 211 ft of water approximately two miles southwest of Coal Oil Point, and began drilling wells into the various zones in the South Ellwood Offshore field. Peak production from the field was in 1984. Mobil operated Platform Holly until 1997, at which point Venoco, Inc. acquired all rights to the field. Currently three pipelines - one oil, one gas, and one for utilities - connect the platform to the processing plant on the mainland. In addition, an oil pipeline transports oil from [...] "tents" [...] constructed over some of the natural seeps on the ocean floor to the processing plant. Leakage from the natural seeps near Platform Holly has decreased substantially, probably from the decrease in reservoir pressure from the oil and gas produced at the platform.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the development of}} four image processing algorithms that combine spectral and spatial information {{for the detection of}} complex objects on the Earth' surface by remote sensing. Complex objects are objects that are composed of several smaller parts. These smaller parts may not be spectrally unique in themselves and lack a statistical coherence, thus creating a problem for image processing techniques that operate per pixel. As the human mind is often capable of processing and recognizing such objects by combining spectral and spatial information, a solution to this problem is an image processing technique that is based on the same qualitative reasoning. The thematic focus is on the detection of <b>natural</b> hydrocarbon <b>seepages.</b> <b>Natural</b> hydrocarbon <b>seepages</b> are non-unique in both their spectral and spatial characteristics. The infrared spectrum of oil is easily confused with other bituminous surfaces such as asphalt. The dominant anomaly that results from the presence of hydrocarbons is a circular halo of bare soil. The first algorithm measured the shape of a homogeneous object, based on relations between the area and perimeter of an object and its convex hull. The second algorithm was a template matching algorithm that matched a miniature image to a remotely sensed image. Both algorithms were based on existing techniques and were shown to perform well in combining spectral and spatial information. It is however concluded that both technigues were not enough versatile for the detection of seepage-induced halos. The third and fourth algorithms were specifically designed for the detection of seepage-induced halos. The third algorithm aimed to detect spectrally homogeneous pixels on a circle. The fourth algorithm was an extension of the third, aimed to detect incomplete circles with variable radii and was based on Hough transforms. Results showed that these algorithms can detect halos of bare soil that result from seeping hydrocarbons. It was finally concluded that the knowledge-based spatial-spectral approach is an improvement of over traditional remote sensing image processing methods in the detection of anomalies resulting from <b>natural</b> hydrocarbon <b>seepages.</b> The concept of the presented algorithms in general and the design of these algorithms in particular allow them to be applied to other remote sensing research...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} two widely {{dissimilar}} spaceborne imaging sensors to detect surface oil accumulations {{in the marine}} environment has been evaluated using broadly different techniques.

These enhanced images have then been compared to surface verification data gathered by aerial reconnaissance during the October 15, 1975, Landsat overpass. A similar evaluation of oil slick imaging potential has been made for digitally enhanced Seasat-A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from July 18, 1979.

40|$|Natural {{hydrocarbon}} seepage is {{a process}} recognised to occur in varying intensity along most continental shelves. The seafloor and seismic expression of such seepage sites includes gas chimneys as well as surface and buried mud volcanoes (Milkov, 2000), pock marks (Hovland & Judd, 1988) and carbonate mounds (Hovland & Thomsen, 1997). Major consequences of hydrocarbon seepage include the support of diverse biological communities, the potential to reduce the stability of continental margin sediments and, importantly, the flux of carbon into the hydrosphere and atmosphere (Judd et al., 1997). The proportion of methane reaching the atmosphere due to <b>natural</b> <b>seepage</b> has until recently been assumed to be insignificant (IPCC, 1990). However, first assessments of the flux of gas from seabed seepages indicate that the geological sources of atmospheric methane may be more significant than is generally acknowledged. Judd et al.

40|$|Hydrocarbons can {{be found}} in many {{different}} habitats and represent an important carbon source for microbes. As fossil fuels, they are also an important economical resource and through <b>natural</b> <b>seepage</b> or accidental release they can be major pollutants. DNA-specific stains and molecular probes bind to hydrocarbons, causing massive background fluorescence, thereby hampering cell enumeration. The cell extraction procedure of Kallmeyer et al.

Here we present a modified extraction method in which the hydrocarbons are removed prior to cell extraction. Due to the reduced background fluorescence the microscopic image becomes clearer, making cell identification, and enumeration much easier. Consequently, the resulting cell counts from oily samples treated according to our new protocol are significantly higher than those treated according to Kallmeyer et al. (2008). We tested different amounts of a variety of solvents for their ability to remove hydrocarbons and found that n-hexane and – in samples containing more mature oils – methanol, delivered the best results.

40|$|Polar {{petroleum}} components enter marine environments through {{oil spills}} and <b>natural</b> <b>seepages</b> each year. Lately, they are receiving increased attention {{due to their}} potential toxicity to marine organisms and persistence in the environment. We conducted a laboratory experiment and employed state-of-the-art Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to characterize the polar petroleum components within two operationally-defined seawater fractions: the water-soluble fraction (WSF), which includes only water-soluble molecules, and the water-accommodated fraction (WAF), which includes WSF and microscopic oil droplets. Our results show that compounds with higher heteroatom (N, S, O) to carbon ratios (NSO:C) than the parent oil were selectively partitioned into seawater in both fractions, reflecting the influence of polarity on aqueous solubility. WAF and WSF were compositionally distinct, with unique distributions of compounds {{across a range of}} hydrophobicity. These compositional differences will likely result in disparate impacts on environmental health and organismal toxicity, and thus highlight the need to distinguish between these often-interchangeable terminologies in toxicology studies.
