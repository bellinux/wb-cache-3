5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the picket lines and <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E

50|$|Hispanic Television Network (HTVN) is a defunct family-oriented {{television}} network {{that was once}} the third-largest Spanish-language network in the United States, after Univision and Telemundo.

5|$|In {{subsequent}} television contracts, the merged NFL required language which obligated the <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> show {{games to}} completion {{in the road}} team's television market. Other major professional sports leagues in North America, the NCAA, and even the International Olympic Committee also shared the same rule in regards to their own respective TV contracts. On November 23, 1975, NBC planned to air the heavily promoted children's film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory at 7:00p.m. Eastern, right after a game between the Raiders and Washington Redskins. When the game went into overtime, NBC stayed with it for almost 45minutes and then joined the Wonka film in progress, prompting angry calls from parents.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was also}} a guest of human rights festival One world, {{organized}} by a non-profit humanitarian organization People In Need. A film by a Swiss director Barbara Miller Forbidden Voices: How to Start a Revolution with a Laptop was among the films shown during the festival. The film presents three women - one of them being Sánchez - who use blogs and social <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> spread information from their countries living under authoritarian regimes, thus fighting for women rights or human rights in general. Sánchez was also invited to a discussion at the Charles University about independent journalism in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work. Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road <b>networks.</b> <b>To</b> reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city.

5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested in plant ice themselves. New tools were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul's {{strategic}} {{position on the}} historic Silk Road, rail <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since {{the establishment of the}} Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established {{at the end of the}} 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.|$|E

5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E

The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June; Braathens SAFE bought 50% of the company's scheduled division, Transwede Airways, with an option to purchase the rest in 1997. The companies planned to integrate their <b>networks,</b> <b>to</b> allow connection between Braathens SAFE's and Transwede flights at Stockholm. Services to Stockholm started on 6 November; after three months, the airline had captured 14% of the Oslo–Stockholm market. In 1996, Braathens SAFE had a 51% domestic market share in Norway, transporting 9.5 million passengers.|$|E

5|$|Since the Links' deployment, {{there have}} been several {{concerns}} about the kiosks' features.

There are also concerns with cybercriminals possibly hijacking the Links, or renaming their personal wireless <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> the same name as LinkNYC's network, in order to steal LinkNYC users' data. In addition, prior to September 2016, the tablets of the Links could be used to browse the Internet. In summer 2016, concerns arose about the Link tablets' browsers being used for illicit purposes; despite the implementation of content filters on the kiosks, the illicit activities continued, and the browsers were disabled.|$|E
5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} {{aircraft}} are transmitted by the aircraft's Satellite Data Unit (SDU) and relayed via satellite to a ground station, {{where they are}} routed to other communication <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> reach their destination. Messages may also {{be sent to the}} aircraft, in reverse order. When passing through the satellite, the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the satellite, leaving the satellite at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the aircraft are made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The ground station then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment to be processed. The ground station keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the newly}} formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English {{initiatives}} combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy {{paved the way for}} the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway—opened to the public.|$|E
