25|$|Long ago, just as today, woodworkers {{required}} a more helpful {{way to keep}} the wood in place while it was being worked. A device was <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> could be used effectively on different sizes of wood. Probably the first such device used two stops - at least one of which was adjustable for position - and wedges between them and the work to fix it in place. This is still a cheap and effective method for holding the work.|$|E
25|$|Molten salts can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and corrosivity increases with temperature. For the primary cooling loop, a material is <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, operating experience is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C thermochemical production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and refractory metal based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E
25|$|For most exchanges, forward {{contracts}} were standard at the time. However, most forward contracts {{were not}} honored {{by both the}} buyer and the seller. For instance, if the buyer of a corn forward contract made an agreement to buy corn, {{and at the time}} of delivery the price of corn differed dramatically from the original contract price, either the buyer or the seller would back out. Additionally, the forward contracts market was very illiquid and an exchange was <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{humanitarian organisation}} Médecins Sans Frontières originated {{in response to}} the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.|$|E
25|$|A second {{opportunity}} for globalization of neuroinformatics {{occurred when the}} participating governments of the Mega Science Forum (MSF) of the OECD {{were asked if they}} had any new scientific initiatives to bring forward for scientific cooperation around the globe. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy requested that agencies in the federal government meet at NIH to decide if cooperation were <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> would be of global benefit. The NIH held a series of meetings in which proposals from different agencies were discussed. The proposal recommendation from the U.S. for the MSF was a combination of the NSF and NIH proposals. Jim Edwards of NSF supported databases and data-sharing in the area of biodiversity; Koslow proposed the HPG as a model for sharing neuroscientific data, with the new moniker of neuroinformatics.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} four months, Wallace's {{campaign}} proceeded extremely well. However, it {{came to an abrupt}} halt on May 15, 1972, when he was shot five times by Arthur Bremer while campaigning at the Laurel Shopping Center in Laurel, Maryland, {{at a time when he}} was receiving high ratings in national opinion polls. Bremer was seen at a Wallace rally in Wheaton, Maryland, earlier that day and two days earlier at a rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Wallace was hit in the abdomen and chest, and one of the bullets lodged in Wallace's spinal column, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. A five-hour operation was <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> evening, and Wallace had to receive several pints of blood in order to survive. Three others who were wounded in the shooting also survived.|$|E

25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
25|$|An {{obvious way}} to {{generate}} permutations of n is to generate {{values for the}} Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to n!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires n operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list, both require (for different reasons) about n2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With n likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is <b>needed)</b> <b>that</b> is not {{too much of a}} problem, {{but it turns out that}} both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in O(n log n) time.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 2010, former Massachusetts State Police Detective Brian Howe {{broke his}} silence about the case. Howe, {{who retired in}} 2009 and no longer lives in Massachusetts, was the lead {{investigator}} for the state police in the Bishop case. He said he looks forward to addressing the judicial inquest into the shooting, and stands by his 1987 report. He had agreed with Captain Theodore Buker, the late Braintree lead investigator, that the shooting was accidental. Howe {{said that he was}} assigned to the case nearly two hours after the shooting and immediately called Braintree. Buker told him {{that he would not be}} <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> day and that Bishop had already been released into her parents' custody. Howe stated that Braintree police never informed him that Bishop had later allegedly accosted employees at a car dealership at gunpoint, demanding a car. Howe said that he repeatedly requested the December 6 incident reports from the Braintree police, but never received them.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers {{even more than the}} old plan. The IBO found that the new 421-a plan would cost add $120 million per year, or $1.2 billion over ten years, to the overall cost of the program. This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> extra money to make up for expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development companies should have to pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a program should instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is <b>needed</b> <b>that</b> draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E
