40|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} that courts use to determine an appropriate statutory damage award in a copyright infringement case is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> <b>of</b> a copyright. How does a court determine the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> when one infringing article has been printed six times in over one hundred copies of a magazine? Before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect, many courts adhered to the 2 ̆ 2 multiplicity doctrine 2 ̆ 2 and would have awarded statutory damages in the above scenarios {{for each of the}} six times that the infringing article was printed or the infringing song was played. Post- 1976, however, most courts have interpreted the 1976 Act 2 ̆ 7 s language as abolishing the practice of awarding statutory damages for each infringing work, instead awarding statutory damages for each infringed work. In 2004, the First Circuit reaffirmed this interpretation in Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records. Although the law may appear to be well-settled, two questions remain. First, does this interpretation of the 1976 Act actually deter prospective infringers-one of the goals of copyright law? And, second, does this interpretation promote good public policy? Evidence seems to suggest that the answers to both of these questions are in the negative...|$|R

40|$|Time-In, A Logical Consequence for Misbehaving Students, {{studied the}} effects of a primary school {{discipline}} program designed and implemented by a trainee school counsellor. The program delivered a series of logical consequences for students' misbehaviour and a formalized entry point for counselling intervention. The program was based on a critical incident technique that required teachers to issue infringement notices to misbehaving students who failed to respond to warnings or contravened existing rules regarding safe and responsible behaviour. Counselling and system responses (loss of privileges, parent notification, in school suspension, exclusion) occurred within an established formula dependent on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> accruing to the student. The school counsellor assumed full responsibility for the collection <b>of</b> <b>infringements,</b> monitoring <b>of</b> on-going student misbehaviour, parental contact and overall management functions of the host school's discipline program. Counselling sessions and mode of therapy were selected and employed to meet the specific needs of misbehaving students once extended misbehaviour patterns emerged. Data collected throughout the study's duration (one year) indicated a decline in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> recurring offenders and a drop-off in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> received by those pupils who continued to transgress school policies regarding safe and responsible behaviour. Five hundred and forty-seven infringement notices were issued during the study which resulted in a total of 83 counselling sessions.

Drawing upon recently developed economic theories of regulatory competition, our model foresees a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> qualitative adjustments resulting from this reform. On one hand, the direct applicability of the exemption provision should increase the overall amount of exemptions. On the other hand, a decentralized system permits private litigants 2 ̆ 7 forum shopping, and parallel enforcement by multiple national competition authorities will drive up the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> findings.

We use a new dynamic measure of the evolution of the legal framework, defined as the compliance record of the Member States of the European Union. Controlling for the nature of the firm {{as well as for the}} identity of the ultimate shareholder, we find that an increase in the annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> is related to a decrease in the valuation of the firms going public.

40|$|Of nearly 1500 European Union {{directives}} enacted between 1978 and 1997, over 65 % had {{at least}} one infringement case opened against a member state for noncompliance. Existing research has considered the problem <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> by either focusing upon timing alone or upon total <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements.</b> These approaches incorrectly assume that all infringements are alike and thus can be addressed as parts of the same phenomenon. While some common factors contribute to higher levels <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> overall, e. g. incapacities within the bureaucracy and complexity of the directives to be enacted, three factors separate late from substantive infringements: preferences, power, and opportunity. Infringements have a common source: disagreement by national political actors (policy-area minister and coalition members) regarding a directive but whether this disagreement transforms into substance or delay depends. Substantive infringements arise when three conditions are simultaneously present: the national political actors not only disagree with a directive, AND they have the power to affect national legislation, AND they have the opportunity to do so, in the national parliament. Late infringements arise when only some of these conditions are present: when national political actors disagree but lack tools to substantively influence legislation, e. g. when coalition members have weak parliamentary powers but disagree with directive content, or when strong national parliaments are involved in the passage of legislation during the transposition process. This dissertation analyzes the incidence of state noncompliance among EU member states using a novel approach on a new dataset. With these tools, I not only explain factors relevant to late and substantive infringements but also why previous research has been unable to provide this explanation until now...|$|R

40|$|Since speed {{cameras were}} {{introduced}} in Queensland in May 1997 {{there has been a}} steady increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> speed camera sites and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> operational hours. However, infringements have not risen in line with this increase in speed enforcement. That is, over time there has been a gradual reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> speeding <b>infringements</b> issues as a proportion <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vehicles' speeds monitored by speed cameras. Superficially this data suggests that speed cameras are effective in reducing speeding. An alternative interpretation is that motorists are reducing their speed at known camera locations, thus avoiding detection, but still speeding at locations where they do not expect to encounter any speed enforcement. If the infringement to vehicles monitored ratio is a system wide indication <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> motorists speeding, then a decline in this infringement ratio should be roughly parallelled by a corresponding reduction in speed related crashes. This paper will analyse infringement data, speed camera deployment data and speed related crash data in order to clarify the effects that speed cameras are having on speeding and crashes. In particular, the ratio <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hours of speed camera operation, speed related crashes and the surrogate measures of serious injury and fatality crashes will be investigated.

The Computer Forensics is a {{research}} area that finds the malicious users by collecting and analyzing the intrusion or <b>infringement</b> evidence <b>of</b> computer crimes such as hacking. Many researches about Computer Forensics have been done so far. But those researches have focused on how to collect the forensic evidence for both analysis and proofs after receiving the intrusion or <b>infringement</b> <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> hosts from computer users or network administrators. In this paper, we describe how to selectively collect the forensic evidence of good quality from observable and protective hosts at the time <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> occurrence by malicious users. By correlating the event logs of Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSes) and hosts with the configuration information of hosts periodically, we calculate the value <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> severity that implies the real <b>infringement</b> possibility <b>of</b> the hosts. Based on this severity value, we selectively collect the evidence for proofs at the time <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> occurrence. As a result, we show that we can minimize the information damage of the evidence for both analysis and proofs, and {{reduce the amount of}} data which are used to analyze the degree <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> severity. ...|$|R
