5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he {{say anything about the}} following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} addax is Addax nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|In early January 2008, protesters marched {{from the}} Minnesota State Capitol to the Xcel Energy Center {{in hopes of}} {{securing}} a protest permit. The Saint Paul Police Department authorized the event, but only approved the permit through July 2008. On February 8 and February 9, 2008, antiwar protesters attended a weekend conference at the University of Minnesota to discuss the protests and antiwar rally. On February 28, 2008, the Associated Press (AP) reported that the police department adopted new guidelines for the investigation of protest groups. The police department said that this did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the convention.|$|E
25|$|According to reports, on 2 November from {{thirty to}} forty sampan-men {{entered the house}} of the {{contractor}} who supplies the Harbour Department with fuel for launches, and threatened to maim him if he refused to join their cause by stopping supplies. The contractor told them he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with them, and, fearing an attack, collected in all of his coolies, although the sampan-men did not reappear. On 13 November Lim Eow Thong and Goh Taik Chee introduced a deputation of sampan-men to Assistant Protector of Chinese Beatty, whereupon the sampan-men related the hardship brought about by the prohibition on repairs along Weld Quay, and of the inadequacy of the present fare structure. Beaty said he would lay these complaints before Bland. Following that a meeting took place at Bland's office. In addition to the Chinese sampan-men who talked to Beatty, leaders of the Malay and Indian sampan-men approached Major H. Barry de Hamel, the Chief Police Officer, and L. H. Clayton, the Superintendent of Indian Immigration. The Government refused to do anything unless the sampan-men called off their strike.|$|E

25|$|The {{three goals}} of his {{movement}} were anti-foreignism, anti-imperialism, and anti-religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement, against superstition. Huang Shaoxiong, also a Kuomintang {{member of the}} New Guangxi Clique, supported Bai's campaign, and Huang was a non-Muslim, the anti religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members, so it may <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Bai's beliefs.|$|R
25|$|On the {{philosophy}} behind {{the process of}} reservation itself, the people in favour of reservation feel that reservation is necessary to undo and counter the 'evils' of centuries of caste system that prevailed in the country. Reservation proponents also contend that merit as it is defined today {{is something that is}} achieved with the help of cramming, tutoring, constant guidance, quality schooling and knowledge of English and poor Dalits, poor MBC's lack most of these. This (the argument cnetering on cramming, tutoring, etc.) the anti-reservationists do not accept, pointing out that not all high-scorers at the exams can hope to eventually succeed in translating their knowledge into skills, but low-scorers especially in higher education will also score badly on the skill ladder proportionately much more than high-scorers. They also suggest that the examination-based approach to merit evaluation calls for a modification to better reflect meritorious performance in practical demonstration of skills, but casteist reservation does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> offer as a solution in this regard. Which, they add, only goes to expose the foul game of the politicians of India many of whom have a record of strongly alleged offences and crimes of numerous types.|$|E
25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{clarified}} {{that her}} age did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was just something that she had in mind {{for a long time and}} with [...] "4 Minutes", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing [...] "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was [...] "a funny paradox" [...] and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the group's {{role in the}} Catholic Church, {{critics have}} argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a {{personal}} prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a [...] "church within a church" [...] and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid , which some considered to be irregular. In contrast, Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and {{its status as a}} prelature [...] "precisely means dependence." [...] Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.|$|E

500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center.

Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E

Dwight insists he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the gift and does not welcome Pam to the desk because she [...] "obscures my view of the shredder." [...] In the second 50-second clip, Dwight tells Andy, Stanley and Phyllis that they should [...] "put our balls in the guillotine, as they say," [...] by threatening to quit if Michael does not give their clients back. The others express doubt and wonder if they should keep quiet in order to protect their jobs.|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to digital, analog {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at {{a small fraction of the}} price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM.|$|E
