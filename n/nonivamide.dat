40|$|BACKGROUND: Nicotinic {{acid and}} <b>nonivamide</b> are often applied topically during {{capillary}} blood collection to induce vasodilation. These molecules {{may have an}} influence on immune effector cell activity in nearby tissues. This study investigates whether the induction of flushing by nicotinic acid and <b>nonivamide</b> causes an inflammatory response that influences the composition of immune cells present in a capillary blood sample. METHODS: Females aged between 18 and 30 years old provided capillary blood samples. Experimental samples were taken from an earlobe treated with nicotinic acid and <b>nonivamide</b> with controls obtained from the untreated earlobe. Immunophenotypic analyses were conducted using polychromatic flow cytometry to determine whether any changes occurred in leucocyte subpopulations (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 19, CD 56, and CD 14) and granulocytic functional-related surface antigen markers (CD 11 b, CD 18, CD 16 b, and CD 66 b). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between experimental and control samples in the mean percent of parent for the lymphocyte, monocyte, or granulocyte subpopulations, or in the median fluorescence intensity of particular surface markers expressed on these leucocytes. CONCLUSION: The topical application of nicotinic acid and <b>nonivamide</b> is a possible method to improve capillary blood collection for immunological assessments. The use of these agents may increase the safety and compliance of {{patients who suffer from}} needle phobia or are unable to provide venous blood samples...|$|E
40|$|Activation of {{intracellular}} transient receptor potential vanilloid- 1 (TRPV 1) {{in human}} lung cells causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increased expression of proapoptotic GADD 153 (growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible transcript 3), and cytotoxicity. However, in cells with low TRPV 1 expression, cell {{death is not}} inhibited by TRPV 1 antagonists, despite preventing GADD 153 induction. In this study, chemical variants of the capsaicin analog <b>nonivamide</b> were synthesized and used to probe the relationship between TRPV 1 receptor binding, ER calcium release, GADD 153 expression, and cell death in TRPV 1 -overexpressing BEAS- 2 B, normal BEAS- 2 B, and primary normal human bronchial epithelial lung cells. Modification of the 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxybenzylamide vanilloid ring pharmacophore of <b>nonivamide</b> reduced the potency of the analogs and rendered several analogs mildly inhibitory. Correlation analysis of analog-induced calcium flux, GADD 153 induction, and cytotoxicity revealed a direct relationship for all three endpoints in all three lung cell types for <b>nonivamide</b> and N-(3, 4 -dihydroxybenzyl) nonanamide. However, the N-(3, 4 -dihydroxybenzyl) nonanamide analog also produced cytotoxicity through redox cycling/reactive oxygen species formation, shown by inhibition of cell death by N-acetylcysteine. Molecular modeling of binding interactions between the analogs and TRPV 1 agreed with data for reduced potency of the analogs, and only <b>nonivamide</b> was predicted to form a “productive” ligand-receptor complex. This study provides vital information on the molecular interactions of capsaicinoids with TRPV 1 and substantiates TRPV 1 -mediated ER stress as a conserved mechanism of lung cell death by prototypical TRPV 1 agonists...|$|E
40|$|Red {{pepper and}} its major pungent component, capsaicin, have been {{associated}} with hypolipidemic effects in rats, although mechanistic studies on the effects of capsaicin and/or structurally related compounds on lipid metabolism are scarce. In this work, the effects of capsaicin and its structural analog <b>nonivamide,</b> the aliphatic alkamide trans-pellitorine and vanillin as the basic structural element of all vanilloids on the mechanisms of intestinal fatty acid uptake in differentiated intestinal Caco- 2 cells were studied. Capsaicin and <b>nonivamide</b> were found to reduce fatty acid uptake, with IC 50 values of 0. 49 μM and 1. 08 μM, respectively. trans-Pellitorine was shown to reduce fatty acid uptake by 14. 0 ± 2. 14 % at 100 μM, whereas vanillin was not effective, indicating a pivotal role of the alkyl chain with the acid amide group in fatty acid uptake by Caco- 2 cells. This effect was associated neither with the activation of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV 1) or the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) nor with effects on paracellular transport or glucose uptake. However, acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity increased (p < 0. 05) in the presence of 10 μM capsaicin, <b>nonivamide</b> or trans-pellitorine, pointing to an increased fatty acid biosynthesis that might counteract the decreased fatty acid uptake...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of an iodine atom on the vanillyl moiety of <b>nonivamide</b> causes a switch in the vanilloid activity (TRPV 1 antagonism versus TRPV 1 desensitization) and nullifies the aversive properties of capsaicinoids. In {{the present study}} we investigated the effect of iodination in the vanillyl moiety on the antioxidant activity of capsaicinoids. To this aim, we have compared the protective effects of <b>nonivamide</b> and three iododerivatives, 2 -iodononivamide (2 IN), 5 -iodononivamide (5 IN), and 6 -iodononivamide (6 IN) {{in a series of}} in vitro models of lipid oxidation, namely the autoxidation and the FeCl(3) -mediated oxidation of linoleic acid at 37 degrees C and the thermal (140 degrees C), solvent-free oxidation of cholesterol. All tested compounds could protect linoleic acid and cholesterol against oxidative degradation, the order of potency being: nonivamide> 5 IN> 6 IN approximately 2 IN. Our results show that, in general, the {{introduction of}} an iodine atom on the vanillyl moiety of <b>nonivamide</b> causes a decrease in the antioxidant activity, and this effect is sensitive to the position of iodine on the aromatic ring, with 5 IN substantially retaining the efficacy of <b>nonivamide</b> to protect linoleic and cholesterol against free radical attack. Moreover, the pre-treatment with 5 IN, at noncytotoxic concentrations, significantly preserved LDL from Cu(2 +) -induced oxidative damage at 37 degrees C for 2 h, inhibiting the reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol and the increase of their oxidative products. The results of the present work suggest that 5 IN exerts useful antioxidant properties in different in vitro systems of lipid peroxidation. This, coupled to its lacks of pungency and TRPV 1 inhibiting properties, qualifies this phenolic compound as an attractive candidate for further investigations in vivo. ...|$|E

To explore how these nonpungent analogs differ from capsaicin, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on cultured rat trigeminal ganglion neurons. In neurons held at � 60 mV, capsaicin, olvanil, and GLNVA were found to activate one or two kinetically distinct inward currents.

Topical capsaicinoids {{have been used for}} decades to treat musculoskeletal pain. This study investigated the effects of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of <b>nonivamide</b> (a capsaicinoid) and nicoboxil (a nicotinic acid ester) cream in the treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain. Materials and methods: This phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multi-center trial investigated efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical nicoboxil 1. 08 %/nonivamide 0. 17 % (Finalgon® cream) in treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain with the endpoints: pain intensity (PI) difference between pre-dose baseline and 8 hours after first application and the end of treatment, mobility score, and efficacy score. Results: Patients (n= 138), 21 – 65 years of age, were treated for up to 4 days with FDC or placebo cream. Mean baseline PI was 6. 8 on a 0 – 10 point numerical rating scale. After 8 hours, pain was more reduced with the FDC than with placebo (adjusted means: 2. 824 vs. 0. 975 points; p< 0. 0001). On the last treatment day, mean pain reduction by the FDC was stronger than with placebo (adjusted means: 5. 132 vs. 2. 174 points; p< 0. 0001). Mobility on Day 1 was in favor of the FDC when compared to placebo (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval {CI}]: 7. 200 [3. 609, 14. 363], p< 0. 0001). At the end of treatment, patients treated with the FDC rated efficacy significantly higher than placebo (odds ratio [95 % CI]: 11. 370 [5. 342, 24. 199], p< 0. 0001).
