He eventually decided to make one final attempt to take the eastern side, and if the effort failed he would give the order to withdraw.

He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E

25|$|The Red Cross and Red Crescent {{movement}} repeatedly rejected Israel's request {{over the}} years, {{stating that the}} Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems were not meant to represent Christianity and Islam but was colour reversals of the Swiss and the Ottoman flags, and also that if Jews (or another group) were to be given another emblem, there would be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the number of religious or other groups claiming an emblem for themselves. They reasoned that a proliferation of red symbols would detract from the original intention of the Red Cross emblem, {{which was to be}} a single emblem to mark vehicles and buildings protected on humanitarian grounds.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{had been}} formed in 1960 as a merger of the Erie Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. It too was bankrupt, but was {{somewhat}} stronger financially than the others. It was ruled reorganizable under Chapter 77 on April 30, 1974 (as had the Boston and Maine Railroad), but on January 9, 1975, with <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> its losses in sight, its trustees reconsidered {{and asked for}} inclusion. The Final System Plan assigned a major section of the EL, from northern New Jersey west to northeast Ohio, {{to be sold to}} the Chessie System, which would help spur competition in Conrail's territory. Chessie however could not reach an agreement with EL labor unions, and in February 1976 announced {{that it would not be}} buying the EL section. The USRA hurriedly assigned large amounts of trackage rights to the Delaware and Hudson Railway, allowing it to compete in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C., markets.|$|E
25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal {{immunity}} from taxation stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He admitted that Dravo Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) but rather on the mere fact that a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E

25|$|During {{the final}} {{decade of the}} 19th Century, careful {{expansion}} nevertheless led to solid chapters at Yale (Sachem Hall), Columbia, Maryland, Penn State and Penn, among other storied schools. Dartmouth, Brown, and MIT followed soon after. Eventually Phi Sig was present at six of the eight Ivy League schools; even Canadian campuses were not excluded in the thinking of those who carried new chapters in all directions shortly {{after the turn of}} the century. Rho Chapter was organized at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario in 1903, and seventeen other units were added during the decade. Under Cutter's and Barrett's leadership, the national organization was strengthened, and work was begun among the alumni to support their continued interest in the Fraternity after graduation. The Greek system's uniqueness among American organizations is based partly on this principle – the idea of continued involvement for members after undergraduate days. Phi Sigma Kappa was one of the early leaders in such efforts and remains one of the strongest alumni-oriented groups. If Founder Brooks' assessment of its purpose is true, then there would be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the Fraternity's influence on its members, and its role in their lives—another vital part of Phi Sig's heritage.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Brazil's third {{dreadnought}} faced a {{good deal}} of political opposition after an economic downturn and a naval revolt: the crews of both of their brand-new battleships, along with several smaller warships, mutinied and threatened to fire on Rio de Janeiro if there was <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> what they called the [...] "slavery" [...] being practiced by the Brazilian Navy. Despite these pressures, the shipbuilder Armstrong Whitworth successfully held the Brazilians to their contractual obligations. Construction on the new ship, preliminarily named Rio de Janeiro, was halted several times due to repeated design changes. Brazil's coffee and rubber booms collapsed soon after. Concerned that their ship would be outclassed by larger super-dreadnoughts, they sold the incomplete vessel to the Ottoman Empire in December 1913.|$|E

500|$|Townsend's {{experiences}} in China {{formed the basis}} of his first book Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China, the release of which on 10 November 1933 put Townsend in the spotlight both nationally and internationally. Billed as doing [...] "for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India", Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people, including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack of critical thinking skills. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves" [...] and predicts <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> chaotic conditions within the country. He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan's sensible policies toward China with the naively [...] "sentimentalist" [...] ones adopted by the United States.|$|E

[...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] is about the difficulty of [...] "giv yourself completely to another person", with lyrical characters who are [...] "addicted to sort of failure and rebirth". [...] "California (There Is <b>No</b> <b>End</b> <b>to</b> Love)" [...] recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. [...] "Song for Someone" [...] is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met when they were teenagers. [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that [...] "we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments. The simplest moments." ...|$|E

In January2011 {{it was announced that}} Kylie would marry David in a [...] "shock storyline". Revealing the news whilst interviewed on talk show Loose Women, Lane said that the pair would meet off-screen in Tenerife. Though she had not read the scripts, Lane thought they would be [...] "a really good combination". Coronation Street publicity said it would make [...] "exciting viewing" [...] for fans. They further stated: [...] "Kylie and David are trouble as individuals so the thought {{of the two of them}} getting together is a nightmare prospect for both their families [...] there is <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the trouble they will cause for everyone." [...] Lane also revealed that the storyline was implemented because there was no other plausible way for Kylie to return. They did not carry on with the scenario with Becky and Steve, because the viewers needed [...] "something new". Lane was happy with the direction of the storyline because it paved the way for more [...] "explosive" [...] material. Kylie was also tipped to be the one in control of the relationship.

500|$|In chapter seven Townsend {{details the}} sheer horror of China's ongoing civil war. Among the factions {{competing}} for power in China, Townsend believes {{that none of}} them, neither the leaders nor their men, have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot. With every man only out for himself and [...] "China's microscopically few good men... too weak to be felt", Townsend predicts <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the chaos. Much of the violence, Townsend explains in chapter eight, is fuelled by opium, the addiction of {{one out of every}} eight Chinese. Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies, {{to such an extent that}} many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food, and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade. In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords, in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China. The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal, brave, reliable, honest, and cleanly people, and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese. Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932, which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression, and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the [...] "foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese" [...] waged by Zhang Xueliang. Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as [...] "a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there" [...] which has achieved [...] "stability and well-being for millions". Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan's role in dealing with an unruly China.|$|E
