40|$|The South African Breweries (SAB) is {{a leading}} local company that {{successfully}} competes on a global platform. To retain their positive position, SAB identifies and improves areas {{in which they are}} falling short of world-class manufacturing status. In order to benchmark their performance, metrics are established. An area that the Rosslyn Brewery identified as an opportunity for improvement is variable costs. A large contributor to variable costs is nonreturnable bottles (NRB), which is the main focus of this project. The purpose of the document is to outline the project aimed at improving the <b>non-returnable</b> <b>bottle</b> loss at the SAB, Rosslyn brewery, so that the performance metrics can be met in this regard. The project is structured according to the DMAIC problem solving approach. The document provides a thorough definition of the project; an overview of the relevant literature gives a context to the problem and describes applicable industrial engineering mechanisms used in solving the problem. Data is analysed to determine the magnitude of the problem and to decide which areas should be focussed on. Discussions on these focus areas reveal factors contributing to bottle loss in each focus area. Each problem is addressed and a variety of solutions are suggested. The suggested solutions are evaluated and a summary of the shortterm and long-term solutions as well as the financial benefit and validation of these solutions is given. Recommendations for the implementation, support and maintenance of the change involved in implementing the solutions is also provided within the document. The successful completion of the project according to this document will ultimately aid SAB to decrease their variable costs and become more profitable. In essence, it will help SAB align itself with the company s vision to strive for operational excellence though continuous improvement.

5000|$|High profile {{campaigns have}} {{included}} the return of 1500 <b>non-returnable</b> <b>bottles</b> to Schweppes in 1971, and the successful [...] "Alice's Meadow" [...] campaign of 1983 - which helped force the diversion of the proposed M40 motorway around Otmoor.|$|R
50|$|More recently, many bottles {{have been}} {{designed}} for single-use. This often allows for thinner glass bottles and less expensive plastic bottles and aluminum beverage cans. Recycling rates have been increasing, particularly for aluminum. On a cost basis, the decision has often been made for <b>non-returnable</b> <b>bottles.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is sold in}} 350 ml {{aluminum}} cans, 355 ml returnable <b>bottles,</b> 355 ml <b>non-returnable</b> <b>bottles,</b> and 1 L returnable bottles. In {{recent years}} Gallo has been exported to other Central American countries, Mexico, France and the United States. It is sold under the name Famosa ("Famous") in the latter two. The label's design features a cockerel (gallo).|$|R
50|$|In February 1974 he was {{appointed}} as Minister of Environment. During his time as Environment Minister he was criticized for failing to ban <b>non-returnable</b> <b>bottles</b> and for refusing to place restrictions {{on the use of}} snowmobiles. In October 1975, he {{was appointed}} as Minister of Agriculture and Food. In this capacity Newman was responsible for the creation of the Foodland Ontario program, which continues to today, designed to promote the sale of Ontario-grown agricultural products.|$|R
50|$|Friends of the Earth {{was founded}} in England in 1971, {{two years after the}} group was first founded in San Francisco in 1969. Its first leader was Graham Searle, a former vice {{president}} of the National Union of Students. One of the first campaigns was to dump 1,500 glass bottles in front of the HQ of soft drinks giant Schweppes in Connaught House, London in protest at the company's policy of having <b>non-returnable</b> <b>bottles.</b> The group had eight local branches in 1971. By 1976 there were 140, and by 1980 it had 250 and 17,000 registered supporters. Between 1984 and 1993 its director was Jonathan Porritt a former teacher and chairman of the Ecology party. Porritt left in 1993, by which time its membership hit 226,000. The next executive director was Charles Secrett who held the position till 2003. Between 2003 and 2008, FoE EWNI's executive director was Tony Juniper.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reverse {{logistics}} is one {{of industries}} ´ activities that is still little known and developed. This paper analyses the necessities of collecting nonreturnable packaging {{at the point of}} sale, as well as their processing and sale to recycling companies, while considering marketing and operational variables for the reverse scheme. The objective is to increase the quality of recycling material by avoiding contamination and therefore, raising the quantity of recycled material used in the production of new packages. The pilot project analyses the operation of a brewery company in a medium-sized city in México. A collection system for <b>non-returnable</b> glass <b>bottles</b> and cans is designed by applying routing algorithms. Specifically a new “profitable algorithm ” based on the well-known Nearest Neighbor is proposed and compared in order to achieve higher volume of collected material while lowering the cost of collection...|$|R
