Conventional laboratory tests are expensive and time consuming, as shale is a difficult material to <b>test.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>testing</b> on shale material is an easy, in-expensive and effective alternative. <b>Index</b> <b>testing</b> has previously been performed in order to obtain this information, {{but the truth is that}} more testing have been needed in order to fully understand the value of these tests. This thesis has enhanced the knowledge and application area for some of the <b>index</b> <b>tests.</b> Four <b>index</b> <b>tests,</b> respectively CWT, Shale Puncher, Scratch Test and Brazilian Test, has been investigated and compared to both modeled data with the patchy weakness model and other published results. A wide collection of data has been used in order to enhance the understanding of these tests. In general measured results correlate well with expected theoretical results. Also the UCS estimations from the <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> correlate with other UCS data. A large comparison of strength data shows that a solid estimation with respect to UCS may be determined by use of the <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> presented. By looking at maximum and minimum readings of presented results, and strength as a function of inclination, degree of strength anisotropy may be determined. <b>Index</b> <b>testing</b> has also proved to provide information concerning heterogeneity. <b>Index</b> <b>test</b> results confirm previous published findings, but some deviations are seen for the interpretation of punch results due to geometrical difficulties. Also the area of application of the scratch test is investigated, and a unique finding is presented where strength anisotropy may be determined as a function of scratch direction. Overall this thesis contributes with important discussion and results regarding shale mechanical parameters and strength anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{paradigm for}} evaluating test performance compares {{the results of}} an <b>index</b> <b>test</b> with a reference test. When the reference test does not mirror the “truth ” adequately well (e. g. is an “imperfect ” reference standard), the typical (“naïve”) estimates of sensitivity and specificity are biased. One has at least four options when performing a systematic review of test performance when the reference standard is “imper-fect”: (a) to forgo the classical paradigm and assess the <b>index</b> <b>test’s</b> ability to predict patient relevant outcomes instead of test accuracy (i. e., treat the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> as a predictive instrument); (b) to assess whether the results of the two <b>tests</b> (<b>index</b> and reference) agree or disagree (i. e., treat them as two alternative measure-ment methods); (c) to calculate “naïve ” estimates of the <b>index</b> <b>test’s</b> sensitivity and specificity from each study included in the review and discuss in which direction they are biased; (d) mathematically adjust the “naïve” estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> to account for the imperfect reference standard.

40|$|Composite {{reference}} standards (CRSs) {{have been}} advocated in diagnostic accuracy {{studies in the}} absence of a perfect reference standard. The rationale is that combining results of multiple imperfect tests leads to a more accurate reference than any one test in isolation. Focusing on a CRS that classifies subjects as disease positive if at least one component test is positive, we derive algebraic expressions for sensitivity and specificity of this CRS, sensitivity and specificity of a new (<b>index)</b> <b>test</b> compared with this CRS, as well as the CRS-based prevalence. We use as a motivating example the problem of evaluating a new test for Chlamydia trachomatis, an asymptomatic disease for which no gold-standard test exists. As the number of component tests increases, sensitivity of this CRS increases at the expense specificity, unless all tests have perfect specificity. Therefore, such a CRS can lead to significantly biased accuracy estimates of the <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> The bias depends on disease prevalence and accuracy of the CRS. Further, conditional dependence between the CRS and <b>index</b> <b>test</b> can lead to over-estimation of <b>index</b> <b>test</b> accuracy estimates. This commonly-used CRS combines results from multiple imperfect tests in a way that ignores information and therefore is not guaranteed to improve over a single imperfect reference unless each component test has perfect specificity, and the CRS is conditionally independent of the <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> When these conditions are not met, as in the case of C. trachomatis testing, more realistic statistical models should be researched instead of relying on such CRSs.

40|$|Research {{into the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of clinical tests is often hampered by single or double partial verification mechanisms, that is, not all patients have their disease status verified by a reference test, neither do all patients receive all <b>tests</b> under evaluation (<b>index</b> <b>tests).</b> We show methods that reduce verification bias introduced when omitting data from partially tested patients. Adjustment techniques are well established {{when there are}} no missing <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> and when the reference test is missing at random. However, in practice, <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> tend to be omitted, and the choice of applying a reference test may depend on unobserved variables related to disease status, that is, verification may be missing not at random (MNAR). We study double partial verification in a clinical example from reproductive medicine in which we analyse the diagnostic values of the chlamydia antibody test and the hysterosalpingography in relation to a diagnostic laparoscopy. First, we plot all possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity of both <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> in two test ignorance regions. Then, we construct models in which we impose different assumptions for the verification process. We allow for missing <b>index</b> <b>tests,</b> study the influence of patient characteristics and study the accuracy estimates if an MNAR mechanism would operate. It is shown that data on tests used in the diagnostic process of the same population are preferably studied jointly and that the influence of an MNAR verification process was limited in a clinical study where {{more than half of the}} patients did not have the reference test.

40|$|Earthen levee {{damage from}} storm surge {{overtopping}} in the New Orleans area was observed and documented after Hurricane Katrina. Some levee reaches were undamaged {{and some were}} slightly eroded, while other portions were completely breached. The in situ jet <b>index</b> <b>test</b> method was applied along selected post-storm reconstructed levee reaches to assess levee fill erodibil-ity. Jet <b>index</b> <b>testing</b> was also conducted at three undamaged (un-eroded) levee surface locations. Pre-storm levee profiles (elevations) were compared to post-storm modeled stormwater elevations to estimate overtopping depths at the test sites. Also, pre-storm levee profiles were compared to post-storm profiles to estimate erosion depths at the test sites. The jet <b>index</b> <b>test</b> results were integrated with pre-storm soil boring data (i. e., stratigraphy and soil classification), post-storm erosion depths, and overtopping depths to investigate soil surface erodibility relationships. The results showed the validity of using the jet <b>index</b> <b>test</b> method for levee soil erodibility assessments. BACKGROUND Adverse hydrological events such as flooding, storm surge, wave runup, overtopping, and overwash are capable of initiating levee erosion, and progressive soil erosion may eventually contribute to breaching failure. The {{first line of defense}} against overtopping-induced erosion is the erosion resistance of the exposed levee surface cover on the levee backside (landside or protected side). Surface erosion resistance and progres-sion rate of erosion are influenced by the soil material properties of the levee surface and its underlying layers.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the sensitivity of the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> with focus on the behavior of the guide vane and runner blade angles. This was achieved by comparing the cam curves from an <b>index</b> <b>test</b> with a design of experiment. <b>Index</b> <b>tests</b> are a popular method for determining cam curves for Kaplan turbines. <b>Index</b> <b>tests,</b> as they are performed today, do not take into account a suspected hysteresis phenomenon in the guide vane and runner blade mechanism. If and how this affects the cam curve is today unknown which this project has investigated. An experiment was designed based on the “design of experiment” method. The difference from a traditional <b>index</b> <b>testing</b> is that the measurements were performed in a random order and only two propeller curves were plotted, but with eight replicates. Ten different guide vane angles were used; five for each runner blade angle and a total of 80 measurements were performed over the span of two days. Then, the measurements were compared with the results from an <b>index</b> <b>test</b> performed the day before on the same machine, a full-scale turbine in the Lule Älv-river using the same equipment. When analyzing the distribution of the efficiency, it has a larger spread on the left hand side of the propeller curve compared to the best efficiency point and negligible variation around the best efficiency point. The difference in the cam curves between the two methods was smaller than the estimated measurement error at the best efficiency point. The peak efficiency in the experiment was found for a slightly higher flow rate at one of the runner blade angles but this point was between two settings at the <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> The variations in efficiency are at their largest before the peak and may vary between a high efficiency and significantly lower efficiency at this point. Additional measurements may reduce the risk for choosing a guide vane angle at which such behavior occurs. A constant difference in the readings between the fixed scale and the station sensor were observed for the runner blade mechanism. This difference varied with the runner blade angle and amounted to 0. 26 ° for 1 ° and 0. 70 ° for 4 ° runner blade angle. For the guide vane mechanism no hysteresis could be validated. A difference between the fixed scale and the station sensor which varied depending on the direction was spotted and could be validated with 95 % significance. The difference in the readings from the fixed scale and the station sensor was in average 0. 15 ° larger when increasing the guide vane angle than when decreasing the angle.

Secondary aims included quantifying rapidity, technical adequacy, predictability of equivocal results and relationships between emergency physician experience and proficiency. METHODS This prospective diagnostic study enrolled {{a convenience sample of}} adult patients presenting to a major ED with suspected lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. The <b>index</b> <b>test</b> was abbreviated compression ultrasonography examining three points: common femoral, proximal great saphenous and popliteal veins. Emergency physicians received specific training. The reference test was full-leg duplex ultrasonography in the Radiology Department. RESULTS A total of 15 emergency physicians participated, enrolling 178 subjects. Sensitivity of the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> was 77. 8 % (95 % confidence interval: 54. 8 – 91. 0 %), specificity was 91. 4 % (95 % confidence interval: 84. 9 %– 95. 3 %) and accuracy was 89. 6 % (95 % confidence interval: 83. 1 – 94. 2 %). Median duration of the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> was 10 [*]min 34 [*]s (interquartile range: 6 [*]min 31 [*]s) and ED diagnosis occurred significantly before Radiology Department diagnosis. The only statistically significant relationship between emergency physician experience and proficiency related to rapidity, which increased from the 36 th scan. Equivocal <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> occurred in 9. 2 % of examinations and emergency physicians predicted equivocal assessments with specificity of 86. 1 % (95 % confidence interval: 78. 8 – 91. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS Abbreviated ultrasonography performed by emergency physicians for proximal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis could be valuable.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{increasing}} {{focus has}} been directed to the methodology for evaluating (new) tests or biomarkers. A key step {{in the evaluation of}} a diagnostic test is the investigation into its accuracy. CONTENT: We reviewed the literature on how to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Accuracy refers to the amount of agreement between the results of the <b>test</b> under evaluation (<b>index</b> <b>test)</b> and the results of a reference standard or test. The generally recommended approach is to use a prospective cohort design in patients who are suspected of having the disease of interest, in which each individual undergoes the index and same reference standard tests. This approach presents several challenges, including the problems that can arise with the verification of the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> results by the preferred reference standard test, the choice of cutoff value in case of a continuous <b>index</b> <b>test</b> result, and the determination of how to translate accuracy results to recommendations for clinical use. This {{first in a series of}} 4 reports presents an overview of the designs of single-test accuracy studies and the concepts of specificity, sensitivity, posterior probabilities (i. e., predictive values) for the presence of target disease, ROC curves, and likelihood ratios, all illustrated with empirical data from a study on the diagnosis of suspected deep venous thrombosis. Limitations of the concept of the diagnostic accuracy for a single test are also highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective cohort design in patients suspected of having the disease of interest is the optimal approach to estimate the accuracy of a diagnostic test. However, the accuracy of a diagnostic <b>index</b> <b>test</b> is not constant but varies across different clinical contexts, disease spectrums, and even patient subgroups.

40|$|Objective(s) : Diagnostic nuclear {{medicine}} is being increasingly employed in clinical {{practice with the}} advent of new technologies and radiopharmaceuticals. The report of the prevalence of a certain disease is important for assessing the quality of that article. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the quality of published {{nuclear medicine}} articles and determine the frequency of reporting the prevalence of studied diseases. Methods: We used Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS- 2) checklists for evaluating the quality of articles published in five nuclear medicine journals with the highest impact factors in 2012. The articles were retrieved from Scopus database and were selected and assessed independently by two nuclear medicine physicians. Decision concerning equivocal data was made by consensus between the reviewers. Results: The average STARD score was approximately 17 points, and the highest score was 17. 19 ± 2. 38 obtained by the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine. QUADAS- 2 tool showed that all journals had low bias regarding study population. The Journal of Nuclear Medicine had the highest score in terms of <b>index</b> <b>test,</b> reference standard, and time interval. Lack of clarity regarding the <b>index</b> <b>test,</b> reference standard, and time interval was frequently observed in all journals including Clinical Nuclear Medicine, in which 64 % of the studies were unclear regarding the <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> Journal of Nuclear Cardiology had the highest number of articles with appropriate reference standard (83. 3 %), though it had the lowest frequency of reporting disease prevalence (zero reports). All five journals had the same STARD score, while <b>index</b> <b>test,</b> reference standard, and time interval were very unclear according to QUADAS- 2 tool. Unfortunately, data were too limited to determine which journal had the lowest risk of bias.

Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) for detection of nerve root impingement were calculated for each individual <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> An overall clinical evaluation, concluding on the level and side of the radiculopathy, was performed. Results The prevalence of disc herniation was 77. 8 %. The diagnostic accuracy of individual <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> was low with no tests reaching positive LR > 4. 0 or negative LR < 0. 4. The overall clinical evaluation was slightly more accurate, with a positive LR of 6. 28 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 37. 21) for L 4, 1. 74 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 2. 93) for L 5, and 1. 29 (95 % CI 0. 97 – 1. 72) for S 1 nerve root impingement. An overall clinical evaluation, concluding on the level and side of the radiculopathy was also performed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with area under the curve (AUC) calculation for diagnostic accuracy of this evaluation was performed. Conclusions The accuracy of individual clinical <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> used to predict imaging findings of nerve root impingement in patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy is low when applied in specialised care, but clinicians’ overall evaluation improves diagnostic accuracy slightly. The tests are not very helpful in clarifying the cause of radicular pain, and are therefore inaccurate for guidance in the diagnostic workup of the patients. The study population was highly selected and therefore the results from this study should not be generalised to unselected patient populations in primary care nor to even more selected surgical populations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the accuracy, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and optical immunoassay (OIA) rapid tests for maternal group B streptococcal (GBS) colonisation at labour. Design: A test accuracy study was used to {{determine the}} accuracy of rapid tests for GBS colonisation of women in labour. Acceptability of testing to participants was evaluated through a questionnaire administered after delivery, and acceptability to staff through focus groups. A decision-analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies. Setting: Two large obstetric units in the UK. Participants: Women booked for delivery at the participating units other than those electing for a Caesarean delivery. Interventions: Vaginal and rectal swabs were obtained at the onset of labour and the results of vaginal and rectal PCR and OIA (<b>index)</b> <b>tests</b> were compared with the reference standard of enriched culture of combined vaginal and rectal swabs. Main outcome measures: The accuracy of the <b>index</b> <b>tests,</b> the relative accuracies of tests on vaginal and rectal swabs and whether test accuracy varied according to {{the presence or absence of}} maternal risk factors. Results: PCR was significantly more accurate than OIA for the detection of maternal GBS colonisation. Combined vaginal or rectal swab <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> were more sensitive than either test considered individually [combined swab sensitivity for PCR 84...|$|R
40|$|Objective To find an {{efficient}} set of diagnostic indicators that are optimally informative in. {{the diagnosis of}} a bacterial origin of acute infectious conjunctivitis. Design Cohort study involving consecutive patients. Results of <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> and reference standard were collected independently from each other. Setting 25 Dutch health centres. Participants 184 adults presenting with a red eye and either (muco) purulent discharge or glued eyelid(s), not wearing contact lenses. Main outcome measures Probability of a positive bacterial culture, given different combinations of <b>index</b> <b>test</b> results; area under receiver operating characteristics curve. Results Logistic regression analysis showed optimal diagnostic discrimination for the combination of early morning glued eye(s), itch, {{and a history of}} conjunctivitis. The first of these indicators increased the likelihood of a bacterial cause, whereas the other two decreased it. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for this combination of symptoms was 0. 74 (95 % confidence interval 0. 63 to 0. 80). The overall prevalence of bacterial involvement of 32 % could be lowered to 4 % or raised to 77 %, depending on the pattern of <b>index</b> <b>test</b> results. Conclusion A bacterial origin of complaints indicative of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be made much more likely or unlikely by the answers to three simple questions posed during clinical history taking (possibly by telephone). These results may have consequences for more targeted prescription of ocular antibiotic...|$|R
