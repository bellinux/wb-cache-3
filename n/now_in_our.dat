[...] Later on, he commented, [...] "We were across the Rhine, on a permanent bridge; the traditional defensive barrier {{to the heart of}} Germany was pierced.

[...] General George C. Marshall commented, [...] "The bridgehead provided a serious threat to the heart of Germany, a diversion of incalculable value.

2500|$|In May 1875, Sioux {{delegations}} {{headed by}} Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in an eleventh-hour attempt to persuade President Ulysses S. Grant to honor existing treaties and stem {{the flow of}} miners into their territories. [...] They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. [...] The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). [...] The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. [...] Spotted Tail said, [...] "You speak of another country, {{but it is not}} my country; it does not concern me, and I {{want nothing to do with}} it. [...] I was not born there...
