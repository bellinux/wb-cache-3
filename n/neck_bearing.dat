They caught Zoya as she started to torch another house. She was tortured and interrogated throughout the night but refused to give up any information. The following morning she was marched {{to the center of the}} town with a board around her <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscription 'Houseburner' and hanged.|$|E
500|$|Between the two work-ins, {{the rear}} dormer was {{completed}} and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start {{to be made}} on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are ½ inch (13mm) thick and [...] wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed {{at the end of the}} second work-in.|$|E
500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Buxhall Mill {{was built}} by William Bear, the Sudbury {{millwright}} {{at a cost of}} £506 6s 9d. The lower three storeys formed the base of a smock mill which stood on the site previously. The mill was worked by wind until [...] November 1929 when the sails were damaged in a storm. The swing-pot <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> was removed and sold to John Bryant of Pakenham mill. It was eventually installed in that mill in 1950 by Amos Clarke, the Ipswich millwright. In the 1940s Buxhall mill was stripped of its millstones and refitted as an engine driven mill, in which form it worked until 1971. The mill had lost its cap by 1971, with the cap frame remaining {{on the top of the}} tower.|$|E

Similarly I was no more than conscious of being forced to face the Duke by words that Cavalcanti was uttering. He was presenting me.|$|E
50|$|Morgan Construction Company built a {{test stand}} that held a {{completely}} instrumented full size mill bearing in the 1990s. Proprietary {{research conducted by}} the Morgan Construction Company from 1999-2001 showed that mill bearings operated on the principals of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHD), where the elasticity of the structure {{plays a significant role}} in the size and shape of the pressure field that supports the bearing. In the case of tapered <b>neck</b> <b>bearings,</b> very small deflections in the sleeve in the load zone of the bearing allow the bearing to redistribute the pressure field in a manner that increases support area and significantly reduces peak pressure in the oil film. Oil film thickness is also significantly larger than predicted by hydrodynamic theory.|$|R

50|$|The {{rotating}} assembly of stocks, sails, windshaft, brake wheel etc. is supported on two bearings. The <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> supports {{by far the}} largest fraction of the weight. This is a plain bearing which supports the majority of the vertical component of the weight of the {{rotating assembly}}. The bearing block is of solid brass construction and is lubricated with animal fat. The shaft lays in a shallow groove of the <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> block and is kept in position by the weight of the rotating assembly. The tail bearing supports the remainder of the vertical weight and any (horizontal) thrust generated by the wind. The <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> does not react any thrust forces.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPhosphoinositide- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -α inhibitors {{have shown}} {{clinical}} activity in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of head and <b>neck</b> (H&N) <b>bearing</b> PIK 3 CA mutations or amplification. Studying models of therapeutic resistance, we {{have observed that}} SCC cells that become refractory to PI 3 Kα inhibition maintain PI 3 K-independent activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This persistent mTOR activation is mediated by the tyrosine kinase receptor AXL. AXL is overexpressed in resistant tumors from both laboratory models and patients treated with the PI 3 Kα inhibitor BYL 719. AXL dimerizes with and phosphorylates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) -protein kinase C (PKC), which, in turn, activates mTOR. Combined treatment with PI 3 Kα and either EGFR, AXL, or PKC inhibitors reverts this resistance...|$|R
40|$|Some ways {{to assess}} the wear of the {{friction}} pair "shaft <b>neck</b> – <b>bearing</b> liner" of sliding support of ship shafting are considered in the paper. These include drawing frictional maps of friction conditions coupling; solution of basic equations of energy and molecular-mechanical friction theories, and conclusion of the multiplicative dependence of wear intensity of the friction pair on dimensionless generalized system criteria. The application of metal- cladding antiwear additives is {{regarded as one of}} the most promising methods to reduce wear and tear of friction couplings, including the work of the propeller shaft of the vessel. The patented metal- cladding antiwear additive on the magnetic base is firstly added into the lubricant.

40|$|SummaryThe {{possibility}} of needing a combined access, with neck and chest incisions makes {{the treatment of}} substernal goiter a challenge both in the pre-op and the intraoperative. We hereby, discuss a standardization of the surgical technique to minimize {{the need for a}} chest approach, making the substernal goiter a surgically treatable disease, through a single neck incision, and with low indices of complication. Aimto assess the substernal goiter surgically approach through a neck incision and to analyze the surgical complications. Materials and methodswe carried out a historical cohort by retrospective analysis of the charts of patients submitted to thyroidectomy, and 33 of them (10. 4 %) had substernal goiter. Resultsall 33 patients were surgically treated through a neck incision without the need for sternotomy. We did not observe definitive lesions in the inferior laryngeal nerve or definitive hypoparathyroidism. Only 2 patients had recurrent nerve paresis; and 2 patients were re-operated because of a neck hematoma. Conclusionpatients with substernal goiter can be safely treated surgically through a single <b>neck</b> incision, <b>bearing</b> low complication rates...|$|R

50|$|Pakenham Mill {{was built}} in 1831. Clement Goodrich was the miller in 1846, when he took on an apprentice. The mill came into the {{ownership}} of the Bryant family in 1885. A steam engine was used as auxiliary power. In 1947, the mill was nearly tail-winded, but the miller managed to turn the cap in time to avoid this happening. The mill was restored in 1950, with a new weatherbeam fitted by Amos Clarke, the Ipswich millwright. At this time the swing-pot <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> from Buxhall mill was installed.

The collagen-like region of B. anthracisis known to be densely substituted by unusual O-glycans that may be used for developing species-specific diagnostics of B. anthracis spores and thus targeted therapeutic interventions. In the present study, we have explored the species and domain specificity of BclA glycosylation within the B. cereus group. First, we have established that the collagen-like regions of both B. anthracis and B. cereus are similarly substituted by short O-glycans that bear the species-specific deoxyhexose residues anthrose and the newly observed cereose, respectively. Second we have discovered that the C-terminal globular domains of BclA from both species are substituted by polysaccharide-like O-linked glycans whose structures are also species-specific. The presence of large carbohydrate polymers covering the surface of Bacillus spores may have a profound impact on the way that spores regulate their interactions with biotic and abiotic surfaces and represents potential new diagnostic targets...|$|E
