By compressing the first 256 to 512 bytes of a 4 KiB page, this virtual memory compression system determines whether the configured compression level threshold can be achieved for a particular page; if achievable, the rest of the page would be compressed and retained in a compressed cache, and otherwise the page would be sent to auxiliary storage through the <b>normal</b> <b>paging</b> system.

40|$|The Multi-threaded Paging problem (MTP) generalizes Paging to {{the case}} where there are many threads of requests.

40|$|In five {{experiments}} {{new methods}} of computer-supported reading were introduced and tested. Self-pacing was permitted in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), in which words are presented sequentially at a fixed locus. In Experiments 2 through 5 regressions were also allowed in RSVP.

There {{was no difference in}} reading speed or comprehension caused by the nature, analogue (mouse), or digital (keystroke) of the control over reading speed, but there was a greater tendency to change speed in the analogue condition than in the digital condition. In Experiment 5 sub-jects read for over two hours in an RSVP condition with self-pacing and regressions or in a <b>normal</b> <b>page</b> condition: subjective reports of discomfort were not different in the two condi-tions, but reading speed in the RSVP condition was approximately half that in the page condition.

The goal {{of this study was}} to compare reading rates from two dynamic-presentation methods that have been proposed to facilitate reading from computer-based displays. Prior research has shown that both normally sighted and low-vision observers read text displayed to the same location, one word at a time [known as rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) ], faster than a page of text. A similar comparison with text scrolled continuously across the screen also shows faster reading for low-vision patients, but the relative change from a standard page view is substantially less (15 % faster for the scroll display versus 80 % faster for RSVP). In this study we directly compared these techniques. For those with normal vision, reading from the RSVP display was 1. 3 times faster than reading from the scroll display �t� 9 � � 3. 32, P � 0. 009 �.

Estimation of model parameters is however di ¢ cult since volatility is unobservable {{and the associated}} likelihood function is not available in closed form. This thesis explores an alternative method for estimation of the parameters of stochastic volatil-ity models possible incorporating jumps, requiring only closed form analytical expressions for the conditional moments of integrated volatility and empirical quadratic variation measures computed using high frequency intraday data. This facilitates treating volatility and jumps as observed state variables, which help overcome some of the econometric di ¢ culties when dealing with stochastic volatility models. In contrast to other computationally demanding estimation procedures, the GMM estimator used in this thesis {{is very easy to}} implement.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades {{there has been a}} growing {{scientific}} and societal concern arising for the possible effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in humans and wildlife. As a result, many in vivo as well as in vitro studies have been developed to identify possible EDCs and determine potential hazards. Many of these studies focused on the interaction of these toxicants with estrogen receptors (ERs). However, many xenobiotics exert their endocrine disrupting effects via other mechanisms of action, including those interfering with other steroid hormone receptors, steroidogenesis and thyroid hormones (THs). Various regulatory agencies have expressed the need for extensive screening programs for potential EDCs, but such an approach would require an excessive amount of animals due to the high numbers of compounds to be tested. Thus, there is an urgent need for in vitro assays that are capable of rapidly identifying various endocrine disrupting properties, preferably using a high throughput system. At present, a wide array of in vitro screening assays using e. g. genetically modified yeast or immortal tumor cell lines have been developed to detect interactions with various sex steroid hormone receptors. In this respect, the development of in vitro screening assays for thyroid hormone interactions clearly lags behind, {{in spite of the fact}} that changes in thyroid hormone homeostasis can have deleterious health effects on development or <b>normal</b> <b>Page</b> 1 of 10 Toxicological Sciences...|$|R
