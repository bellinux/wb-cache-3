5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, if there is <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must {{be transferred to the}} first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E
5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it.|$|E

50|$|Haushofer's {{version of}} autarky {{was based on}} the quasi-Malthusian idea that the earth would become {{saturated}} with people and no longer able to provide food for all. There would essentially be <b>no</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> productivity.|$|R
5|$|Prince Christian {{was given}} the title Prince of Denmark and his family {{moved into a new}} {{official}} residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church practice.|$|E

50|$|In {{the general}} population, <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> is {{expected}} <b>in</b> the frequency oftissue reactions attributable to radiation exposure and <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> is expected <b>in</b> {{the incidence of}} congenital or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to in-utero radiation exposure. <b>No</b> significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> heritable effects {{has been found in}} studies of the children of the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or in the offspring of cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy, which indicates that moderate acute radiation exposures have little impacton the overall risk of heritable effects in humans.|$|R
50|$|Several {{attempts}} to replicate Cohen et al.'s 2006 and subsequent experiments using larger sample sizes {{have failed to}} reproduce Cohen's impressive results {{associated with the use}} of self-affirmation exercises by African-American students. One experiment by Paul Hanselman using Cohen's methodology showed only a negligible 0.065 <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> GPA, while an even larger experiment demonstrated <b>no</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> achievement at all.|$|R
25|$|In males {{previously}} having undergone radiotherapy, {{there appears}} to be <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy. However, the use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} protein product was confirmed, DCC {{knockout}} mice were created. As DCC−/− mutations are rapidly fatal {{due to a}} lack of nervous system development, DCC+/− mice were assessed for increased tumour development over two years, and <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> tumour predisposition was detected.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the lack}} of {{apparent}} benefit, {{a series of three}} meta-analyses reported that vitamin E supplementation is associated with an increased risk of death; one of the meta-analyses performed by the Cochrane Collaboration also found significantly increased mortality for the antioxidant vitamins A and beta-carotene. A subsequent meta-analysis found no mortality benefit from vitamin E, but also <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> mortality either.|$|E
50|$|As {{with his}} other Republican contemporaries, he was fiscally conservative, but {{accepted}} federal money for unemployment aid, transportation projects, and water management programs.

To determine whether vaccination increased cardiac death, we reviewed NYC death certificates for comparable periods in 1946 and 1948 (N = 81, 529) and calculated adjusted relative death {{rates for the}} postvaccination period. <b>No</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> cardiac deaths were observed...|$|R
25|$|In 1962, Vicary {{admitted}} to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results, {{the story itself}} being a marketing ploy. An identical experiment conducted by Henry Link showed <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> cola or popcorn sales. The claim that the small cinema handled 45,699 visitors in six weeks has led {{people to believe that}} Vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Paris had doubled since 1815, with <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> its area. To accommodate the growing population {{and those who}} would be forced from the centre by the new boulevards and squares Napoleon III planned to build, he issued a decree annexing eleven surrounding communes, and {{increasing the number of}} arrondissements from twelve to twenty, which enlarged the city to its modern boundaries.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth National Government {{said that}} if {{emissions}} were not stabilised at 1990 levels by the year 2000, a low-level carbon charge would be introduced in December 1997. By 1996, the Fourth National Government changed the emissions target to either <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 2000 net {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} from 1990 volumes or a 20% reduction if it was cost-effective and had no impact on trade.|$|E
50|$|Observations {{before and}} after the opening of Insite {{indicated}} <b>no</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> drug dealing or petty crime in the area. There was no evidence that the facility influenced drug use in the community, but concerns that Insite ‘sends the wrong message’ to non-users could not be addressed from existing data. The European experience has been mixed.|$|R
50|$|Under her stewardship, the Baltimore County Sheriff's Office {{attained}} a 20-year retirement plan, newer office equipment, upgrade in firearms, higher training standards, new security scanners, and after September 11, 2001, a new camera observation system was ordered, and {{was to be}} installed the following year.

25|$|A higher {{bypass ratio}} {{increases}} the thrust {{for the same}} engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F-135 is in the hover using its increased bypass ratio, the thrust augmentation decreases to 50% with <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> fuel flow. Thrust augmentation increases to 52% in horizontal flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from Greenland, the anonymous {{author of the}} Old Norwegian scientific work Konungs skuggsjá (circa 1250) described in detail the physical characteristics and feeding behavior of these beasts. The narrator proposed there must only be two in existence, stemming from the observation that the beasts have always been sighted in the same parts of the Greenland Sea, and that each seemed incapable of reproduction, as there was <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> their numbers.|$|E
25|$|Thornhill and Gangestad {{found that}} women {{are much more likely}} to sexually fantasize about and be {{attracted}} to extra-pair men during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than the luteal phase, whereas attraction to the primary partner does not change depending on the menstrual cycle. A 2004 study by Pillsworth, Hasselton and Buss contradicted this, finding greater in-pair sexual attraction during this phase and <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> attraction to extra-pair men.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in the British Medical Journal in December 2011 concluded that there was <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the risk of death for musicians at the age of 27. Although the sampled musicians faced an increased risk of death in their 20s and 30s, this was not limited to the age of 27. A 2015 article in The Independent also provided statistical evidence that popular musicians are not more likely to die at the age of 27.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E
25|$|By year's end it {{was clear}} that current pacification efforts were ineffectual, as had been the air campaign. Johnson then agreed to McNamara's new {{recommendation}} to add 70,000 troops in 1967 to the 400,000 previously committed. While McNamara recommended <b>no</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the level of bombing, Johnson agreed with CIA recommendations to increase them. The increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in Saigon, Hanoi and Warsaw. While the bombing ended the talks, North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine.|$|E
