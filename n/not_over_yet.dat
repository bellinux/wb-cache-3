5|$|With The Evil Thing destroyed, Max, Sean and Cassie save Priscilla. She angrily {{yells at}} Cassie and calls her a witch, and Sean rejects Priscilla {{in favor of}} Cassie. After Priscilla leaves, they save the pizza {{delivery}} man, who offers them free pizza in return for releasing him, then follows Priscilla to hit on her, to her disgust. Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing. Sean leaves shortly afterward. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace. The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing. The film concludes with Cassie realizing that The Evil Thing has been brought back to life {{and that it is}} <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E
25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared {{and go back to}} sleep for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, it is a sign that the winter is <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E
25|$|As Australian number 8 Steve Tuynman {{took the}} ball {{from the back of}} the scrum, he searched for Nick Farr-Jones, utilising the blind under Alan Jones' command. Farr-Jones {{occupied}} Campese opposite winger and passed the ball to him, allowing Campese to run along the left wing. At the start of his run, Campese ran past Butler, who was unable to make the defending tackle. But Campese's run was <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet,</b> he swerved past the Welsh fullback, and executed a wonderful sidestep to get past the Welsh inside center. Campese's sidestep led him toward a group of defenders, so he then offloaded to Simon Poidevin, who quickly passed the ball to Michael Lynagh who scored an easy try under the post. Australia won 28–9 in one of their greatest victories at the time.|$|E

25|$|The ten {{remaining}} war-junks anchored at {{the entrance}} of Bias Bay. Unbeknownst to the British, thirteen additional junks were nearby. Chui A-poo survived the battle, but the danger was <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> Commander Hay ordered that on 1 October, the remaining junks be attacked, so he sent a letter to Rear Admiral Sir Francis Augustus Collier requesting reinforcements while he prepared for further fighting. Collier dispatched the small six-gun sloop-of-war HMS Fury to the scene along with boats of marines from HMS Hastings. Under Commander John Willcox, the Fury arrived off Bias Bay where the Columbine and Canton were anchored. The pirates at this time fled further into the bay, but were still trapped by the Royal Navy. Only the small Pinghoi Creek provided a possible avenue for departure. On 1 October, the British attacked, destroying 23 additional junks and leaving Chui A-poo's base in ruins.|$|E
25|$|After {{these events}} Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, {{but with her}} psionic {{potential}} divided between them, neither ability is {{as strong as it}} once was. The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's X-Club. Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which was {{at the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o for his role in the murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.|$|E

500|$|After a poor race in Canada, {{where he}} stalled {{on the grid}} before the {{formation}} lap before receiving a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race started, Coulthard said that Ferrari could still {{be caught in the}} season's nine remaining races: [...] "We have to look towards Magny-Cours and put this (Montreal) race behind us. The championship is <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> and although we cannot change what happened in Canada, we can try to close the gap." [...] Former World Champion and President of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to clinch the title after Häkkinen's continuing run of poor results. Michael Schumacher came into the race confident that his car would perform well at the circuit. Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore played down his team's chances saying, [...] "We need a miracle to finish on the podium." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} Prohibition, so too {{came the}} end of the Alamo Foods Company. [...] The company went back to their prior name: San Antonio Brewing Association (1933–1952). [...] Most {{believed}} beer production would quickly return to the levels before the 1920 ban. [...] However, Pearl's hard times were <b>not</b> <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> [...] In 1933, the nation was still deep in the grips of the Great Depression. [...] Although most of the public would have loved to enjoy a Pearl, the financial situation of most made buying beer an unaffordable luxury. [...] Through her skillful management, Emma Koehler kept the brewery afloat through the Depression, selling beer to those who could afford it and continuing many of the business ventures that had carried the brewery through Prohibition.|$|E
