40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> in a community cohort {{of black and white}} girls, using different definitions of <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> as described in the literature. Research Methods and Procedures: Three-day food diaries collected as part of the National Growth and Health Study were examined to identify episodes of <b>night</b> <b>eating,</b> which was defined in five different ways: eating > 25 % of daily caloric intake after the last evening meal, eating > 25 % of daily caloric intake after 7 PM, eating > 50 % of daily caloric intake after the last evening meal, eating > 50 % of daily caloric intake after 7 PM, or eating between 11 PM and 4 : 59 AM. Results: Frequency of <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> varied tremendously depending on how the behavior was defined. For the least restrictive definition (> 25 % of total intake after last meal), 50 % to 70 % of girls reported one <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> event; for the most restrictive (> 50 % of total intake after last meal), only 1. 5 % of 11 -year-old girls' diaries and 3. 5 % of 19 -year-old girls' diaries contained a <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> event. The frequency of <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> decreased dramatically (typically by a factor of 10) if the inclusion criteria required multiple <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> events in a given week. Discussion: A standard definition of <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> behavior is needed to advance the field.

5000|$|A {{study done}} by SL Colles, JB Dixon, and PE O’Brien on {{snacking}} at night relates obesity, binge eating disorder (BED), and psychological stress to <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> <b>syndrome</b> (NES). This syndrome constitutes {{a pattern of}} eating where most food is consumed {{late in the day}} and at night, sometimes including waking up during the night to snack. It causes morning anorexia and evening hyperphagia and insomnia. This condition is observed most frequently in overweight and obese people. Being a recent syndrome to emerge, the study says, “It is currently unclear whether NES, as a discrete condition, is associated with emotional distress, impairment or disability, and thereby represents an eating disorder of clinical significance”. [...] It may just be a behavioral condition linked to obesity and weight gain. The study was conducted by distributing surveys to people ages 18-70 that had not undergone previous bariatric surgery.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, several {{studies have found that}} those afflicted with NSRED all have {{different}} symptoms and behaviors specific to them, yet they also all have similar characteristics that doctors and psychologists have identified to distinguish NSRED from other combinations of sleep and eating disorders such as <b>Night</b> <b>Eating</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Dr. John W. Winkelman says that typical behaviors for patients with NSRED include: “Partial arousals from sleep, usually within 2 to 3 hours of sleep onset, and subsequent ingestion of food in a rapid or ‘out of control’ manner.” They also will attempt to eat bizarre amalgamations of foods and even potentially harmful substances such as glue, wood, or other toxic materials. [...] In addition, Schenck and Mahowald noted that their patients mainly ate sweets, pastas, both hot and cold meals, improper substances such as “raw, frozen, or spoiled foods; salt or sugar sandwiches; buttered cigarettes; and odd mixtures prepared in a blender.” ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Night</b> <b>eating</b> <b>syndrome</b> (NES) is {{an eating}} disorder, {{characterized}} by a delayed circadian pattern of food intake. Although there is some degree of comorbidity with binge eating disorder, it differs from binge eating in {{that the amount of}} food consumed in the evening/night is not necessarily objectively large nor is a loss of control over food intake required. It was originally described by Dr. Albert Stunkard in 1955 [...] and is currently included in the other specified feeding or eating disorder category of the DSM-5. [...] Research diagnostic criteria have been proposed and include evening hyperphagia (consumption of 25% or more of the total daily calories after the evening meal) and/or nocturnal awakening and ingestion of food two or more times per week. The person must have awareness of the night eating to differentiate it from the parasomnia sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Three of five associated symptoms must also be present: lack of appetite in the morning, urges to eat in the evening/at night, belief that one must eat in order to fall back to sleep at night, depressed mood, and/or difficulty sleeping.|$|E

5000|$|NSRED {{is closely}} related to <b>Night</b> <b>Eating</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (NES) {{except for the fact that}} those {{suffering}} from NES are completely awake and aware of their eating and bingeing at night while those suffering from NSRED are sleeping and unaware of what they are doing. NES is primarily considered an eating disorder while NSRED is primarily considered a parasomnia; however, both are a combination of parasomnia and eating disorders since those suffering from NES usually have insomnia or difficulty sleeping and those suffering from NSRED experience symptoms similar to binge eating. Some even argue over whether NES and NSRED are the same or distinct disorders. [...] Even though there have been debates over these two disorders, specialists have examined them to try to determine the differences. Dr. J. Winkelman noted several features of the two disorders that were similar, but he gave one important factor that make these disorders different. In his article Sleep-Related Eating Disorder and Night Eating Syndrome: Sleep Disorders, Eating Disorders, Or both, Dr. Winkelman said, “Both disorders involve nearly nightly binging at multiple nocturnal awakenings, defined as excess calorie intake or loss of control over consumption.” [...] He also reported that both disorders have a common occurrence of approximately one to five percent of adults, have been predominantly found in women, with a young adult onset, have a chronic course, have a primary morbidity of weight gain, sleep disruption, and shame over loss of control over food intake, have familial bases, and have been observed to have comorbid depression and daytime eating disorders. However, Winkelman said, “The most prominent cited distinction between NES and SRED is the level of consciousness during nighttime eating episodes.” Therefore, these two disorders are extremely similar with only one distinction between them. This information provided by Dr. Winkelman shows how doctors and psychologists have difficulty differentiating between NES and NSRED, but the distinction of a person’s level of consciousness is what doctors chiefly rely on to make a diagnosis. One mistake that is often made is the misdiagnosis of NSRED for NES. [...] However, even though NSRED is not a commonly known and diagnosed disease, many people suffer from it in differing ways while doctors work to find a treatment that works for everyone; several studies have been done on NSRED, such as the one conducted by Schenk and Mahowald. [...] These studies, in turn, provide the basic information on this disorder including the symptoms, behaviors, and possible treatments that doctors are using today.|$|E

As with other forms of disordered eating, cognitive and behavioral treatment modalities may be effective in reducing NES symptoms. This review presents evidence for a variety of behavioral treatment approaches, including behavioral therapy, phototherapy, behavioral weight loss treatment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. A more detailed overview of cognitive-behavioral therapy for NES is provided. All of these studies have been case studies or included small samples, and all but one have been uncontrolled, but the outcomes of many of these approaches are promising. Larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to advance NES treatment literature. With the inclusion of NES in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) as a “Feeding or Eating Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified,” more sophisticated, empirically-supported, behaviorally-based treatment approaches are much needed.

Realizou-se uma busca sistematizada das informações nas bases de dados PubMed usando os seguintes descritores: eating disorders, circadian rhythm, <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{binge eating}} disorder e sleep patterns. Os transtornos alimentares, como a síndrome do comer noturno e o transtorno da compulsão alimentar periódica, têm sido considerados e relacionados a um atraso no ritmo circadiano da ingestão alimentar e saciedade prejudicada. Os ritmos circadianos são aqueles que apresentam um período de 24 h, como, por exemplo, o ciclo sono-vigília, temperatura corporal, atividade e comportamento alimentar. Distúrbios provocados pelas alterações nos horários de sono/vigília influenciam o apetite, a saciedade e, consequentemente, a ingestão alimentar, o que parece favorecer o aumento desses transtornos. Percebe-se que o comportamento alimentar pode ser influenciado por ritmos circadianos. Porém, mais estudos e o maior conhecimento sobre a ritmicidade alimentar podem contribuir com o melhor entendimento do comportamento alimentar atual, atuando na prevenção e/ou tratamento de transtornos alimentares. This review aims at reviewing aspects related to eating disorders arising from changes in circadian rhythm.

Eating disorders, such as <b>night</b> <b>eating</b> <b>syndrome</b> and binge eating disorder, have been considered and related to a delay in circadian rhythm in food intake and impaired satiety. Circadian rhythms are those that show a period of 24 h, for example, sleep-wake cycle, body temperature, activity and eating behavior. Disorders related to changes in sleep-wake schedules influence the appetite, satiety and consequently food intake, which seems to increase such disorders. Circadian rhythm can influence eating behavior.
