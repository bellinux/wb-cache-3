500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's {{family members}} to devote some {{publishing}} rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. [...] "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can go make this person well to go create some income...'" [...] Landy expressed similar views. [...] "Saying that [...] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars {{if you can get}} up and fly around the room.'" [...] This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.|$|E

Chilling Effects contains the original complaint letter from the law firm used by the Church of Scientology, Moxon & Kobrin.Google provided {{a copy of the}} letter from law firm Moxon & Kobrin to online rights watchdog Chilling Effects, a joint project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, and University of San Francisco law school clinics. Helena Kobrin, lawyer for the Church of Scientology, stated she took offense at the name of the Web site, saying: [...] "It implies that the First Amendment gives people some special right to infringe copyrights." [...] Sergey Brin and Larry Page were both questioned on Google's response to the Church of Scientology's complaints in a 2004 interview in Playboy Magazine, and they appreciated Chilling Effects as a [...] "nice compromise". Brin explained the new scenario: [...] "So <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do a generic search on Scientology, you get a link to a site that discusses the legal aspects of why the anti-Scientology site isn't listed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The series {{focuses on}} the {{exploits}} and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty and his acerbic wife Sybil, {{as well as their}} employees: porter and waiter Manuel, maid Polly, and, in the second series, chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in [...] "raising the tone" [...] of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as [...] "that golfing puff adder", [...] "my little piranha fish" [...] and [...] "my little nest of vipers". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of [...] "Basil!" [...] At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance. Basil occasionally longs for a touch of class, sometimes by playing recordings of classical music. In one episode he is playing music by Brahms when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: [...] "You could have them both done by <b>now</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't spend the whole morning skulking in there listening to that racket." [...] Basil replies, with exasperation, [...] "Racket?? That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!" ...|$|E
