40|$|Face-to-face {{interviews}} were conducted to identify the main changes in gear and vessel technology that may have improved the fishing efficiency {{of a number of}} French, Danish, and Basque fleets over the past few decades. Important changes include the gradual appearance of twin trawls (Danish and French trawlers) and trammel-nets (French gillnetters), and the increased polyvalence of Basque bottom trawlers. The results suggest that fishing effort descriptors that are not traditionally measured (gear type, groundrope type, length of net used per day, headline length, crew size, number of winch or <b>net</b> <b>drums)</b> may have a substantial impact on catch rates. Adjusting fishing effort using such descriptors may generally improve the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality...|$|R

A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, Ross Tiger is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used {{for a longer period}} than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers.

25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or <b>net</b> <b>drums.</b> These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|R

25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or <b>net</b> <b>drums.</b> Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|R

5000|$|The {{technique}} of setting drum lines {{is also used}} in Queensland and New South Wales, {{where they have been}} used in association with shark nets. Before 1962, there were 82 recorded attacks. Since the policy was implemented there has only been one recorded death, at Amity Point in January 2006. 21-year-old Sarah Kate Whiley was attacked by as many as three sharks in Rainbow Channel. The attack occurred in an unpatrolled area.

5000|$|In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa a {{long term}} shark control program utilising a {{combination}} of shark <b>nets</b> and <b>drum</b> lines are used to mitigate the risk of shark attack. The region's shark attack statistics primarily reflect the effectiveness of <b>netting,</b> as <b>drum</b> lines were only introduced recently, following their successful use for over 40 years in Queensland, Australia. The Board states [...] "Both types of equipment function by reducing shark numbers {{in the vicinity of}} protected beaches, thereby lowering the probability of encounters between sharks and people at those beaches." [...] At Durban, from 1943 until the installation of shark nets in 1952, there were seven fatal attacks. No fatalities at Durban and no incidents resulting in serious injury have occurred since nets were installed there. At other protected beaches in KwaZulu-Natal, from 1940 until most of those beaches were first netted in the 1960s, there were 16 fatal attacks and 11 resulting in serious injury. In the three decades since nets were installed, there have been no fatal attacks at those beaches and only four resulting in serious injury. It is unclear whether more sharks caught on drum lines survive when compared to shark net captures in KwaZulu-Natal, but the lines have shown reduced non-target species bycatch. Drum lines set in the region are baited with 500 grams of meat per hook and are believed to only attract sharks from several hundred metres away.|$|R

In January 2014, drum lines were introduced in Western Australia to catch potentially hazardous sharks.

These include more comprehensive shark tagging efforts and associated tracking and notification systems, capture and translocation of sharks to offshore waters, research into shark feeding and foraging behaviour, public shark threat education programs and encouraging higher risk user groups (surfers, spear-fishers and divers) to use personal shark protection technology.|$|R
500|$|Murray cod were {{originally}} {{the most common}} large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod — very large, very long-lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, The Argus. Yet, fishing effort continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and reels, handlines, setlines, <b>drum</b> <b>nets,</b> gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the Register News (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929: ...|$|R
