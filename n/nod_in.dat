5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault {{that was going to}} cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions that range from securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults. Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a Nod media manipulation, which convinces {{the world that the}} GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to a cut in GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of <b>Nod</b> <b>in</b> Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May, Arsenal {{announced}} the line-up for the 2014 Emirates Cup, an annual tournament {{held at the}} Emirates Stadium. The tournament will consist of Arsenal (the hosts), Spanish side Valencia (who last participated in inaugural Emirates Cup), Portuguese side Benfica and Ligue 1 outfit Monaco. Arsenal will play Benfica on 2 August 2014, followed by Monaco a day later. The winners are crowned based on points accumulated and goals scored (with shots taken being taken into account if standings remain level). The last friendly to be announced for Arsenal {{turned out to be}} the opening fixture of the pre-season schedule, with the non-World Cup participating squad members involved against Conference South side Boreham Wood. The match finished 2–0 to the Gunners following second half strikes from Kristoffer Olsson in the 68th minute and a penalty from striker Benik Afobe in the 86th minute in what proved to be a stern test for Arsène Wenger's side. Arsenal began their Emirates Cup campaign opening to Benfica on 2 August. Starting the match with a high tempo, Arsenal found the breakthrough in the 26th minute following a goal by Yaya Sanogo, who scored his first goal in his Arsenal career, despite having 14 first team appearances last term. Arsenal continued the high tempo, and five minutes before time, Héctor Bellerín picked out Joel Campbell, who struck a volley past goalkeeper Artur to give Arsenal a two-goal advantage. Sanogo soon completed his hat-trick by netting twice in the space of as many minutes, as he first rolled into an empty net and then prodded past Artur after being picked out from the left by Kieran Gibbs. Arsenal entered half time with a 4–0 lead, and looked sure to progress further into the competition. Four minutes after the restart and Sanogo had his fourth, with Artur spilling a low drive from Ramsey into his path before calmly slotting home. However, Benfica pulled one back just past the hour mark, with a long throw from Maxi Pereira touched on for Nicolás Gaitán to <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> from close range, but Arsenal managed to progress after a busy afternoon in North London, with the match showcasing the debuts of Chilean Alexis Sánchez from the bench, along with Wenger opting to start £16million signing Calum Chambers.|$|E
500|$|The {{treasury}} surplus had evaporated and the nation's {{economic health}} was worsening – precursors to the eventual Panic of 1893. Congressional elections in 1890 had gone against the Republicans; and although Harrison had cooperated with Congressional Republicans on legislation, several party leaders withdrew {{their support for}} {{him because of his}} adamant refusal to give party members the <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> the course of his executive appointments. Specifically, Thomas C. Platt, Matthew S. Quay, Thomas B. Reed and James Clarkson quietly organized the Grievance Committee, the ambition of which was to initiate a dump-Harrison offensive.

500|$|... "Scream & Shout" [...] is {{an upbeat}} dance-pop track {{written in the}} key of G minor and has a {{moderate}} tempo of 130 beats per minute. It contains lyrics about having an enjoyable night out. The track begins with Spears rapping the first eight lines with Nicki Minaj-esque vocals. As the song proceeds to its chorus, will.i.am joins Spears on vocals. [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] interpolates {{a sample of the}} lyric [...] "It's Britney, bitch", which was first used on Spears' 2007 single [...] "Gimme More", and is used before every breakdown on the track.

500|$|In 2013, Hutcherson voiced the {{character}} <b>Nod</b> <b>in</b> the animated action-adventure 3D film Epic, {{loosely based on}} William Joyce's book, The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs; the film is his most commercially successful except for The Hunger Games series. As filming approached for The Hunger Games sequel, , he enlisted celebrity trainer Bobby Strom to assist him in five hour-long workouts per week. The film brought in $420 million at the North American box office, making it his most commercially successful film. Todd Gilchrist of Indiewire proclaimed of the actor's performance that [...] "Hutcherson's maturing talents achieve a parallelism with {{the character}}'s self-actualization, proving subtler and more self-aware with every resigned decision he makes {{on behalf of the}} people around him that he loves." [...] Hutcherson received his second MTV Movie Award for [...] "Best Male Performance" [...] {{for his role in the}} sequel.|$|E
500|$|In any case, {{such was}} Robey's {{popularity}} in {{the role that the}} German theatre and film producer Max Reinhardt declared that, should the opportunity arise for a film version, the comedian would be his perfect choice as Falstaff. Cotes described Robey as having [...] "a great vitality and immense command of the [...] He never faltered, he had to take his audience by the throat and make them attentive at once because he couldn't play himself in." [...] Although he was eager to be taken seriously as a legitimate actor, Robey provided a subtle <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> the direction of his comic career by using the wooden cane intended for the Prime Minister of Mirth for the majority of his scenes as Falstaff. The poet John Betjeman responded to the critics' early scepticism: [...] "Variety artistes are a separate world from the legitimate stage. They are separate too, from ballet, opera, and musical comedy. It is possible for variety artists to appear in all of these. Indeed, no one who saw will ever forget the superb pathos and humour of George Robey's Falstaff". Later, in 1935, Blanche Littler persuaded Robey to accept Carroll's earlier offer to play Bottom, and the comedian cancelled three weeks' worth of dates. The press were complimentary of his performance, and he later attributed his success to Littler and her encouragement.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make you laugh, <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> agreement, shake your fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than {{he has been in}} for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's always been one of Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E

2500|$|Brain {{originally}} {{played a}} French instrument, a Raoux piston-valve horn, {{similar to that}} used by his father.

[...] In 1951 he switched to an Alexander single B instrument, complaining that [...] "they want me to play the right notes all of the time!" [...] The Alexander had a custom lead pipe which was narrower than the usual, and offered a sound which, if not comparable to the Raoux, at least gave a <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the lighter French instrument.|$|E
2500|$|During his reign, it {{was said}} the City Council would vote {{according}} to Hamann's <b>nod.</b> <b>In</b> 1963, the State of California imposed Local Agency Formation Commissions statewide, but largely to try to maintain order with San Jose's aggressive growth.

In the game's expansion pack, Yuri's Revenge, the main villain nukes Seattle, Washington several times to extort money from a computer corporation. In a mod for C Generals Zero Hour, called 2015, Waste Land Conflict, the game features a nuke that is very realistic in damage and creates an EMP wave.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond its seeming {{cultivation}} of German philosophy, Poor Dionis is stylistically {{an homage to}} German Romanticism. It is most closely related to late-18th-century fantasy works by E. T. A. Hoffmann or Novalis. Among the Eminescu scholars, Perpessicius, Philippide, Simion and Constantin Ciopraga see a special connection between Dionis and Heinrich von Ofterdingen, the [...] "Blue Flower" [...] minstrel of Novalis' prose. In addition to this floral motif, Eminescu takes from Novalis the whole narrative device of dream sequences, and the uchronic worldview of [...] "magical idealism". From Adelbert von Chamisso, the Romanian writer borrowed a [...] "man without a shadow" [...] motif that had already inspired him to write the 1869 short story [...] "My Shadow". Eminescu's characterology is described by several authors as a <b>nod</b> <b>in</b> the direction of J. W.
