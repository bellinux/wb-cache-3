500|$|Planning {{guidance}} on aircraft noise advises that [...] "in some circumstances the public perceive general aircraft noise levels as more disturbing than similar levels around major airports." [...] This {{is a result}} of the tonal characteristics of light aircraft engines and the activities they are engaged in, including: repetitive circuit flying at low-altitude near an aerodrome, during which aircraft are audible for long periods; slow climbing aircraft engaged in parachute drop or glider tug activities concentrated around the drop zone or aerodrome, also audible for long periods; erratic and repetitive engine noise from aircraft engaged in aerobatics; and piston-engines on full power in areas of low background noise, leading to the perception that such noise is more intrusive. In an attempt to alleviate these problems, the majority of aerodromes implement <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>procedures</b> designed to route aircraft away from noise sensitive areas, and more than 50 are required by the government to provide consultative facilities in which local concerns can be raised with aerodrome operators.|$|E

40|$|A design {{methodology}} {{based on the}} principles of system analysis was used to design a <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> approach <b>procedure</b> for Louisville International Airport. In a flight demonstration test, this procedure was shown to reduce the noise at seven locations along the flight path by 3. 9 to 6. 5 dBA and reduce the fuel consumed during approach by 400 to 500 lbs. The noise reduction is significant given that a 3 -decibel difference represents a 50 % reduction in acoustic energy and is noticeable to the human ear, and the 7 % reduction {{in the size of the}} 50 DNL contour that would result if all aircraft were to perform the procedure. The fuel saving is also significant given the financial benefit to airlines and the accompanying reduction in gaseous and particulate emissions. While the analysis of aircraft performance data showed how pilot delay, in combination with auto-throttle and flight management system logic, can result in deviations from the desired trajectory, the results confirm that near-term implementation of this advanced <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>procedure</b> is possible.

The results indicate that the velocity along the ﬂight path plays a dominant role in the resulting statistical properties of the noise metric on the ground. Furthermore it is shown that uncertainty in the velocity has a signiﬁcant impact on beneﬁt obtained by <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> ﬂight <b>procedures.</b> This indicates the need to include uncertainty into the optimisation process.

40|$|Research on {{helicopter}} <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> at DLR {{has led to}} the development of a pilot assistant display for following prescribed noise-optimised landing procedures. An intuitive tunnel-in-the-sky display was chosen in order to reduce pilot workload during complex manoeuvres. The tunnel representation allows the pilot to anticipate the coming flight path. This has led to improvements in flight path accuracy compared to flights with a standard primary flight display with target indicators only. Trajectory generation is performed partly during flight which allows the update of the displayed trajectory relative to the current helicopter position. After selecting the desired <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>procedure,</b> landing place and approach direction, a transition trajectory is generated that leads the pilot to the entrance point of the actual procedure.

25|$|The {{stall warning}} and stall {{recovery}} systems {{were at the}} centre of the inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air pressure valve (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>procedure</b> could have activated the warning light that indicated low air pressure in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay {{at the end of the}} runway.

The rapid prototyping simulation environment NOIse SIMulator (NOISIM) includes a sound propagation model {{based on a}} ray tracing algorithm that incorporates atmospheric and ground effects.

Two main applications of this tool are pre-sented in this thesis: the design of a weather-specific <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>procedure</b> and a statistical study of the effect of weather on average noise contours. The first case study explores the magnitude of the weather effects on the noise impact of a Boeing 767 in communities near Boston Logan Airport during takeoff.

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{currently}} developing a tool chain {{for the environmental}} analysis of aircraft flight trajectories. The presented tool chain consists of tools for aerodynamic analysis, engine cycle modelling, flight simulation, and aircraft noise prediction. The aircraft geometry is not modified within the process but provided as an input. The implemented tools come from specialized DLR institutes, are harmonized in input/output format and are integrated into one fully automated analysis process. The PHX ModelCenter framework allows for a DLR-wide accessible server/client architecture. The new tool chain is applicable to evaluate arbitrary three dimensional flight trajectories. The focus of the presented work lies on the environmental analysis and optimization of approach and departure procedures. The predicted ground noise levels are compared to results from a dedicated DLR flyover noise campaign in 2009.

50|$|To {{practice}} {{take off}} and landing, a pilot would often fly many patterns, one after another, from the same runway. Upon each landing, depending on the runway distance remaining, aircraft and pilot capabilities, <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>procedures</b> in effect, and air traffic control clearance, the pilot will perform either a full stop landing (taxi to the runway beginning for subsequent take-off), a touch-and-go (stabilize in the landing roll, reconfigure the aircraft for take-off, and take-off without ever stopping the aircraft), or a stop-and-go (decelerate to a stop, then take-off from the remaining runway). In the U.S., when operating in a controlled airport a pilot can be cleared for the option, allowing any of the landing options above, or a rejected landing, at pilot's discretion.|$|E
50|$|The short primary runway (20R/2L), {{coupled with}} the local noise restrictions, can require a takeoff at or near full power (95-97% power).

40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} a {{significant}} concern to communities near airports, and therefore a constraint {{to the growth of}} aviation. Advanced <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> approach and arrival procedures have been shown in previous studies and in limited implementation to be a cost effective means of achieving near- and medium-term noise reductions. Additionally, these procedures can be employed to reduce fuel bum, emissions, and flight time. However, because of aircraft trajectory variations due to operational uncertainties, it is difficult for air traffic controllers to predict and maintain separation between aircraft. Thus, without proper decision support tools, controllers need to add arbitrarily large buffers, thereby reducing airport throughput. A design and operational framework is proposed to advance the implementation of <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> arrival <b>procedures.</b> Under this framework, a target spacing is given at an intermediate metering point to ensure with a certain (limited) probability that the remainder of the <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> arrival <b>procedure</b> may be completed without further controller intervention. Small probability exceptions are handled by alternative plans. (cont.) A design methodology is presented, along with the details of a unique Monte Carlo simulation-based Tool for the Analysis of Separation And Throughput (TASAT) that is used to determine the minimum possible target spacing between aircraft at the metering point. Hence, a smaller separation buffer can be used and traffic throughput can be maintained at a relatively high level. The Monte Carlo simulation-based design tool accounts for operational uncertainties such as differences in aircraft performance, Flight Management System logic, aircraft weight, pilot response, and winds. A mode-decomposition and autoregressive approach was developed to model the stochastic wind variations between flights. Aircraft trajectories from the Monte Carlo simulations (or from radar tracks if they are available) are used {{within the context of the}} design methodology to determine target spacing for given desired probability. The utility of the design framework, methodology, and tools was illustrated through simulation analysis and an Area Navigation (RNAV) Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) flight test at Louisville International Airport. (cont.) The flight test results were consistent with the model prediction. The research demonstrated that with the developed tools, <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> arrival <b>procedures</b> can be implemented to achieve noise reductions and other economic and environmental benefits while maintaining a relatively high level of traffic throughput.
