The mechanism for this <b>nurse</b> <b>tree</b> effect has frequently been ascribed to mycorrhizal fungi, but no detailed molecular-based studies of the mycorrhizal fungal communities associated with A. menziesii roots have yet been conducted. • Methods: We examined the structure of the mycorrhizal fungal communities associated with A. menziesii in varying forest types and seasons and assessed the potential for common mycelial networks between A. menziesii and Pinaceae hosts, particularly Pseudotsuga menziesii. Study sites were located in the Klamath-Siskyou region in southern Oregon, United States. Molecular approaches were used to identify the mycorrhizal fungi (ITS rDNA) and plant hosts (trnL cDNA). • Key results: Arbutus menziesii hosts a highly diverse mycorrhizal fungal community with similar composition to communities found on other angiosperm and Pinaceae hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of the mycorrhizal genus Piloderma revealed that host species and geographic location had little effect on fungal taxon relatedness. Multihost fungal taxa were significantly more frequent and abundant than single-host fungal taxa, and there was high potential for the formation of common mycelial networks with P. menziesii. • Conclusions: Our results suggest A. menziesii is a major hub of mycorrhizal fungal diversity and connectivity in mixed evergreen forests and {{plays an important role in}} forest regeneration by enhancing belowground resilience to disturbance...|$|E

30|$|This general process {{facilitates}} {{the conversion of}} an alien community to a natural forest through selective removal of the invading <b>nurse</b> <b>trees,</b> when the <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> have relatively small stem diameters. However, sometimes the nurse stand is composed of large, branchy and useful trees {{of one or more}} alien tree species {{that could be used for}} timber, poles, fuelwood or charcoal (Geldenhuys & Bezuidenhout 2011). The first priority would then be to remove all utilizable stems before the rehabilitation actions are implemented. The non-harvestable tree debris could be left on site but in sections not longer than 2  m (as bird perch sites, as micro-sites for seedling establishment and small animals and micro-organisms, to protect seedlings against browsers, and as a slow-release ‘fertilizer’ through natural wood decomposition). However, if such an alien tree stand grows inside the riparian zone or on the banks of a river, then the first priority would be the safety and security of the river in terms of people’s lives, infrastructure (bridges, pipelines, water pumps, etc.), and ecotourism activities on and along the river. Then all alien trees should be removed in one action to prevent stream blockage during flooding, by drifting branch wood and deformed non-harvestable main stems, which may cause associated increased flood levels and infrastructure damage. If good native forest regeneration were present in such an alien tree stand, then care should be taken to minimize damage to the native tree regeneration by the falling cut <b>nurse</b> stand <b>trees.</b> But even if the native tree regeneration is damaged by the cut trees, then most of the regenerating woody species will recover through relatively fast vegetative regrowth. In this latter case of removing large tree debris along the river, the non-harvestable tree debris could be burnt on site with care to keep the burnt spot footprint small and to prevent scorch of the regenerating plants of native woody species.|$|R

The most northerly in distribution of western North American white pines, it occurs across 18 ∞ of latitude and 21 ∞ of longitude, and comprises diverse community types [...] successional, climax, and treeline, mesic to xeric, and pure to mixed associations. Studies within {{the last three decades}} have elucidated a unique ecology for whitebark pine, derived in part from obligate seed dispersal by Clarkís nutcrackers, but also from its multiple functional roles. These roles include facilitating community development after fire, acting as a <b>nurse</b> <b>tree</b> on harsh sites, and protracting snow melt at treeline, thus regulating downstream flows. Whitebark pine seeds are an important wildlife food for granivorous birds and mammals, including black bears and grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Area and elsewhere. Whitebark pine may be considered both a foundation and a keystone species for promoting regional biodiversity, influencing ecosystem processes, and facilitating community development and stability. Furthermore, in some treeline ecosystems, whitebark pine is the most frequent conifer to initiate formation of tree islands, which in turn may facilitate treeline response to climate change. Whitebark pine communities are experiencing dramatic declines as a result of widespread infection by the non-native fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust, advancing succession from fire suppression, and widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae), particularly in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Furthermore, climate change is predicted to result in range shifts for whitebark pine both to higher elevations and more northern latitudes. As whitebark pine declines as a functional component in subalpine and treeline ecosystems, the resulting structural and functional changes in communities may have multiple effects, particularly on regional biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Land {{degradation}} {{is widespread}} {{and a serious}} threat affecting the livelihoods of 1. 5 billion people worldwide of which one sixth or 250 million people reside in drylands. Globally, {{it is estimated that}} 10 – 20 % of drylands are already degraded and about 12 million ha are degraded each year. Driven by unsustainable land use practices, adverse climatic conditions and population increase, land degradation has led to decline in provision of ecosystem services, food insecurity, social and political instability and reduction in the ecosystem’s resilience to natural climate variability. Several global initiatives have been launched to combat land degradation, including rehabilitation of degraded drylands. This review aimed at collating the current state-of-knowledge about rehabilitation of degraded drylands. It was found that the prospect of restoring degraded drylands is technically promising using a suite of passive (e. g. area exclosure, assisted natural regeneration, rotational grazing) and active (e. g. mixed-species planting, framework species, maximum diversity, and use of <b>nurse</b> <b>tree)</b> rehabilitation measures. Advances in soil reclamation using biological, chemical and physical measures have been made. Despite technical advances, the scale of rehabilitation intervention is small and lacks holistic approach. Development of process based models that forecast outcomes of the various rehabilitation activities will be useful tools for researchers and practitioners. The concept of forest landscape restoration approach, which operates at landscape-level, could also be adopted as the overarching framework for rehabilitation of degraded dryland ecosystems. The review identified a data gap in cost-benefit analysis of rehabilitation interventions. However, the cost of rehabilitation and sustainable management of drylands is opined to be lower than the losses that accrue from inaction, depending on the degree of degradation. Thus, local communities’ participation, incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge, clear division of tasks and benefits, strengthening local institutions are crucial not only for cost-sharing, but also for the long-term success of rehabilitation activities...|$|E

40|$|Beech {{woodland}} can {{be restored}} by direct planting of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seedlings in abandoned areas, but {{this method is}} generally avoided in forestry because of the growth difficulties of beech in full-light conditions. This study tested a method that consists of planting beech seedlings in full-light conditions with silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) or Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) as <b>nurse</b> <b>trees.</b> A total of 65 two-year-old beech seedlings surrounded by either 3, 4, 5 or 6 pine or birch seedlings or without competitors were planted in bare-soil open-field conditions in Central France. Tree growth and light availability were monitored {{at the end of}} each of the following 3 years, and soil moisture was also measured the last year. At the end of the experiment, aerial biomass measurements were made on the beeches. Results showed that relative beech growth in terms of diameter was significantly reduced by the local neighbouring trees and that this reduction was particularly noticeable in the pine treatments where there was extensive pine seedling development. In contrast, relative beech height did not exhibit any significant variations among the treatments. Light availability was decreased by the neighbouring trees, especially in the pine treatments. Light reduction was more pronounced in the last 2 years and in the middle or lower parts of the canopy of the subject beech. Soil water content was lower under the pine canopies than under the birch canopies, and was positively correlated to beech relative diameter growth. Specific leaf area, height-to-diameter ratio and crown length-to-crown width ratio weakly but significantly increased with competition from the neighbours. Beech biomass partitioning was only weakly affected by the treatments. This study showed that <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> tend to reduce beech growth but improve form although effects remained weak due to the insufficient length of the experiment. Further studies are also needed to quantify the effects of the neighbourhood on the growth of competitive herbaceous vegetation and on changes in the microclimatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the southern}} Brazilian highlands is characterized by Araucaria forest and Campos grassland. Evidences indicate that Araucaria forest is currently expanding over grassland and that this expansion may occur by nucleation or edge dynamics. Nucleation mechanisms of Araucaria forest expansion are well documented, whereas mechanisms of expansion starting from the forest edge are not. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess how prominent is Araucaria forest expansion over Campos grassland starting from the forest edge, and (2) to discuss about the possible mechanisms underlying sapling community colonization in grassland. We conducted our sampling in 11 transects disposed from the forest edge towards the grassland. The transects were distributed in four study sites. Each transect was 50 m long and was divided into 25 plots with area of 8 m 2. All forest woody sapling individuals were identified and registered. We considered distance from forest edge, presence of dead shrubs, Baccharis uncinella cover, <b>nurse</b> <b>tree</b> cover and rock cover as predictors of forest plant abundance and composition. Niche and distance contribution on the explanation of sapling composition and abundance were partitioned using, respectively, canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regressions. Cover of nurse trees explained almost 31 % of total variation in sapling abundance, followed by {{the distance from the}} forest edge that explained 6. 9 %. Site explained 7. 6 % of total variation in sapling species composition, followed by distance from the forest edge, which explained 2. 3 %, whereas niche had a minor (2. 1 %) and non-significant proportion of variation explanation. Our findings show that Araucaria forest expansion over native grasslands in southern Brazil relies deeply on the nurse plant effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that Araucaria forest forms nuclei scattered in the grassland where nurse plants or nurse rocks are established. Here, we bring evidences that nurse plants are important also to the tree encroachment starting closer to the forest edge. This study provides new information on the mechanisms involved in the forest expansion over native grasslands...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands are {{productive}} transitional lands between terrestrial {{and aquatic}} systems. They provide social, {{economic and cultural}} values, while providing valuable services such as carbon storage, water purification, flood abatement and biodiversity support. While wetlands only cover ~ 3 % of the globe, they contribute up to 40 % of these global renewable ecosystem services. Worldwide degradation of wetlands through urbanisation, conversion to agriculture and flood management schemes {{has resulted in a}} 50 % loss of the worlds original wetlands, with New Zealand being one of the most extreme examples of this with > 90 % of the original extent of wetlands being lost. Wetlands unique hydrology results in distinct plant zonation and community composition and seedling survival is the primary factor that influences stand structure and community composition. However, restoring degraded wetlands is challenging because the alterations to the hydrology through filling or diverting water will impact the effect of physical, chemical and biotic environmental variables on native plant establishment. The use of facilitation in restoration through successional planting using nurse trees, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is common in restoration, however research into the effectiveness of these techniques in wetland systems is lacking. This thesis is comprised of two studies with aims to determine the factors that had the biggest impact on the survival and growth of kahikatea and totara in Wairio wetland and inform future restoration. Wairio wetland has large isolated remnant kahikatea trees, so my first study focused on how these established trees and a connection to fungal hyphae networks influenced the survival and growth of newly planted saplings. One sapling of each species was planted at the dripline of the remnant tree, and another sapling of each species was planted 2 metres from that point. Out of the 16 remnant kahikatea trees used, 8 were ‘disturbance’ plots where saplings were planted in 35 μm mesh bags that excluded roots but fungal hyphae could penetrate, in slotted pots which were turned every 3 months. In the 8 remaining ‘undisturbed’ plots, saplings were planted into the ground. I assessed the influence of distance and disturbance on sapling survival and growth using a chi-square test of independence and general linear models. Results showed that kahikatea trees survived better than totara overall. The survival of totara was significantly reliant on a close proximity to the remnant kahikatea, and a connection with mycorrhizal networks. Kahikatea had greater biomass than totara, however they suffered strong conspecific competition with the remnant trees, with kahikatea saplings planted at the dripline having 51. 28 g greater biomass with regular disturbance of AMF mycelium. Kahikatea trees are light demanding species, and therefore growing under the canopy of a parent tree has a negative impact on kahikatea saplings growth. Knowing that kahikatea and totara trees respond differently to nurse trees and AMF, my second study focused on how nurse effects and AMF association changes with chemical, physical and environmental stressors. The survival and growth of 5 -year-old kahikatea and totara trees, with or without a nurse across 10 blocks in Wairio wetland were analysed. At each tree, soil moisture and root available nutrients were measured and soil cores were taken to determine gravimetric soil moisture, reduction-oxidation reaction (redox), pH, soil carbon content and I counted the presence of AMF spores in two size classes. I assessed tree survival and growth against these variables using a chi-squared test of independence and general linear models. The results of this study showed that kahikatea survived better than totara trees in the very wet blocks, where no other species survived. Totara trees survived in the upland sites of the wetland and had better growth than kahikatea trees. Moreover, totara trees grew 24 cm taller {{in the presence of a}} <b>nurse</b> <b>tree,</b> and were strongly positively associated with spore number.

40|$|Received: 30 June 2014 / Accepted: 14 October 2014 / Published online: 30 October 2014 In {{harsh environments}} {{facilitation}} alleviates biotic and abiotic constraints on tree recruitment. Under ongoing drier climate change, we expect facilitation {{to increase as}} a driver of coexistence. However, this might not hold under extreme abiotic stress and when the outcome depends on the interaction with other drivers such as altered herbivore pressure due to land use change. We performed a field water-manipulation experiment to quantify the importance of facilitation in two coexisting Mediterranean trees (dominant Juniperus thurifera and coexisting Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) under a climate change scenario. Shifts in canopy dominance favouring Q. ilex could {{be based on the}} extension of heterospecific facilitation to the detriment of conspecific alleviation. We found that saplings of both species transplanted under the canopy of <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> had greater survival probability, growth and photochemical efficiency. Intra- and interspecific facilitation mechanisms differed: alleviation of abiotic stress benefited both species during summer and J. thurifera during winter, whereas browsing protection was relevant only for Q. ilex. Facilitation was greater under the dry treatment only for Q. ilex, which partially agreed with the predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis. We conclude that present rainfall availability limits neither J. thurifera nor Q. ilex establishment. Nevertheless, under current global change scenarios, imposing increasing abiotic stress together with altered herbivore browsing, <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> could differentially facilitate the establishment of Q. ilex due to species-specific traits, i. e. palatability; drought, heat and cold tolerance, underlying species differences in the facilitation mechanisms and eventually triggering a change from pure juniper woodlands to mixed formations.

The soil was weakly acidic, and kaolin minerals dominated. The amount of exchangeable bases in surface soils, soil temperature (> 35 °C), and relative light intensity were all highest in the grassland. Seedling growth was also highest in the grassland, whereas many seedlings died there over 81 months. Growth and survivability were very similar in secondary and logged forests. The death of the seedlings in the grassland was attributable to an extremely high light intensity for all species. In contrast, the seedling growth rate in all species was also enhanced by light intensity. In conclusion, dipterocarp seedlings can be planted on highly degraded land such as grassland, although high light intensity limits their survival. Planting under <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> such as regenerated pioneer trees may be an effective method to enhance seedling survival under open conditions such as grassland...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands {{are highly}} {{productive}} ecosystems that support abundant native fauna and flora and provide many essential functions and services, for example water purification, erosion stabilisation, floodwater storage, groundwater recharge, peat accumulation and biogeochemical cycling. Despite the vast benefits they provide, worldwide loss and degradation of wetlands still continues, mainly due to agriculture, urban development, {{population growth and}} exploitation. Wetland disturbance can cause altered hydrological regimes, invasive species introduction, soil and water eutrophication, habitat fragmentation, and reductions in native fauna and flora leading to an overall reduced functionality. Ecological restoration is an active practice commonly undertaken in degraded wetlands to re-establish ecosystem functioning, and most commonly includes revegetation, reconstruction of hydrology, weed control, pest management, and native species reintroductions. Wairio Wetland located on the eastern shores of Lake Wairarapa forms a part of Wairarapa-Moana, the largest wetland complex in the lower North Island of New Zealand. Wairio Wetland was historically an abundant kahikatea swamp forest, with a diverse range of waterfowl, waders and freshwater fish. However, the wetland was adversely affected by draining from the Lower Wairarapa Valley Development Scheme (LWVDS) during the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s, the construction of Parera Road, and invasion of willow tree seeds planted in the Wairarapa Valley for erosion control. Draining of the wetland, division from nearby lagoons and ponds, nitrogen and phosphorus build-up in waterways and exotic weed invasion all contributed to the poor state of the wetland. In 2005, Ducks Unlimited (DU) {{in conjunction with the}} Department of Conservation (DOC) and various members of the local community formed the Wairio Wetland Restoration Committee, with aims to manage and restore the wetland to its natural pre-settlement state. Restoration activities undertaken at the site that have included native tree planting, earthworks, weed control, pest management and fencing sections of the site to exclude cattle, have been met with mixed success over the years. This thesis reports on two studies undertaken at Wairio Wetland with aims to inform future restoration efforts at the site. The committee have proposed to divert nutrient rich water through Wairio Wetland to increase filtration and improve the water quality of Lake Wairarapa. However, the effects of nutrient loading on established plant communities at the site are unknown. Therefore the first study, conducted between December 2012 and May 2013 in Stage 2 of the wetland, examined the effects of fertiliser addition on biomass, structure and diversity of a wetland plant community. Different levels of phosphate and nitrate fertiliser were applied to 50 plots (4 m 2) of vegetation at the site with percent cover, and average height of respective species recorded every four to five weeks. Results showed that the addition of phosphorous and/or nitrogen had neither a positive nor negative effect on the plant community at Wairio with no significant changes in the 15 species recorded at the site. These results contrast other studies that have reported increases in biomass, reductions in biodiversity and common/introduced species outcompeting rare/native species. The short duration of the experiment and summer drought conditions may have obscured the above-ground visual responses of the plant community to nutrient addition; therefore further continuation of this experiment is advised. Previous low success rates of native tree plantings at Wairio Wetland have significantly hindered revegetation efforts at the site. Therefore the second study, conducted between July 2011 and January 2014 in Stage 3 of the wetland, further investigates the effects of various management treatments on establishment of native woody vegetation. The study involved monitoring 2, 368 planted trees of eight native wetland tree/shrub species, including; Cordyline australis, Dacrycarpus dacridioides, Olearia virgata, Podocarpus totara, Coprosma robusta, Coprosma propinqua, Leptospermum scoparium, and Pittosporum tenuifolium. The trees were subjected to various planting treatments including the excavation or retention of topsoil, presence or absence of weedmats and presence or absence of <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> with spacing of 0. 75 m or 1. 5 m. Survival and growth of each tree was measured every six months over the 30 month experimental period. Results showed that interspecific competition and hydrology appeared to be the main processes influencing the establishment of native plantings at Wairio Wetland, with plant mortality greatest in the first year after planting. Waterlogging, in particular, was detrimental to establishment of all species at the site except D. dacridioides. Topsoil excavation and the planting of <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> at 1. 5 m spacing was the most effective management treatment combination promoting survival of plantings at Wairio. However, the success of management treatments varied greatly between species at the site and had different impacts on plant growth. Topsoil excavation was beneficial to survival of D. dacridioides and C. robusta but detrimental to growth of C. australis, O. virgata, C. propinqua, P. tenuifolium and L. scoparium. The concurrent planting of <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> with focal trees was beneficial to the survival of D. dacridioides, growth of P. totara, and survival and growth of C. australis. The planting of <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> further apart at 1. 5 m compared to 0. 75 m had a positive effect on the survival of C. propinqua and P. tenuifolium, and survival and growth of L. scoparium. Weedmats were beneficial to survival of O. virgata and growth of L. scoparium but detrimental to growth of D. dacridioides. These management treatments can be used in future revegetation efforts at Wairio Wetland, and potentially in other wetland restoration projects throughout New Zealand...|$|R

Both species were also planted for agroforestry and forestry in the two countries. A. auriculiformis is valued by farmers for both agricultural and wood-energy production in agroforestry or forestry systems in DR Congo (Kasongo et al. 2009; Shure et al. 2010; Dubliez et al. 2018), while A. mangium is mainly used to sustain eucalypt plantations to provide pulp, fuel and wood energy in the Congolese coastal plains of the Republic of the Congo (Shure et al. 2010; Bouillet et al. 2013; Epron et al. 2013; Tchichelle et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of competitive and facilitative interactions in plant communities {{is expected to}} change along resource gradients. Contrasting theoretical models predict that with increasing abiotic stress, facilitative effects are higher, lower, or similar than those found under more productive conditions. While these predictions have been tested in stressful environments such as arid and alpine ecosystems, they have hardly been tested for more productive African woodlands. We experimentally assessed the {{strength of}} tree seedling facilitation by <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> in mesic and dry woodlands in Benin, West Africa. We planted seedlings of the drought-sensitive Afzelia africana and the drought-tolerant Khaya senegalensis under three microsite conditions (closed woodland, woodland gap, and open fields). Seedling survival was greater within woodlands compared with open fields in both the mesic and dry woodlands. The relative benefits in seedling survival were larger at the dry site, especially for the drought-sensitive species. Nevertheless, plant interactions became neutral or negative {{during the dry season}} in the drier woodland, indicating that the net positive effects may be lost under very stressful abiotic conditions. We conclude that facilitation also occurs in the relatively more productive conditions of African woodlands. Our results underscore the role of environmental variation in space and time, and the stress tolerance of species, in explaining competitive and facilitative interactions within plant communitie...|$|R

The focus in stand manipulation should be to remove all nurse stand plants within the clusters and to create just enough open space adjacent to the cluster to facilitate expansion of the cluster.|$|R

About 50% of the distance from the drip line to the trunk is regarded as the closest you can cut without major risk to plants health. If it is necessary to trench closer than halfway towards the trunk, it would be advisable to engage the services of an arborist to assess the tree prior to the work being carried out, and to help <b>nurse</b> the <b>tree</b> through the period of installation.|$|R

50|$|In the Nigerien Sahara, tussocks of Panicum turgidum {{act as a}} <b>nurse</b> {{plants for}} <b>tree</b> {{regeneration}}. They have been shown facilitating the regeneration of Acacia tortilis subsp. raddiana by protecting seedlings from drought and domestic herbivory. Accordingly, transplanting seedlings of Saharan trees inside Panicum’s tussocks may promote substantially reforestation in degraded areas on a long-term scale. The leaves and shoots of this grass are palatable to livestock, and camels and donkeys will also eat it in the dry state.|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} of the Andean cloud forest raises strong biological conservation issues and threatens the sustainability of a crucial water resource. The idea that nurse-based restoration can accelerate the recovery of these forests is underexplored, despite its promise as a restoration technique. Recent conceptual models predict that facilitation among plants {{may be an important}} mechanism, but {{there is a lack of}} strong empirical support. We gathered experimental data to test this prediction and explore the relevance of using nurse-based forest restoration in these environments. A 20 -month factorial experimental design in the Andean tropical cloud forest was established. We measured the survival and estimated the biomass production of transplanted seedlings of a keystone canopy forest species, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae), in a deforested area in the presence/absence of herbivory, a potential nurse plant (the tussock grass Setaria sphacelata, Poaceae) and artificial shade. The joint effects of deforestation and herbivory led to the death of all seedlings, whereas most seedlings survived in the adjacent forest, which was used as the control. The presence of nurse plants led to significantly higher survival and growth of Ceroxylon seedlings throughout the experiment, regardless of herbivore presence. The nurse effects were explained by a reduction of the relative abiotic stress experienced by the seedlings outside the forest, that is, the consistently decreasing maximum vapour pressure deficit. Furthermore, nurse tussocks delayed and reduced the effects of herbivory by offering physical protection and a refuge for seedlings against detection by herbivores. However, the effects of herbivory and abiotic stress on facilitation were not additive. Synthesis and applications. Facilitation in degraded cloud forest can be intense as soon as the beneficiary plants are driven away from their physiological optimum (relative abiotic stress) and/or are confronted by herbivory. Using pre-established exotic tussock grasses as a nurse-based restoration technique in degraded cloud forest is a low-cost, non-detrimental (to biodiversity) option, especially in the absence of <b>nurse</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs. The success of this method requires transplanting seedlings at the base of tussocks...|$|R
