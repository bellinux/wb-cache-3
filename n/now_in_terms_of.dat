500|$|In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau hailed Off the Wall as [...] "the dance groove of the year" [...] {{and that}} Jackson's vocal stylings were a {{reminder}} that he had grown up. In a review for Melody Maker Phil McNeill expressed the opinion that in Off the Wall Jackson sounded comfortable, confident and in control. He believed [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] had a [...] "classy" [...] introduction {{and that it was}} the best song on the album. He also praised [...] "Rock with You", describing it as [...] "masterful". The reviewer concurred with a colleague that Jackson was [...] "probably the best singer in the world right <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> style and technique". Giving the album a favorable review in Smash Hits, David Hepworth said that Jackson [...] "sings like an angel". Sounds shared the same point of view, qualifying Jackson's voice as [...] "astoninshingly agile". The first side of Off the Wall is praised for its [...] "clutch of dancers that must have even Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards watching their backs".|$|E

After the promotional performances supporting the album, she had a concrete imagery about the themes {{she would like to}} incorporate. [...] "I like to create personas and then the persona changes and grows into other things... I'm at the beginning of that process right <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> thinking of my tour and stuff," [...] the singer explained. Rehearsals for the tour occurred for 10–12 hours per day. She added: [...] "When I go on tour, I like the rehearsal. I like the creation of everything. I like being able to wear my rehearsal clothes and be sweaty and not having to worry about how I look and just get into what it is I'm trying to say and do." [...] Unlike The MDNA Tour, Madonna confirmed that her son Rocco would not perform onstage, but would instead work behind the scenes of Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

It might be possible for her to show a grateful appreciation of his conduct. Devotedly fond of his little daughter, he must have felt acutely his long separation from her; {{and it was quite}} likely that he might ask to see Kitty. But there was an obstacle in the way of her willing compliance with that request, which it was impossible to think of without remorse, and which it was imperatively necessary to remove. Mrs. Presty would understand that she alluded to the shameful falsehood which had led the child to suppose that her father was dead.|$|E

6000|$|What surprises {{one most}} in this {{controversy}} {{is that men}} eminent in the legal profession should be [...] "anti-Shakesperean," [...] if not overtly Baconian. For the evidence for the contemporary faith in Will's authorship is all positive; from his own age comes not a whisper of doubt, not even a murmur of surprise. It is incredible to me that his fellow-actors and fellow-playwrights should have been deceived, especially when they were such men as Ben Jonson and Tom Heywood. One would expect lawyers, of all people, to have been most impatient of the surprising attempts made to explain away Ben Jonson's testimony, by aid, first, of quite a false analogy (Scott's denial of his own authorship of his novels), and, secondly, by the suppression of such a familiar fact as the constant inconsistency of Ben's judgments of his contemporaries in literature. Mr. Greenwood must have forgotten the many examples of this inconsistency; but I have met a Baconian author who knew nothing of the fact. Mr. Greenwood, it is proper to say, {{does not seem to}} be satisfied that he has solved what he calls [...] "the Jonsonian riddle." [...] Really, there is no riddle. About Will, as about other authors, his contemporaries and even his friends, on occasion, Ben [...] "spoke with two voices," [...] <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> hyperbolical praise, now in carping tones of censure. That is the obvious solution of [...] "the Jonsonian riddle." ...|$|E
