5000|$|In 1980, he {{left the}} firm and founded the real estate {{investment}} firm, Pacific Financial Group which purchased and redeveloped rundown buildings using <b>non-recourse</b> <b>financing.</b> By 1987, his firm had a portfolio of 5,000,000 square feet and after discovering in 1989 that 2,000,000 square feet of his portfolio contained asbestos, which was just then becoming a concern, he sold off his entire portfolio of Southern California real estate in 19 months reducing his payroll from 90 to 10 employees. The sale was timely as the market crashed in 1990. In 1991, he co-founded with Victor Coleman and Andrew Sobel the Arden Pacific Management Group - named after the street he grew up on in Beverly Hills. Arden began purchasing, at deep discounts, foreclosed commercial buildings from banks eager to exit from the burdens of property management. The firm focused on properties in good locations in Southern California with small tenants (who {{did not have a}} lot of negotiating leverage and would not have a significant impact to Arden's cash flows if they moved) and who had owners willing to provide direct financing of up to 90% of the purchase price. By 1996, Arden had a portfolio of 24 office buildings and 4,000,000 square feet. In October 1996, Arden Realty, Inc. went public on the New York Stock Exchange in a $496 million IPO organized by Lehman Brothers. Subsequent share issuances in July 1997 and February 1998 raised an additional $360 million and $710 million respectively. By 2004, Arden had 200 buildings with 19,000,000 square feet.|$|E

Essentially, this thesis will be investigating what the main cost determinants are which lenders use to price the risk in project finance transactions. Project finance risks such as market, operational, sponsor, political / regulatory and environmental risks are investigated. A loan transaction database is used to fit these risks to determine the relevant loan parameters available in the database, employing a regression model is used to obtain which loan parameters, and, in turn, risks, lenders price into {{the cost of the}} loans. The database represents <b>non-recourse</b> project <b>finance</b> transactions throughout Africa from 1995 to 2015 and was filtered down 89 loan entries that contained the most important loan parameters.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by need for financing India’s huge infrastructure gap. Given that infrastructure assets are heterogeneous – this study focuses on power projects. Firstly the study examines whether the current regulatory environment is conducive for attracting large scale investments, since the country has a checkered past in light of Enron fiasco, during the 1990 ’s. Secondly, global fund managers, tends to make allocation of capital based on relative attractiveness of power sector on a regional basis – thus a comparative study of Asian peer group has been conducted. Thirdly, Project finance is characterized by long gestation period, high leverage and <b>non-recourse</b> <b>financing</b> – thus this study undertakes a credit risk analysis of key power sector companies, and thereby indentifies nature of risk lenders may be exposed to {{in case of a}} potential investment into the sector. Fourthly, the dearth of a quantitative risk framework for project finance has led to attempts for modeling uncertainty related to project’s cash flow or NPV using Monte Carlo Simulation techniques. This study applies Monte Carlo simulation of cash flows to depict value at risk (VAR) for a hypothetical (1000 MW) Greenfield power project. This can also depict scenarios in which – cash flows from operations may be inadequate to service debt. Currently – only Merton’s options pricing model is widely used to determine credit spread or risk neutral probability of default. Further the study indentifies sources of cash flow risk, and incorporates realistic values for such parameters based on case study of NTPC power plants and regulatory guidelines. The study finds that, the risk-return trade of Indian power sector investments compares favorably with respect to, the actual returns generated by listed Infrastructure Funds.

40|$|For {{the time}} being {{there is no clear}} {{definition}} of project finance and there is no unanimity about the role of its specific characteristics as potentially distinctive traits. Empirical research leads to the following conclusions: - in order to realise an undertaking a special company is created, called a project company or a vehicle company (also: special purpose company), - the sponsors and shareholders in such a company are also companies which actively participate in the project e. g. as contractors or subcontractors, - project participants (contractors, managers, lenders, often governmental agencies, and, if possible, final users) all create a network of contracted connections aiming at distinguishing the possible types of risk and ascribing the consequences of those risks to particular parties, - a company implementing a project uses a high leverage and the creditors have limited rights to file a claim {{in the case of a}} failure of the project (limited-recourse or <b>non-recourse</b> <b>financing).</b> Most projects are realised in the industries that are particularly significant to the state, and in many cases a project cannot be launched without a permit from the special governmental agencies overseeing the investment process and representing the state interests while the buildings are erected and used. This article deals with two trends in the research on project finance. One of them focuses upon project finance as a method of financing virtually only investments in the infrastructure sphere and it includes research on the justification for private capital involvement in the infrastructure, in addition to research on the role of the state in implementing projects and on the effect of project finance upon the situation in the state where the undertaking is realised. The other trend perceives project finance as a method of financing investment in general and it aims at presenting the conditions for deriving greater benefits than in the case of carrying out undertakings by the company itself...|$|E
40|$|Public private {{partnership}} (PPP) is {{an alternative}} method for the financing of public infrastructure, based {{on the concept of}} financing public undertakings by private funds. The technique {{can be used in a}} number of different sectors such as transportation, energy, waste management, housing, education and healthcare. However, the focus for this essay is made to large-scale capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as, inter alia, motorways, railroads, bridges, water supply and energy facilities. PPP is commonly used all over Europe, particularly in England, and have recently grown exceedingly in the Nordic countries. Despite this European trend, the Swedish government has so far been hostile against making use of the PPP. However, given the positive outcome from the development that has taken place in the Nordic countries, Sweden is likely to follow the track. There are various forms of private public partnerships, however, the basic concept is that a private company, solely established for the purpose of carrying out the project in question, takes the primary responsibility for the financing, designing, building and operating of a project facility, which is then transferred to the public sector. Using such a single purpose vehicle (SPV) reduces the risks for the project sponsors thus making it possible for them to attain a “non-recourse financing”. This means that the lenders have no recourse against the project sponsors and therefore only may take recourse to the assets held by the project company for the repayment of their loans and for interest payments on such loans. However, the value of the asset of the project company, at least at the beginning of the construction phase, is significantly limited and uncertain. There is often no established market for project assets such as a power plant or a motorway and the facilities are in general owned by the public sector, rather than the project company. The <b>non-recourse</b> <b>financing</b> technique in addition to the fact that there is no real asset to take security in thus exposes the creditors to considerable risk. The lenders are forced to almost solely rely on the future revenues of the project company. Both the creditors and the equity holders therefore focus their attention on the prospective future cash flow of the project company. The most important objective for the creditors as well as for the equity holders is thus to keep the project running. The future revenues are generally provided by the public sector party, once the project is finalized. Hence, the key threat is a public sector party cancellation of the contract. In order to make these projects “bankable” the parties involved are forced to create innovative contractual solutions taking these foreseeable conditions into consideration. Apart from the traditional form of security, various forms of “quasi security” are often used. One of the most important features in this regard is direct agreements. Direct agreements are entered into between the project company, the banks financing a project and the parties to the project’s key underlying commercial contracts. The key contracts for this purpose would typically include the concession agreement, the main construction contract, any operation and maintenance agreement, any long-term supply contract and any long-term sales contracts. The objective of a direct agreement is basically to enable the banks to “step into the shoes of the project company” if it defaults in its loan obligations. The agreements provide a right for the creditors to assume the project company’s rights and obligations under the contract for a specified period of time or allow the transfer of the contract to a separate company established by the banks for this purpose. If such an assumption is made, then the project contractors can not terminate the defaulted contracts prematurely, their cancellation rights are to say “frozen”. Hence, direct agreements draw third parties into a projects finance agreement in that compulsory consent to accomplish an eventual assignment is obtained prior to such transfer is being considered. In doing so, the lenders can hinder third parties from exercising their contractual rights. However, direct agreements are met in accordance with English law, which is generally considered more ‘creditor friendly’ than the Germanic law tradition. Albeit the parties involved have agreed upon this solution, implications in the Swedish jurisdiction may render these agreements ineffective. The key threat to the efficiency of using direct agreements in Sweden is the potential bankruptcy of the project company. The bankruptcy itself does not necessarily create significant complications for the lenders, however the expected right of the bankruptcy’s estate to enter into the debtor’s contracts exposes the lender to higher risk. The purpose of this essay is to examine the efficiency of direct agreements used in private public partnerships and project financing in general, relating to large-scale infrastructure projects, in the light of Swedish law, particularly with regard to the project company’s bankruptcy and the principal rule of the estate’s right to enter into the debtor’s contracts. The two basic questions are, firstly whether the bankrupt estate is entitled to enter into the project company’s contracts, (or from a contractual perspective, whether the solvent party is entitled to cancel its contractual obligations) and secondly whether the right of the estate to accede to the project company’s contract is mandatory and hence an agreement opposing such right is void against the estate. The essay seeks to discuss these basic questions de lege lata as well as de lege ferenda in Sweden and to compare the legal situation in the Nordic countries and in England. Furthermore, the purpose of this essay is to suggest solutions of the problems evinced, principally to devise a law reform. The essay holds that the two perspectives deliberated in doctrine, the solvent party as opposes to the bankrupt estate and its creditors prove inadequate pertaining to project finance. There is considerably more interest to take into account that renders the traditional argumentation invoked in legal literature inapplicable for the particular circumstances at stake in project finance. The concept of “all creditors” must be modulated. The interest of protection noticeably varies among different creditors and hence there are reasons to give preference for the syndicated lenders who comprise the major part of the creditors and those subjected to the major risks. It is held that none of the likely risks expressed in legal literature or key arguments invoked in favour of the bankruptcy perspective is pertinent considering project finance where the lenders have step in rights. There are incitements to consider other creditors in the contracting of the solvent party and the debtor prior to the bankruptcy. The solvent party does incur an inconsiderable further damage or inconvenience beyond what he would have suffered if the contracts instead had been cancelled on the day of the bankruptcy judgement. Besides this inconvenience is not a matter of concern solely for the single contracting party however encompasses the public interest of infrastructure and the quality of such. Besides the lender’s step in comprise a substitute providing a noticeably better solution. The most efficient and favourable solution for “all creditors” will be achieved by entitling the lender’s and hence not the estate to enter into the project company’s contracts, particularly the project agreement. It may certainly be questioned why the estate should be considered as a “new third party” not possible to include in direct agreements prior to a bankruptcy, when all major creditors participate in such agreement. However, the essay states that de lege lata as well as de lege ferenda remain uncertain. The principal rule de lege lata give preference to the right of entry for the estate in analogy with the 63 § SAG. Albeit exceptions can be made in analogy with anticipatory breach such deviations from the basic principle is subjected to inconveniences. The debate de lege ferenda indicates a highly trend towards company reorganisation and increased priority of secured creditors. The objectives behind the new insolvency rules and the essence of the debate of incorporating the two insolvency proceedings are considerably more likely to be achieved if the lender’s are entitled to enter into the debtor’s contract. The commission advocates flexibility and the importance of giving all the creditors incentives to participate. It can be questioned if the best way to achieve such goals is through mandatory rules is. Conversely, the principle of freedom of contract and encouraging private work out insensitive, as provided for in direct agreements, is without doubt a better solution for the particular circumstances in project finance. In conclusion, a balancing of interest, de lege lata, definitely points in favour of entitling the lender’s to step in and the solvent party to cancel and hence not entitling the estate to accede to the debtor’s contracts. However, uncertainty prevails. Besides, it is just a matter of time before a legal reform is brought into force, prescribing general rules in favour of the bankruptcy estate to enter. It is thus essential to carve out exceptions for project finance and public private partnership in such proposal. Against this background the essay concludes with a proposal of a law reform...|$|E
40|$|Deposited {{with the}} {{permission}} of the author. © 2000 Dr. Raphael Henry ArndtOver the last decade there has been an increasing trend by governments in Australia and throughout the world to use the skills and expertise of the private sector in developing and implementing infrastructure projects. The agreement for these projects must allocate responsibility for dealing with the risks which may arise to either the government directly, or on behalf of consumers, or to the private sponsor. This thesis investigates risk allocation in the private provision of infrastructure, particularly in build-own-operate (BOO) and build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) projects. Its primary objective is to identify a framework for efficient risk allocation so that decision makers can assess the efficiency of the risk allocation in past projects and can attempt to increase the efficiency of the risk allocation in future projects. This thesis defines an efficient situation as one where the risk allocation cannot be varied without the total risk premium for the entire project being increased, and approach based on Pareto optimality. As {{it is almost impossible to}} determine the true risk premium charged by parties for risk bearing, risks should be allocated to the party best able to control and manage them. This is explained to mean the party which is best able to control or manage the likelihood of the risk occurring or the size of its consequences if it does occur. It also means the party with the best access to reasonable mitigation techniques and the party which is least risk averse. Those exogenous risks which are not easily allocated in this way should be shared so that both parties, the sponsor and the government, have an incentive to manage them. Some of the options for sharing these risks are examined. The application of the theory of efficient risk allocation is simplified by using a categorical risk framework. This approach is then tested on seven case studies of recent Australian projects spanning several industry sectors. Finally, the theoretical hypotheses and assumptions are tested in a survey of key participants in the Australian private infrastructure industry. This survey not only confirms that the basic theory for efficient risk allocation is valid but also identifies the key areas of concern to the private sector when it considers project risk allocation. Risks of concern are identified and possible options for risk sharing are investigated. This thesis concludes that it is possible to achieve efficient risk allocations in practice, and that by achieving this outcome transaction costs can be reduced, allowing cheaper infrastructure services to be supplied to the community. However, several hurdles to achieving this outcome are identified. These include the peculiar characteristics of banks and their position in projects funded using <b>non-recourse</b> project <b>finance,</b> and the fact that most private firms fail to value potential upside risks as highly as they fear potential losses due to downside risks. More work is needed to understand and overcome these hurdles if efficient risk allocation is to be achieved in the real world. It is only then that governments can be sure that they are providing private sector infrastructure services to the community at the lowest overall cost. Open Acces...|$|R
