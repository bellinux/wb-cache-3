25|$|The Ibis is an elegiac poem in 644 lines, {{in which}} Ovid uses a {{dazzling}} array of mythic stories to curse and attack an enemy who is harming him in exile. At {{the beginning of}} the poem, Ovid claims that his poetry up to that point had been harmless, but <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to use his abilities to hurt his enemy. He cites Callimachus' Ibis as his inspiration and calls all the gods to make his curse effective. Ovid uses mythical exempla to condemn his enemy in the afterlife, cites evil prodigies that attended his birth, and then in the next 300 lines wishes that the torments of mythological characters befall his enemy. The poem ends with a prayer that the gods make his curse effective.|$|E

But at this point, and while dwelling on this occasion, his memory became darkened again; it vainly endeavoured to retrace the circumstances attending the crowning evidence of the high priest's interest in his pupil, and anxiety to identify him completely with his new protector and his new duties, which had <b>been</b> displayed when <b>he</b> conferred on the trembling boy the future distinction of one of his own names.|$|R

While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E

25|$|The Chaos {{campaign}} {{follows the}} progress Thorgar the Blooded One, a Chaos champion who fought alongside the warlord Asavar Kul in the Great War. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> looking {{to build his}} forces to launch another attack on The Empire. During this time he is guided by a sorcerer {{by the name of}} Sudobaal, who instructs Thorgar to lead his men to a Chaos shrine. After enduring a series of trials Thorgar obtains the favour and patronage of one of the chaos pantheon; either Nurgle or Khorne, depending on the player's choice. Sudobaal then instructs Thorgar to locate an elven mage who knows the location of the body of the defeated Chaos warlord Asavar Kul. During this time he allies with Kasquit, a skaven warlock engineer of clan Skryre. Having angered the skaven council, Kasquit quickly accepts the alliance in order to receive Thorgar's protection, and agrees to help Thorgar locate the mage. The campaign concludes with Thorgar killing Sudobaal for turning on him and his elevation to daemonhood, and the subsequent destruction of the city of Talabheim. Roaring his victory to the gods and claiming he can't be defeated. In the distance a huge greenskin army is preparing to launch its own attack against the Old World, this possibly heralding the game's expansion: Battle March.|$|E
25|$|Sir Launfal {{has gone}} to his room, but his faerie {{mistress}} does not appear and Sir Launfal soon realises why. Tryamour will no longer come {{to him when he}} wishes for her since he has given away her existence. Soon, her gifts have disappeared or changed. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> brought to trial. Since the jury of his peers all know that the Queen is more likely to have propositioned Launfal than the other way around, they believe Launfal's version of the encounter. However, for his insult he is given a year and a fortnight to produce the beautiful lady as proof of his boast; Guenevere says she is willing to be blinded if he manages to produce such a woman. As the day of the proof progresses, the Queen presses for him to be executed while others express doubt, particularly when two parties of gorgeous women ride up. Finally Tryamour arrives and exculpates Launfal on both counts. She breathes on Guenevere and blinds her. Gyfre, now visible, brings his horse Blaunchard, and Tryamour, Launfal, and her ladies ride away to the island of Olyroun, which in Marie de France's twelfth-century version of the tale is Avalon. Once a year, on a certain day, Sir Launfal returns and his horse may be heard neighing and a knight may joust with him, although he was never seen again in Arthur's land.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, {{following}} {{the example of}} a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home send Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.|$|E

500|$|Inglis views {{these lines}} as a {{reference}} to Harrison's [...] {{as well as his}} years {{as a member of the}} Beatles.

[...] Inglis offers a simple précis of this statement: [...] "he has paid his dues. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> his own man..." ...|$|E

500|$|Out of the {{starting}} gate, Secretariat and Sham raced evenly {{through the first}} turn. Through a half-mile, the two were even. Entering the backstretch and approaching three-quarters of a mile, Secretariat began to distance himself as Sham began to fade, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued to extend his advantage {{for the rest of}} the race, finishing 31 lengths over the second-place finisher, Twice a Prince. Twice a Prince started slowly and moved along the rail until reaching second position, passing Sham and outpacing My Gallant.
