25|$|Pop punk in the United States {{began to}} grow in {{popularity}} in the late 1980s especially in California due to bands like Dag <b>Nasty</b> <b>and</b> All, but the genre was not yet considered commercially viable by major US record labels. Bands such as Bad Religion, Descendents, and The Vandals began to inspire the formation of bands like The Offspring (1984) and the more melodic Green Day (1987), although {{it would take a}} number of years for these new bands to achieve mainstream popularity. As these new bands came into the scene, they were exposed to criticism for not representing the punk image as it originated in the 1970s, most notably by Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon. Many pop punk bands espoused a do it yourself (DIY) approach to their music, and a number of independent record labels emerged during this period, often run by band members who wanted to release their own music and that of their friends. During this period several independent labels were formed that would achieve much notoriety and commercial success in the 1990s, namely Epitaph Records (1987), Lookout Records (1987), and Fat Wreck Chords (1990). During the 1980s and early 1990s, pop punk bands such as The Queers, The Mr. T Experience, Jawbreaker and Screeching Weasel emerged. Some of these bands, including Screeching Weasel, The Queers and The Mr. T Experience, were signed to the record label Lookout! Records, which also signed Green Day.|$|E

[...] On the , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37percent of the vote to 36percent, with Sharpton and Holtzman well behind.

[...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game.

500|$|The film's {{release was}} met with controversy. Raimi made the film as gruesome as {{possible}} with neither interest in nor fear of censorship, {{which led to the}} film's receiving an X rating and being named a [...] "video nasty". Films with this label were quite violent and disturbing, and the rating was often held by pornographic and other X-rated films. While The Evil Dead was not pornographic in nature, it was {{considered one of the most}} violent films of its time, and censors had issues with the film's content, which impacted some of its commercial potential. The film was called the [...] "number one nasty" [...] in a nod to its status as both a <b>nasty</b> <b>and</b> the year's best-selling video release. Writer Bruce Kawin described The Evil Dead as one of the most notorious splatter films of its day, along with Cannibal Holocaust and I Spit on Your Grave. The film was and is still banned either theatrically or on video in some countries.|$|E
500|$|The {{team had}} several goals: factions {{should not be}} [...] "locked-in" [...] to certain strategies; players should have {{interesting}} things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play. The team believed the [...] "coolness" [...] of the Progenitor aliens would determine {{the success or failure}} of Alien Crossfire. They strove to make them feel significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics. The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce [...] "a <b>nasty</b> <b>and</b> potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down". Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions. The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart. Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Vonnegut has {{inspired}} numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published {{a compendium of}} Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's Unstuck in Time and Charles J. Shields's And So It Goes. Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to The Guardian, the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. [...] "Cruel, <b>nasty</b> <b>and</b> scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said The Daily Beasts Wendy Smith. [...] "Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, Grove {{retired from}} the Royal College of Music. Parry was chosen to succeed him, and {{although}} Stanford wholeheartedly congratulated his friend on his appointment, their relations soon deteriorated. Stanford {{was known as a}} hot-tempered and quarrelsome man. Grove had written of a board meeting at the Royal College [...] "where somehow the spirit of the d----l himself had been working in Stanford all the time – as it sometimes does, making him so <b>nasty</b> <b>and</b> quarrelsome and contradictious as no one but he can be! He is a most remarkably clever and able fellow, full of resource and power – no doubt of that – but one has to purchase it often at a very dear price." [...] Parry suffered worse at Stanford's hands with frequent rows, deeply upsetting to the highly strung Parry. Some of their rows were caused by Stanford's reluctance to accept the authority of his old friend and protégé, but on other occasions Parry seriously provoked Stanford, notably in 1895 when he reduced the funding for Stanford's orchestral classes.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night I lay in bed so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried to find somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that <b>nasty</b> <b>and</b> that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2009 season, Boren {{suffered}} a knee injury. [...] The injury was not severe {{because of the}} knee brace that he was wearing.

The media portrayed Boren as a <b>nasty</b> <b>and</b> intense player, which Boren downplayed. Early in the season, the offensive line struggled. But as the season progressed guards Boren and Bryant Browning teamed up with second-year linemen Michael Brewster, J.B. Shugarts and Mike Adams to form a unit that worked effectively. Boren missed the October 31 non-conference game against New Mexico State due to an unspecified foot injury. [...] When he returned to Michigan Stadium for the season finale, Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham was very vocal about Boren's departure.

40|$|More {{and more}} of the {{information}} on the web is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum conversations, to comment threads on news articles. In contrast to traditional, monologic resources such as news, highly social dialogue is very frequent in social media. We aim to automatically identify sarcastic <b>and</b> <b>nasty</b> utterances in unannotated online dialogue, extending a bootstrapping method previously applied to the classification of monologic subjective sentences in Riloff and Weibe 2003. We have adapted the method to fit the sarcastic <b>and</b> <b>nasty</b> dialogic domain. Our method is as follows: 1) Explore methods for identifying sarcastic <b>and</b> <b>nasty</b> cue words <b>and</b> phrases in dialogues; 2) Use the learned cues to train a sarcastic (nasty) Cue-Based Classifier; 3) Learn general syntactic extraction patterns from the sarcastic (<b>nasty)</b> utterances <b>and</b> define fine-tuned sarcastic patterns to create a Pattern-Based Classifier; 4) Combine both Cue-Based and fine-tuned Pattern-Based Classifiers to maximize precision at the expense of recall and test on unannotated utterances.
