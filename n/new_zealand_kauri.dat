It is common in cloud forest up to 700m too. The species has a preference for shaded or sheltered locations, often in permanently damp soil and near streams. It is locally abundant but mostly individuals are far between. It is common in regenerating forests along with tawheowheo Quintinia serrata. Pollination is mainly by birds. The seeds are partly covered by a fleshy aril and are dispersed by birds and other animals that eat it. The wide spreading anthers are an adaptation to pollination by birds.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} of Waipoua Forest {{in relation to}} the kauri was that it remained the only kauri forest retaining its former virgin condition, and that it was extensive enough to give reasonable promise of permanent survival. On 2 July 1952 an area of over 80 km² of Waipoua was proclaimed a forest sanctuary after a petition to the Government.The zoologist William Roy McGregor was one of the driving forces in this movement, writing an 80-page illustrated pamphlet on the subject, which proved an effective manifesto for conservation.Along with the Warawara to the North, Waipoua Forest contains three quarters of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand's</b> remaining <b>kauri.</b> Kauri Grove on the Coromandel Peninsula is another area with a remaining cluster of kauri, and includes the Siamese Kauri, two trees with a conjoined lower trunk.|$|R

5000|$|Members of Araucariaceae are {{typically}} very tall evergreen trees, reaching heights of 60 m or more.

5000|$|The {{building}} was commissioned {{in the early}} 1870s by the Fox Ministry, partially {{in anticipation of the}} abolition of the provincial governments. It was originally planned to have the building constructed in concrete and timber, but the cost of concrete at the time led to a decision to build in timber alone. The Italianate, Neo-Renaissance style was usually the domain of stone buildings, thus the building is designed to mimic stone. As an important symbol of nationhood the {{building was}} constructed to resemble an Italian stone palace to help convey its strength and stability in the expanding empire. The timber is native kauri, which could not be replicated because <b>New</b> <b>Zealand's</b> remaining public <b>kauri</b> forests are permanently protected. If the building had been constructed out of stone as planned, it may not have survived subsequent earthquakes, as it is situated near a major fault line. The architect was William Clayton and the contractors were Scoular and Archibald. When it opened in 1876, after 22 months of construction, and at a cost of £39 000, it was easily the largest building in the country [...] and is now considered to be one of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand's</b> most important historic buildings. The building was built on reclaimed land.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Long tree-ring chronologies {{have been}} {{constructed}} in the Northern Hemisphere for dendroclimatology and palaeoenvironmental studies, radiocarbon calibration and archaeological dating. Numerous tree-ring chronologies have also {{been built in the}} Southern Hemisphere, primarily for dendroclimatology, but multimillennial chronologies are rare. Development of long chronologies from the Southern Hemisphere is therefore important to provide a long-term perspective on environmental change at local, regional and global scales. This paper describes the extension of the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> Agathis australis (<b>kauri)</b> chronology from AD 911 to 1724 BC. Subfossil (swamp) kauri was collected from 17 swamp sites in the upper North Island. Kauri timbers were also obtained from an early twentieth century house on the University of Auckland campus. Twelve site chronologies and 11 independent tree-sequences were constructed and crossmatched to produce a 3631 -yr record, which was calendar dated to 1724 BC-AD 1907 against the modern kauri master chronology. A new long chronology, AGAUc 04 a, was built by combining the modern kauri data with house timbers and subfossil kauri. This new chronology spans 1724 BC-AD 1998. It is of similar length to chronologies from Tasmania and South America and is the longest tree-ring chronology yet built in <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> The greatest significance of the long kauri chronology lies in its potential as a high-quality palaeoclimate proxy, especially with regard to investigation of the El Ninio-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The chronology also has application to investigation of extreme environmental events, dendroecology, archaeology and radiocarbon calibration...|$|R

50|$|Kauri is {{considered}} a first rate timber. The whiter sapwood is generally slightly lighter in weight. Kauri is not highly resistant to rot and when used in boatbuilding must be protected from the elements with paint, varnish or epoxy to avoid rot. Its popularity with boatbuilders is due to its very long clear lengths, relative light weight and beautiful appearance when oiled or varnished. The timber has a beautiful sheen. It planes and saws very well. It holds screws and nails very well. It darkens with age to a richer golden brown colour. It does not easily crack or split or warp. Very little <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>kauri</b> is now sold, and the most commonly available kauri in New Zealand is Fiji kauri, which is very similar in appearance but lighter in weight.|$|E
