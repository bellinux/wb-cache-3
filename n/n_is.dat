40|$|The binding of Triton X- 100 (Tx) to {{bovine serum}} albumin(BSA) was studied using {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy. It was shown that TX {{has a strong}} ability to quench the BSA fluorescence mainly via a static quenching. The binding constant K {{and the number of}} bindig <b>n</b> <b>were</b> obtained from the fluorescence quenching results.
