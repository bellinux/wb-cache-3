25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer {{access to}} health care {{resources}} than men. In certain regions of Africa, many women often lack access to malaria treatment as well as access to resources that could protect them against Anopheles mosquitoes during pregnancy. As a result of this, pregnant women who are residing in areas with low levels of malaria transmission are still placed at two to three times higher risk than men in terms of contracting a severe malaria infection. These disparities in access to healthcare are often compounded by cultural norms and expectations imposed on women. For example, certain societies forbid women from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a male relative, making it harder for women to receive healthcare services and resources when they <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>most.</b>|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{nutrition}} {{are some of}} the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding. In young children, providing food (in addition to breastmilk) between six months and two years of age improves outcomes. There is also good evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world. To get food to people who <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>most,</b> both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective. Simply feeding students at school is insufficient. Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods is possible much of the time. In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended. This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature, addressing dehydration, and gradual feeding. Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection. Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices, reducing poverty, improving sanitation, and the empowerment of women.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{writing for}} The Sunday Times said that set-up [...] "proves very {{effective}} for the denouement", which Mulkern described as [...] "a creepy pay-off". Chris Bennion of The Independent {{said that the}} ending was testament {{to the fact that}} the writers [...] "know how to play their audience like a fiddle". Billen was less impressed, saying that [...] "the ultimate twist in the tale was crude, and the insight that those who offer help <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>most</b> just a little banal - by this series' standards, at least". Owen, similarly, found the motives of [...] "Chloe" [...] unconvincing, and considered [...] "the surprisingly nihilistic final shot perhaps not fully earned or plausible", but confessed that the episode was able to [...] "outmanoeuvre" [...] him, as he did not foresee the ending.|$|E

2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{adolescent}} mothers {{have become a}} target population for breastfeeding education. In industrialized {{regions of the world}} including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia [...] and the United States, single, young mothers, under age 20, are less likely to initiate breastfeeding and more likely to have lower rates of breastfeeding duration. [...] Studies have found that social barriers to continuing breastfeeding are insufficiently recognized and addressed by healthcare professionals. [...] Studies suggest that one of the greatest barriers to improving breastfeeding rates among adolescent mothers are the expectations made by health care providers who assume young mother are too immature to breastfeed successfully. [...] Therefore, these young mothers receive even less education and support than adult mothers even though they <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>most.</b> Participants of the various studies reported that medical staff directed them towards the hospital's vast supply of formula milk instead of receiving lactation consultations even when they wished to breastfeed.|$|E
