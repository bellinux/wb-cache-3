Optically, other than displaying a primary color when viewed from one incident angle, the 3 D nanowire architecture periodically displayed multiple primary color domains covering all microtrenches and the local orientation ordered nanowire arrays. A pre-growth annealing of ZnO nanoseeds resulted in nonuniformity and non-periodic distribution of the grown nanoarchitectures and thus reduced the multicolor effect.

In {{the area of}} polyelectrolytes in surfaces and interfaces, the phenomena of polyelectrolyte adsorption at oppositely charge surface was investigated. Simulations found that short range van der Waals interaction was {{a major factor in}} determining morphology and thickness of the adsorbed layer. Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes adsorbed in hydrophobic surfaces tend to be the most effective in forming multi-layers because short range attraction enhances the adsorption process. Adsorbed polyelectrolytes could move freely along the surface which was in contrast to polyelectrolyte brushes. The morphologies of hydrophobic polyelectrolyte brushes were investigated and simulations found that brushes had different morphologies depending on the strength of the short range monomer-monomer attraction, electrostatic interaction and counterion condensation. Planar polyelectrolyte brushes formed: (1) vertically oriented cylindrical aggregates, (2) maze-like aggregate structures, or (3) thin polymeric layer covering a substrate. While, the spherical polyelectrolyte brushes could be in any of the previous morphologies or be in a micelle-like conformation with a dense core and charged corona. ^ In the area of biopolymers and semiflexible polyelectrolytes in solution, simulations demonstrated that the bending rigidity of these polymers was scale-dependent. The bond-bond correlation function describing a chain 2 ̆ 7 s orientational memory could be approximated by a sum of two exponential functions manifesting the existence of the two characteristic length scales.

The patterned ETFE template is produced by embossing ETFE film into a patterned silicon master and is used as template to transfer nanogratings during the SART-NIL process. It indicates that highly reproducible and well-controlled P 3 HT nanograting film is obtained successfully with feature size of nanogratings ranging from 130 to 700  nm, due to the flexibility, stiffness, and low surface energy of ETFE mold. Moreover, the SART-NIL method using ETFE mold is able to fabricate nanogratings but not to induce the change of molecular orientation within conjugated polymer. The conducting ability of P 3 HT nanograting in the vertical direction is also not damaged after patterning. Finally, we further apply P 3 HT nanograting for the fabrication of active layer of OBHJ solar cell device, to investigate the morphology role presented by ETFE mold in device performance.
