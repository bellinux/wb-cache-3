These essays were characterized, not only by sharp logic and scintillating wit, but by a spirit of earnest, conservation. Among the most prominent were [...] " [...] Justice and Fraternity," [...] "The Right to Labor," [...] "Diversity of the Eaces, its bearing upon Negro Slavery," [...] "Negro and White Slavery," [...] "Enfranchisement of Women," [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin," [...] " [...] Carey on the Slave-trade," [...] "Negro Mania," [...] "Woman and her Needs," [...] "British Philanthropy and American Slavery," [...] "Charity which does not Begin at Home," [...] and [...] "A Letter to the Duchess of Sutherland from a Lady of South Carolina." [...] Davidson said that McCord was {{a contributor}} to the Southern Literary Messenger, to DeBow's Review, and to the Southern Quarterly Review. Examination of the complete files of the Southern Literary Messenger does not show her name; this is no <b>negative</b> <b>proof,</b> however. There are numerous anonymous articles, a few of which suggest McCord's style. A few poems are suspiciously like some selections found in [...] "My Dreams," [...] but because there is no signature her authorship cannot be inferred. In the editorial reminiscences secured and edited by Benjamin Blake Minor, one-time editor of the Messenger, McCord's name is not mentioned. The same problem is faced in a review of De Bow's Review. Her signature cannot be found, nor is her name acknowledged by J. D. B. De Bow in his quarterly Table of Contents. However, the Table of Contents of DeBow's Review lists only the signed articles; there are numerous unsigned ones. So accepting the statements of Duyckinck and Davidson, who agree that McCord contributed to these magazines, the assumption is made that for these magazines, except the Southern Quarterly, she worked anonymously. Though it is regrettable, it is true to type. Women authors often disguised their names under masculine noms de plume. However, most of her contributions to the Southern Quarterly Review were signed, and were easily available.|$|E

Even so, the metamorphoses of insects, from the egg to the maggot and caterpillar, and from these, through the nympha and aurelia into the perfect insect, are but a more individuated and intenser form of a similar transformation of the plant from the seed-leaflets, or cotyledons, through the stalk, the leaves, and the calyx, into the perfect flower, the various colours of which seem made for the reflection of light, as the antecedent grade to the burnished scales, and scale-like eyes of the insect. Nevertheless, with all this seeming prodigality of organic power, the whole tendency is ad extra, and the life of insects, as electricity in the quadrate, acts chiefly on the superficies of their bodies, to which we may add the <b>negative</b> <b>proof</b> arising from the absence of sensibility. It is well known, that the two halves of a divided insect have continued to perform, or attempt, each their separate functions, the trunkless head feeding with its accustomed voracity, while the headless trunk has exhibited its appropriate excitability to the sexual influence.|$|E
60|$|This act, therefore, {{has this}} {{distinguished}} evil in it, {{that it is}} the first partial suspension of the Habeas Corpus that has been made. The precedent, which is always of very great importance, is now established. For the first time a distinction is made among the people within this realm. Before this act, every man putting his foot on English ground, every stranger owing only a local and temporary allegiance, even negro slaves who had been sold in the colonies and under an act of Parliament, became as free as every other man who breathed the same air with them. Now a line is drawn, which may be advanced further and further at pleasure, on the same argument of mere expedience on which it was first described. There is no equality among us; we are not fellow-citizens, if the mariner who lands on the quay does not rest on as firm legal ground as the merchant who sits in his counting-house. Other laws may injure the community; this dissolves it. As things now stand, every man in the West Indies, every one inhabitant of three unoffending provinces on the continent, every person coming from the East Indies, every gentleman who has travelled for his health or education, every mariner who has navigated the seas, is, for no other offence, under a temporary proscription. Let any of these facts (now become presumptions of guilt) be proved against him, and the bare suspicion of the crown puts him out of the law. It is even by no means clear to me whether the <b>negative</b> <b>proof</b> does not lie upon the person apprehended on suspicion, to the subversion of all justice.|$|E

It is morally impossible that men or monikins can faithfully relate events that have never happened; and as it has never yet happened to any man, who is still a man, to be translated to the monikin state of being, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that he can know nothing about it. If you want historical proof, therefore, of what I say, you must search the monikin annals for evidence. There it is to be found with an infinity of curious details; and I trust the time is not far distant, when I shall have great pleasure in pointing out to you some of the most approved chapters of our best writers on this subject. But we are not confined to the testimony of history, in establishing our condition to be of the secondary formation. The internal evidence is triumphant; we appeal to our simplicity, our philosophy, the state of the arts among us, in short, to all those concurrent proofs which are dependent on the highest possible state of civilization. In addition to this, we have the infallible testimony which is to be derived from the development of our tails. Our system of caudology is, in itself, a triumphant proof of the high improvement of the monikin reason." ...|$|E

If he succeeds in this difficult exculpation, and demonstrates his innocence to the satisfaction of the court, he forfeits all his goods and chattels, and all the profits of his lands incurred and received before such acquittal; but he is freed from all other forfeitures, and from all subsequent incapacities. There is also another method allowed by the law in favor of persons under such unfortunate circumstances, as in the former case for their innocence, in this upon account of their expiation: if within six months after their return, with the punctilious observation of many ceremonies, they conform to the Established Church, and take all the oaths and subscriptions, the legislature, in consideration of the incapable age in which they were sent abroad, of the merit of their early conformity, and to encourage conversions, only confiscates, as in the former case, the whole personal estate, and the profits of the real; in all other respects, restoring and rehabilitating the party.|$|E

[...] The Scottish surgeon James Braid coined the term [...] "hypnotism" [...] in his unpublished Practical Essay on the Curative Agency of Neuro-Hypnotism (1842) as an abbreviation for [...] "neuro-hypnotism," [...] meaning [...] "sleep of the nerves." [...] Braid fiercely opposed the views of the Mesmerists, especially the claim that their effects were due to an invisible force called [...] "animal magnetism," [...] and the claim that their subjects developed paranormal powers such as telepathy. Instead, Braid adopted a skeptical position, influenced by the philosophical school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, attempting to explain the Mesmeric phenomena on the basis of well-established laws of psychology and physiology. Hence, Braid is regarded by many as the first true [...] "hypnotist" [...] as opposed to the Mesmerists and other magnetists who preceded him.|$|E

40|$|The notions "expressive power" or "expressiveness" of {{knowledge}} representation languages (KR-languages) {{can be found}} in most papers on knowledge representation; but these terms are usually just used in an intuitive sense. The papers contain only informal descriptions of what is meant by expressiveness. There are several reasons which speak in favour of a formal definition of expressiveness: For example, if we want to show that certain expressions in one language cannot be expressed in another language, we need a strict formalism which can be used in mathematical proofs. Though we shall only consider KL-ONE-based KR-language in our motivation and in the examples, the definition of expressive power which will be given in this paper can be used for all KR-languages with model-theoretic semantics. This definition will shed a new light on the tradeoff between expressiveness of a representation language and its computational tractability. There are KR-languages with identical expressive power, but different complexity results for reasoning. Sometimes, the tradeoff lies between convenience and computational tractability. The paper contains several examples which demonstrate how the definition of expressive power can be used in positive proofs [...] that is, proofs where it is shown that one language can be expressed by another language [...] as well as for <b>negative</b> <b>proofs</b> [...] which show that a given language cannot be expressed by the other language...|$|R

It was this ‘most ungentlemanly’ act of M‘Neile towards Braid, that forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842; a pamphlet which, in Crabtree's opinion is “a work of the greatest significance in the history of hypnotism, and of utmost rarity” (1988, p. 121).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{ascertain}} the determinants involved in {{the introduction of the}} 'voluntary system' for the protection of habitats in the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 in order to explain its existence and form and also its effectiveness. The identification of the determinants involves consideration of a number of hypotheses. A positive proof shows why the voluntary approach was chosen. A <b>negative</b> <b>proof</b> shows why the alternatives of using criminal sanctions or planning control were not chosen. Hypothesis 1 is that the system adopted for species protection had proved inefficacious and thus criminal sanctions were regarded as inappropriate for protecting habitats. This hypothesis is disproved. Hypothesis 2 is {{that the purpose of the}} legislation was a determinant. The thesis will show that there is no positive proof of this hypothesis although there is the possibility of a <b>negative</b> <b>proof.</b> Hypothesis 3 is that pressure group activity in the pre-parliamentary stages of its enactment was a determinant.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 260 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for bronchiectasis between January 2000 and December 2010. The factors related with the outcome were analyzed and the candidate factors were screened by χ 2 test and t test. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was used for multiple factor analysis to obtain the independent factors that affected the surgical outcome. Results: Complications occurred in 30 (11. 5 %) patients during perioperative period. The univariate analysis showed that significant differences {{can be observed in}} age (P =  0. 000), sputum volume (P =  0. 000), smoking history (P =  0. 033), pulmonary function (P =  0. 003), Gram-negative bacillus infection (P =  0. 000), bronchial stump coverage (P =  0. 016) using intercostals muscles or pedicle pleura embedding and surgical approach (P =  0. 003) between the patients with excellent and poor outcome. The multivariable analyses showed that sputum volume (P =  0. 000), Gram-negative bacillus infection (P =  0. 000) and bronchial stump coverage (P =  0. 000) were the three independent factors related with surgical outcome.

A series of measurements were carried out with a smartphone device using the camera to act as a colorimeter and converting the CIE L xy vector length into a yellowing parameter Y. A number of preliminary attempts were made to recreate conditions that corresponded to the measurements of Y using a conventional spectrophotometer, this was by standardising distance from object and through a number of lighting conditions. It was found that the most consistently comparable results (with an offset) could be obtained using an iPhone 6 S with the light source from an additional iPhone with sample to aperture distance of 4  cm. Both studies showed that the large increase in Y occurred in journals printed around 1912 with a plateau of elevated Y value detected in journals until the 1950 s after which the Y parameter decreased until 2004. This indicates the frequency access hypothesis to be false and this <b>negative</b> <b>proof</b> was able to be evidenced by the data collected by the iPhone. It would be suggested that great care needs to be taken if such an approach of stand-alone measurement were to be taken into citizen science; training and testing would need to be undertaken, because of the challenge of reproducibility and the risk of sampling irreplaceable objects.|$|E

Ktihne assumed that this property was due to the presence in the juice of an unorganized ferment or enzyme which he called trypsin. Subsequent work by Fisher and Abderhalden, Cohnheim, Bayliss, Vernon, Schaffer and Terroine, Abderhalden, Willst~ttter, and Waldschmidt-Leitz and their collaborators has added greatly to our knowledge of the enzymatic properties of pancreatic juice (1). The kinetics of these reactions have also been partially worked out. According to Waldschmidt-Leitz the activated pancreatic juice contains at least five proteolytic enzymes [...] trypsinogen, trypsin-kinase, carboxy-peptidase and amino-pepfidase, which hydrolyze polypeptides, and erepsin. There is no positive evidence t as yet that any of these enzymes has ever been obtained in pure form or separated completely from each other and it is probable that the separation can be carried still further, as already indicated by Abderhalden (3). The enzyme described in this paper differs essentially from any previously described. In the meantime the existence of these separate enzymes has been assumed purely from the behavior of certain solutions, as Linderstr 6 m-Lang has pointed out (4). In contrast to the marked advances in knowledge of the properties i In one sense this will always be the case since {{it is not possible to}} furnish positive proof of the purity of a substance but only <b>negative</b> <b>proof</b> consisting of the fact that no evidence of mixtures can be found under conditions which would be expected to show such evidence. For a discussion of the difficulty of proving the existence of, or defining a "pure substance " see Lunn and Senior (2) ...|$|E
40|$|We study well-posedness for the Cauchy Problem {{associated}} to the coupled Schrödinger equations with quadratic nonlinearities, which appears modeling problems in nonlinear optics. We obtain local well-posedness for data in Sobolev spaces with low regularity. To develop the local theory, we prove news bilinear {{estimates for the}} coupling terms of the system in the continuous case. Concerning global results, in the continuous case, we establish global well-posed in H^s(R) × H^s(R), for some <b>negatives</b> s. The <b>proof</b> of our global result uses the I-method introduced by Colliander, Keel, Staffilani, Takaoka and Tao. Comment: 34 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{rigorous}} system of archiving {{put in place}} by the British administration in the mid-50s, which was maintained by the archive's librarian, Martha Mosinga, after independence, the contents of the CPPA-B are in relatively good shape. However, under the present climatic conditions the holdings are jeopardised by high humidity and temperatures. The Archives contain approximately 120,000 <b>negatives,</b> 14,000 <b>proof</b> sheets (templates on which up to 16 contact prints were mounted for the purpose of reference) and 12 register books. Generally, approximately 500 negatives that are packed in paper envelopes are stored in small wooden boxes. Some of the negatives in the CPPA-B present visual evidence of events such as, among many others, the Governor General’s tour of the Southern Cameroons in December 1957, the Premier’s arrival from the UNO Conference in New York City on 16 March 1959, United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld’s arrival at Tiko airport from Yaoundé, views of Victoria’s Barclays Bank building, and the Commonwealth Youth Sunday Celebrations in Buea and Victoria.|$|R
25|$|The Cameroon Press Photo Archive (CPPA-B) is a {{photographic}} archive located in Buea, the regional {{capital of the}} South West Region of Cameroon. It holds around 120,000 <b>negatives</b> and 14,000 <b>proof</b> sheets (templates on which up to 16 contact prints were mounted {{for the purpose of}} reference) in total, granting a unique view of Anglophone Cameroon’s history for the time period 1955 to 2000. Between 2013 and 2015, African Photography Initiatives digitized 25,000 negatives and all 14,000 proof sheets. A copy of the digitized material is in the possession of the Ministry of Communication, the authority in charge of the photo archive. The CPPA-B is considered an endangered archive.|$|R
