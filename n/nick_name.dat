25|$|As Etheredge-Ouzts {{and music}} {{supervisor}} John Norris began planning {{the music for}} the film, Etheredge-Ouzts read {{an article about the}} queercore (gay punk music) scene in Los Angeles. The article mentioned queercore band <b>Nick</b> <b>Name</b> and the Normals, and Etheredge-Ouzts contacted Name to see if he would be interested in writing music for the film. Working with Name helped Etheredge-Ouzts to further define the motion picture's aesthetics, characters, and themes. At some point, Name, who had been an Abercrombie & Fitch model, was asked to play the serial killer in the film, and he agreed. Through Name, Etheredge-Ouzts came to know Texas Terri, whom he cast as the tattoo artist. Only later did Etheredge-Ouzts discover that Texas Terri was a punk rock musician and singer, after which he asked her to contribute to the soundtrack as well.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Searching for {{information}} about people in the web {{is one of the}} most common activities of many internet users. Around 30 % of search engine queries include person names. Retrieving information about people from web search engines can become difficult when a person has <b>nick</b> <b>names</b> or name aliases. We will not be able to retrieve all the information about a cricket player, if we only use his real name. For example we can’t retrieve all the information regarding the cricketer sachin tendulkar by using his real name only. So we need his <b>nick</b> <b>names</b> too. Identification of entities on the web is difficult mainly for two fundamental reasons: The first one is that different entities can share the same name (i. e., lexical ambiguity) and the second one is that a single entity can be designated by multiple names (i. e., referential ambiguity). In this paper, we propose a lexical pattern-based approach to extract aliases of a given name using snippets returned by a web search engine. The lexical patterns are generated automatically using a set of real world <b>nick</b> <b>names</b> or name alias data. The proposed work does not assume any language specific preprocessing such as part of speech tagging or dependency parsing, etc., which can be both inaccurate and computationally costly in web scale data processing...|$|R

60|$|This odd-looking figure {{reported}} {{himself to be}} a native of the county of Cornwall, in the island of Great Britain. His boyhood had passed in the neighborhood of the tin mines, and his youth as the cabin-boy of a smuggler, between Falmouth and Guernsey. From this trade he had been impressed into the service of his king, and, for the want of a better, had been taken into the cabin, first as a servant, and finally as steward to the captain. Here he acquired the art of making chowder, lobster, and one or two other sea-dishes, and, as he was fond of saying, had an opportunity of seeing the world. With the exception of one or two outports in France, and an occasional visit to Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Deal, he had in reality seen no more of mankind, however, than if he had been riding a donkey in one of his native mines. But, being discharged from the navy at the peace of ‘83, he declared that, as he had seen all the civilized parts of the earth, he was inclined to make a trip to the wilds of America We will not trace him in his brief wanderings, under the influence of that spirit of emigration that some times induces a dapper Cockney to quit his home, and lands him, before the sound of Bow-bells is out of his ears, within the roar of the cataract of Niagara; but shall only add that at a very early day, even before Elizabeth had been sent to school, he had found his way into the family of Marmaduke Temple, where, owing to a combination of qualities that will be developed {{in the course of the}} tale, he held, under Mr. Jones, the office of major- domo. The name of this worthy was Benjamin Penguillan, according to his own pronunciation; but, owing to a marvellous tale that he was in the habit of relating, concerning the length of time he had to labor to keep his ship from sinking after Rodney’s victory, he had universally acquired the <b>nick</b> <b>name</b> of Ben Pump.|$|E
