40|$|Dual {{threshold}} voltage and forward body bias techniques are {{effective ways to}} optimally balance the standby leakage power and performance. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained forward body biasing scheme for monotonic static logic circuits. In the proposed scheme, the forward body bias is applied to high {{threshold voltage}} of either the pull-up or the pull-down network based on the evaluation transition {{and the state of}} operation. This technique improves the low skew NAND and <b>NOR</b> <b>circuit</b> performance by 7 % and 11 %, high skew NAND and NOR by 8 % and 13 % respectively. It reduces both active and standby leakage power as compared to monotonic static CMOS with dual- V T technique.

Characteristics of the CMOS <b>NOR</b> logic <b>circuit</b> following gate oxide degradation are analyzed in both the DC and V-t domains. The NOR gate rise time increases by approximately 30 %, which may lead to timing or logic errors in high frequency digital circuits. Additionally, the voltage switching point of the <b>NOR</b> logic <b>circuit</b> shifts by 9 % which could affect operation of analog or mixed signal designs. This shift in <b>NOR</b> logic <b>circuit</b> performance is correlated to an increased channel resistance of the stressed pMOSFET...|$|R

40|$|As {{the rate}} of energy release in a double layer with voltage delta V is P approx I delta V, a double layer must {{be treated as a}} part of a circuit which {{delivers}} the current I. As neither double layer <b>nor</b> <b>circuit</b> can be derived from magnetofluid models of a plasma, such models are useless for treating energy transfer by means of double layers. They must be replaced by particle models and circuit theory. A simple circuit is suggested which is applied to the energizing of auroral particles, to solar flares, and to intergalactic double radio sources. Application to the heliospheric current systems leads to the prediction of two double layers on the Sun's axis which may give radiations detectable from Earth. Double layers in space should be classified as a new type of celestial object (one example is the double radio sources). It is tentatively suggested in X-ray and Gamma-ray bursts may be due to exploding double layers (although annihilation is an alternative energy source). A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts like double layers, critical velocity, pinch effects and circuits is made...|$|E
40|$|A high gamma {{radiation}} hardness of 4 H-SiC circuits is performed. The OR <b>NOR</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are based on}} emitter coupled logic (ECL), using integrated bipolar NPN transistors. Gain degradation in individual bipolar junction transistors (BJT) is minimal up to a dose of 38 Mrad (SiO 2), but for the dose of 332 Mrad (SiO 2) a degradation of 52 % is observed. The SiC BJTs show higher radiation hardness than existing Si-technology and high stability under temperature stress. It is proposed that the oxide charge-dominated recombination is the key base current recombination mechanism contributing to gain degradation. An improvement in the gain is seen after annealing at 400 °C for 1800 s due to the possible annealing {{of some of the}} oxide defects contributing to the oxide charge. Qc 20170118 </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} wavy channel (WC) {{architecture}} thin-film transistor-based digital circuitry using ZnO as a channel material. The novel architecture allows for extending device width by integrating vertical finlike substrate corrugations {{giving rise to}} 50 % larger device width, without occupying extra chip area. The enhancement in the output drive current is 100 %, when compared with conventional planar architecture for devices occupying the same chip area. The current increase is attributed to both the extra device width and 50 % enhancement in field-effect mobility due to electrostatic gating effects. Fabricated inverters show that WC inverters can achieve two times the peak-to-peak output voltage for the same input when compared with planar devices. In addition, WC inverters show 30 % faster rise and fall times, and can operate up to around two times frequency of the planar inverters for the same peak-to-peak output voltage. WC <b>NOR</b> <b>circuits</b> have shown 70 % higher peak-to-peak output voltage, over their planar counterparts, and WC pass transistor logic multiplexer circuit has shown {{more than five times}} faster high-to-low propagation delay compared with its planar counterpart at a similar peak-to-peak output voltage...|$|R

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} (BG) are {{a group of}} highly {{interconnected}} nuclei buried deep in the brain. They are involved in an important range of brain functions, including both lower-level movement control and higher-level cognitive decision making. Dysfunction of the BG {{has been linked to}} human neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. This thesis proposes a unified functional model of the BG, called multi-input multi-output adaptive switching (MIMOAS) model that attempts to account for the role of the BG in both higher-level rote behavior and lower-level motor control. In the model, BG circuitry effectively implements a large set of parallel noncompetitive logical OR and <b>NOR</b> <b>circuits</b> that can be driven by specific patterns of cortical activity. These afford selective gating of target thalamocortical neurons. This process {{can be viewed as a}} general mapping between binary context and response vectors. The mapping is proved to be learnable via a reinforcement mechanism that is consistent with actions commonly proposed for nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathways in the striatum and homeostasis in synaptic physiology. It appears that the cortico-striatal connections provide a biologically plausible realization of winner-take-all dynamics that is different from many engineering alternatives implementing the same function. With the winner-take-all units as functioning as a hidden layer, using corticostriatal weights as the only tunable parameters, the adaptive BG network can develop the capacity to perform universal binary mappings. In this way, the model can simulate important features of procedural learning in human experiments. At the same time, it can be shown that derangement of the winner-take-all dynamics could underlie the tremor and rigidity seen in Parkinson's disease. by Zhi-Hong Mao. Thesis (Ph. D.)
