40|$|Effective {{discharge}} planning {{is important to}} ensuring a high quality of patient care and operational efficiency. The general internal medicine (GIM) environment is very complex and fluid, with multiple health professions providing care for patients. This makes coordination of discharges difficult, even with structured daily interprofessional rounds. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> that predicts next-day discharges. The main measures of the study, {{which took place in}} GIM wards at two academic teaching hospitals, were the completion and accuracy of the discharge forms, length of stay, discharge times, post-discharge admissions, and emergency department visits. Seventy-six of 200 patients studied had information completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The overall effect appeared to move discharges earlier in the day, while having no effect on length of stay. Patients whose information was completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> were less likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days post-discharge. The use of a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> appears to move discharges earlier in the day, without increasing length of stay. Further refinement and evaluation is necessary to increase usage and assess the impact on outcomes of care...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{patterns}} and legal requirements of methylphenidate consumption. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional {{study of the}} data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> and balance lists of drugs sales – psychoactive and others – subject to special control in the fifth largest city of Brazil, in 2006. We determined the defined and prescribed daily doses, the average prescription and dispensation periods, and the regional sales distribution in the municipality. In addition, we estimated the costs of drug acquisition and analyzed the individual drug consumption profile using the Lorenz curve. RESULTS The balance lists data covered all notified sales of the drug while data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> covered 50. 6 % of the pharmacies that sold it, including those with the highest sales volumes. Total methylphenidate consumption was 0. 37 DDD/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day. Sales were concentrated in more developed areas, and regular-release tablets were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical formulation. In some regions of the city, approximately 20. 0 % of the prescriptions and dispensation exceeded 30 mg/day and 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Methylphenidate was widely consumed in the municipality and mainly in the most developed areas. Of note, the consumption of formulations with the higher abuse risk was the most predominant. Both its prescription and dispensation contrasted with current pharmacotherapeutic recommendations and legal requirements. Therefore, the commercialization of methylphenidate should be monitored more closely, and its use {{in the treatment of}} behavioral changes of psychological disorders needs to be discussed in detail, in line with the concepts of the quality use of medicines...|$|E

40|$|How has {{the number}} of abortions in {{metropolitan}} France varied since 1975 ? The sources of abortion data (<b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> established in 1975 and hospital statistics since the mid- 1990 s) do not agree. Given the incomplete nature of the notification form data, INED previously produced estimates of the total number: 250, 000 abortions in 1976, 262, 000 in 1980, 230, 000 in 1987 and 225, 000 in 1993. According to the hospital statistics, elective abortions totalled 180, 500 in 1994 and 206, 500 in 2003. We show that the trend-line indicated by the INED estimates (fall in the 1980 s and stability in the early 1990 s) appears to be correct. We also show that the rise in {{the number of}} abortions recorded in hospital statistics in the late 1990 s appears to be a statistical artefact caused by improved data collection...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMeningococcal {{meningitis}} {{remains a}} periodical {{threat in the}} African meningitis belt. The countries concerned, such as Burkina Faso, provided guidelines for its surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention during outbreaks. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the quality of the surveillance system and case management during an outbreak in Fada N'Gourma district. A retrospective study of the meningitis outbreak in 2007 was conducted by literature review and interviews of health caretakers across 27 health centers (CSPS) and three units in the regional hospital in the district. We reported all data available about surveillance and case management, and then we compared it with the guidelines of the Ministry of Health. The case definition and <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were available in all centers and units. During the outbreak, 861 cases were recorded, but only 89 % was notified at the upper level and 87 % of <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were available. The age is marked on all the forms, while the interval between the onset of symptoms and consultation is noted only in 90. 7 %. The forms were distributed weekly at the district level. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram coloration was performed for a limited number of cases (150 / 349 samples, 42. 9 %); it showed Gram-negative diplococcus in 86 %. Culture was performed for a limited number of patients (7 cases). According to the results of a central level laboratory study, the outbreak was due to Group A Neisseria meningitidis. The case management guidelines were available in all the centers and units which were supervised during the outbreak. Anti-biotherapy was appropriate in 93. 6 % of the cases. A shortage of antibiotics (free prepositioning) was observed in 7 centers (23. 3 %). The mortality rate was 3. 5 %. This assessment shows an under-notification of cases, despite the existence of a surveillance system and supervision, a weak laboratory contribution in germ identification, appropriate case management, and shortage of antibiotics during the outbreak. Management of a meningitis outbreak may become more efficient by improving the notification, the laboratory's capabilities, and the availability of drugs...|$|E

40|$|With {{the decline}} in {{mortality}} from other causes, congenital malformations represent an increasingly important cause of stillbirth and infant death. Malformations are also an important cause of spontaneous abortion and this paper examines the high fetal and infant loss associated with these conditions, using data collected on all births in 1964 - 66 to women resident in South Wales.
