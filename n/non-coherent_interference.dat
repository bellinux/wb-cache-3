40|$|Linear {{precoding}} {{has been}} widely studied {{in the context of}} Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) together with two common power normalization techniques, namely, matrix normalization (MN) and vector normalization (VN). Despite this, their effect on the performance of Massive MIMO systems has not been thoroughly studied yet. The aim {{of this paper is to}} fulfill this gap by using large system analysis. Considering a system model that accounts for channel estimation, pilot contamination, arbitrary pathloss, and per-user channel correlation, we compute tight approximations for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the rate of each user equipment in the system while employing maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero forcing (ZF), and regularized ZF precoding under both MN and VN techniques. Such approximations are used to analytically reveal how the choice of power normalization affects the performance of MRT and ZF under uncorrelated fading channels. It turns out that ZF with VN resembles a sum rate maximizer while it provides a notion of fairness under MN. Numerical results are used to validate the accuracy of the asymptotic analysis and to show that in Massive MIMO, <b>non-coherent</b> <b>interference</b> and noise, rather than pilot contamination, are often the major limiting factors of the considered precoding schemes.

40|$|Next {{generation}} wireless networks aim at providing substantial {{improvements in}} spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Massive MIMO {{has been proved}} to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially multiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential limitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which arises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by reusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot contamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot sequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative method, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data symbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot contamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using maximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE. To this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a practical random BS deployment. We prove that the reduction of pilot contamination with SP is outweighed by the additional coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> <b>interference.</b> Numerical results show that when both methods are optimized, RP achieves comparable SE and EE to SP in practical scenarios.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a tractable model for analyzing non-coherent joint transmission base station (BS) cooperation, {{taking into account}} the irregular BS deployment typically en-countered in practice. Besides cellular-network specific aspects such as BS density, channel fading, average path loss and inter-ference, the model also captures relevant cooperation mechanisms including user-centric BS clustering and channel-dependent co-operation activation. The locations of all BSs are modeled by a Poisson point process. Using tools from stochastic geometry, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution with cooperation is precisely characterized in a generality-preserving form. The result is then applied to practical design problems of recent interest. We find that increasing the network-wide BS density improves the SINR, while the gains increase with the path loss exponent. For pilot-based channel estimation, the average spectral efficiency saturates at cluster sizes of around 7 BSs for typical values, irrespective of backhaul quality. Finally, it is shown that intra-cluster frequency reuse is favorable in moderately loaded cells with generous cooperation activation, while intra-cluster coordinated scheduling may be better in lightly loaded cells with conservative cooperation activation.
