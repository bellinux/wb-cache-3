5|$|Soon {{thereafter}} came {{new evidence}} on dinosaur social behavior, with nests of Maiasaura suggesting parental care. These findings were {{reflected in the}} work of a <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> paleoartists. One milestone was Sarah Landry's feathered dinosaur in Bakker's 1975 Scientific American article, Dinosaur Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The reevaluation {{of dinosaurs}} spurred public interest, with the <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> paleoartists quick to respond.

5|$|Against this {{economic}} backdrop a <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> venture capitalist owners had emerged.

5|$|For the <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> students, {{producers}} auditioned {{over six}} hundred school-aged children {{in an attempt}} to provide characters to which the teenaged target-audience could relate. The decision to cast age-similar actors was purposeful to contrast the series from other shows of the same period such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek, which had cast actors in their twenties as teenagers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand a guitar revival took place and raised a <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> {{alternative}} guitar bands often described as post-punk revival or garage rock revival.

They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions {{they would like to}} see on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E
5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region.

5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> more entertainment-oriented movies {{coming from}} the Somali film {{industry}} has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the Somali language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this quiet revolution. In 2010, the Somali director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E

In May 1942, Barbey {{was appointed to}} organize a new Amphibious Warfare Section within the Navy Department, which was charged with responsibility for the coordination of amphibious training and the development and production of the <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> landing craft. In January 1943 he assumed command of Amphibious Force, Southwest Pacific Force, which became the VII Amphibious Force. He planned and carried out 56 amphibious assaults in the Southwest Pacific Area between September 1943 and July 1945. After the war, he commanded the Seventh Fleet and Fourth Fleet.|$|E

Even though the members of Bonded by Blood were not born when their favorite 1980s thrash metal bands released their debut albums, the music and fashion of that era {{had a profound impact on}} them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of a <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch {{turned out to be}} expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E

Existing games also continue to thrive on new business models, such as the reliance on downloadable content to provide songs to players. The introduction of the <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> console hardware has also spurred return of Activision's Guitar Hero and Harmonix's Rock Band titles in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> combat {{aircraft}} that {{would be capable of}} supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
