5|$|In 1893–1894, Ottawa HC {{finished}} in a four-way tie for {{first in the}} AHAC standings. A playoff was arranged in Montreal for the championship between Ottawa, Montreal HC and Montreal Victorias (the other first place club, Quebec, having {{dropped out of the}} playoff). These games would be the first Stanley Cup playoff games ever played. As the 'away' team, Ottawa was given a bye to the final game. On March 23, 1894, at the Victoria Rink, Ottawa and Montreal HC played for the championship. Ottawa scored the first goal, but Montreal would score the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> win the game 3–1. Ottawa captain Weldy Young fainted from exhaustion {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide. Over the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and californium (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts {{of these elements}} were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann.|$|E

After the Senators won the first game in Pittsburgh, the Penguins took the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> take a commanding 3–1 lead in the series. The Senators won the fifth game in triple overtime to force a sixth game in Ottawa. In the sixth game, the Senators took a 3–0 lead before the Penguins rallied to win the deciding game 4–3 in overtime to end the Senators season.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Mathews {{left his}} job at Hot Press and moved into Linehan's London home. Over the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows {{while at the same}} time writing for sketch shows such as The All New Alexei Sayle Show and The Fast Show. One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called Irish Lives, with six episodes, each {{focusing}} on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in Maynooth College. Producer Geoffrey Perkins suggested that the episode's concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals optioned starter Joe Ross to Class-AAA Syracuse on May 1, {{following}} consecutive {{starts in}} which he failed to pitch five full innings, and called up pitcher A. J. Cole. Closer Shawn Kelley landed on the 10-day disabled list on May 5 with a lower back strain and reliever Matt Grace was recalled from Class-AAA Syracuse. With both Kelley and alternate closer Koda Glover on the shelf with injuries, reliever Matt Albers was called upon to close out a 4–2 game against the division rival Philadelphia Phillies on May 5. Albers hit the leadoff batter with a pitch but retired the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> finally earn his first career save. Albers finished the game having given up no runs, no walks, and only four hits in 11⅓ innings pitched in 2017.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} session of the final O'Sullivan won the first frame with a break of 86. The next two frames were shared, before O'Sullivan made a century, which he {{followed}} with a 72 in the frame after. The sixth frame had lasted 36 minutes, when O’Sullivan stroked in the pink to a distant balk pocket before clipping in a tricky black for 5–1 lead. McCulloch won the next to bring the score to 5–2 in O'Sullivan's favour {{at the end of}} {{the first session}}. In the second session O'Sullivan took the first two with breaks of 66 and 104. O'Sullivan won two of the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> bring the score to 8–4, before missing a relatively straightforward pot in the 13th, which allowed McCulloch to take the frame. A break of 71 in the next gave O'Sullivan the victory.|$|E

25|$|The colony cycle {{requires}} {{six months}} and begins with {{one or a few}} females founding the nest and beginning construction. These females build the colonies independently, without the initial aid of workers. This entails building individual cells and putting an egg in each cell; at this point, the growth rate of the colony is one cell (and egg) per day. This process continues until the first eggs begin to hatch, at which point growth of the colony stops. The first larvae born are all worker females who help {{in the formation of the}} nest once they have matured. Thus, once the larvae cocoon and pupate, the rate of growth increases. After the female workers mature, male and female non-workers are born and the nest continues to grow. During the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four months, more males and nonworkers are born in relation to the rest of the nest population. Next, the rate of growth decreases until the nest is no longer growing. At this point the phenomenon of abortion of larvae and pupae occurs, more cells are abandoned, and the adult population decreases. Finally, the nest is abandoned, signifying the end of the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Following {{injury to}} the central nervous system, NG2 expressing {{oligodendrocyte}} precursor cells are seen around the site of injury within 48 hours of the initial injury. The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase for the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five days {{and high levels of}} NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on neurite growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration. When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, neurite extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to neurite extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the fifth}} playoff series between these two teams. This was a rematch of the second-round series that took place the {{previous}} year, in which San Jose defeated Detroit in five games. After losing the first three games, Detroit won the <b>next</b> <b>three,</b> <b>to</b> force a seventh game. This was the eighth time this feat had been achieved in NHL history, {{the third time in}} the last two seasons, and the second time in the 2011 playoffs. Chicago had accomplished the same feat against Vancouver in the Quarterfinals, ultimately losing that series. Since the New York Islanders twice forced a game seven after being down 3–0 during the 1975 Stanley Cup playoffs, there had been 112 consecutive failed attempts to repeat that feat prior to the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, after which it has happened in three of the seven possible series. San Jose won the seventh game by a score of 3–2 to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead. It allowed them their second consecutive trip to the Conference Finals. Six of the games were decided by only one goal; the only exception was a 3–1 win by Detroit in game six, in which Darren Helm of Detroit scored an empty net goal.|$|E

500|$|The MCC {{team was}} captained by G. O. B. Allen who added Leyland {{to the team}} {{selection}} committee during the tour.

Leyland {{was one of the}} few batsmen excused: [...] "Leyland, though very restrained, was one of the mainstays of the batting". Before the series, England were expected to struggle severely against the bowling of O'Reilly. According to Cardus, Leyland told O'Reilly before the first Test: [...] "Ah can tell thi one thing now for certain... Ah's got thee where Ah wants thi, Bill—and Ah thinks tha knows it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat {{got off to}} a {{tentative}} 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached. Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below [...]300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in Game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> win its first ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as he walked to the locker room following the loss.|$|E

500|$|The females {{lay their}} eggs in November or December. The eggs are round, {{about the size of}} a mustard seed, and are a transparent, purply red. They are held {{together}} in a cream-coloured, round, ball shaped egg sac which is about [...] in diameter. The female constructs five or six egg sacs over the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four weeks. Each egg sac contains about 70 to 90 fertilised eggs. The egg sacs are hung in the centre of the spiders web and the female spins more silk over them. Over time the exterior of the egg sac may become covered with sand. After six weeks of incubation, during January and February, the spiderlings hatch. The young spiders then disperse from the web. At present, little is known about the dispersal mechanism that the spiderlings use to move away from the nest. In one study, observing spiders over 24 hours, 28% used a ballooning method, which is where the young spiders use heat currents to carry themselves away from the nest suspended by a single web strand. While the majority, 61%, used a bridging method where the spiderling uses its silk to move to nearby plants, and 11% still remained in the nest. The young spiderlings reach full maturity the following spring.|$|E
