40|$|Background context <b>Neuropathic</b> (Charcot) spinal <b>arthropathy</b> (CSA) {{is a rare}} but {{progressive}} and severe degenerative disease that develops {{in the absence of}} deep sensation, for example, after spinal cord injury. The diagnosis of CSA is often delayed {{as a result of the}} late onset or slow progression of the disease and the nonspecific nature of the reported clinical signs. Considering risk factors of CSA in combination with the common clinical signs may facilitate timely diagnosis and prevent severe presentation of the disease. However, there is a lack of data concerning the early signs and risk factors of CSA. Furthermore, the complications and outcomes after surgical treatment are documented insufficiently. Purpose To investigate the early signs and risk factors of CSA after spinal cord injury, as well as the complications and outcome after surgical treatment. Study design Retrospective case series from a single center. Patient sample Twenty-eight patients with 39 Charcot joints of the spine. Outcome measures Clinical signs, radiological signs, risk factors, and complications. Methods The case histories and radiological images of patients suffering from CSA were investigated. Results The first clinical symptoms included spinal deformity, sitting imbalance, and localized back pain. Long-segment stabilization, laminectomy, scoliosis, and excessive loading of the spine were identified as risk factors for the development of the disease. Postoperative complications included implant loosening, wound healing disturbance, and development of additional Charcot joints. All patients were able to return to their previous levels of activities. Conclusions Radiological follow-up of the entire thoracic and lumbar spine should be performed in paraplegic patients. Risk factors in combination with typical symptoms should be considered to facilitate early detection. Functional restoration can be achieved with appropriate surgical techniques.

50|$|Walking braces {{controlled}} by pneumatics are also used. Surgical correction {{of a joint}} is rarely successful in the long-term in these patients. However, off-loading alone does not translate to optimal outcomes without appropriate management of vascular disease and/or infection. Duration and aggressiveness of offloading (non-weight-bearing vs. weight-bearing, non-removable vs. removable device) should be guided by clinical assessment of healing of <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> based on edema, erythema, and skin temperature changes. It can take 6-9 months for the edema and erythema of the affected joint to recede.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{scenarios}} {{in which}} the use of TCC is appropriate for managing <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> (Charcot foot), according to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society. First, during the initial treatment, when the breakdown is occurring, and the foot is exhibiting edema and erythema; the patient should not bear weight on the foot, and TCC {{can be used to}} control and support the foot. Second, when the foot has become deformed and ulceration has occurred; TCC can be used to stabilize and support the foot, and to help move the wound toward healing.|$|E
50|$|Syringomyelia {{causes a}} wide variety of neuropathic {{symptoms}} due to damage of the spinal cord and the nerves inside. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, abnormal sensations and loss of sensation particularly in the hands. Some patients experience paralysis or paresis temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem as in syringobulbia, vocal cord paralysis, ipsilateral tongue wasting, trigeminal nerve sensory loss, and other signs may occur. Rarely, bladder stones can occur in the onset of weakness in the lower extremities.Classically, syringomyelia spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord, leaving pressure, vibration, touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities. <b>Neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy,</b> also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia. The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to damage of the joint over time.|$|E

30|$|Although {{this case}} cannot be {{regarded}} as a typical case of <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> since a fracture occurred complicating the course of the disease, considering the poor outcome, caution is recommended in indicating knee osteotomy for patients affected by neurosyphilis-related <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy.</b>|$|E

The authors present two cases of <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> of the elbow. One of them was diagnosed as Septic <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy.</b> Material and Method: Two patients with <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> of the elbow (an infected and a non-infected case) were treated at our department. Both patients were over 60 years old. The underlying condi-tions associated with the arthropathy included combined median and ulnar neuropathy in the infected case and idiopathic in the non-infected case. Both of the patients had a history of specific trauma at the affected elbows. The radiographs of the elbows revealed dislocation, fracture fragmentation and some bony sclerosis. The management in the non-infected case aimed to maintain the function of the elbow with a short period of immobilization and physical therapy. For the infected case, the patient was treated successfully with systemic antibiotic, surgical debridement and a period of immobilization with an external fixator.

40|$|Abstract Background Syphilis is {{a chronic}} {{infection}} that is classified into three stages. In its tertiary stage, syphilis spreads to the brain, heart and other organs; the lesions may involve the skin, mucous membranes and bones. <b>Neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> associated with tertiary syphilis {{has rarely been}} described in Europe and its association with HIV-HCV co-infection has not been reported so far. This article reports {{the case of a}} man with tertiary syphilis presenting with rapidly evolving <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> of the hip and extensive bone destruction. Case presentation On initial presentation, the patient complained of progressively worsening left-sided coxalgia without localized or generalized inflammation. The patient reported to have no history of previous infections, trauma or cancer. Plain x-ray films of the left coxofemoral joint showed marked degeneration with necrosis of the proximal epiphysis of femur and morphological alterations of the acetabulum without protrusion. Primary coxarthrosis was diagnosed and hip arthroplasty was offered, but the patient declined treatment. Three months later, the patient presented a marked deterioration of his general condition. He disclosed that he was seropositive for HCV and HIV, as confirmed by serology. Syphilis serology testing was also positive. A Girdlestone's procedure was performed and samples were collected for routine cultures for bacteria and acid fast bacilli, all resulting negative. Although histological findings were inconclusive, confirmed positive serology for syphilis associated with progressive arthropathy was strongly suggestive of tertiary syphilis, probably exacerbated by HIV-HCV co-infection. The patient partially recovered the ability to walk. Conclusions Due to the resurgence of syphilis, this disease should be considered as a possible cause of <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> when other infectious causes have been ruled out, particularly in patients with HIV and/or HCV co-infection. </p...|$|E
30|$|<b>Neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> (Charcot’s joint) is a {{degenerative}} {{process that}} affects peripheral or vertebral joints {{as a consequence}} of a disturbance in proprioception and pain perception. The knee {{is one of the most}} frequently affected joints, but even when the diagnosis is made at an early stage there is no consensus on the best treatment options. An early diagnosis of neurosyphilis was made in a 55 -year-old woman presenting a delayed union of an asymptomatic Schatzker type IV fracture of the proximal tibia. A medial opening wedge tibial osteotomy was performed to achieve fracture healing, to correct the medial depression of the articular surface, and possibly to avoid an early arthritis typical of the disease. To our knowledge, a knee osteotomy has never been reported at an early stage of <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy.</b> Even though the clinical and radiographic evaluation performed at 4  months follow-up showed a good stage of healing of the osteotomy and no typical features of neuropathic joint degeneration, at 8  months follow-up the knee was markedly deranged.|$|E

40|$|Charcot arthropathy is {{a pattern}} of {{destructive}} changes that can impair joint function and stability. Since its original description by French physician Jean Marie Charcot, neuro-pathic arthropathy {{has been reported to}} affect nearly every joint in the body. The most accepted theory explaining the changes that occur in Charcot arthropathy centers around the cumulative effects of relatively minor traumatic events in an insensate joint. 1 – 3 As the sum of these events accumulate, the joint surfaces are rapidly destroyed. Due to their role inweight-bearing activities, the joints of the lower extremity aremost commonly involved in thispathology. When <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> of the upper extremity is observed, the shoulder is most frequently affected. Modern literature detailing cases of wrist involvement is limited to case reports from a myriad of different etiologies.

40|$|Background: <b>Neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> of {{the elbow}} is rare and {{characterized}} by a painless but unstable articula-tion. The functional capacity of patients with this condition has not been reviewed in detail. Methods: Five male patients, {{with an average age}} of fifty-one years, were treated for <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> of the elbow. The underlying conditions associated with the arthropathy included syringomyelia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal failure, and two cases of polyneuropathy of unknown cause. Four patients sought medical attention after a specific traumatic event. Peripheral sensory and motor dysfunction was present in each patient. Radiographs of the elbow revealed dislocation, fracture fragmentation, and heterotopic ossification. Our management of the neuropathic elbows centered on maintenance of a functional arc of mo-tion through physical therapy aimed at regaining muscle strength and the use of orthoses for support. Opera-tive treatment was performed for an associated ulnar or radial nerve compression syndrome in three patients, and an open reduction and internal fixation of an unstable proximal ulnar nonunion associated with loose im-plants was performed in one. Results: The patients were followed for an average of nineteen months, with a range of twelve to thirty-six months. All patients had a pain-free elbow with a functional range of motion at the most recent follow-up examination, and none wished to have further treatment.

30|$|Differential {{diagnosis}} includes septic arthritis, <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> and avascular necrosis with joint collapse. Absence of fever {{with normal}} blood cell count and inflammatory markers {{will help to}} exclude septic arthritis, but a Gram stain and culture of joint fluid should be undertaken since crystal synovitis can coexist with sepsis [18]. On imaging, lack of osteopenia and of focal erosion are usually found. A neuropathic joint usually occurs in a patient with known underlying neurologic disorder. These two entities must be excluded since they represent contraindication to perform joint replacement, which is the treatment of choice for rapidly degenerative osteoarthritis.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Charcot arthropathy {{was first}} {{described}} in 1868 by Jean Martin Charcot as a progressive and destructive joint disease. Diabetes, polyneuropathy, syphilis, syrengomyelia and chronic alcoholism {{are the main}} causes of the disease. In this study we present a Charcot arthropathy of the knee seen after unsuccessful spinal stenosis surgery. Presentation of case: We report here a case of 62 years old patient with Charcot arthropathy at her left knee developed one year after spinal stenosis surgery. The patient’s knee joint was already beyond the fragmentation and coalescence stages {{at the moment of}} physical examination. Patient had already been treated for Charcot foot four years before spinal surgery. Because of an unsuccessful spinal surgery, proximal migration of the level of the sensorineural loss negatively affected the polyneuropathy and eventually resulted in Charcot knee joint {{in a short period of}} time. Discussion: However, the etiology of the <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> hasn’t been well described yet, it is usually seen at patients with diabetes mellitus as a long-term complication with or without polyneuropathy. In addition to the spinal canal pathologies, it is reported that Charcot arthropathy can be seen even after spinal anesthesia procedures. Conclusion: In conclusion, spinal procedures should be applied with extra caution on the patients with polyneuropathy or any <b>neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy.</b> It should be remembered that it is possible to encounter unexpected complications such as proximally migration of the level of sensorineural loss and progression of the actual disease after spinal procedures of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) is {{considered}} a major complication in diabetes mellitus (DM), and {{it is estimated that}} 1 % of diabetic patients may develop this complication.

Some cases with a Charcot-modified clinical presentation during the postoperative convalescence period after SKPT have been described. The clinical presentation may condition severe destructive lesions, and good practices include systematic follow-up.

40|$|<b>Neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> (NA) {{is one of}} {{the less}} {{understood}} and challenging condition to treat in clinical practice. Jean Martin Charcot described neuropathic joint in 1868. He has shown occurrence of NA in cases of syringomyelia and tabes dorsalis. Since then NA has been described in various other conditions. Knee and ankle joints are most commonly affected. Occurrence of neuropathic joint in upper extremity is very rare. Elbow is less commonly affected joint. We describe two cases of NA of elbow joint with unusual presentation. One patient presented with 3 month history of elbow injury with gross destruction of elbow joint.

We reviewed literature to discuss etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment available for NA of elbow joint...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neuropathic</b> <b>arthropathy</b> (NA) is a progressive, {{degenerative}} disorder {{associated with}} decreased sensory innervation of the involved joints. The shoulder joint is an uncommon presentation for NA, although syringomyelia {{is the most}} common cause for this joint. Two cases are presented of NA of the shoulder, with both patients having a history of syringomyelia and cocaine use. In both cases a work up for malignancy was negative, but imaging was consistent with NA. Although syringomyelia has been linked with this presentation in prior publications, the role of cocaine use may not be incidental, with complex biochemical interactions in bone metabolism. Cocaine has been shown to involve the Leptin, Neuromedin U (NmU), cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) pathways of bone remodeling. Treatment can be challenging, involving concurrent use of pharmacotherapy, surgical correction, and protective bracing...|$|E
