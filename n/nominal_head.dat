5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power and would be the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England {{disapproved of}} {{divorced}} people remarrying in church while a former spouse was still living. The monarch {{was required to}} be in communion with the Church of England, and was its <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> or Supreme Governor. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and {{his role as the}} Church's ex officio head.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{made several}} key trips to {{communist}} Cuba {{and to the}} United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the <b>nominal</b> <b>Head</b> of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.|$|E
40|$|Constructions {{in which}} PP {{arguments}} occur separate from their <b>nominal</b> <b>heads</b> have been argued to involve extraction from noun phrases. In this paper we provide evidence against {{the assumption that}} these PPs have been extracted. Instead, we argue that an analysis allowing argument raising of PP complements from <b>nominal</b> <b>heads</b> is more appropriate and that it makes additional correct predictions regarding possible word orders. Furthermore we show that restrictions on the construction can be explained {{on the basis of}} lexical semantic properties of the involved elements. Finally, an HPSG theory capturing the syntactic and lexical semantic properties on the basis of lexical principles is provided...|$|R
50|$|Syntactically, {{adjectival}} and <b>nominal</b> predicate <b>heads</b> {{appear with}} auxiliaries {{less often than}} verbs. Adjectives and nouns can appear together in nominal predicates expanded with adjectives. A <b>nominal</b> predicate <b>head</b> can be preceded by a modifying adjective or numeral.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet {{presidium}} {{chairman and}} <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of state Leonid Brezhnev began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues. While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested {{as he returned}} {{from a trip to}} Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the Committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot. Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.|$|E
5|$|Olds, whose B-17s were {{deployed}} to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg, {{was given the}} assignment of locating the Rex as far at sea as possible, and assigned Major Vincent J. Meloy, the commanding officer of the 20th Bomb Squadron, to act as <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of the Black Force. Olds selected three aircraft from the 49th Bomb Squadron for the mission. On the afternoon of 11 May 1937, Olds and his crews flew from Olmsted to the staging base at Mitchel Field on Long Island.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nominal</b> <b>heads</b> are {{normally}} followed by their modifiers, {{but there are}} occasional inversions. Word order is subject-object-verb (SOV), with indirect objects preceding direct objects, but it becomes more flexible in Achaemenid Elamite.

5|$|From 1603, {{when the}} Scottish monarch James VI {{inherited}} the English throne as James I, both the English and Scottish kingdoms were {{ruled by a}} single sovereign. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England, which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Act of Settlement 1701 excluded Roman Catholics, or those who married Catholics, from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The British monarch became <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of the vast British Empire, which covered {{a quarter of the}} world's surface at its greatest extent in 1921.|$|E
5|$|However, Rangnath Poudel, finding himself {{unsupported}} by the King, {{resigned from}} the mukhtiyari, which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah; but Puskhar Shah was only a <b>nominal</b> <b>head,</b> and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranjang Pande. Sensing that a catastrophe was going to befall the Thapas, Mathabar Singh fled to India while pretending {{to go on a}} hunting trip; Ranbir Singh gave up all his property and became a sanyasi, titling himself Abhayanand Puri; but Bhimsen Thapa preferred to remain in his old home in Gorkha. The Pandes were now in full possession of power; they had gained over the King to their side by flattery. The Senior Queen had been a firm supporter of their party; and they endeavored to secure popularity in the army by promises of war and plunder.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} was {{opposed by the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political and moral objections were raised. As British monarch, Edward was the <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of the Church of England, which did not then allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because of her two failed marriages. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her whether his governments approved or not.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reports on}} three sentence processing experiments involving structurally ambiguous Jabberwocky strings. The items are complex NPs, {{in which a}} relative clause can be attached to either of two <b>nominal</b> <b>heads</b> (NP 1 -preposition-NP 2 -RC). The phonological lengths of the heads, {{as well as that}} of the relative clause, are manipulated. The results show modest effects on relative clause attachment preferences of this manipulation, thus lending support to Fodor’s (1998, 2002) implicit-prosody hypothesis. ...|$|R
5|$|With these reforms, kings {{were reduced}} to being <b>nominal</b> <b>heads</b> of their fiefs, gaining a {{personal}} income from {{only a portion of}} the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.|$|R
5|$|George did {{not play}} a senior role in {{government}} until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and Lord High Admiral, the official but <b>nominal</b> <b>head</b> of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. Actual power at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose elder brother was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother Charles Churchill, {{had been one of}} his gentlemen of the bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. His secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne's close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the Honourable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the States General of the Netherlands to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the Maritime Powers that William had held.|$|E

25|$|Some parishes have {{a further}} {{territorial}} subdivision. Ordino, La Massana and Sant Julià de Lòria are subdivided into quarts (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 veïnats (neighborhoods).

25|$|Hoping {{to attract}} major press coverage, George Rappleyea {{went so far}} as to write to the British novelist H. G. Wells asking him to join the defense team. Wells replied that he had no legal {{training}} in Britain, let alone in America, and declined the offer. John R.

25|$|The Rebellions of 1837 {{brought about}} great {{changes to the}} role of the {{governor}} general, prompting, as they did, the British government to grant responsible government to the Canadian provinces. As a result, the viceroys became largely <b>nominal</b> <b>heads,</b> while the democratically elected legislatures and the premiers they supported exercised the authority belonging to the Crown; a concept first put to the test when, in 1849, Governor-General of the Province of Canada and Lieutenant-Governor of Canada East the Earl of Elgin granted Royal Assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, despite his personal misgivings towards the legislation.|$|R
50|$|In 1594, the Polish royal court {{tribunal}} attempted to restore Catholic services to St. Mary's, but the City Council rejected that approach. But as a compromise, since the Catholic kings of Poland {{had been the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>heads</b> of the City since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Council authorised building the baroque Catholic Royal Chapel. It was erected by Tylman van Gameren (Gamerski) and completed in 1681, near St. Mary's Church, for the king's Catholic service when he visited Danzig. With St. Mary's pastor Constantin Schütz (1646-1712) a moderate pietist theology replaced the previously dominant Lutheran orthodoxy.|$|R

25|$|Relative clauses {{are marked}} with final determiners. If the {{definite}} referent {{of the relative}} clause has already been accounted in the discourse or is otherwise obvious, the relative clause is marked with the definite /-sh/.

40|$|Persian {{argument}} clauses may {{be determined}} by the definite determiner in preceding the complementiser, and exactly like nominal objects, object sentences may be marked by the case marker rā occurring with specific direct objects. The Persian data strongly suggest that preverbal clauses are in fact DPs. We propose that the distribution of subordinate clauses is universally correlated with the ability to bear case.

40|$|Despite many {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the syntax of noun phrases, the position of determiners and the distributional restrictions they exhibit raise many unsolved problems. Abney's (1987) DP Hypothesis has led to new approaches to these problems, but it accounts mainly for articles in languages such as English, not giving a systematic account of other kinds of determiners. This paper centers on determiners in Hebrew, and tries to give a unified account which links the following properties of Hebrew: * Most determiners have two (synonymous) forms, the one derived from the other by the same morphology that derives <b>nominal</b> <b>heads</b> of construct-state <b>nominal...</b>|$|R

By manipulating static depth information while holding retinal-image motion constant during  simulated self-movement, the authors found that static depth information played a role in determining perceived heading. Some support was also found for the involvement of R. F. Wang and J. E. Cutting’s (1999) categories of object-image relative motion in determining perceived heading. However, results suggested an unexpected functional dominance of information about heading relative to apparently near objects. <br /...|$|R
