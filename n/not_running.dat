5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When <b>not</b> <b>running</b> around, {{they are}} usually asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

5|$|Warren is {{a leading}} figure in the Democratic Party and is popular among American progressives. Although she {{repeatedly}} stated that she was <b>not</b> <b>running</b> for the presidency, Warren was frequently mentioned by political pundits as a strong potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Warren remained neutral during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, endorsing presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton only after all fifty states had voted.|$|E

5|$|In February 2008, Barkley {{announced}} that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle, but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show. In 2010, he confirmed that he was <b>not</b> <b>running</b> in 2014. In 2016, Barkley once more turned Republican, when he endorsed John Kasich for the office of President in the 2016 election.|$|E

5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering <b>not</b> <b>running</b> for re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed {{that he would}} remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 2003 {{he signed}} a one-year, $1.73 million {{contract}} with the Indians {{in order for the}} Indians to avoid salary arbitration with him.

On April 3, 2004, he was traded to the Dodgers for Franklin Gutiérrez and a player to be named later (Andrew Brown); the Akron Beacon Journal later reported that manager Eric Wedge had insisted that Bradley be traded.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{initially}} {{struggled to}} recruit a candidate. Former Governor Douglas and Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott announced {{early on that}} they would not run and it was not until March 2014 that a candidate entered the race: marijuana legalization activist and former Independent gubernatorial candidate Emily Peyton. This spurred Republicans to recruit a serious candidate, but they struggled to do so. Former Wall Street banker Bruce Lisman announced in May 2014 that he was <b>not</b> <b>running,</b> and attention turned to former State Senator and 2012 nominee Randy Brock, State Representative Heidi Scheuermann and businessman Scott Milne.|$|E

5|$|The first (and only) {{production}} model (serial number S5, named Graywolf) was loaned to NCAR {{as a demonstration}} system in May 1993. NCAR's version was configured with 4 processors and a 128MWord (64-bit words, 1GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM proved to be problematic. It was also discovered that the square root code contained a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong.

5|$|Three works XJ220-Cs {{were entered}} in the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in the newly created Grand Touring Class. John Nielsen, David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class, beating Porsche by two laps; the other two cars retired, both through engine failure. However, the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220-C was {{controversially}} disqualified for failing to run with catalytic converters. The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed {{the first day of}} qualifying when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that Jaguar were <b>not</b> <b>running</b> catalytic converters. The cars had been entered under the IMSA GT category and Bertaut claimed that they needed to run with catalysts. The cars ran in the race under appeal.|$|E

5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} a mortar attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When <b>not</b> <b>running</b> at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E
5|$|From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on {{the board}} of directors, {{sometimes}} as chair, of the New World Foundation, which funded a variety of New Left interest groups. From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it. She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991. When Bill Clinton thought about <b>not</b> <b>running</b> again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate. However, Warren repeatedly stated that she was <b>not</b> <b>running</b> for President in 2016. In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E

Cranston left office in January 1993, and died in December 2000. DeConcini and Riegle continued to serve in the Senate until their terms expired, but they did not seek re-election in 1994. DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, trying to become the first senator ever to win a fourth term from Ohio. The Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor R. Michael DeWine, attacked Glenn on Keating Five {{as well as a number}} of other matters, in one of the dirtiest campaigns in the country that year and the toughest of Glenn's senatorial contests. Glenn prevailed, however, defeating DeWine by nine percentage points to gain one more term in the Senate before retiring and <b>not</b> <b>running</b> for re-election in 1998.|$|E
5|$|On lap 126, Hamlin had a 2.8second {{lead over}} Kahne. Seven laps later, Stewart passed Jeff Burton {{for the fifth}} position. By lap 134, the green flag pit stops began.

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was able to compete, after the Ferrari crew was able to change his gearbox in time for the session. <b>Not</b> <b>running</b> was Jenson Button, after his team decided not to go out, since a 55-place grid penalty would have placed him {{at the back of the}} grid at any case. Marcus Ericsson was more than half a second quicker than teammate Felipe Nasr, who failed to proceed into Q2, as did both Manor Marussia drivers. With Button out of the running, just one more driver was eliminated, and that proved to be his McLaren teammate Alonso, who barely missed out on making the cut. At the front, Rosberg set the fastest time ahead of Vettel, while Hamilton was the only driver not to use the soft compound tyre.|$|E
