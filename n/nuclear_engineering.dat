5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{provided}} {{universities and colleges}} with grants to acquire small nuclear reactors for research programs. The University of Washington began <b>nuclear</b> <b>engineering</b> classes {{as part of the}} College of Engineering in 1953, and formed a Department of <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Engineering</b> in 1956, accepting engineers from Boeing and the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Engineering</b> department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's <b>nuclear</b> <b>engineering</b> program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|One of Robinson's professors, James E. Boyd, {{convinced}} him {{to give up the}} radio repair business and work as a research assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (then known as the Engineering Experiment Station, or EES). One of his ham radio friends was actually his boss's boss and EES director, Gerald Rosselot. Working after hours at EES, Robinson built a television set in the lab, which he and others claim was the first to be built in the state of Georgia. In 1950, Robinson went to Tennessee to work in <b>nuclear</b> <b>engineering</b> for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, servicing radiology-related equipment at local hospitals.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Engineering</b> in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.|$|E
