5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> storing {{programmes}} {{that had}} not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, it was {{reported}} that an 18-year-old pupil who had recently publicly admitted to being transgender had committed suicide. Her family stated that the school bore <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> her death.|$|E
50|$|Constitutionally, provincial governments had <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> Aboriginal peoples, {{but they}} used the {{prohibition}} movement, primarily the liquor laws, {{as a way to}} define Aboriginals. Rules for the retail selling of alcohol were primarily a provincial responsibility. This came to be following the adoption of government control after Canada's experience with prohibition during the First World War.|$|R

25|$|Fired: Mani - For {{incorrectly}} briefing {{the team}} on the venture, his arrogant behaviour, taking <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> his actions, being disrespectful towards Ruth in the boardroom, and for his generally average at best track record through the process.|$|E
25|$|In a {{shocking}} {{close to the}} episode, Lydia is confronted by an angry Mr. Lindstrom at the office stating that everyone working there will take <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> their actions.

25|$|In 2017, Le Pen {{argued that}} France {{as a nation}} bore <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, {{a part of the}} Holocaust in which Paris policemen arrested Jewish {{citizens}} for deportation to Auschwitz. She repeated a Gaullist thesis according to which France was not represented by the Vichy regime but by General de Gaulle's Free France.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2008, {{the city}} of Durham filed a motion to remove itself as a defendant, arguing it had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> Nifong's actions. On the same day, Nifong filed for {{bankruptcy}}. On May 27, 2008, Judge William L. Stocks lifted the stay from Nifong's bankruptcy filing and ruled that the plaintiffs lawsuit could go forward.|$|E
25|$|Fired: Kevin – For his awful sales pitches, {{refusing to}} allow Claire to pitch (despite her experience), {{allowing}} Jenny full control on creating the card, taking <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the loss, bringing Sara {{back in the}} boardroom {{in an attempt to}} scapegoat her instead of Jenny and for his overly arrogant attitude throughout the process.|$|E
50|$|<b>No</b> groups claimed <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the attack. However, {{there were}} suspicions centred on the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi which has carried out several sectarian attacks before.|$|R

The crew refused to stop the ship {{to search for the}} passenger and the 21-year-old Estonian male perished in the incident. Tallink later accepted <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the accident, emphasizing that none of the passengers confirmed actually seeing the man falling overboard or in the water.|$|E
25|$|Other than UC {{appointing}} {{three members}} to the two separate board of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E

5000|$|A task-combined zveno, wrote Kayurova, had {{or should}} have plots of land fixed to it for the whole period of its work cycle. Task-specialized zvenya (e.g. of harrowers or sowers) bore <b>no</b> fixed <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> {{particular}} plots, but worked in all their brigade's plots. It was consequently very difficult to pin down <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> bad work. A fixed plot ensured [...] "timely and high-quality execution" [...] of work.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the ramifications}} {{and the fact}} that a monarch from the House of Orange had never visited Spain, the Queen {{had no choice but to}} turn back. Prince Bernhard then {{traveled}} to Madrid to meet with his daughter and her fiancé, who both accompanied him back to the Netherlands, where an immediate meeting took place with the couple, the Queen, Prime Minister Marijnen, himself a Roman Catholic, and three top cabinet ministers. When the meeting had ended in the early hours of the morning on Sunday, 9 February 1964, Dutch radio broke its traditional Sabbath day silence to announce that Princess Irene would give up any rights of succession to the throne so she could marry Carlos Hugo. The princess further stated that she did not want the government to create a bill which would grant official consent to her marriage. In an attempt to gain public favour for her proposed marriage, Princess Irene publicly stated that her marriage was intended to help end religious intolerance. This caused a division in public opinion, as less than 40percent of the country ruled by the Protestant House of Orange was Roman Catholic. Over the ensuing weeks, things deteriorated further when Pope Paul VI granted an audience requested by the couple in Rome. The Vatican believed the meeting was being held with the consent of the Dutch Royal Family. The Queen at first denied such a meeting had taken place, but it was later verified. Because the constitution prohibits members of the royal family from any involvement in foreign politics, Irene alienated herself from almost every Dutch citizen when a photo appeared in a Dutch paper showing her at a Carlist rally in Spain and she declared that she supported her fiancé's political goals. The Dutch government officially announced that it had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> either the words or actions of Princess Irene in the future on 10 April 1964. It was done in response to Irene's declaration of joining Carlos Hugo's political campaign to regain the throne of Spain on 8 April 1964.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in 1864, Sherman ordered the city's evacuation. When the city council appealed to him to rescind that order, {{on the grounds that}} it would cause great {{hardship}} to women, children, the elderly, and others who bore <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the conduct of the war, Sherman sent a written response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if the Union were restored, and that he was therefore prepared to do all he could do to quash the rebellion: ...|$|E
500|$|Whatever the {{relative}} {{influence of the}} Board and cabinet, the latter disavowed any ownership of the act that established the former. Though it was a government bill, sponsored by Solon Low, the Provincial Treasurer explained that he took <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> it, as it was drawn up by a committee of insurgents [...] "without the interference of the cabinet". Though some insurgents complained that the {{version of the bill}} introduced by the government was different than that drafted by the committee, MacLachlan insisted that there had been no material changes. The bill was passed April 13, and the legislature adjourned the following day.|$|E
50|$|For the August 2007 Yazidi {{communities}} bombings, {{which killed}} some 800 people, US military and government sources named al-Qaeda as the “prime suspect”, {{but there was}} <b>no</b> claim of <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> those attacks.|$|R

25|$|<b>No</b> group claimed <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the attack. Israeli and Egyptian {{authorities}} {{believe that}} the perpetrators belonged to a global jihad network, and were assisted by Bedouin tribes in the Sinai in return for money.|$|R
500|$|In {{his first}} Senate speech in 1855, Wilson {{continued}} to align {{himself with the}} abolitionists, who wanted to immediately end slavery in the United States and its territories. In his speech, Wilson {{said he wanted to}} abolish slavery [...] "wherever we are morally and legally responsible for its existence" [...] including Washington D.C. Wilson also demanded repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, believing the federal government should have <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> enforcing slavery, and that once the act was repealed tensions between slavery proponents and opponents would abate, enabling those Southerners who opposed slavery to help end it in their own time.|$|E
500|$|A pauper {{applicant}} had {{to prove}} a settlement. If they could not they were removed to the parish that was nearest to their place of birth, or where they might prove some connection; some paupers were moved hundreds of miles. Although the parishes they passed through en route had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> them, {{they were supposed to}} supply food and drink and shelter for at least one night. In 1697 an act was passed requiring those who begged to wear a [...] "badge" [...] of red or blue cloth on the right shoulder with an embroidered letter [...] "P" [...] and the initial of their parish. However, this practice soon fell into disuse.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{took the}} view that a few [...] "militarist" [...] extremists had [...] "hijacked" [...] Japan {{starting}} in 1931 with the Mukden Incident, the Emperor was a pro-Western [...] "moderate" [...] who had been powerless to stop the militarists, and thus bore <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> any of the war crimes committed by the Japanese between 1931 and 1945. The American historian Herbert P. Bix described {{the relationship between the}} general and the Emperor as: [...] "the Allied commander would use the Emperor, and the Emperor would cooperate in being used. Their relationship became one of expediency and mutual protection, of more political benefit to Hirohito than to MacArthur because Hirohito had more to lose–the entire panoply of symbolic, legitimizing properties of the imperial throne".|$|E
50|$|Even those Noldor {{who bore}} <b>no</b> direct <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the crime felt {{the shame of}} it, and they grew angry at the sons of Fëanor for their pride. Eventually, Círdan the Shipwright heard rumour of the Kinslaying, and sent word to Thingol. Outraged, Thingol confronted Finrod Felagund with this news, but Finrod made no reply rather than accuse his kinsmen.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{formation of}} police and security forces saw {{an overwhelming majority of}} senior-ranking personnel due to disorganization and corruption. It was not uncommon to find someone holding a senior rank, such as lieutenant colonel, possessing minimal qualifications or having little to <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> a rank of that stature. It was a period of total mismanagement that allowed people to use bribery and other forms of influence to gain prominent positions in the national police force. It was soon evident that the organization was “top heavy” and thus ineffective in conducting the daily duties expected of the police. Furthermore, many leaders inside the Ministry of Interior were guilty of human rights violations and other forms of blackmail and corruption. There was an obvious need to reorganize and repair this broken ministry.|$|R
