2500|$|In most jurisdictions, {{there are}} ways for third parties to {{challenge}} the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the <b>national</b> <b>patent</b> office; these are called opposition proceedings. [...] It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries {{to prove that the}} patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not patentable subject matter at all; [...] the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc. [...] Patents can be found to be invalid {{in whole or in part}} for any of these reasons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{breakthrough in}} soft lenses {{was made by}} Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím, who published their work [...] "Hydrophilic gels for biological use" [...] in the journal Nature in 1959. In 1965, <b>National</b> <b>Patent</b> Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists' work led to {{the launch of the}} first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort, if any, is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.|$|E

50|$|<b>National</b> <b>patents</b> are {{available}} in all European countries. In some European countries, <b>national</b> <b>patents</b> are substantively examined, while in other countries there is no provision for such examination and patents are thus granted only if formal requirements are met, while novelty and inventive step is not evaluated. It can be cheaper and tactically advantageous {{to apply for a}} few <b>national</b> <b>patents</b> rather than for a European patent at the European Patent Office.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that with the success of the European Patent Office (EPO), and {{in the context of a}} European Community (EC) which now has a single market, that <b>national</b> <b>patenting</b> in European countries is an anachronism. However, although national filing figures in EC countries have decreased in the past decade, whilst those in non-EC countries increased, this decline has apparently now levelled off. There is a continued demand for <b>national</b> <b>patenting</b> which should be met so that no company or individual is forced to use the European regional system where that is inappropriate. ...|$|R

50|$|Europe {{does not}} {{comprise}} a unitary patent system. European patent law is instead {{characterized by the}} coexistence of <b>national</b> <b>patent</b> systems, and thus <b>national</b> <b>patent</b> offices, and a European patent system associated with the European Patent Convention (EPC), {{in the context of}} which the European Patent Office (EPO) grants European patents through a central prosecution procedure. Enforcement of European patents are conducted and decided at a national level, i.e. before national courts. The patent offices in Europe therefore include, on the one hand, the plurality of <b>national</b> <b>patent</b> offices and, on the other hand, the European Patent Office.

5000|$|<b>National</b> <b>patents</b> {{applied for}} {{directly}} with Netherlands Patent Office are so-called [...] "registration patents": no substantial examination takes place, and the patent is granted if certain formalities have been fulfilled. European patents designating the Netherlands {{have the same}} effect as direct <b>national</b> <b>patents,</b> provided that the patent description is translated in English and the claims in Dutch (The Netherlands has ratified the London Agreement (2000)). Inventions have to fulfill three requirements to be patentable: they have to be new, inventive and industrially applicable. Patents can be licensed and such license has effect against third parties only after registration with the Intellectual property office. The patents act provides for the grant of compulsory licenses in the public interest if the patent owner refuses to grant a licence, and grant of compulsory licenses to the Kingdom in wartime.|$|R
