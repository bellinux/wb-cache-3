25|$|The nuclear {{industry}} says that {{new technology and}} oversight have made <b>nuclear</b> <b>station</b> much safer, but 57 small accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 until 2008.

25|$|Compared {{to nuclear}} power, {{hydroelectricity}} construction requires altering {{large areas of}} the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any <b>nuclear</b> <b>station</b> failure. The creation of Garrison Dam, for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.|$|E

In addition, the petition asks the NRC to halt proceedings to approve the standardized AP1000 and Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor designs.The petitioners asked the NRC to supplement its own investigation by establishing an independent commission comparable to that {{set up in the}} wake of the less severe 1979 Three Mile Island accident. The petitioners included Public Citizen, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace.|$|R
25|$|The reactor at Koeberg is cooled by {{cold water}} from the Atlantic Ocean pumped through an {{isolated}} circuit at 80 tons a second. Low and intermediate level waste from Koeberg is transported by road in steel and concrete containers to a rural disposal site at Vaalputs, 600km away in the Kalahari Desert.

25|$|In {{the case}} of an {{accident}} (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission <b>nuclear</b> <b>station.</b> Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary {{for the construction of a}} weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the four}} EPRs under {{construction}} (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost. Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats. While first of their kind designs, such as the EPRs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget, of the seven South Korean APR-1400s presently under construction worldwide, two are in S.Korea at the Hanul Nuclear Power Plant and four are at the largest <b>nuclear</b> <b>station</b> construction project {{in the world as}} of 2016, in the United Arab Emirates at the planned Barakah nuclear power plant. The first reactor, Barakah-1 is 85% completed and on schedule for grid-connection during 2017.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>nuclear</b> <b>stations</b> require two {{distinct}} sources of offsite {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some <b>nuclear</b> <b>stations</b> the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. <b>Nuclear</b> power <b>stations</b> are equipped with emergency power.|$|R
25|$|Construction on Byron Nuclear Generating Station {{began in}} 1975, at a 1,782-acre (7.2km²) site, 17miles (27km) {{southwest}} of Rockford, Illinois, {{south of the}} city of Byron in Ogle County. The firm of Sargent & Lundy acted as consulting engineer during construction and Babcock & Wilcox oversaw the completion of the reactor vessels. Before construction was completed on the reactor vessels and facilities, at least three groups joined in a 1981 lawsuit to halt Byron Nuclear Generating Station's completion. The League of Women Voters, DeKalb Area Alliance for Responsible Energy, and others were involved in the lawsuit over the safety of and need for the plant. In 1984 the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, a division of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), stopped the planned <b>nuclear</b> <b>station</b> at Byron by refusing its owners, then Commonwealth Edison, permission to begin operation. The decision stemmed from concerns about the quality control of independent contractors hired during construction. Ultimately, the board overturned its decision in October1984 and permission was granted to operate after a re-inspection of over 200,000items and components within the plant.|$|E

[...] The construction of the two South Carolina reactors have been abandoned due to cost overruns and the bankruptcy of Westinghouse Electric Company (who designed and was building the reactors) in March 2017.
