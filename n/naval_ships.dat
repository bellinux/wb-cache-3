40|$|In present study, {{a history}} {{analysis}} and review of last 30 years for U. S. <b>naval</b> <b>ship</b> concept design development trend is proposed. Based {{on the development}} of <b>naval</b> <b>ship</b> concept design model history, the three features of development process are further summarized. The first is that model-based system engineering (MBSE) becomes the basic of <b>naval</b> <b>ship</b> concept design, while the second one is that the multi-discipline crossing and combination becomes a general innovation model. And the third one is that systematization oriented naval system integration is the developing goal. Some detailed examples are presented to illustrate these three characteristics. Finally, the technology difficulties in <b>naval</b> <b>ship</b> concept design are also presented...|$|R

5|$|Even though Brigadier General Joseph V.

It said that the northern, southern, and western areas of the city were all taken over by armed gangs.|$|E

5|$|The National Flag of Portugal {{also serves}} as war flag and ensign, so being flown on {{military}} facilities and <b>naval</b> <b>ships.</b> There are however specific national military flags for specific uses, namely the military colors, the naval jack and the naval pennant.

5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents could destroy the dock gates.

The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any <b>naval</b> <b>ships</b> large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E

Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and the Apache for the British Army's new Attack Helicopter in 1995. Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. Apache variants include changing to more powerful Rolls-Royce engines, and the addition of a folding blade assembly for use on <b>naval</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing <b>naval</b> <b>ships</b> that were assembled in the area.|$|E

Because Monitor was an experimental craft, urgently needed, hurriedly constructed and almost immediately put to sea, a number of problems were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there. Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, an Australian Division of the East Indies Station was {{established}}, and in 1859 the British Admiralty {{established an}} independent command, the Australia Station, {{under the command}} of a Commodore who was assigned as Commander-in-Chief, Australia Station. The Australian Squadron was created to which British <b>naval</b> <b>ships</b> serving on the Australia Station were assigned. The changes were partially in recognition of the fact that {{a large part of the}} East Indies Station had been detached to Australian waters, and also reflecting growing concern for the strategic situation in the western Pacific in general, and in Tahiti and New Zealand in particular. In 1884, the commander of the Australia Station was upgraded to the rank of Rear Admiral.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the United States {{military}} flew planes {{away from}} the coast to safer shelters further inland. Two people were killed when they crashed the Navy plane they were evacuating. <b>Naval</b> <b>ships</b> rode out the storm at sea, while small boats were secured at port. The American Red Cross opened shelters and mobilized 41officials with experience in hurricanes. The Coast Guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate, and overall about 14,000people evacuated the coastline, some to the 79Red Cross shelters opened up. About 2,000people evacuated from flood-prone areas in New Bern, North Carolina. In Philadelphia, the Boy Scouts evacuated 800scouts from Camp Delmont due {{to the threat of}} the hurricane. The threat of Connie also canceled a flight by President Dwight Eisenhower from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., prompting him to travel instead by car. Residents were also evacuated in coastal portions of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were <b>naval</b> <b>ships</b> of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E

5|$|At 13:10, the RAF {{formation}} {{flew over}} the mud flats {{to the west of}} Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions, 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other <b>naval</b> <b>ships</b> in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. In a quick briefing, JG 1's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack was dangerous, as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire. One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794–1795 the armies of the French Republic overran the Dutch Republic, {{reforming}} the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic. The Dutch Republic {{was part of the}} Coalition against Republican France formed in the War of the First Coalition {{at the start of the}} French Revolutionary Wars, and their closest ally in Northern Europe was Great Britain. In Britain the Admiralty was alarmed by developments in the Netherlands, particularly the seizure of the Dutch Navy by French cavalry units while the fleet was frozen into its winter harbour, and gave orders that the Royal Navy was to detain Dutch merchant and <b>naval</b> <b>ships.</b> As a result, the Batavian Republic and Great Britain began an undeclared war in the spring of 1795.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made {{a friendly}} visit to Melbourne in early 1863. According to information {{passed on to}} Australian authorities in June 1864, Rear Admiral A.A. Popov had {{in the first half}} of the year 1863 received orders and a plan of attack on the British <b>naval</b> <b>ships</b> positioned near the Australian shore. The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries. The information was attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr, who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia, and found his way to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising. This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky. Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral Lessovsky, that was sent to New York at the same time.|$|E
