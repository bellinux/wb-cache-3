25|$|Aside from {{instances}} of larger lionfish individuals engaging in cannibalism on smaller individuals, adult lionfish have few identified natural predators, likely from {{the effectiveness of}} their venomous spines. Moray eels (family Muraenidae), bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), and large groupers, like the tiger grouper (Mycteroperca tigris) and <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus striatus), have been observed preying on lionfish. It remains unknown, however, how commonly these predators prey on lionfish. Sharks are also believed to be capable of preying on lionfish with no ill effects from their spines. Park officials of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras have attempted to train sharks to feed on lionfish as of 2011 in an attempt to control the invasive populations in the Caribbean. Predators of larvae and juvenile lionfish remain unknown, but may prove to be the primary limiting factor of lionfish populations in their native range.|$|E

50|$|Coral reefs have intense biodiversity-rich {{ecosystems}} {{which provides}} habitat {{for millions of}} aquatic species such as sponges, star fish, jellyfish, sea turtles, etc. Unfortunately, reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to chemical, temperature, and population changes. There has been an increasing disappearance of large predators such as barracuda, <b>Nassau</b> <b>groupers,</b> and sharks This makes the reefs more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.|$|R
50|$|A large {{spawning}} {{site for the}} species is located at Glover's Reef, off the Belizean coast. It {{has been identified as}} one of only two viable sites remaining for the species, of 9 originally known locations. In 2002, a permanent marine protected area was established on Glover's Reef. However, the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper's</b> spawning region is not included in this marine protected area (MPA). Instead, their spawning area (located north of the MPA) is subjected to a three-month closure during winter spawning aggregations.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, <b>Nassau</b> <b>groupers,</b> humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|R

30|$|Commonness {{is often}} used in ecology to explain the {{population}} status of a species (Gaston 1994, 2010). A species prevailing over a wide geographical range and having broad habitat specificity, large local abundance, and frequent habitat occupation {{can be considered a}} common species (Rey Benayas et al. 1999). Commonness is normally closely related to abundance, referring to the frequency with which a species is found in controlled areas (Hu et al. 2012; Sizling et al. 2009; Zacharias and Brandes 1990). In this study, the definition of commonness was adjusted from spatial abundance to temporal presence {{in order to meet the}} demands arising from visits by different divers. The “star” species used to lure tourists to many destinations are good examples. Longfin batfish on the steel-frame reefs of Green Island, Taiwan (Yang et al. 2011), hammerhead sharks at Layang Layang Island, Malaysia (Musa et al. 2006), <b>Nassau</b> <b>groupers</b> at the Turks and Caicos Islands and Bahamas (Rudd and Tupper 2002), and pygmy-seahorses in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea (Cater 2008) are some of the star species often showcased in diving magazines, guide books, promotional videos, and websites. Their appearance and behavior can trigger tourist diver interest. However, there should also be a focus on their reliability of occurrence, a factor essential for guaranteeing satisfactory encounters on commercial dive trips.|$|R

50|$|In its {{invasive}} range, few predators of the lionfish {{have been}} documented. Most larger Atlantic and Caribbean fish and sharks {{that should be}} able to eat the lionfish have not recognized them as prey, likely due to the novelty of the fish in the invaded areas. Lionfish have, however, been found in the stomachs of <b>Nassau</b> and tiger <b>groupers</b> in the Bahamas. The lionfish themselves are voracious feeders and have outcompeted and filled the niche of the overfished snapper and grouper. When hunting, they corner prey using their large fins, then use their quick reflexes to swallow the prey whole. They hunt primarily from late afternoon to dawn. High rates of prey consumption, a wide variety of prey, and increasing abundance of the fish lead to concerns the fish may have a very active role in the already declining trend of fish densities. As the fish become more abundant, they are becoming a threat to the fragile ecosystems they have invaded. Between outcompeting similar fish and having a varied diet, the lionfish is drastically changing and disrupting the food chains holding the marine ecosystems together. As these chains are disrupted, declining densities of other fish populations are found, as well as declines in the overall diversity of coral reef areas.|$|R
50|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus bunkleywilliamsae is a diplectanid monogenean {{parasitic}} on {{the gills}} of the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus striatus. It {{has been described}} by Kritsky, Bakenhaster and Adams in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The type-host {{and only}} {{recorded}} host of P. bunkleywilliamsae is the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus striatus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality and only recorded locality is La Parguera, Puerto Rico.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> is fished both commercially and for sport; {{it is less}} shy {{than other}} groupers, and is readily {{approached}} by scuba divers. However, its numbers have been sharply reduced by overfishing in recent years, {{and it is a}} slow breeder. Furthermore, its historic spawning areas are easily targeted for fishing, which tends to remove the reproductively active members of the group. The species is therefore highly vulnerable to overexploitation, and is recognised as endangered on the IUCN Red List. The governments of the United States, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas have banned or instituted closed fishing seasons for the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> in recent years. In the Cayman Islands, fishing in the spawning holes of the grouper has been banned until the end of 2016. In the case of the Bahamas, the government has instituted a closed fishing season in which fishing for the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> is banned from December to February. It is in a very high rate decline and is at serious risk of becoming extinct.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, {{the term}} [...] "white grouper" [...] {{is also used}} as a local vernacular name for several other species of fish, {{including}} the yellowedge grouper (Epinephelus flavolimbatus), <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus striatus), and Venezuelan grouper (Mycteroperca cidi) (http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/ComNames/CommonNameSearchList.php).|$|E

50|$|A large {{spawning}} {{site for the}} endangered <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus striatus) {{is located at the}} northeastern end of the atoll. It has been identified as one of only two viable sites remaining for the species, of nine originally known locations. In 2002, it was declared a special marine reserve, permanently closed to fishing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> {{was placed}} on the World Conservation Union’s redlist of {{threatened}} species in 1996, and it was determined to be endangered because its population has declined by 60% in the past 30 years. Over a third of spawning aggregations have been estimated to have disappeared, and the grouper is considered to be commercially extinct in some areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> {{lives in}} the sea near reefs; {{it is one of}} the largest fish to be found around coral reefs. It can be found from the {{shoreline}} to nearly 100-m-deep water. It {{lives in the}} western Atlantic Ocean, from Bermuda, Florida, and the Bahamas in the north to southern Brazil, but it is only found in a few places in the Gulf of Mexico, most notably along the coast of Belize.|$|E
50|$|The reef {{system is}} {{home to more than}} 65 species of stony coral, 350 species of mollusk and more than 500 species of fish. There are {{numerous}} species that live in or around the reef system that are endangered or under some degree of protection, including the following: sea turtles (green sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, leatherback turtle, and the hawksbill turtle), the queen conch, the West Indian manatee, the splendid toadfish, the American crocodile, the Morelet's Crocodile, the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper,</b> elkhorn coral, and black coral.|$|E
50|$|The reef {{has only}} partial {{environmental}} protection. The Great Blue Hole and Half Moon Caye have been designated as Natural Monuments and are UNESCO World Heritage Sites (as {{part of the}} Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System) since 1996.

50|$|Aside from {{instances}} of larger lionfish individuals engaging in cannibalism on smaller individuals, adult lionfish have few identified natural predators, likely from {{the effectiveness of}} their venomous spines. Moray eels (family Muraenidae), bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), and large groupers, like the tiger grouper (Mycteroperca tigris) and <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus striatus), have been observed preying on lionfish. It remains unknown, however, how commonly these predators prey on lionfish. Sharks are also believed to be capable of preying on lionfish with no ill effects from their spines.

5000|$|Spearfishing {{has been}} implicated in local disappearances of some species, {{including}} the Atlantic goliath grouper on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> in the barrier reef {{off the coast of}} Belize and the giant black sea bass in California, which have all been listed as endangered. Modern Spearfishing has shifted focus onto catching only what one needs and targeting sustainable fisheries. As gear evolved in the 1960s and 1970s spearfishermen typically viewed the ocean as an unlimited resource and often sold their catch. This practise is now heavily frowned upon in prominent spearfishing nations for promoting unsustainable methods and encouraging taking more fish than is needed.In countries such as Australia and South Africa where the activity is regulated by state fisheries, spearfishing {{has been found to be}} the most environmentally friendly form of fishing due to being highly selective, having no by-catch, causing no habitat damage, nor creating pollution or harm to protected endangered species. [...] In 2007, the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic became the first spearfishing tournament to be accredited and was awarded 4 out of 5 stars based on environmental, social, safety and economic indicators.|$|E
50|$|Representative of {{the trend}} in grouper populations {{throughout}} the Caribbean is the endemic and now-endangered <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus striatus), {{once one of the}} most commonly caught fishes in Belize. About one-third of the spawning aggregations sites for this species have disappeared due to over-fishing. Annual spawning occurs in specific locations on the outer reef shelf during the days around the full moon of December and January. Aggregations can range anywhere from a dozen to up to several thousand adult individuals and are usually in the same site each year, making an easy target for fishermen. This intensive harvesting of reproductively active individuals, often before they have had the chance to spawn, has resulted in a marked decline in both abundance and size. One site for example, Caye Glory, historically provided a catch of up to 1,200-1,800 Nassau groupers per boat per spawning season during the 1960s. In 2001, at the same site, fishers caught just 9 individuals out of an aggregation of 21 groupers. In addition, groupers typically {{take a long time to}} reach maturity. Because of this, over the past few years females have continued to decrease in average size, indicating that more mature females are being removed, leaving behind young females with fewer eggs.|$|E
40|$|The Indo-Pacific Red Lionfish (P. volitans) has invaded {{coral reefs}} in the Western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean. This {{abundant}} invader {{has the potential}} to negatively affect native species through both competition and predation. A native species that may be particularly vulnerable to this invasion is the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> (E. striatus) because it prefers similar habitat as lionfish. Since <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> are of ecological and economic significance, {{it is important to understand}} how lionfish will affect them. Experiments were conducted in large outdoor tanks to investigate competition for shelter space and predation between lionfish and <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper.</b> Lionfish and <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> were paired in three combinations (lionfish:grouper) : (1) 1 : 1 size ratio (2) 1 : 4 size ratio and (3) 3 : 1 size ratio. Small lionfish often displaced large <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> from shelter holes indicating that the invader may be a superior interference competitor for habitat. In addition, throughout all replicates, large <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> did not consume small lionfish and large lionfish did not consume small <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper.</b> These results suggest that grouper in the size range studied are unlikely to control the invasion and that invasive lionfish may outcompete native grouper for access to shelter...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Groupers are a phylogenetically diverse group and include many ecologically and economically valuable predatory marine fishes that have experienced drastic population declines. Reproduction via spawning aggregations increases the vulnerability of grouper species such as <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus striatus to overfishing, and this is likely to be a major contributing factor to population declines. However, the lack of information pertaining to population structure and dynamics of <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> spawning aggregations has impeded effective ecosystem-based fisheries management for remaining stocks.

40|$|<b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus striatus {{are a large}} bodied, {{top level}} {{predator}} that is ecologically important throughout the Caribbean. Although typically solitary, <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> form large annual spawning aggregations at predictable times in specific locations. In 2003, The Cayman Islands Marine Conservation Board established protection for a newly rediscovered <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> spawning aggregation on Little Cayman, British West Indies. The large size of this aggregation provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study the behavior of <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> on a relatively intact spawning aggregation. During non-spawning periods <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> display a reddish-brown-and-white barred coloration. However, while aggregating they exhibit three additional color phases: “bicolor”, “dark”, and “white belly”. We video sampled the population on multiple days leading up to spawning across five spawning years. Divers focused a laser caliper equipped video camera on individual fish at the aggregation. We later analyzed the video to determine the length of the fish and record the color phase. Our observations show that the relative proportion of fish in the bicolor color phase increases significantly on the day leading up to the primary night of spawning. The increase in the proportion of the bicolor color phase from 0. 05 early in the aggregation to 0. 40 on the day of spawning suggests that this color phase conveys that a fish is behaviorally and physiologically prepared to spawn. Additionally, 82. 7 % of fish exhibiting dark or white belly coloration early in the aggregation period suggests that these color phases are not only shown by female fish as was previously posited [Current Zoology 58 (1) : 73 – 83, 2012]...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus striatus (Bloch, 1792), is an {{endangered}} species that has been historically overexploited in numerous fisheries throughout its range in the Caribbean and tropical West Atlantic. Data relating fishery exploitation levels to stock abundance of the species are deficient, and protective regulations for the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> are yet to be implemented in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). The goal {{of this study was}} to conduct a stock assessment and evaluate the exploitation status of the <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> in the TCI. Materials and methods. Calibrated length cohort analysis was applied to published fisheries data on <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> landings in the TCI. The total lengths of Nassau groupers among the catches of spearfishers, lobster trappers, and deep sea fishers on the island of South Caicos during 2006 and 2008 were used with estimates of growth, natural mortality, and total annual landings to derive exploitation benchmarks. Results. The TCI stock experienced low to moderate fishing mortality (0. 28, 0. 18) and exploitation rates (0. 49, 0. 38) during the period of the study (2006, 2008). However, 21. 2 %- 64. 4 % of all landings were reproductively immature. Spearfishing appeared to contribute most to fishing mortality relative to the use of lobster traps or hydraulic reels along bank drop-offs. Conclusion. In comparison with available fisheries data for the wider Caribbean, the results reveal the TCI as one of the remaining sites, in addition to the Bahamas, with a substantial <b>Nassau</b> <b>grouper</b> stock. In light of increasing development and tourism in the TCI, continued monitoring is essential to maintain sustainable harvesting practices...|$|E
