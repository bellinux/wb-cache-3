25|$|The {{existence}} of camels in Mesopotamia {{but not in}} Israel is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> The historian Richard Bulliet {{did not think that}} the occasional mention of camels meant that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time. The archaeologist William F. Albright writing even earlier saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.|$|E

25|$|The {{commuter}} ferry is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> Tradition {{has it that}} Native Americans regularly {{crossed the}} Hudson River at the point between what is now Beacon and Newburgh, long before Europeans arrived in America. In 1743, an “official” ferry was established when Alexander Colden received a royal charter from King George II to carry passengers and goods for profit. The right to operate ferries between Beacon and Newburgh was bestowed upon the Ramsdell family by the heirs of Alexander Colden. They ran the ferry through the Steamboat Era until 1956 when NYSBA took over ferry services.|$|E
500|$|In 1932 the Hungarian Vilmos Hevesy (Guillaume de Hevesy) {{published}} an article claiming a relationship between rongorongo and the Indus Valley script, based on superficial similarities of form. This was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea,</b> but was now presented to the French Academy of Inscriptions and Literature by the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot and {{picked up by the}} press. Due to the lack of an accessible rongorongo corpus for comparison, it was not apparent that several of the rongorongo glyphs illustrated in Hevesy's publications were spurious. Despite the fact that both scripts were undeciphered (as they are to this day), separated by half the world and half of history ( [...] and 4000years), and had no known intermediate stages, Hevesy's ideas were taken seriously enough in academic circles to prompt a 1934 Franco–Belgian expedition to Easter Island led by Lavachery and Métraux to debunk them (Métraux 1939). The Indus Valley connection was published as late as 1938 in such respected anthropological journals as Man.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "thought variant" [...] {{policy may}} have been {{introduced}} for publicity, {{rather than as a}} real attempt to define the sort of fiction Tremaine was looking for; the early [...] "thought variant" [...] stories were not always very original or well executed. [...] Ashley describes the first, Nat Schachner's [...] "Ancestral Voices", as [...] "not amongst Schachner's best"; the second, [...] "Colossus", by Donald Wandrei, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea,</b> but was energetically written. [...] Over the succeeding issues, it became apparent that Tremaine was genuinely willing to publish material that would have fallen foul of editorial taboos elsewhere. [...] He serialized Charles Fort's Lo!, a nonfiction work about strange and inexplicable phenomena, in eight parts between April and November 1934, in an attempt to stimulate new ideas for stories. [...] The best-remembered story of 1934 is probably Jack Williamson's [...] "The Legion of Space", which began serialization in April, but other notable stories include Murray Leinster's [...] "Sidewise in Time", which was the first genre science-fiction story to use the idea of alternate history; [...] "The Bright Illusion", by C.L. Moore, and [...] "Twilight", by John W. Campbell, writing as Don A. Stuart. [...] "Twilight", which was written in a more literary and poetic style than Campbell's earlier space opera stories, was particularly influential, and Tremaine encouraged other writers to produce similar stories. [...] One such was Raymond Z. Gallun's [...] "Old Faithful", which appeared in the December 1934 issue and was sufficiently popular that Gallun wrote a sequel, [...] "Son of Old Faithful", published the following July. [...] Space opera continued to be popular, though, and two overlapping space opera novels were running in Astounding late in the year: The Skylark of Valeron by E.E. Smith, and The Mightiest Machine, by Campbell. [...] By the end of the year, Astounding was the clear leader of the small field of sf magazines.|$|E

We hope to show that VisPar can be useful as a teaching tool by providing visualisations of a few examples from a course on parallel functional programming...|$|R
2500|$|Hubbert's {{peak oil}} theory {{suggests}} that petroleum is a finite resource that is rapidly depleting. Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately [...] (about {{one half of the}} original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of [...] per year, only about 50 years worth of petroleum is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: fuel (home heating, jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, etc.) transportation, agriculture, pharmaceutical, plastics/resins, man-made fibers, synthetic rubber, and explosives. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘peak oil’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021, (though peak oil is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea)</b> and a slowing of global warming that may usher in unprecedented climate change.|$|E
6000|$|Flight is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> to the Crown-Prince; in a {{negative}} form we have seen it present {{in the minds of}} by-standers: [...] "a Crown-Prince determined NOT to fly," [...] whispered they. [Dubourgay (9th August, 1729), supra, p. 129.] Some weeks ago, Wilhelmina writes: [...] "The King's bad treatments began again on his reappearance" [...] at Potsdam after the Hunting; [...] "he never saw my Brother without threatening him with his cane. My Brother told me day after day, He would endure everything from the King, only not blows; and that if it ever came to such extremity, he would be prepared to deliver himself by running off." [...] And here, it would seem, the extremity has actually come.|$|E

25|$|Each of the 19 {{stations}} {{along the}} route is designed in a unique architectural style reflective of the station's surrounding community. This is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> entirely <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> for the region, {{as many of the}} higher-traffic bus stops around the city have distinctive designs. Due to the unique makeup of Minneapolis's population, ticket-dispensing machines present instructions in four languages: English, Spanish, Somali and Hmong. Travel time is roughly two to three minutes between most stations.|$|R
60|$|We have lately been struck,--of course <b>not</b> dangerously,--by <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>A</b> recent {{number of}} a {{well-known}} magazine contains {{an account of}} an American multimillionaire who, {{on account of the}} pressure of his brain power and the rush of his business, found it impossible to read the fiction of the day for himself. He therefore caused his secretaries to look through any new and likely novel and make a rapid report on its contents, indicating for his personal perusal the specially interesting parts.|$|R

Helicopter air ambulances had been in use for about fifteen-years in various other countries but the centralised funding of the NHS had always rejected the concept. When Cornwall’s started operating on 1 April 1987 it was the first in the UK.|$|R

30|$|Anonymous job {{applications}} gain {{attention and}} popularity as an attractive policy intervention {{to reduce or}} even eliminate discrimination in hiring.

However, the concept is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> fundamentally <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> Anonymous or “blind” procedures have already been used in other areas. For example, Blank (1991) analyzes the effects of double-blind and single-blind reviewing processes at an economic journal.Goldin and Rouse (2000) investigate the impacts of blind auditions to select members of symphony orchestras.

2500|$|Yet another {{approach}} was proposed {{by a number}} of parties inside and outside Israel: a [...] "binational solution" [...] whereby Israel would formally annex the Palestinian territories but would make the Palestinian Arabs citizens in a unitary secular state. Championed by Edward Said and New York University professor Tony Judt, the suggestion aroused both interest and condemnation. It was <b>not</b> actually <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>idea,</b> dating back as far as the 1920s, but it was given extra prominence by the growing demographic issues raised by a rapidly expanding Arab population in Israel and the territories.
