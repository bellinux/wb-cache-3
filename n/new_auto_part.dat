40|$|The Thai <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> {{industry}} {{is considered to}} be, along with the automotive industry, {{the driving force of}} the nation’s economy. Dating back to the 1960 s, the government has started an initiative to establish Thailand as the “Detroit of Asia”. Foreseeing that the <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> and automotive industries are two interrelated segments with high value added, various measures and policies are planned by the government to nurture and support the two industries {{so that they can be}} internationally competitive. This paper analyzes interviews conducted with firms in the <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> and automotive industries along with the secondary data to identify the source of competitive advantage of the <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> industry and its contribution to the development of the automotive industry. The findings, which utilized the national diamond model, five forces framework, and network theory, has demonstrated an interesting result. The role of the government is much more important than expected. Policies and regulations enforced by the government are the main factor creating competitive advantage for the <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> industry.
