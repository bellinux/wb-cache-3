5|$|Somerset's quarter-final, against Lancashire, was {{scheduled}} for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Bad weather meant that <b>no</b> <b>play</b> was possible on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, {{as a result of}} which the teams requested special dispensation from the ECB for an additional reserve day on the Thursday, which was granted. The wet weather continued, forcing the teams to play a bowl-out. Each team had to select five bowlers, each of whom had two deliveries at a set of unguarded stumps. Somerset won the bowl-out 5–1, with Ben Phillips, Peter Trego and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice.|$|E
5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed <b>no</b> <b>play</b> over nineyards until late in the drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
5|$|In each {{of their}} {{following}} two matches, at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire, Somerset batted first and then enforced the follow-on after bowling their opponents out cheaply. In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat, and both matches resulted in draws. During the Worcestershire match, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman's total of 28,067 first-class runs to become the highest-scoring Australian batsman. Successive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title. <b>No</b> <b>play</b> was possible on {{the third and fourth}} days, and the match resulted in another draw, leaving Somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, meant that Durham clinched the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth draw in a row in the competition), and finished third in the first division.|$|E

5|$|The third {{innings of}} the match gave Kimberley a second attempt at batting on the first day; they lost wickets {{regularly}} through the afternoon, but opener Tancred remained at the crease throughout, finishing the day unbeaten on 55, with the team on 100 for six. The match resumed on Monday 7 April 1890, with <b>no</b> <b>play</b> scheduled for the Sunday. After the early loss of Rose-Innes for 20 runs, Charles Rutherfoord joined Tancred. The pair scored 97 runs together, taking the score up to 226. Three quick wickets then ended the Kimberley innings; they scored 235 runs from 83 overs, in which Tancred scored a century, hitting 106 runs before being leg before wicket to Bowden. Vintcent took the most wickets for Transvaal, claiming four for 70. Smith claimed two wickets, and Bowden, who was designed on the scorecard as the team's wicket-keeper also claimed two wickets from the three overs that he bowled.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, Mold was {{qualified}} for Lancashire and was expected by critics {{to make an}} impact. At the time, Lancashire had no fast bowler in their team, making Mold potentially an important player. He made his first-class debut for the county in a three-day match against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) starting on 9 May 1889, taking one wicket in a drawn game. Throughout {{the rest of the}} season, Mold impressed critics. After a slow start in unhelpful conditions and unsuitable playing surfaces for his type of bowling, he took a total of 33 wickets in four consecutive games and established a reputation as the fastest bowler in England. His best performance statistically was seven for 35 against Yorkshire County Cricket Club, in a match during which he took 13 wickets, but he was successful in other high-profile matches. In all games against county opposition, Mold took 80 wickets at an average of 11.69; in all first-class matches he took 102 wickets at an average of 11.81. This placed him third in the national bowling averages. Although less successful in 1890, he took 118 wickets in first-class games at 14.72, which was 11th in the averages. His best figures, nine for 41, once more came against Yorkshire, and he helped Lancashire to second place in the first official County Championship. Mold came close to playing for England when he was included in the squad to play in the third Test match against Australia, but the match was abandoned owing to rain and <b>no</b> <b>play</b> took place.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings and were {{strongly}} placed on 174/3 {{at the end}} of the third day, an overall lead of 316 with seven wickets in hand. They had been aided by several dropped chances against Cyril Washbrook, who reached 85 by the close of play. However, rain meant that <b>no</b> <b>play</b> was possible on the fourth day and England did not have the opportunity to capitalise on their favourable position and set Australia a high runchase. Yardley declared on the final morning, but play did not start until mid-afternoon due to continuing inclement weather. The Australian batsman thereafter played for a draw; they batted slowly and reached 92/1 when stumps were drawn, not making an attempt to chase the 317 for victory. Arthur Morris made 54 not out, his second half-century of the match to go with his 51 in the first innings, registering Australia's top-score on both occasions. Despite the fact that 30% of the playing time was lost to rain, the match still managed to set a record for the highest attendance at a Test match in England, surpassing the mark set in the previous Test.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but <b>no</b> <b>play</b> was possible due to bad weather, and so the match {{was moved to the}} following day. The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a no ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete {{at the end of the}} over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.|$|E
