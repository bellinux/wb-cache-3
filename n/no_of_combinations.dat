The purpose of the present investigation was to test the usefulness of the demonstration of urinary fungal immunoglobulins and complement in distinguishing patients with fungal cystitis from those with suspected disseminated fungal disease. Twenty-one patients with microscopic funguria were suspected clinically of having disseminated fungal infection. Urine specimens from these patients were tested for the presence of antibody- and complement-coated fungi by direct immunofluorescence with the use of specific goat antisera to human immunoglobulins and complement. <b>No</b> unexpected frequencies <b>of</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> urinary yeast staining by specific antibody were noted. Urine specimens demonstrating funguria from 12 patients with uncomplicated illnesses were also examined for the presence of antibody- and complement-coated fungi; <b>no</b> unexpected frequencies <b>of</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> urinary yeast staining were noted in this group and no differences in frequencies of specific antibody staining were noted when compared with results in patients with suspected invasive fungal disease. Thus, no difference in the occurrence of specific antibody or complement adsorbed to urinary yeasts was observed between patients suspected of having invasive fungal disease and a small group of control patients...|$|R

The inhibition of expression of NOS- 3 corresponded with a reduced production <b>of</b> <b>NO.</b> A <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> hypoxia with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, interleukin 1 beta, or tumor necrosis factor alpha augmented both effects.

30|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature failed to identify evidence with a low risk of bias in critically ill neutropenic patients. Neutropenic critically ill patients with fever or suspicion of sepsis should be considered at high risk of severe infection and receive an empirical antibiotic therapy including an antipseudomonal β-lactam agent with activity against gram-positive bacteria [2]. In these patients, systematic use <b>of</b> <b>combination</b> therapy with aminoglycosides remains speculative. In a {{systematic review}} focused on the general neutropenic patient population, Paul et al. [125] found <b>no</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>combination</b> therapy in terms of mortality. In addition, combination therapy was associated with an increased rate of renal toxicity [125]. Little information was available with regard to the more severe cases, however. Two low-level evidence studies specifically demonstrated a potential benefit of aminoglycosides in critically ill patients with neutropenia and severe sepsis and/or septic shock [126, 127]. Although experts therefore recommend using combination therapy in this specific subgroup, they also underline the need for studies producing high-grade evidence in this setting.|$|R
