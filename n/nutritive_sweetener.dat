40|$|Nonnutritive {{sweeteners}} (NNS) are ecologically novel chemosensory signaling {{compounds that}} influence ingestive processes and behavior. Only about 15 % of the US population aged > 2 y ingest NNS, but the incidence is increasing. These sweeteners {{have the potential}} to moderate sugar and energy intakes while maintaining diet palatability, but their use has increased in concert with BMI in the population. This association may be coincidental or causal, and either mode of directionality is plausible. A critical review of the literature suggests that the addition of NNS to non-energy-yielding products may heighten appetite, but this is not observed under the more common condition in which NNS is ingested in conjunction with other energy sources. Substitution of NNS for a <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweetener</b> generally elicits incomplete energy compensation, but evidence of long-term efficacy for weight management is not available. The addition of NNS to diets poses no benefit for weight loss or reduced weight gain without energy restriction. There are long-standing and recent concerns that inclusion of NNS in the diet promotes energy intake and contributes to obesity. Most of the purported mechanisms by which this occurs are not supported by the available evidence, although some warrant further consideration. Resolution of this important issue will require long-term randomized controlled trials...|$|E
40|$|Sweeteners elicit pleasurable sensations with (nutritive) {{or without}} (nonnutritive) energy. <b>Nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> (eg, sucrose, fructose) are {{generally}} recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), yet concern exists about increasing sweetener intakes relative to optimal nutrition and health. Dietary quality suffers at intakes above 25 % of total energy (the Institutes of Medicine’s suggested maximal intake level). In the United States, estimated intakes of <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> fall below this, although {{one in four}} children (ages 9 to 18 years) can surpass this level. Polyols (sugar alcohols), GRASaffirmed or petitions filed for GRAS, add sweetness with reduced energy and functional properties to foods/ beverages and promote dental health. Five nonnutritive sweeteners with intense sweetening power have FDA approval (acesulfame-K, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose) and estimated intakes below the Acceptable Daily Intake (level that a person can safely consume everyday over a lifetime without risk). By increasing palatability of nutrient-dense foods/ beverages, sweeteners can promote diet healthfulness. Scientific evidence supports neither that intakes of <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> by themselves increase the risk of obesity nor that <b>nutritive</b> or nonnutritive <b>sweeteners</b> cause behavioral disorders. However, <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> increase risk of dental caries. High fructose intakes may cause hypertriglyceridemia and gastrointestinal symptoms in susceptible individuals.

40|$|Cues {{that have}} been paired with food evoke {{dopamine}} in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and drive approach behavior. This cue-evoked dopamine signaling could contribute to overconsumption of food. One manner in which individuals try to restrict caloric intake is through the consumption of foods containing artificial (non-nutritive) sweeteners. We were interested in whether cues paired with a non-nutritive sweetener (saccharin) would evoke similar dopamine release as cues paired with a <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweetener</b> (sucrose). We trained food-restricted rats to associate distinct cues with sucrose or saccharin pellets. In {{the first group of}} rats, training sessions with each pellet took place on different days, maximizing the opportunity for rats to detect nutritional differences. After training, voltammetry recordings in NAc core revealed that sucrose cues evoked greater phasic dopamine release than saccharin cues. In a second group of rats, on each training day, sucrose and saccharin pellets were presented in pseudorandom order within the same session, to mask nutritional differences. In this condition, the difference in dopamine between sucrose and saccharin cues was attenuated, but not abolished. These results suggest that sucrose-paired cues will more powerfully motivate behavior than saccharin-paired cues. The differing responses to each cue seem to be driven by overall preference with both the nutritional value that the pellets predict as well as other factors, such as taste, contributing.

Professional clinical management of caries has been very successful in cases of different severities of disease manifestations. However, tertiary management of this disease has been gaining attention, with numerous methods and agents emerging on a daily basis. Higher intake of <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> can result in higher energy intake and lower diet quality and thereby predispose an individual to conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Non-nutritive sweeteners have gained popularity as they are sweeter and are required in substantially lesser quantities. Xylitol, a five-carbon sugar polyol, {{has been found to be}} promising in reducing dental caries disease and also reversing the process of early caries. This paper throws light on the role and effects of various forms of xylitol on dental caries and oral hygiene status of an individual. Keywords: xylitol, caries preventive effect, oral flora ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, non <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> {{that can}} {{substitute}} for sucrose (high in calorie) cause increased {{the prevalence of}} overweight children and adults. Non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners as tools for making healthful food choices have been introduced to satisfy consumer demand. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of stevia sweetener as a substitute sucrose at different doses (25, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg b. wt/day) for twelve weeks on the weight management and on several hematological and biochemical parameters of female rats. The results showed significant improvement and ameliorated reduction in final bodyweight, body weights gain (%) (BWG) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) in the stevia sweetener groups compared with the control. Stevia sweetener at 500 mg/kg b. wt/day helps in weight loss of rats, decrement in the total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein concentration, increment in the high-density lipoprotein and no significant differences in mean serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or acid phosphatase (ACP) levels as compared to the control rats, which may be considered as therapeutic beneficial. Also, this dose may be considered as a safe dose for people with diabetes, especially the many individuals who need to lose weight to help control their blood glucose levels...|$|R
40|$|The food {{industry}} {{is looking at}} possibilities to reduce, amongst others, the amount of sugar in food. Sugar can be replaced by sweeteners. The intake of artificial, non <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> of young Dutch children was estimated and compared to the health limit (ADI). An ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) {{is the amount of}} a food additive, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which can be ingested daily throughout life without causing additional health risks. The most commonly used sweeteners were examined, namely acesulfame-K (E 950), aspartame (E 951), cyclamate (E 952), saccharin (E 954) and sucralose (E 955). In the Netherlands, almost all 2 - 6 year old children were exposed to these artificial sweeteners. The assessment showed that the ADIs for these sweeteners were not exceeded. Given the rising trend in adding sweeteners to foods and drinks, it is important to continue monitoring the intake of sweeteners periodically. Children are often simultaneously exposed to multiple sweeteners. In such cases interactions cannot be excluded and thus, a combined exposure to amounts of sweeteners below the individual ADIs may not be assumed to be safe in all cases. Further research is needed into the effects of mixtures of artificial sweeteners...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{research}} from the USA has demonstrated {{a positive relationship between}} sugars consumption and prevalence of obesity; however, the relationship in other nations is not well described. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the trends in obesity and sugar consumption in Australia over the past 30 years and to compare and contrast obesity trends and sugar consumption patterns in Australia with the UK and USA. Data on consumption of sugar in Australia, the UK and USA were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization for the years 1980 - 2003. The prevalence of obesity has increased 3 fold in Australians since 1980. In Australia, the UK and USA, per capita consumption of refined sucrose decreased by 23 %, 10 % and 20 % respectively from 1980 to 2003. When all sources of <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> including high fructose corn syrups, were considered, per capita consumption decreased in Australia (− 16 %) and the UK (− 5 %), but increased in the USA (+ 23 %). In Australia, there was a reduction in sales of nutritively sweetened beverages by 64 million liters from 2002 to 2006 and a reduction in percentage of children consuming sugar-sweetened beverages between 1995 and 2007. The findings confirm an “Australian Paradox”-a substantial decline in refined sugars intake over the same timeframe that obesity has increased. The implication is that efforts to reduce sugar intake may reduce consumption but may not reduce the prevalence of obesity...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{determined}} {{the effect of}} <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> at 0 to 0. 50 moles/kg on lipid oxidation in a model cookie system. Confocal microscopy using Bodipy 493 as a fat soluble dye showed that the fat formed a continuous phase surrounding the starch granules regardless of sugar type. The impact of glucose concentration on lipid oxidation was monitored by lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal during storage at 55 °C. Low concentrations of glucose (0. 09) were strong inhibitors. At equal molar concentrations, reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) inhibited lipid oxidation, greater than a two months increase in lag phase compared to the control. Sucrose inhibited lipid oxidation, but to a much lesser extent than reducing sugars. The inhibition of lipid oxidation is potentially due to sugar’s ability to bind water. Additionally, reducing sugars may exhibit this effect due {{to their ability to}} act as a hydrogen donor which could inactivate free radicals or due to the production of Maillard reaction products (MRPs). For example, the l-values were lower and b-values were higher for cookies with non-reducing sugars compared to cookies with sucrose indicating that there were more MRPs. The addition of cysteine, sulfites, and ascorbic acid acted as a strong browning inhibitors however cysteine was showed to be antioxidative. When compared to synthetic antioxidants, glucose proved to be a strong natural alternative.

40|$|The homeostatic {{regulation}} of food intake {{is one of}} the most pressing challenges to an organism. Certain foods may, unpredictably, provide either an overabundance or a deficit of energy and nutrients. The present series of experiments examines the influence of associations between taste stimuli and nutritive or nonnutritive consequences on food intake and body weight regulation following both short- and long-term exposure to such diets. ^ The first set of experiments examines whether consuming artificial sweeteners impairs caloric regulation. The ability of the animals to compensate for the calories contained in sweet-tasting foods is predicted to be impaired following experience with diets in which sweet tastes inconsistently predicted the caloric value of the diet compared to the animals that received food that were always sweet tasting and always had associated caloric consequences. Results suggest that animals given experience with <b>nutritive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> (glucose and sucrose) sometimes and non-nutritive sweeteners (saccharin) sometimes are less able to regulate food intake following a preload challenge during a 24 -h intake test compared to animals that always receive the sweet, nutritive diet.

The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|R
