40|$|We {{examined}} voluntary-falling behaviour by adult {{females of}} the {{two-spotted spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{and one of its}} major predators <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> <b>McGregor</b> (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Experiments were conducted using a setup in which mites could only move onto one of two landing points by falling. Significantly more T. urticae females fell onto available food leaves compared to non-food or heavily infested leaves, whereas significantly fewer females fell onto leaves with the predatory mite N. californicus compared to leaves without the predator. This suggests that spider mites can actively choose on which patch to land on the basis of food quality and predation risk on the patch. Using the same experimental setup, starved N. californicus females never fell, suggesting that falling T. urticae females gain the potential advantage of predator avoidance...|$|E

The total development period (egg to adult) decreased linearly with increasing temperature (0. 012 × T – 0. 093; R 2 = 0. 950). The total development threshold obtained from regression analysis {{was estimated to be}} 7. 8 °C. <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> required, on average, 83. 3 DD to complete its development from egg to adult. Mean total and daily fecundity were highest at 25 °C, and were statistically different from those obtained at 20 and 30 °C. The net reproductive rate (R 0) was highest at 25 °C (42. 92 Â/Â). The longest mean generation period (T 0) occurred at 20 °C (12. 96 days) and the shortest occurred at 30 °C (10. 12 days). The highest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) for N. californicus was observed at 25 °C (0. 3373 Â/Â/day) and the lowest was at 20 °C (0. 2467 Â/Â/day). The numbers of T. cinnabarinus eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adult males eaten by N. californicus were significantly different between prey densities. Regardless of prey density, N. californicus consumed more eggs and larvae than nymphs and adult males.

40|$|Typhlodromips montdorensis is a {{non-native}} {{predatory mite}} used {{for control of}} red spider mite and thrips, but is not yet licensed {{for use in the}} UK. Current legislation requires that non-native glasshouse biological control agents may not be introduced into the UK without a risk assessment of establishment potential outside of the glasshouse environment. This work focuses on the application of a recently developed protocol to assess the establishment potential of T. montdorensis in the UK. Further, the use of alternative prey outside the glasshouse by, Macrolophus caliginosus is examined, and interactions between <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus,</b> Typhlodromus pyri and T. montdorensis are investigated. Laboratory results demonstrate that T. montdorensis has a developmental threshold of 10. 7 °C, lacks cold tolerance and is unable to enter diapause when tested under two different regimes. Field studies indicate that no reproduction occurs within the field in winter (November to March) and 100 % mortality of eggs, larvae and adults occurs within two weeks of release during this period. It is suggested that T. montdorensis would be a ‘safe candidate’ for introduction as a glasshouse biological control agent in the UK as outdoor establishment is unlikely to occur. Macrolophus caliginosus is able to feed and reproduce on Trialeurodes vaporariorum, Myzus persicae and Aleyrodes proletella although performance (lower fecundity and longevity) is reduced on the latter prey source. Both N. californicus and T. pyri were able to feed on larval stages of each other but when given a mixed diet, showed a preference for Tetranychus urticae over their phytoseiid prey. <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> showed a preference for T. urticae over T. montdorensis, whereas the latter species showed no preference between T. urticae and N. californicus.

Second, we compared the avoidance behavior of adult female N. californicus and two spider mite species (T. urticae, a lower leaf surface user; Panonychus citri, an upper leaf surface user) in response to solar UV and visible light. N. californicus actively avoided both types of radiation, whereas P. citri showed only minimal avoidance behavior. T. urticae actively avoided UV as well as N. californicus but exhibited a slow response to visible light as well as P. citri.

Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, dinocap, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenbutatin oxide and propargite were innocuous to N. californicus.

Con-versely, fresh and cold stored N. californicus employed three different modes of predatory attack: (1) intercepting and attacking migrant O. perseae outside of web nests; (2) attacking prey through nest webbing; or (3) invading and attacking O. perseae inside nests. Predatory efficacy of both N. californi-cus and G. helveolus was reduced following cold storage, as both species engaged in certain predatory behaviors less frequently in comparison to predators that were not stored at low temperatures. Our ob-served results for N. californicus and G. helveolus attacking O. perseae are interpreted {{in relation to the}} chaetotaxy hypothesis, which proposes that phytoseiid invasion efficiency and propensity of webbed nests is facilitated by dorsal setal lengths...|$|E
40|$|Prenatal or {{embryonic}} learning, {{behavioral change}} following experience made prior to birth, may have significant consequences for postnatal foraging {{behavior in a}} wide variety of animals, including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and molluscs. However, prenatal learning has not been previously shown in arthropods such as insects, spiders and mites. We examined prenatal chemosensory learning in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus.</b> We exposed these predators in the embryonic stage to two flavors (vanillin or anisaldehyde) or no flavor (neutral) by feeding their mothers on spider mite prey enriched with these flavors or not enriched with any flavor (neutral). After the predators reached the protonymphal stage, we assessed their prey choice through residence and feeding preferences in experiments, in which they were offered spider mites matching the maternal diet (neutral, vanillin or anisaldehyde spider mites) and non-matching spider mites. Predator protonymphs preferentially resided in the vicinity of spider mites matching the maternal diet irrespective of the type of maternal diet and choice situation. Across treatments, the protonymphs preferentially fed on spider mites matching the maternal diet. Prey and predator sizes did not differ among neutral, vanillin and anisaldehyde treatments, excluding the hypothesis that size-assortative predation influenced the outcome of the experiments. Our study reports the first example of prenatal learning in arthropods...|$|R
40|$|From 2013 2015, {{the release}} and {{establishment}} of predatory mites {{for the control}} of two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae, was conducted in five hop gardens of The species compared were the autochthonous mites Typhlodromus pyri, Amblyseius andersoni and a mix of the two allochthonous species <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> and phytoseiulus persimilis. Main objective was {{the establishment of a}} permanent population of T. pyri in a hop garden by providing the predators with structures for their hibernation by undersown crops. We chose seeding of tall fescue Festuca arundinacea, a grassland seed mixture and strawberries as an intercrop in the wheel lanes. During the three project years, 15 trials were conducted of which however only two yielded meaningful results. We found that the cheapest and most effective way to release T. pyri in hops is the transfer of vine cuttings gathered during the pruning of vines in late winter. Besides, the mixture of P. persimilis and N. californicus proved to be very effective. During samplings of the undersown crop of tall fescue in spring, predatory mites were recorded in low numbers. This is evidence that tall fescue can serve as a hibernation quarter for predatory mites. More studies are however needed to give more detailed answers to this thematic constellation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Species at {{the same}} trophic level may {{interact}} through competition for food, but can also interact through intraguild predation. Intraguild predation is widespread at {{the second and third}} trophic level and the effects may cascade down to the plant level. The effects of intraguild predation can be modified by antipredator behaviour in the intraguild prey. We studied intraguild predation and antipredator behaviour in two species of predatory mite, <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> and Phytoseiulus persimilis, which are both used for control of the two-spotted spider mite in greenhouse and outdoor crops. Using a Y-tube olfactometer, we assessed in particular whether each of the two predators avoids odours emanating from prey patches occupied by the heterospecific predator. Furthermore, we measured the occurrence and rate of intraguild predation of different developmental stages of P. persimilis and N. californicus on bean leaves in absence or in presence of the shared prey. Neither of the two predator species avoided prey patches with the heterospecific competitor, both when inexperienced with the other predator and when experienced with prey patches occupied by the heterospecific predator. Intraguild experiments showed that N. californicus is a potential intraguild predator of P. persimilis. However, P. persimilis did not suffer much from intraguild predation as long as the shared prey was present. This is probably because N. californicus prefers to feed on two-spotted spider mites rather than on its intraguild prey...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{control is}} not common in citrus {{nurseries}} where chemical control is prevalent. The systemic neonicotinoid imidacloprid applied as a drench is effective against {{three out of}} four key pests of young clementine plants in Spain – aphids, whiteflies, and scales. However, mites, the fourth key pest, are not control by imidacloprid and could be regulated by introduction of the predatory Phytoseiid mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> (<b>McGregor).</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of imidacloprid applied as a drench on the demographic parameters of these two predatory mites and the compatibility of P. persimilis releases with imidacloprid to control key pest populations in young clementine plants under field conditions. The results showed that some demographic parameters of P. persimilis were affected by imidacloprid. However, their combined effect on its intrinsic rate of increase was neutral. In contrast, imidacloprid negatively affected the demographic parameters of N. californicus. Field results proved that young clementine plants could be satisfactorily protected against key pests with releases of P. persimilis combined with drench applications of imidacloprid. The combination of imidacloprid with P. persimilis releases was highly effective for management of the key pests of young clementine plants in the nursery...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{determine}} the residual toxicity of the main pesticides used in citrus, on <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> (<b>McGregor)</b> under laboratory conditions. For this, it was used the residual contact bioassay. Citrus leaves of the variety Pêra were sprayed in a Potter tower. The residual action was evaluated at 2 hours and 1; 3; 5; 7; 10; 14 e 21 days after treatment. Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, dinocap, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenbutatin oxide and propargite were innocuous to N. californicus. On the other hand, abamectin, azocyclotin e cyhexatin caused mortalities of 29. 8; 32. 0 e 34. 1 %, respectively, two hours after transference. Dicofol, pyridaben and chlorfenapyr were extremely toxic to the predator mite, causing 100 % of mortality two hours after the application. This way, to this population of N. californicus, the releases can be performed safely 3 days after the application, except for cyhexatin (5 days), dicofol and pyridaben (14 days) and chlorfenapyr (21 days), without risk of significant adult mortality rates due to the application of pesticides...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar os efeitos secundários dos principais agrotóxicos utilizados em macieira sobre adultos e imaturos de <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> (<b>McGregor)</b> (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Os testes foram conduzidos em laboratório, utilizando as doses dos produtos recomendadas para a cultura e o método de contato e {{residual}} com pulverização em superfície de folha. Foram testados tebufenozida, fosmete, metidationa, clorpirifós, abamectina, fenpiroximato, piridabem, captana, mancozebe (duas dosagens) e ditianona. Para o cálculo do efeito total (E%) sobre os adultos, avaliaram-se a mortalidade, a oviposição e a viabilidade dos ovos, e para os imaturos, somente a mortalidade. Os resultados do E% foram avaliados 96 horas após a pulverização. Os produtos foram classificados quanto ao efeito total (E%) de toxicidade proposta pela IOBC/WPRS. Fosmete, tebufenozida e metidationa foram inócuos; abamectina, fenpiroximato, clorpirifós, captana, mancozebe (nas duas dosagens testadas) e ditianona foram levemente nocivos, e piridabem foi moderadamente nocivo aos adultos de N. californicus. O fungicida mancozebe, na maior dosagem (320 g,i. a. / 100 L), foi o que mais afetou o ácaro predador. Quanto à seletividade dos agrotóxicos aos imaturos, constatouse que abamectina e piridabem foram moderadamente nocivos, e os demais foram inócuos. Nenhum produto foi classificado como nocivo, evidenciando a tolerância de N. californicus a estes agrotóxicos. Estes resultados permitem uma escolha e manejo mais adequado para os agrotóxicos utilizados nos pomares comerciais de macieira, de forma que a presença deste ácaro predador exerça pressão de controle do ácaro-vermelho. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the side effects of the main pesticides used in adult and immature <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> (<b>McGregor)</b> (Acari: Phytoseiidae). The tests were carried out in the laboratory by using the contact and residual spraying method on the leaf surface. It was tested tebufenozide, phosmet, methidation, chlorpyrifos, abamectin, fenpyroximate, pyridaben, captan, mancozeb (two concentrations) and dithianon. To calculate the total effect (E%) on the adults, it was evaluated the mortality, oviposition and viability of eggs, and for the immature ones, only the mortality. The results of E% were assessed 96 hours after the spraying. The products were classified considering the total effect (E%) of toxicity proposed by the IOBC/WPRS. Phosmet, tebufenozide and methidation were innocuous; abamectin, fenpyroximate, chlorpyrifos, captan, mancozeb (two concentrations), and dithianon were slightly harmful, and pyridaben was moderately harmful to the N. californicus adults. As the pesticide selectivity for the immature ones, it was verified that abamectin and pyridaben were moderately harmful, and the others were innocuous. The treatment with 320 g. a. i. / 100 l of mancozeb was the most harmful to N. californicus. No product has been classified as harmful to N. californicus, showing tolerance to these pesticides. These results allow a choice and a more adequate handling for the pesticides used in commercial orchards of apple trees, so that the presence of this mite predator has ability to control red mite...|$|E
40|$|Conservation and augmentative {{biological}} control strategies {{have been developed}} {{to take full advantage of}} the natural enemies that occur in Spanish citrus orchards. Among them, the predatory mites Euseius stipulatus, <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> and Phytoseiulus persimilis play an important role in the {{biological control}} of tetranychid mites. However, these predatory mites are often affected by pesticides and information about the side-effects of these products against these beneficial arthropods is essential to guarantee their efficacy. The side-effects of some pesticides remain unknown and the primary aim of this study was to fill this gap. We have further used this information and that collected from other sources to compare the response of these three mite species to pesticides. Based on this information, E. stipulatus has the most tolerant species, followed by N. californicus and P. persimilis. Therefore, using E. stipulatus as an indicator species in citrus may have led to the paradox of selecting presumed selective pesticides resulting in excessive impact on N. californicus and, especially on P. persimilis. Because these two latter species are considered key for the biological control of T. urticae in citrus, especially clementines, in Spain, we propose to use P. persimilis as the relevant indicator of such effects on predacious mites occurring in citrus instead of E. stipulatus. This change could have a dramatic impact on the satisfactory control of tetranychid mites in citrus in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} time, {{survival and}} fecundity of Amblyseius <b>californicus</b> (<b>McGregor),</b> a predatory mite in deciduous fruit orchards, were determined at 20, 25 and 30 °C. Using these values the intrinsic {{rate of increase}} (r(m)), mean generation time (T) and net replacement rate (R 0) were estimated at the respective temperatures. In addition, the data were used to estimate the minimum temperature required for development. The r(m) increased with increasing temperature from 0. 122 at 20 °C to 0. 251 at 30 °C. The R 0 was highest at 25 °C (11. 18 females/female) and was lower at 20 °C (9. 71 females/female) than at 30 °C (10. 54 females/female), while T decreased with increasing temperature from 20. 11 days at 20 °C to 10. 20 days at 30 °C. The estimated minimum temperature for development was 8. 3 °C, which indicates that A. californicus could survive the winter on plants in the covercrop in orchards and {{should be able to}} control populations of the phytophagous mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, at temperatures below 30 °C.

40|$|O controle biológico aplicado de Panonychus ulmi (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae) em macieira iniciou em Vacaria (RS), em 1992, com a multiplicação de <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> em estufas e liberação nas áreas de ocorrência da praga, fazendo com que o equilíbrio entre ambos os ácaros ocorresse semanas após a liberação. O presente trabalho teve o objetivo de verificar o efeito da densidade de N. californicus a ser liberada em pomar de macieira, Malus domestica (Borkh.) Mansf., para o controle do ácaro-vermelho. Foi selecionado um pomar {{comercial}} em Fraiburgo (SC) e liberados os fitoseídeos nas densidades de 50. 000, 100. 000 e 150. 000 por ha, originados da criação comercial situada na Renar Maçãs (Fraiburgo). O controle do ácaro foi medido através da injúria, devido à alimentação de P. ulmi, e avaliado por meio de uma escala de sintomas de bronzeamento, e do monitoramento de ovos hibernantes em maio, julho e setembro. O tratamento com 150. 000 fitoseídeos reduziu a população de ácaros- vermelhos após 16 dias da liberação, enquanto os demais tratamentos necessitaram de 21 dias. A injúria das folhas foi menor no tratamento com 150. 000. Os ovos hibernantes em maio, nas parcelas de 50. 000 e 100. 000, foram, respectivamente, 75 % e 69 % maiores do que na parcela com 150. 000 fitoseídeos. Concluiu-se que a liberação de 150. 000 N. californicus foi mais eficiente no controle de P. ulmi no estágio fenológico reprodutivo da macieira. The applied {{biological control}} of Panonychus ulmi in apple orchards in Brazil began in Vacaria (RS), in 1992 by rearing <b>Neoseiulus</b> <b>californicus</b> in greenhouses and releasing them into infested areas. The balance between both mites took place {{weeks after the}} release. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of N. californicus density {{to be released in}} apple orchards for the control of the red mite. A commercial orchard in Fraiburgo (SC) was chosen and populations of 50, 000, 100, 000 and 150, 000 phytoseiidae per ha were released. These populations were from the commercial breeding centre located at Renar Maçãs, in Fraiburgo. The damage, due to the feeding of P. ulmi was measured in terms of the range of brownish symptoms. The monitoring of hibernating eggs was carried out in May, July and September. The treatment with 150, 000 phytoseiidae reduced the population of red mite 16 days after the release, while the other treatments required three weeks. The damage to the leaves was less in the treatment with 150, 000 phytoseiidae. The monitoring of hibernating eggs using 50, 000 and 100, 000 phytoseiids/plot took place in May and it was 75 % and 69 % greater than in the plot using 150, 000 phytoseiidae. It can be concluded that the release of 150, 000 N. californicus was more efficient in the control of P. ulmi in the reproductive phenological stage of the apple tree...|$|R
