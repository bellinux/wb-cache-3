Cowley notes philosophical difficulties with each extreme, as they are argued by Sampson and Pinker: Sampson's version of the nurture position also argues for philosophical dualism; whereas Pinker's version of the nature position also argues for an ontological reality for syntax. Both these auxiliary arguments are unsatisfactory to many writers who address the relevant broader philosophical questions.|$|E
25|$|Some critics view {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a form}} of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that {{evolutionary psychology}} does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a <b>nature-nurture</b> interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.|$|E
30|$|There is {{one final}} point to {{consider}} here. In poor rural communities, {{where women are}} commonly subjected to intense field labor and lack access to modern health practices, there is a significantly higher frequency of miscarriages—and this too, we feel, contributes to the characterization of the womb as a grave. This high rate of tragedy is assuredly engraved deep into the psychologies of rural South Asian women (Mahbub ul 2005). 16 But the presence {{of death in the}} womb need not signify weakness, but rather, agency and power. Indeed, the darker side of the feminine, as it were, can be ultimately empowering for women to embrace since it resists portraying the sacred feminine in an overly reductive or romantic manner. Women and goddesses within a Hindu understanding represent at once a two-fold <b>nature—nurturing</b> and violent, beautiful and deadly, alluring and strong—and it is all the better that both sides of the coin are to be included.|$|R
500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well reviewed in biological journals. It received {{a much more}} mixed reaction among sociologists, mainly triggered by the brief coverage {{of the implications of}} sociobiology for human society in the first and last chapters of the book; the body of the text was largely welcomed. A review reached {{the front page of the}} New York Times, such was the level of interest in the debate. The sociologist Gerhard Lenski, admitting that sociologists needed to look further into non-human societies, agreed that human society was founded on biology but denied both biological reductionism and determinism. Lenski observed that since the <b>nature-nurture</b> dichotomy was false, there was no reason for sociologists and biologists to disagree. Other sociologists objected in particular to the final chapter, on [...] "Man": Devra G. Kleiman called Wilson's attempt to extend his thesis to humans weak and premature, and noted that he had largely overlooked the importance of co-operative behaviour and females in mammalian societies.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} of the 25th anniversary edition in 2000, the historians of biology Michael Yudell and Rob Desalle reviewed the <b>nature-nurture</b> controversy around the book. [...] "Once again", they wrote, [...] "biological reductionism and genetic determinism became the focus of rancorous debates, discussions and diatribes within both academia and popular culture." [...] They pointed out that the quest for a [...] "sociobiologization" [...] of biology was not new, mentioning Darwin's The Descent of Man, R.A. Fisher, and Julian Huxley, all touching on the biological basis of human society, followed by Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey in the 1960s, and Richard Dawkins and David Barash in the 1970s. Wilson's choice of title echoed the modern synthesis (named by Huxley in 1942) and, the reviewers argued, meant to build upon and extend it. 25 years on, they noted, most of the discord had gone, and the discipline had been renamed as evolutionary psychology; they were surprised to find that Wilson was happy with that, and they called the new discipline pop psychology for people [...] "who like telling just-so stories".|$|E
500|$|Gerhard Lenski, in Social Forces, {{admitted}} that sociologists had too often ignored non-human societies, and thought the book {{should be required}} reading. Human societies were plainly founded on biology, but this did not imply either biological reductionism or determinism. Comparison with other species would be productive, as nonhuman societies often had traditions handed down {{from one generation to}} the next, such as [...] "the flyways of migratory birds or dietary patterns among primates". Issues of conflict and cooperation were similarly illuminated. But in his view the book raised [...] "uncomfortable issues". The first chapter could sound, he argued, like [...] "intellectual imperialism" [...] as Wilson called sociology [...] "an essentially nontheoretical, descriptive science, not unlike taxonomy and ecology forty years ago, before they were 'reshaped entirely ... neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory'". Lenski however took Wilson more openly than that, noting Wilson's precursors, Julian Huxley, George Gaylord Simpson, Dobzhansky and others of the modern synthesis. They had tried repeatedly to talk to sociologists, and in Lenski's view that remained necessary. Further, he suggested, the <b>nature-nurture</b> dichotomy was evidently false, so there was no reason for sociologists and biologists to disagree. In his view, continued rejection of biology by sociologists only invited [...] "a reductionist response on the part of biologists." [...] Lenski found the final chapter on Man [...] "disappointing", as Wilson had been unable to penetrate the [...] "barriers" [...] put up by social science against the modern synthesis, and Wilson's overestimation of the influence of genetics compared to culture and technology on human society. All the same, Lenski thought these [...] "flaws" [...] could be mended by dialogue between sociology and biology.|$|E
2500|$|In Sense and Sensibility, for example, Elinor and Marianne {{represent}} [...] "the {{view of the}} <b>nature-nurture</b> dichotomy usually {{adopted by}} conservatives", that is, [...] "on the one hand, Marianne's way is subjective, intuitive, implying confidence in the natural goodness of human nature when untrammelled by convention. Her view is corrected by the more cautious orthodoxy of Elinor, who mistrusts her own desires, and requires even her reason to seek the support of objective evidence." [...] Duckworth argues that Austen's heroines aim [...] "to support and maintain an inherited structure of values and behavior", often with an explicit Christian stoicism. In his interpretation, Austen's heroines' morality is based in religious principle and duty to society. Austen's novels portray [...] "society" [...] positively, and her novels end with hero and heroine united {{in the company of}} true friends, society [...] "reaffirmed around the central union, and the social fragmentation that initially threatened... reconstituted through individual commitment into a new whole." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{authors of}} The Adapted Mind {{have argued that}} the SSSM is now out of date and that a {{progressive}} model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of <b>nature-nurture</b> interactionism, grounded in the computational theory of mind. Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{have pointed}} out that {{environmental}} inputs affect the expression of genes [...] (see the article on epigenetics). This is one explanation of how environment can influence {{the extent to which a}} genetic disposition will actually manifest. The interactions of genes with environment, called gene-environment interactions, are another component of the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate. A classic example of gene-environment interaction is the ability of a diet low in the amino acid phenylalanine to partially suppress the genetic disease phenylketonuria. Yet another complication to the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate is the existence of gene-environment correlations. These correlations indicate that individuals with certain genotypes are more likely to find themselves in certain environments. Thus, it appears that genes can shape (the selection or creation of) environments. Even using experiments like those described above, it can be very difficult to determine convincingly the relative contribution of genes and environment.|$|E
50|$|Kin {{recognition}} in some species {{may also be}} mediated by immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). For {{a discussion of the}} interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007). Some have suggested that, as applied to humans, this <b>nature-nurture</b> interactionist perspective allows a synthesis between theories and evidence of social bonding and cooperation across the fields of evolutionary biology, psychology (attachment theory) and cultural anthropology (nurture kinship).|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{argue that}} {{many cases of}} {{corrective}} rape are caused by drawing moral conclusions from the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate. Despite the scientific community believing that sexual orientation {{is the result of}} biology and environment, many people do not believe that homosexuality (or other forms of non-heterosexuality) has a genetic basis and instead believe it is only the result of one's environment. Because of this, some of these people believe sexual orientation can be changed, or in this case, fixed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} view {{expertise}} is {{a characteristic of}} individuals and {{is a consequence of}} the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the nature and nurture argument. Some factors not fitting the <b>nature-nurture</b> dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.|$|E
5000|$|Social {{constructionism}} falls {{toward the}} nurture {{end of the}} spectrum of the larger nature and nurture debate. Consequently, critics have argued that it generally ignores biological influences on behaviour or culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour. The view of most psychologists and social scientists is that behaviour is a complex outcome of both biological and cultural influences. [...] Other disciplines, such as evolutionary psychology, behaviour genetics, behavioural neuroscience, epigenetics, etc., take a <b>nature-nurture</b> interactionism approach to understand behaviour or cultural phenomena.|$|E

50|$|In 2017, {{his newest}} book, The Genome Factor: What the Social Genomics Revolution Reveals About Ourselves, Our History and the Future (Princeton University Press), coauthored with Jason Fletcher, will be released.

Now that many large scale social surveys collect genetic data, {{researchers}} who study behavior and social life can obtain a complete picture of how the forces of genetics and the environment interact to produce human outcomes. Conley and Fletcher address topics ranging from the role of genes in social mobility, genetic and social assortative mating, the difference between race and genetic ancestry and the potential rise of a genotocracy as foreshadowed by the 1997 film, Gattaca.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, he {{introduced}} {{a television show}} called Hjernevask ("Brainwashing") which contrasted cultural determinist models of human behavior (also {{referred to as the}} Standard social science model) with <b>nature-nurture</b> interactionist perspectives. Several of those who were interviewed for the show criticized the show publicly {{both before and after the}} airing, and this ignited a wide public discussion on the subject of the nature versus nurture debate. Specially the question of gender, and what is referred to as the gender paradox (the fact that although Norwegian women have a high level of participation within the workforce, more so than most countries, the Norwegian job market remains highly segregated in terms of gender) has provoked controversy.|$|E
5000|$|Central to the Adlerian {{approach}} is to see the personality {{as a whole and}} not as the mere net result of component forces. Thus the term individual (indivisible) psychology. Adlerians adopt a radical stance that cuts across the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate by seeing the developing individual at work in creating the personality in response to the demands of nature and nurture but not absolutely determined by them. The self-created personality operates subjectively and idiosyncratically. The individual is endowed with a striving both for self-development and social meaning - what Adler himself called [...] "the concept of social usefulness and the general well-being of humanity" [...] - expressed in a sense of belonging, usefulness and contribution, and even cosmic consciousness.|$|E

50|$|He deemed his slogan to be {{not more}} babies but better brought up babies. Watson argued for the nurture side of the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate, {{claiming}} {{that the world would}} benefit from extinguishing pregnancies for twenty years while enough data was gathered to ensure an efficient child-rearing process. Further emphasizing nurture, Watson said that nothing is instinctual; rather everything is built into a child through the interaction with their environment. Parents therefore hold complete responsibility since they choose what environment to allow their child to develop in. Laura E. Berk, author of Infants and Children: Prenatal Through Middle Childhood, examined the roots of the beliefs Watson came to honor. Berk says that the experiment with Little Albert inspired Watson’s emphasis on environmental factors. Little Albert did not fear the rat and white rabbit until he was conditioned to do so. From this experiment, Watson concluded that parents can shape a child’s behavior and development simply by a scheming control of all stimulus-response associations.|$|E
5000|$|In the introduction, Symons {{argues that}} modern {{understandings}} of [...] "natural selection" [...] and [...] "fitness" [...] are value free, the latter term measuring reproductive success rather than referring to human value judgments, {{that is necessary}} to distinguish between proximate and ultimate explanations of animal behavior, the former being concerned with how animals come to develop behavior patterns, and the latter with why they develop these patterns, that while a feature of structure or behavior may benefit an animal, only features that result from natural selection should be considered functions, that the persistence of the <b>nature-nurture</b> controversy is partly the result of failing to distinguish between proximate and ultimate causation, that learning abilities are more often concerned with specific problems than they are the expression of general capacities, and that the secondary sex differences that exist in animals of most species are the consequences the different reproductive behaviors of males and females.|$|E

Concerning the anniversary edition, they thought it strange that nothing worth adding had happened in 25 years: the book remained a primary text, and failing to develop it weakened the edition's impact. The early chapters still seemed a [...] "lucid and engaging" [...] introduction to population biology, but much of the rest seemed after 25 years to lack [...] "methodological breadth", given that it did not cover the new fields that had emerged; while barely mentioning the growing importance of phylogenetic systematics seemed [...] "curious".

The reviewers were also troubled by Wilson's attitude to the debate, remaining [...] "contemptuous of his anti-sociobiological opposition" [...] and [...] "opprobrium towards Marxism" [...] (especially Gould and Lewontin). Yudell and Desalle note the irony that Wilson despises Marxism but advocates an [...] "aggressive paradigm ... seeking to blaze an historical path towards the future" [...] (as Marxism did).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} and passionate debates in sports science concerns {{the relative importance of}} genes (i. e., nature) and environment (i. e., nurture) on human behaviour. This debate has considerable relevance for understanding athletic performance and exercise behaviours. The purpose of this position paper is to provide a synopsis of current evidence regarding the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate and to consider the implications of this research for researchers in sport science and medicine. To this end, we begin by providing a historical overview of the <b>nature-nurture</b> debate before reviewing current evidence for the influence of nature and nurture on variability in sports performance. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the influence of genes on phenotypes of complex systems is context-based which provides a challenge for understanding the role of variants of single genes in shaping behaviour. For this reason, the dualist approach of nature versus nurture is inadequate to account for the complexity of the interactions between these factors and advocate an approach that considers a more dynamic, interactive relationship...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{remarkable}} and puzzling fact that, for over a century, psychological and biological research have been exploring the development and functional characterization of brain/mind activity in almost totally separate and non-interactive ways. It cannot be denied, however, that the human brain {{is the result of}} evolution in the brains of other mammals. The subcortical structures of mammals present anatomical, neurochemical and functional homologies, and these suggest largely similar mechanisms for emotion, perception and action. One {{of the reasons for the}} lack of concern by experimental psychologists with biological issues may derive from a premature, and thus largely sterile, <b>nature-nurture</b> controversy. While it was difficult in the recent past to understand how genes might interact with the environment in expressing themselves, the notion of epigenetic development is now better understood in its precise mechanisms, although much remains to be discovered. 1 The <b>nature-nurture</b> controversy, however, has overshadowed other important points.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a historical {{view of the}} study of the brain and its relationship to intelligence, and human behavior, from Hipocrates and Alcmeon of Crotona to present days. This historical view briefly contemplates the thesis of Bell, Mangedie, Flourens, Galvani, and Gall. The importance of the neuron, neural networks, and environment is highlighted. These general principle of <b>nature-nurture</b> interactions means that the brain is both an independent (causal) variable and a dependent (outcome) variable. That is, brain is an organ that allows an organism to act on the environment and that can be changed in constrained ways as the organism interacts with the environment. In this way, teacher are an important influence on the nurture side of the <b>nature-nurture</b> interaction for learning. Finally, five functional neuroimaging studies, that have been published recently, are presented. These studies showed that neural deficitsin children with reading difficulties are ameliorated by behavioral remediations.

Probably, in the future these studies will be a useful way to early identification and treatment of reading difficulties...|$|E
