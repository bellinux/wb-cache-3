5|$|The {{means by}} which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into {{radiation}} remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 {{there was still no}} generally accepted model for how this process occurs. Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging is the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays. Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123 and to GRB 080319B, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra, have suggested that inverse Compton may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{details of}} how the Pythia {{operated}} are missing as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain.</b> Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories. One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock, and that she spoke gibberish which priests interpreted as the enigmatic prophecies and turned them into poetic dactylic hexameters preserved in Greek literature. This idea, however, has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio, who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly, and giving prophecies in her own voice. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC describes the Pythia speaking in dactylic hexameters.|$|E
25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory.

The integrated [...] "faceposer" [...] tool allowed Troika to customize facial animations, expressions, gestures and lip-synching, eliminating the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> what a character was doing. Every non-player character required a voiceover, which helped Troika define its characters more quickly. The engine had a physics system permitting new features, such as monsters hurling corpses at the player or dying characters realistically crumbling into pieces, instead of requiring pre-built animations. Although Troika had ignored first-person engines due to technical limitations, such as a low polygon count and limited texture memory, as the technology improved, it thought it could create a real-time action game without sacrificing the immersion and story of a role-playing game.|$|E
500|$|While [...] "money surprise" [...] models floundered, efforts {{continued}} {{to develop a}} new classical model of the business cycle. A 1982 paper by Kydland and Prescott introduced real business cycle theory (RBC).

RBC dismissed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> business cycles with price surprise, market failure, price stickiness, uncertainty, and instability. Instead, Kydland and Prescott built parsimonious models that explained business cycles with changes in technology and productivity. Employment levels changed because these technological and productivity changes altered the desire of people to work. RBC rejected the idea of high involuntary unemployment in recessions and not only dismissed the idea that money could stabilize the economy but also the monetarist idea that money could destabilize it.|$|E

500|$|No {{account or}} allusion to Philip's presumed {{conversion}} to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues {{in favor of}} Philip's Christianity in Rome and the Arabs, assumes {{that he had been}} a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature. Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction. Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements. Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip [...] "may have been curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he may not have been so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not keep an open mind on other religions." [...] He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood. For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{title was}} thought {{up by the}} {{production}} team, but the original story built around the title proved impossible to work. The original draft had nine characters (including the Prince, two love interests, two villains, and two helper characters) representing different political factions, and {{the setting of the}} Prince's own palace home instead of in another kingdom. This storyline ultimately impeded other aspects of development, and so was scrapped. In starting over, the team returned to [...] "The Sands of Time" [...] title and concept. They decided upon four key elements for the game: [...] "Unity of time and place", with the game taking place over twenty-four hours within the palace of Azad; [...] "Acrobatics", referring to the gameplay and how the setting was constructed around this concept; [...] "Combat", with the palace being filled with monsters to give the game and story a fast-paced feeling; and [...] "Rewind", the ability to turn back and manipulate time. One of the early decisions made by the production team was not to refer to Prince of Persia 3D in any degree in designing the gameplay, instead looking to the 1989 original for reference. They intended to capture the original feeling of platforming an adventure in a 3D environment. The Rewind mechanic began as a gameplay wish for the title, surviving the initial rewrite of the story and becoming key to both story and gameplay. The Dagger of Time and the Sands were both born from the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> this mechanic in-game. The initial concept was simply using the Dagger to rewind time and dispatch enemies, but its powers were gradually expanded into its current roster. The main character's acrobatics were designed to be novel to the video game medium, inspired by similar stunts performed in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. A video game which provided inspiration for the acrobatic feats of the Prince was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Elements such as using ladders as part of combat, and riding on a magic carpet or a horse were axed early in development. The Rewind function was suggested by the game's director Patrice Désilets based on experiences playing , where he had wished to rewind after making a mistake rather than restarting the entire level.|$|E

From the difference of the masses of the neutron and proton follows that the rest mass of the electron-neutrino is 0. 55 milli-eV. The potential of the weak force that holds the lattices of the particles together can be determined with Born's lattice theory. From the weak force follows automatically the existence of a strong force between the sides of two lattices. The strong nuclear force is the sum of the unsaturated weak forces at the sides of each lattice and is therefore 10 ^ 6 times stronger than the weak force. Comment: 41 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Dwarf {{galaxies are}} known to have remarkably low star {{formation}} efficiency due to strong feedback. Adopting the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way as a laboratory, we explore a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model to understand how the feedback processes shape the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we exhaustively search a large parameter space of the model and rigorously show that the general wisdom of strong outflows as the primary feedback mechanism cannot simultaneously explain the stellar mass function and the mass [...] metallicity relation of the Milky Way satellites. An extended model that assumes that a fraction of baryons is prevented from collapsing into low-mass halos in the first place can be accurately constrained to simultaneously reproduce those observations.
