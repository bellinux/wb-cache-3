5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis {{escaped from the}} zoo and went on the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage. Keepers <b>noticed</b> <b>it</b> was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} battery-powered back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later <b>noticed</b> <b>it,</b> and after the first batch of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan {{read the}} play and <b>noticed</b> <b>it</b> was {{relatively}} simplistic compared to Shakespeare's other works. John Philip Kemble, actor and manager of Drury Lane Theatre, later claimed he had serious doubts about its authenticity; he also suggested that the play appear on April Fool's Day, though Samuel Ireland objected, and the play {{was moved to the}} next day.|$|E
25|$|Cystatin C {{was first}} {{described}} as 'gamma-trace' in 1961 as a trace protein {{together with other}} ones (such as beta-trace) in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the urine of patients with renal failure.

Although the majority of the older plates were armorial, there were always pictorial examples as well, and these are the quasi-totality of modern ones.|$|E
25|$|Smaug was {{the last}} named dragon of Middle-earth. He was slain by Bard, a {{descendant}} of Girion, Lord of Dale. A deadly winged fire-breathing dragon, he was described as red-gold in colour and his underbelly was encrusted with many gemstones from the treasure-pile he commonly slept upon once he had taken control of Erebor (the Lonely Mountain). The Arkenstone was buried right in the pile he slept on, but Smaug never <b>noticed</b> <b>it.</b> Smaug had only a single weakness: there was {{a hole in his}} jewel encrusted underbelly on his left breast area. Bilbo Baggins discovered this, which led to Smaug's death above Esgaroth.|$|E
25|$|Paige first {{played for}} the semi-{{professional}} Mobile Tigers from 1924 to 1926. He began his professional baseball career in 1926 with the Chattanooga Black Lookouts of the Negro Southern League {{and became one of}} the most famous and successful players from the Negro leagues. While his outstanding control as a pitcher first got him <b>noticed,</b> <b>it</b> was his infectious, cocky, enthusiastic personality and his love for the game that made him a star. On town tours across the United States, Paige would sometimes have his infielders sit down behind him and then routinely strike out the side. He played his last professional game on June 21, 1966, for the Peninsula Grays of the Carolina League.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} the blast ripped most of the {{branches}} from the Survivor Tree. Glass and debris were embedded in its trunk and fire from the cars parked beneath it blackened what was left. Most thought the tree could not survive. Almost {{a year after the}} bombing, family members, survivors, and rescue workers gathered for a memorial ceremony by the tree <b>noticed</b> <b>it</b> was beginning to bloom again. The Survivor Tree now thrives, and the Outdoor Memorial design includes a mandate to feature and protect the tree. For example, one of the roots that would have been cut by the wall surrounding the tree was placed inside a large pipe so it could reach the soil beyond the wall without being damaged. The decking around the tree was raised several feet to make an underground crawlspace; workers enter through a secure hatchway and monitor the health of the tree and maintain its very deep roots.|$|E
25|$|There were exceptions, of course. The {{first person}} known to {{publicly}} {{address this issue}} was Bob Bemer, who had <b>noticed</b> <b>it</b> in 1958 {{as a result of}} work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the government of the United States and the ISO aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, Erik Naggum was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.|$|E
