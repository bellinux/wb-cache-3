30|$|Ensuring {{clean and}} safe water facilities, {{preserving}} our environment and avoiding societal nanophobia {{are some of}} the challenges faced by scientists and those involved in the use of nanomaterials. We must ensure the connectivity of each step in the handling, use, disposal and fate of CNTs in water purification technologies. At present, there is a paucity of methods and criteria for accurately measuring CNT risks and hazards. It is apparent {{that there is a need}} for solid regulatory frameworks that address and specifically manage the potential risks of nanotechnology. This regulatory framework should address the challenges faced in identifying and characterizing the <b>nanomaterial</b> <b>form</b> and its impact on human health and the environment. Our case-by-case, in-depth risk assessment procedures based on the nanomaterial’s structure-property relationships will help in understanding CNT behaviour in WWTPs and their subsequent release into the environment. With the help of these relationships, a universal safety guideline can be developed to accurately address risk estimates of CNTs in future water purification applications.|$|E

40|$|In {{the growing}} field of {{nanotechnology}} {{there is a}} need to determine the physicochemical and potential toxicological properties of nanomaterials since many industrial, medical and consumer applications are based on an understanding of these properties and on a controlled exposure to the materials. This document provides a literature review on the current status of computational studies aimed at predicting the physicochemical properties and biological effects (including toxicity) of nanomaterials, with an emphasis on medical applications. Although a number of models have been published for physicochemical property prediction, very few models have been published for predicting biological effects, toxicity or the underlying mechanisms of action. This is due to two main reasons: a) <b>nanomaterials</b> <b>form</b> a colloidal phase when in contact with biological systems making the definition and calculation of properties (descriptors) suitable for the prediction of toxicity a new and challenging task, and b) <b>nanomaterials</b> <b>form</b> a very heterogeneous class of materials, not only in terms of their chemical composition, but also in terms of size, shape, agglomeration state, and surface reactivity.

The aim {{of the current study}} was to explore the synergistic effect and mechanism of a doxorubicin (Dox) -ZnO nanocomplex as a multimodal drug delivery system, integrating Dox chemotherapy and ZnO-mediated photodynamic therapy, in anticancer therapeutics. Methods: Dox was loaded onto ZnO <b>nanomaterials,</b> <b>forming</b> complexes with the transition metal Zn to yield the Dox-ZnO nanocomplexes. After culture with SMMC- 7721 hepatocarcinoma cells, the cellular uptake was quantitatively detected by flow cytometry and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

The results indicate the formation of self-organized hexagonal-cubic and cubic-cubic nanolamellae with varying compositions and thicknesses in the range of similar to 3 - 15 nm across the film thicknesses, depending on the actual composition of the reactive gas mixtures. On the basis of the occurrence of the nanolamellae and their correlation with the local film hardness, progressively narrower ranges of the composition and hardness were refined in three steps. The third film was produced using an AlCl 3 /TiCl 4 precursor ratio of similar to 1. 9, resulting in the formation of an optimized lamellar microstructure with similar to 1. 3 nm thick cubic Ti(Al) N and similar to 12 nm thick cubic Al(Ti) N nanolamellae which exhibits a maximal hardness of similar to 36 GPa and an indentation modulus of similar to 522 GPa.

In order to expand the application of lithium-ion batteries in portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles, we need to improve the cycling performance, rate capability and safety performance of lithiumion batteries. Graphene, as a two-dimensional macromolecular sheet of carbon atoms with a honeycomb structure, has excellent electronic conductivity and mechanical properties, and may be the ideal conductive additive for hybrid nanostructured electrodes. Other advantages of graphene include high surface area (theoretical value of 2630 m 2 /g) for improved interfacial contact and the potential for low manufacturing costs. Its excellent conductivity could enhance the kinetic properties and rate performance of electrode materials. Meanwhile, the unique two-dimensional structure of the graphene can anchor, wrap and weave the <b>nanomaterials,</b> <b>forming</b> a hybrid random 3 D structure. This kind of loose structure could buffer the volume expansion and avoid the agglomeration during the cycling. Furthermore, it may absorb the electrolyte, offering the special ion channels between the different nanoparticles to further improve its conductivity. A series of graphene composites have been synthesized. The preparation, characterization and electrochemical performance of various nanostructured electrode materials are investigated...|$|R
30|$|At the beginning, the {{durability}} of the tested ENMs in the initial compartment should be screened (tier 0). The term “durability” means that the ENMs keep their status as a nanomaterial. For that screening, any information about the ENM properties and their possible loss (e.g. by rapid dissolution) is indispensable. Such information should be available (at least to some extent), e.g. from the manufacturer collecting it {{in the course of}} product design and development. In the case, that low durability is determined, meaning that the ENM rapidly loses its status of being a <b>nanomaterial,</b> the <b>formed</b> chemicals can be tested and assessed as conventional chemicals. In the case that medium to high durability is determined, the first tier of the assessment scheme is initiated. It has to be noted that any trigger value to differentiate between “high”, “medium” and “low” durability has still to be discussed. We expect that for example metals and metal oxides will belong to the medium and high durability group, whereas most of the “nano pesticides” will be allocated to the low durability group.|$|R

Micro- and nanocantilevers are {{employed}} in atomic force microscopy (AFM) and in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) as sensing elements. They enable nanomechanical measurements, are essential for the characterization of <b>nanomaterials,</b> and <b>form</b> {{an integral part of}} many nanoscale devices. Despite the fact that numerous methods described in the literature can be applied to determine the static flexural spring constant of micro- and nanocantilever sensors, experimental techniques that do not require contact between the sensor and a surface {{at some point during the}} calibration process are still the exception rather than the rule. We describe a noncontact method using a microfluidic force tool that produces accurate forces and demonstrate that this, in combination with a thermal noise spectrum, can provide the static flexural spring constant for cantilever sensors of different geometric shapes over a wide range of spring constant values (≈ 0. 8 – 160 N/m).

30|$|Carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> come in <b>forms</b> of {{graphene}} sheets, {{ranging from}} zero-dimensional (0 D) to two-dimensional (2 D), and three-dimensional (3 D) graphene structures [80]. While graphene is widely recognized for their unique physicochemical properties both separately and as hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials, the versatility of graphene {{has expanded to}} its application in three-dimensional structures. The following section will review information on three-dimensional graphene structures, such as graphene nano-onions (GNOs), graphene nanoribbons (GONRs), graphene nanoplatelets (GONPs), 3 D graphene oxide encapsulated gold nanoparticle, and 3 D graphene foams (GFs) [80 – 82]. The three-dimensional graphene structures are mostly utilized in detection of neural stem cell differentiation.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} galvanic replacement approach towards the development of bimetallic nanocatalysts, special emphasis {{has been focused on}} minimizing the use of expensive metal (e. g. Pt), in the finally <b>formed</b> <b>nanomaterials</b> (e. g. Ag/Pt system as a possible catalyst for fuel cells). However, the complete removal of the less active sacrificial template is generally not achieved during galvanic replacement, and its residual presence may significantly impact on the electrocatalytic properties of the final material. Here, we investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ag nanocubes replaced with different amounts of Pt, and demonstrate how the bimetallic composition significantly affects the activity of the alloyed nanomaterial...|$|R
