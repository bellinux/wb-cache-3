40|$|The {{notion that}} the tort {{liability}} system deters negligence in health care has been invoked to make the "business case for patient safety. " However, existing data {{on the relationship between}} hospital adverse events and malpractice claims typically are interpreted as evidence that the tort system does not deter negligence because of the poor fit between those who are negligently injured and those who sue. Using a familiar analogy from epidemiology [...] the problem of false positives in screening tests for rare diseases [...] and data from two large studies of medical injuries and malpractice claims in the United States, this paper presents an argument that the standard interpretation overlooks a complexity in the data. Although most malpractice claims do not actually involve a <b>negligent</b> <b>injury,</b> a patient who suffers a <b>negligent</b> <b>injury</b> is more than 20 times more likely, on average, to file a claim than a patient who does not. However, because malpractice claiming is a rare event with many false positives, for the average hospital or group practice, even substantial improvements in rates of <b>negligent</b> <b>injury</b> will not lead to a large reduction in claims rates. These findings suggest that the strength of the business case for patient safety depends on the perspective from which one views the data.

It is {{therefore}} not openly accessible, {{though it may be}} available by request. If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. When a patient is bringing a lawsuit, he or she is seeking retributive justice for a harm that they believe was done to them {{at the hands of a}} negligent physician. The foundation of malpractice litigation from a legal point of view is that the threat of litigation forces physicians to practice safely and more carefully. Meanwhile physicians believe that malpractice litigation is a punitive approach that seeks to isolate individual cases and assign blame and shame, rather than promote a culture of openness about mistakes and how to avoid them in the future. While the patient safety system relies on transparency and the availability of case information to accomplish its aims, the liability system, as argued by physicians, suppresses the transparency of this information because physicians fear legal retribution in the face of open disclosure. This compromises the foundational dynamic of the physician-patient relationship, and as a result detracts from the quality of care. Studies have found that in punishing the 3 percent of <b>negligent</b> <b>injuries</b> that actually result in malpractice claims, four innocent doctors are punished for every doctor that is actually at fault. Clearly the medical malpractice system is also struggling to maintain an efficient system of corrective justice. If the medical malpractice system seeks to deter negligence, promote patient safety and improve quality and access to medical services in a cost effective manner, then the current system seems to be flawed in meeting these aims. The flaws in this system not only promote a culture of non-disclosure and compromised physician-patient relations but also contribute to a culture of defensive medicine (unnecessary tests) to confirm a diagnosis. With the threat of malpractice litigation ever present, physicians have responded by avoiding high-risk patients and reducing their access to care. Combined, these flaws not only compromise quality and access of care, but also fuel an unjustifiable increase in the costs of care. It is no surprise that studies have found that at least $ 28 billion is spent each year on an interrelated combination of medical liability litigation and defensive medicine. This statistic, from 2005, compared to total National Health Expenditures from 2005 (1. 982 trillion dollars) indicates that this cost was about 1. 4 % of total National Health Expenditures in 2005. While this may seem like a small percentage of total health care expenditures, at a time when health care costs and declining access are of major public concern, the costs are indefensible because they are not necessarily improving patient safety or health outcomes. As questions linger about waste and inefficiency limiting access and compromising the quality of healthcare, it is necessary to assess the expansive impact that medical malpractice litigation is having on the field of medicine...|$|R
5000|$|NIED {{began to}} develop {{in the late nineteenth}} century, but only in a very limited form, in the sense that plaintiffs could recover for {{consequential}} emotional distress as a component of damages when a defendant negligently inflicted physical harm upon them. By 1908, most industrial U.S. states had adopted the [...] "physical impact" [...] form of NIED. However, NIED started developing into its more mature and more controversial form in the mid-20th century, as the new machines of the Second Industrial Revolution flooded the legal system with all kinds of previously unimaginable complex factual scenarios. Courts began to allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress resulting from <b>negligent</b> physical <b>injuries</b> to not only themselves, but other persons with whom they had a special relationship, like a relative. The first step, then, was to remove the requirement of physical injury to the actual plaintiff while keeping the requirement of physical injury to someone. In the 1968 landmark decision of Dillon v. Legg, the Supreme Court of California was the first court to allow recovery for emotional distress aloneeven {{in the absence of any}} physical injury to the plaintiffin the particular situation where the plaintiff simply witnessed the death of a close relative at a distance, and was not within the [...] "zone of danger" [...] where the relative was killed. [...] A 2007 statistical study commissioned by the Court found that Dillon was the most persuasive decision published by the Court between 1940 and 2005; Dillon has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis paper {{summarizes}} a {{new report}} presenting the best available research {{about the impact of}} the liability environment on maternity care, and policy options for improving this environment. Improved understanding of these matters can help to transcend polarized discourse and guide policy intervention. MethodsWe used a best available evidence approach and drew on more recent empirical legal studies and health services research about maternity care and liability when available, and considered other studies when unavailable. FindingsThe best available research does not support a series of widely held beliefs about maternity care and liability, including the economic impact of liability insurance premiums on maternity care clinicians, the existence of extensive defensive maternity care practice, and the impact of limiting the size of awards for non-economic damages in a malpractice lawsuit. In the practice of an average maternity caregiver, <b>negligent</b> <b>injury</b> of mothers and newborns seems to occur more frequently than any claim and far more frequently than a payout or trial. Many important gaps in knowledge relating to maternity care and liability remain. Some improvement strategies are likely to be more effective than others. ConclusionsEmpirical research does not support many widely held beliefs about maternity care and liability. The liability system does not currently serve well childbearing women and newborns, maternity care clinicians, or those who pay for maternity care. A number of promising strategies might lead to a higher functioning liability system, whereas others are unlikely to contribute to needed improvements...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus in}} the mini-dissertation {{is the concept of}} the duty of care which is {{analysed}} from a pragmatic medical malpractice perspective. South Africa has experienced a sharp increase in medical malpractice litigation in recent years and, although there is anecdotal evidence that many of these cases are without merit, this trend causes great concern in both public and private health sectors. The South African medical malpractice liability system is replete with contradictions ? why is it that not all patients who suffer negligent injuries institute action against health care professionals, and why do other patients who suffered no <b>negligent</b> <b>injury,</b> litigate? Theories that good communication may be a factor and that physicians who communicate well with their patients {{are less likely to be}} sued are supported in the dissertation. The duty of care, although a legal concept, lies at the heart of good medical practice. Physicians owe their patients a duty of care, both in contract and in delict. Codes of ethics further influence the standard of behaviour of the physician. Concerns have been expressed that there is a decline in professionalism and that the standard of care offered has decreased. Physicians are not infallible and to err is human. As South Africa is a country with limited resources it may be necessary to opt for a utilitarian standard of care that in many instances is below that which is expected in the developed world, but there is no ethical or legal reason why patients should be denied the duty of care. The foundations in contract and delict of the duty of care are laid down and the relevance of standards of care in this context is outlined. Actions constituting negligence are examined and the responsibilities of the health professional in relation to the duty of care are discussed and applied in the context of South African medical malpractice. Recommendations are proposed for consideration to curb the South African medical malpractice storm. Mini Dissertation (MPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Public LawMPhilUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|On the surface, suing in {{negligence}} {{seems the}} most promising avenue for recovery against appraisers, because liability depends on an examination of defendant 2 ̆ 7 s conduct alone and does not require an examination or defendant 2 ̆ 7 s mental state to show intent or agreement. But historically insuperable hurdles have operated to prevent recovery under this seemingly simple cause of action. One hurdle is lack of privity. The appraiser 2 ̆ 7 s legal relationship is with the hiring party [...] the lender [...] to assess the risks of the loan transaction and not with the purchaser, who may rely on the appraisal in making the decision to purchase. Because {{of the lack of}} privity with the buyer-borrowers, the appraisers had no duty and hence no liability to them, even when the property appraisal was critical in the loan transaction. Moreover, even if the facts showed that the appraiser was somehow <b>negligent</b> and that <b>injury</b> to the buyer-borrower was foreseeable, appraisers have asserted the economic loss rule, which operates to preclude recovery in a tort action for purely economic losses, unaccompanied by physical injury or property damage. These defenses might have seemed reasonable or appropriate in a time when there were isolated errors in appraisal reports, but in the world described by the Crisis Commission, fraught with sharp practices and dishonesty, a new regime seems in order. In the last few years, some courts, perceiving the disconnect between the formal rules governing the conduct of appraisers and the ends sought to be achieved by those rules, are making rulings aimed at some harmony and coherence for a sensible imposition of liability for appraisers 2 ̆ 7 wrongful conduct. The limitations of the negligence claim and the need for a new regime are discussed in further detail below...|$|R
40|$|Physicians are {{traditionally}} liable under a negligence rule of liability. Economic analysis of liability rules, including malpractice, {{assumes that the}} primary function of liability is injury prevention (deterrence). Compensation can be provided more efficiently through other forms of social or private insurance. In theory, a negligence rule creates incentives for efficient care, hence {{there should be no}} negligence, no claims and no demand for liability insurance. In practice, the incidence of <b>negligent</b> <b>injury</b> has been estimated at roughly one per hundred hospital admissions in the US and about one in seven physicians is sued per year. These discrepancies between the theory and actual operation of the negligence system arise primarily because of imperfect information on the part of courts, doctors, patients, liability insurers and health insurers. Imperfect information and extensive health insurance lead to biased and uncertain legal standards. Uncertain legal standards create incentives for physicians to practice defensive medicine and incentives for plaintiffs and defendants to invest in litigation, leading to high overhead costs, such that compensation through the malpractice system carries a load of $ 1. 50 per $ 1. 00 of compensation. Nevertheless, the extreme criticisms of the malpractice system are exaggerated. Malpractice premiums are less than 1 percent of total health care costs. There are no comprehensive estimates of defensive medicine costs; in any case such costs are likely to decline with the growth of managed care. Although claim disposition exhibits both Type 1 and Type 2 errors, negligent injuries {{are much more likely to}} lead to a claim being field and payment to the plaintiff than non-negligent injuries, and awards are strongly related to loss incurred. The limited empirical evidence of provider response to liability and the deterrent effect of claims suggests [...] but cannot prove [...] that the net benefits of the malpractice system may plausibly be positive. Nevertheless, reforms designed to reduce inappropriate compensation and deter excessive litigation and defensive practice would make the system more cost-effective. The empirical evidence, based primarily in the US, includes studies of malpractice injuries; physician response to liability; trends in claim frequency, severity (size), and claim disposition; and the malpractice insurance market. Analyses of actual and proposed reforms address tort reform, no fault, enterprise liability and optimal liability under managed care. More limited evidence is available on the negligence regimes in Canada and the UK, and the quasi no-fault regimes in Sweden and New Zealand. ...|$|E
