40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} extracellular sodium concentration (Na) o, osmolality and prostaglandin Ei(PGEi) on basal vascular tone and {{the response to the}} pressor agents, noradrenaline (NA) or angiotensin II (AT-II) using the pref used central artery of the isolated rabbit ear. The following results were obtained. 1) Both the basal vascular tone and the vasoconstrictor response of resistance vessels to <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> enhanced with a decreased extracellular osmolality induced by alteration in both sucrose concentration and(Na) o. 2) While the response to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> not affected by (Na) o under constant osmolality, the response to AT-II was augmented significantly when (<b>Na)</b> o <b>was</b> increased from 102 mM to 132 mM. 3) The inhibitory action of PGE 1 on the response to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> influenced by alteration of the extracellular calcium concentration (Ca) o, and was greater when (Ca) o was less than 2. 0 mM. 4) When 0. 1 μg and 1. 0 μg of <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> applied repeatedly and alternately, the responses were gradually enhanced. However, their enhancement was reduced under perfusion of PGE 1 (10 ng/ml), the responses finally being inhibited. From the results described above, it was concluded that the response of the resistance vessels to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> affected by alteration not in external Na concentration, but in external osmolality and calcium concentration. Further, it may be considered that the inhibitory effect of PGE 1 on the response to <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> probably due to each antagonistic action on calcium ion mobility through the cell membrane or within smooth muscle cells at contraction due to NA...|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{substantial}} amount of empirical research on negative affect (NA) and its role in the tripartite model.

The correlations between the specific anxiety scale (anxious arousal) in the MASQ and <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> moderate (rs= [...]41 and [...]47), supporting that <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> specific to anxiety disorders, congruent with the tripartite model.
