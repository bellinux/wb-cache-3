Many positive immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were identified in the pial capsule of the pineal, in connective septae and in the parenchyma between pinealocytes. The intraparenchymal fibers were particularly evident and created an extensive network throughout the gland. <b>Nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> immunoreactive for all the peptides were also observed in the posterior commissure and in the stria medullaris thalami. No NPY- or CPON-positive neurons {{were found in the}} pineal gland. In order to study the site of origin of NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> the superior cervical ganglia were bilaterally removed in a series of animals. Sympathetic denervation was checked by using an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Nearly all TH-immunoreactive elements disappeared in the pineal glands of animals sacrificed 15 days after surgery. Also the density of NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> decreased in the animals after the ganglionectomy. However, a number of <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> still remained in the gland. These data indicate that some NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of the sheep pineal gland derive from an extrasympathetic origin. The very dense innervation of the sheep pineal gland with <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> containing NPY and CPON strongly indicates a functional role for this family of peptides in the pineal gland of this species...|$|R

It is unknown whether the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous teeth is identical to that in permanent teeth or not. Moreover, morphological changes in the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> during resorption of deciduous teeth and eruption of successional permanent teeth in diphyodont animals have not been reported in detail. Therefore, in this study, we examined changes in the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in the cat during changes in dentition (i. e., deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition) by immunohistochemistry of protein gene product 9. 5. During deciduous dentition, periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were concentrated at the apical portion, and sparsely distributed in the periodontal ligament of deciduous molars. During mixed dentition, the periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of deciduous molars showed degenerative profiles during resorption. In permanent dentition, the periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of permanent premolars, the successors of deciduous molars, increased in number. Similar to permanent premolars, the periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of permanent molars, having no predecessors, increased in number, and were densely present in the apical portion. The present results indicate that the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous dentition is almost identical to that in permanent dentition although the number of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous dentition was low.

25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber,</b> forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E

500|$|A neurolytic {{block is}} the {{deliberate}} injury of a nerve by {{the application of}} chemicals (in which case the procedure is called [...] "neurolysis") or physical agents such as freezing or heating ("neurotomy"). These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve's fibers and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals. In these procedures, the thin protective layer around the <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber,</b> the basal lamina, is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber regrows, it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgically cutting a nerve severs these basal lamina tubes, and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, a painful neuroma or deafferentation pain may develop. This is why the neurolytic is preferred over the surgical block.|$|E

2500|$|Glia {{are also}} crucial in the {{development}} of the nervous system and in processes such as synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis. Glia have a role in the regulation of repair of neurons after injury. In the central nervous system (CNS), glia suppress repair. Glial cells known as astrocytes enlarge and proliferate to form a scar and produce inhibitory molecules that inhibit regrowth of a damaged or severed axon. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), glial cells known as Schwann cells promote repair. After axonal injury, Schwann cells regress to an earlier developmental state to encourage regrowth of the axon. This difference between the CNS and the PNS, raises hopes for the regeneration of nervous tissue in the CNS. For example, a spinal cord may be able to be repaired following injury or severance. Schwann cells are also known as neuri-lemmocytes. [...] These cells envelop nerve fibers of the PNS by winding repeatedly around a <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> with the nucleus inside of it.

2500|$|A typical neuron {{consists}} of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly in its undifferentiated stage. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometers and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex [...] "dendritic tree". An axon (also called a <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> when myelinated) is a special cellular extension (process) that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. Nerve fibers are often bundled into fascicles, and in the peripheral nervous system, bundles of fascicles make up nerves (like strands of wire make up cables). The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never {{to more than one}} axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: for example, neurons can lack dendrites, or have no axon, and synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.|$|E
