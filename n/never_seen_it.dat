5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E

25|$|Queen Street {{is known}} by {{reputation}} {{all over the}} country, even {{by people who have}} <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b> It gives its name to the most expensive square in the New Zealand version of Monopoly and to a somewhat disrespectful description of business people with rural investment interests (but lacking farming expertise): 'Queen Street farmers'. The street was immortalised by The Front Lawn with their song (It started on) Queen Street.|$|E

25|$|The tee {{shots on}} Holes 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there are}} several blind {{approach}} shots on Holes 2, 6 and 14. The second and third shots at Hole 9 are blind, depending on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach shots on Holes 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for a golfer who has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> before. Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|E
25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E

ATF's historian Henry Bullen privately tells Beatrice Warde, then a junior librarian, that he suspects that Garamond {{had nothing to do}} with the type, since he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> in a contemporary book, but has no better candidate for its creator. Warde subsequently moves to Europe, becoming a freelance writer on printing and adviser to Monotype in London.|$|E
500|$|The series' {{introduction}} of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club as making Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{an essential part of}} the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with [...] "stuff" [...] happening in the films, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. dealing with the fallout of it. However, the series would now be [...] "making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU". Barr wrote that the series [...] "does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> do before. Come the final frame , all anyone—Marvel fan or otherwise—will be asking is when season three begins." ...|$|E
500|$|Merrill Barr of Forbes {{thought that}} by not only {{introducing}} the Inhumans {{ahead of the}} film, but by depicting the spreading of the race throughout the world, {{was part of the}} series cementing its [...] "right to exist" [...] apart from the films. Talking about the season finale, Barr said, [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> do before. Come the final frame, all anyone – Marvel fan or otherwise – will be asking is when season three begins. The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize, perhaps for the first time, that the journey of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is not only worth it now, but perhaps always has been." ...|$|E

[...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E

He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars." ...|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World {{and it is a}} positive one. The reviewer states, [...] "A clear presentation of the visions of a child who {{wanted to go to the}} city. The vision is, perhaps, a bit more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b> The awakening was rude, but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality." [...] Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{wished to}} bring back the Daleks, as they were popular among {{children}} and had become [...] "one of the regulars". He stated in March 2010 that he and the production team had considered redesigning the Daleks. Mark Gatiss, the writer of the episode, was instructed by Moffat to write an episode about [...] "Churchill versus the Daleks". Gatiss was {{not sure what to do}} with the premise at first, but then became excited about doing a war movie, of which he was fond, and his own Dalek story. For research, he visited the real Cabinet War Rooms and read diaries and first-hand accounts of the war. Gatiss's inspiration was the 1966 serial The Power of the Daleks, though he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> due to it being lost, which depicted them as more sly and silent, an aspect he called [...] "very scary, more than when they're just barking orders".|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video.

After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he person that I normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights. They've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> they've never been given the permission to put that stuff on [...] He said, basically, 'If we had it, I would {{love to be able to}} reissue those old games.'" [...] Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith (since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment), who also did not know who the IP belonged to. Amrich concluded that [...] "at this time I do not believe that Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever." ...|$|E
