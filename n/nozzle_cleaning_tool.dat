40|$|Many {{work and}} {{environmental}} factors can affect the health of professional cleaners. In many of the work environments where cleaners are found the conditions that promote various occupational diseases (e. g., musculoskeletal disorders) are readily manageable. Inappropriate and poor working postures, lack of task variation, poor ergonomic design of work places, bad design of <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools</b> and work organization (e. g., long working hours, low salaries and awkward schedules) are all areas where relatively simple interventions can significantly reduce the rate of exposure to occupational disease. The primary goal of this research work was to study, existing <b>cleaning</b> work, <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools,</b> working environment and psychosocial aspects among professional cleaners. Seven different studies were carried out, these included a systematic literature review on risk factors in the cleaning occupation, redesign of <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools,</b> evaluation of <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools,</b> evaluation of working environment and psychosocial aspects of cleaners. The overall conclusion of presented studies is this thesis is that the cleaning job consists of high cardiovascular, muscular, and postural load. Using a participatory ergonomic approach and user-centered design, cleaning problems can be identified comprehensively and can be solved ergonomically, and <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools</b> can be redesigned considering ergonomic aspects by involving the end user. The strategy of participatory ergonomics in cleaning activities can significantly reduce work injuries, absenteeism, and compensation costs {{while at the same}} time lead to high quality of work and greater job satisfaction among the workforce.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the bacteriological status of selected RTE foods, associated preparation surfaces and <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools</b> sampled from four retail delicatessens in Johannesburg. An initial pilot study of four RTE foods such as filled baguettes, assorted salads, sliced processed meats and hot meals was conducted in order to set the parameters {{for the remainder of the}} study. Results showed that filled baguettes and assorted salads contained the highest bacterial counts and incidences of potential foodborne pathogens. Bacterial counts were obtained from the associated preparation surfaces, whilst <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools</b> were associated with coliform and Escherichia coli, suggesting they may harbour potential foodborne pathogens. For the main study, 60...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Researchers have {{designed}} {{many kinds of}} hole <b>cleaning</b> <b>tools</b> to improve hole cleaning condition in the com-plex structural wells.

The results show that blade helical angle as a con-trolling variable has {{a significant impact on}} application effect of the spiral hole cleaning tool; tangential cuttings velocity increases and axial cuttings velocity decreases with the increase in the helical angle and adjusting the helical angle can reach the required cuttings velocity...|$|R
