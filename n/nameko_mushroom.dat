The town's other main exports are rice and flowers, such as roses and gentians. Sakegawa is also well known for fishing, with the Salmon Festival (鮭祭り) being held at Eco Park every October.|$|R
30|$|Possible reutilization {{of fresh}} and aged culture wastes of {{mushrooms}} for cultivatingLyophyllum decastes was investigated, although bark compost has commonly {{been used as}} a substrate for cultivating this fungus. The culture wastes studied were obtained after harvestingPleurotus ostreatus andPholiota <b>nameko</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Mycelia ofL. decastes grew in the media containing both the fresh culture waste ofP. nameko and bark compost. However, it did not grow in the medium containing only the fresh culture waste ofP. nameko or in any media containing the fresh culture waste ofP. ostreatus. The mycelial growth inhibition in the fresh culture wastes ofP. ostreatus might be caused by the water-soluble inhibitors present. Mycelia ofL. decastes grew in all the media with aged culture wastes of bothP. ostreatus andP. nameko, which had been left outdoors for 6 months, regardless of whether bark compost was mixed. Fruit bodies were produced on all the tested media with aged culture wastes of both mushrooms, which had been left outdoors for a year. The aged culture waste ofP. nameko gave greater yields than the bark compost. This investigation shows that the aged culture wastes ofP. ostreatus andP. nameko could be reutilized for producingL. decastes mushrooms.|$|R
