5|$|Some of Van Rensselaer's {{success as}} a jewel {{merchant}} came about due to trade {{made possible by the}} Dutch East India Company. The practical spirit of the Dutch merchant could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> recognize that the way to riches was through trade with the West Indies and Africa. During the Twelve Years' Truce, Dutch merchants had sailed unmolested to the West Indies but also received no letters of marque to take prizes from the enemy.|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} statues, {{the male}} Salsal ("light shines through the universe") and the (smaller) female Shamama ("Queen Mother"), {{as they were}} called by the locals, did <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> fire the imagination of Islamic writers in centuries past. The larger statue reappears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.|$|E

25|$|This {{intelligence}} could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> create alarm in {{the mind}} of Napoleon, who concluded that the corps in question had been detached against his rear, as a diversion in favour of Blücher, from the Wellington's Anglo-allied, who had probably obtained some signal triumph over Ney. Another officer arrived from Vandamme, reiterating the account previously given.|$|E
25|$|In {{writing about}} the {{conspiracy}} of Catiline, Sallust's tone, style, and descriptions of aristocratic behavior {{show that he was}} deeply troubled by the moral decline of Rome. While he inveighs against Catiline's depraved character and vicious actions, he does <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> state that the man had many noble traits, indeed all that a Roman man needed to succeed. In particular, Sallust shows Catiline as deeply courageous in his final battle.|$|E
25|$|Pallis studied music under Arnold Dolmetsch, the {{distinguished}} reviver of early English music, composer, and performer, {{and was considered}} “one of Dolmetsch's most devoted protégés”. Pallis soon discovered a love of early music—in particular chamber music of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries—and for the viola da gamba. Even while climbing in the region of the Satlej-Ganges watershed, he and his musically-minded friends did <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> bring their instruments.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} hide his amazement and Eric smiled to see it. The latter had <b>not</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> {{perceive}} that his friend had until now considered him as {{little better than}} a lunatic.|$|R
60|$|Klara had <b>not</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> notice these {{symptoms}} of an agony of mind which {{the young man}} was so vainly trying to hide from her. For the moment she almost felt sorry for him--sorry and slightly remorseful.|$|R

25|$|Two {{qualifying}} {{sessions were}} held to determine the starting order for the race; the first on Friday afternoon and the second on Saturday afternoon. The fastest laptime set by a driver in either session {{was used to determine}} grid placings. There were 26 starting positions available for the race, and the qualifying sessions would normally be used to decide which drivers would miss out, but with the cars from Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo not taking part, the remaining 22 drivers could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the race.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue was}} {{contrived}} that the Protestant party (Du Plessis Mornay) could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> lose. By concurring with this decision, Casaubon confirmed the Protestants' suspicions that, like {{his friend and}} patron, Philippe Canaye, he was contemplating abjuration. From then on, he became {{the object of the}} hopes and fears of the two religions; the Catholics lavishing promises and plying him with arguments; the Protestant ministers insinuating that he was preparing to forsake a losing cause, and only haggling about his price. Neither side could understand that Casaubon's reading of the church fathers led him to adopt an intermediate position between Genevan Calvinism and Ultramontanism.|$|E
25|$|While the Prussian Infantry {{in rear of}} Ligny were in {{movement}} {{for the purpose of}} relieving their comrades who were already giving way before this renewed attack, they suddenly perceived, on the French right of Ligny, a column issuing from under the heavy smoke that rolled away from the well served batteries which had so unexpectedly opened upon them, and, which continued so fearfully to thin their ranks; and, as the mass rapidly advanced down the slope with the evident design of forcing a passage across the valley, they could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> distinguish both by its well sustained order and compactness, and by its dark waving surface of bearskins, that they had now to contend against the redoubted Imperial Guard.|$|E

60|$|The Sub-Prior, at the Borderer's request, had <b>not</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> {{return to}} the tower, into which he was {{followed}} by Christie of the Clinthill, who, shutting {{the door of the}} apartment, drew near, and began his discourse with great confidence and familiarity.|$|R
25|$|Artists at the {{forefront}} of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further. A reevaluation in their own work in relation to that of Cézanne had begun following a series of retrospective exhibitions of Cézanne's paintings held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. By 1907, representational form gave way to a new complexity; subject matter progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.|$|E
25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> know about it.|$|E
25|$|With {{both his}} courage and {{experience}} to draw from, Cézanne created a hybrid art-form. He combined {{on the one hand}} the imitative and the immobile, a system left over from the Renaissance, and the mobile on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, precisely because of this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists {{at the forefront of the}} Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.|$|E

25|$|In a probate case Saadia {{refused to}} sign a verdict of the exilarch which he thought unjust, {{although}} the Gaon of Pumbedita had subscribed to it. When {{the son of the}} exilarch threatened Saadia with violence to secure his compliance, and was roughly handled by Saadia's servant, open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon. Each excommunicated the other, declaring that he deposed his opponent from office; and David b. Zakkai appointed Joseph b. Jacob as gaon of Sura, while Saadia conferred the exilarchate on David's brother Hassan (Josiah; 930). Hassan was forced to flee, and died in exile in Khorasan; but the strife which divided Babylonian Judaism continued. Saadia was attacked by the exilarch and by his chief adherent, the young but learned Aaron ibn Sargado (later Gaon of Pumbedita, 943-960), in Hebrew pamphlets, fragments of which show a hatred {{on the part of the}} exilarch and his partisans that did not shrink from scandal. Saadia did <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> reply.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims {{had been found}} at stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast, Viktor Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the Rostov Oblast with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations, and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer's activities {{would be more likely}} to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and passport number. Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently—Kirpichnaya, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep—in an effort to force the killer to strike at one of those three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.|$|E
25|$|Judah b. Ezekiel {{introduced}} a new and original method of instruction in the school which he built up at Pumbedita; by emphasizing the need of an exact differentiation between, and a critical examination of, the subjects treated, he became the founder of Talmudic dialectics (Sanh. 17b; Ḥul. 110b; B. M. 38b). His method of instruction, however, did not please some of his older pupils, and they left him; among these was Ze'era, who went to Palestine despite Judah's declaration that no man should leave Babylonia for that country (Ket. 111a). But the new method was acceptable to most of his disciples, and was especially attractive to the young, so that the school at Pumbedita steadily increased in importance and popularity. After the death of Rav Huna, head of the Academy of Sura, most of his pupils went to Pumbedita, which, until the death of Judah, remained the only seat of Talmudic learning. Although Judah devoted himself chiefly to dialectics, he did <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> interpret the mishnayot, to explain peculiar words in them (Pes. 2a; M. Ḳ. 6b), or to determine the correct reading where several were given (Beẓah 35b; Suk. 50b).|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the final}} , Fogg {{had thought it}} was one day later than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact: during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. In fact, {{at the time and}} until 1884, the concept of a de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, in the real world, Fogg's mistake would not have occurred because a de facto date line did exist. The UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times. He would have noticed, when he arrived in San Francisco, that the local date was actually one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. As a consequence he could <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were actually one day earlier than his personal travel diary.|$|E
25|$|The {{writers of}} the Middle Ages have sought for other mystical {{explanations}} of the Hour of Nones. Amalarius of Metz (III, vi) explains at length how, like the sun which sinks on the horizon at the hour of Nones, man's spirit tends to lower itself also, he is more open to temptation, {{and it is the}} time the demon selects to try him. For the texts of the Fathers on this subject it will suffice to refer the reader to the above-mentioned work of Cardinal Bona (c. ix). The same writers do <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> remark that the number nine was considered by the ancients an imperfect number, an incomplete number, ten being considered perfection and the complete number. Nine was also the number of mourning. Among the ancients the ninth day was a day of expiation and funeral servicenovemdiale sacrum, the origin doubtless of the novena for the dead. As for the ninth hour, some persons believe that it is the hour at which our first parents were driven from the Garden of Paradise. In conclusion, it is necessary to call attention to a practice which emphasized the Hour of Nonesit was the hour of fasting. At first, the hour of fasting was prolonged to Vespers, that is to say, food was taken only in the evening or {{at the end of the}} day. Mitigation of this rigorous practice was soon introduced. Tertullian's famous pamphlet De jejunio rails at length against the Psychics (i.e. the orthodox Christians) who end their fast on station days at the Hour of Nones, while he, Tertullian, claims that he is faithful to the ancient custom. The practice of breaking the fast at Nones caused that hour to be selected for Mass and Communion, which were the signs of the close of the day. The distinction between the rigorous fast, which was prolonged to Vespers, and the mitigated fast, ending at Nones, is met with in a large number of ancient documents (see Fasting).|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Balkan Chronicle, an Internet-based {{newspaper}} {{reporting from the}} Balkans, disagreed with the opinion that the violence was unnecessarily explicit or sensationalized: [...] "Sugarcoating it would do no one any good.

[...] Later, when Bolkovac spoke at a screening of the film in Bosnia, it was reported that her message was well-received and discussion about the events that occurred in the late 1990s [...] "did <b>not</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> engage and provoke".|$|E
