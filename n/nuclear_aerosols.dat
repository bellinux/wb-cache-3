These aerosols evolve under natural transport processes {{as well as}} {{under the influence of}} engineered safety features. Such aerosols can be hazardous for the equipment inside the reactor, and when leaked into the environment, pose potential risks to the public.

40|$|In {{the course}} of a severe accident, some <b>nuclear</b> <b>aerosols</b> may be {{released}} to the environment through penetrating the containment concrete cracks, even if a catastrophic failure of the containment does not occur. There is experimental and theoretical evidence of strong retention of aerosol particles in the cracks that act as a filter. In this work a Eulerian model is developed based on the numerical solution of the one-dimensional aerosol transport equation. Plug formation is accommodated by allowing the crack diameter to change with time, based on the volume of the deposited mass. Brownian diffusion, gravitational settling and turbulence-driven deposition are considered as the removal mechanisms of the particles along the leak path. The model is verified against analytical solutions and validated by comparing with early as well as recent experimental data. It is concluded that a one-dimensional model of aerosol flow through a hydraulically equivalent leaking duct can simulate with enough accuracy aerosol transport in cracks, so that it may be an appropriate option for a large system code like ASTEC.

40|$|International audienceThe Institute of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (France) is {{planning}} the set-up of an automatic <b>nuclear</b> <b>aerosol</b> monitoring network over the French territory. Each of the stations {{will be able}} to automatically sample the air aerosol content and provide activity concentration measurements on several radionuclides. This should help monitor the French and neighbouring countries nuclear power plants set. It would help evaluate the impact of a radiological incident occurring at one of these nuclear facilities. This paper is devoted to the spatial design of such a network. Here, any potential network is judged on its ability to extrapolate activity concentrations measured on the network stations over the whole domain. The performance of a network is quantitatively assessed through a cost function that measures the discrepancy between the extrapolation and the true concentration fields. These true fields are obtained through the computation of a database of dispersion accidents over one year of meteorology and originating from 20 French nuclear sites. A close to optimal network is then looked for using a simulated annealing optimisation. The results emphasise the importance of the cost function in the design of a network aimed at monitoring an accidental dispersion. Several choices of norm used in the cost function are studied and give way to different designs. The influence of the number of stations is discussed. A comparison with a purely geometric approach which does not involve simulations with a chemistry-transport model is performed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study simulates of aerosol {{dynamics}} including coagulation, deposition {{and source}} reinforcement. Typical applications are for <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>aerosols,</b> aerosol reaction chambers {{and the production}} of purified materials. The model determines the aerosol number and volume distributions for an arbitrary number of particle-size classes, called sections. The user specifies the initial aerosol size distribution and the source generation rate of each component in each section. For spatially homogeneous aerosol of uniform chemical composition, the aerosol dynamic equation is solved in closed volume to simulate the radionuclide particle transport in the containment. The effects of initial conditions on the aerosol distribution, boundary layer thickness and the aerosol behaviour under source reinforcement (external source) are considered...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of fluid}} and gaseous {{inclusions}} in solids {{have been a}} major interest in various fields and have been carried out at dfferent pressures, temperatures, and phase conditions. In nuclear fuel, approximately 20 % of the fission products (FPs) are gaseous with isotopes of Xe contributing up to 90 % to the product gases. However, previous to this work quantitative analysis of Xe inclusions in nuclear fuel samples have not been performed systematically. The method used must incorporate simple sample handling procedures in a shielded environment. This study is the development of a method for the direct determination of the. ssion gas (FG) products in micro inclusions contained in nuclear fuels using LA- ICP- MS. To determine the concentration of Xe in nuclear fuel, two calibration strategies were investigated. The first strategy was based on the direct injection of a known quantity of a reference gas into the LA- ICP- MS carrier gas system. Further, the ablation of a 'matrix-matched' standard of a non-irradiated UO 2 sample, implanted with a known amount of 129 Xe was also applied. Using these quanti. cation methods, quantitative LA- ICP- MS measurements were performed on high burnup nuclear fuel. This study demonstrates that direct gas injection is most suitable for the quanti. cation of. ssion gas in micron-sized inclusions. The direct gas addition is simple and linear calibration curves were obtained. Good reproducibility was obtained and matrix effects were within the uncertainty of the measurements. For the quanti. cation of. ssion gases in <b>nuclear</b> fuel, <b>aerosol</b> particles were filtered before entering the ICP to remove interferences on the Xe isotopes from the solid FP matrix. The first quantitative determinations of the amount of gas in nuclear fuel using the direct injection method for calibration led to sample pressure calculations which were in good agreement with pressures estimated from computer simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of gaseous molecular iodine into iodine oxide aerosols has significant relevance {{in the understanding}} of the fission product iodine volatility in a LWR containment during severe accidents. In containment, the high radiation field caused by fission products released from the reactor core induces radiolytic oxidation into iodine oxides. To study the characteristics and the behaviour of iodine oxides in large scale, two THAI tests Iod- 13 and Iod- 14 were performed, simulating radiolytic oxidation of molecular iodine by reaction of iodine with ozone, with ozone injected from an ozone generator. The observed iodine oxides form submicron particles with mean volume-related diameters of about 0. 35 mu m and show low deposition rates in the THAI tests performed in the absence of other <b>nuclear</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Formation of iodine aerosols from gaseous precursors iodine and ozone is fast as compared to their chemical interaction. The current approach in empirical iodine containment behaviour models in severe accidents, including the radiolytic production of I- 2 -oxidizing agents followed by the I- 2 oxidation itself, is confirmed by these THAI tests.

The focus of this research is {{on the use of the}} Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique to elucidate the role of various phenomena that influence the evolution of <b>nuclear</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Several sampling algorithms and aerosol processes such as coagulation, deposition, condensation, and source reinforcement are explored for a multi-component, aerosol dynamics problem in a spatially homogeneous medium. Several test problems are simulated using the DSMC technique. The DSMC results obtained are verified against the analytical results for appropriate test problems. Additionally, the DSMC results are compared against those obtained from the sectional method for several multi-component test problems with same component densities. It is clear from the results that the assumption of a single mean density is not appropriate due to the complicated effect of component densities on the aerosol processes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis treats aerosol {{behaviour}} {{under various}} conditions in enclosed spaces. Knowledge of this behaviour is of importance {{for the use of}} aerosol-filled enclosures as a supply of aerosol, as a means for aerosol characterization and for so-called smog chambers for air pollution research (mainly for the investigation of photochemical processes by which usually particles are formed). Chapter 1 gives a brief literature survey, indicating the limited attention given hitherto to aerosol behaviour in enclosed spaces. After decades of almost exclusive interest from meteorologists, {{since the beginning of the}} sixties, enclosed aerosols have become an important research subject in <b>nuclear</b> safety. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>aerosol</b> research, however, pertains mainly to high aerosol mass concentrations. In chapter 2 a model is given, describing aerosol removal from enclosed spaces. Usually, aerosol deposition on the walls occurs from a cloud with homogeneous space distribution due to thermal convection. The rate-limiting step of deposition is the transport through the boundary layer at the walls. Relations are derived for a number of removal mechanisms: sedimentation, diffusion, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, electrophoresis and photophoresis. From literature data and Fuchs' theory a relation is derived for the dependence of the boundary layer thickness δfor diffusive deposition on the diffusion coefficient D of aerosol particles in usual containments. Boundary conditions for non-stirred deposition of aerosols by sedimentation and diffusion are given. Chapter 3 summarizes the most important means used for experiments. In chapter 4 the experimental results and conclusions are presented. It consists of four sections dealing with unheated dry enclosures, heated dry enclosures, enclosures with a heated pool of liquid, and smog chambers, respectively. Observations on the behaviour of monodisperse and polydisperse aerosols in unheated dry enclosures support the model derived for sedimentation and diffusion. Additionally, the relation between δand D derived in chapter 2 is validated. Particles larger than a few tenths of a micron are removed by sedimentation; particles smaller than about 0. 1 μm aresubject to diffusive deposition, though often electrophoresis plays an important role (particularly, in case of particles of about 0. 1 μm). It is shown that aerosol measurements in containments can be used for determination of dynamic shape factors and aerodynamic diameters. Aerosols in heated dry containments are removed by thermophoresis. Observations on a large variety of aerosols and enclosures are in fair agreement with the model on thermophoretic removal derived in chapter 2. Interpretation of the experimental results yields the thermophoretic properties of aerosols. The results support the theories of Brock and Stetter, and are in disagreement with those of Derjaguin and Epstein. In accordance with theoretical predictions, thermophoretic decay constants are obtained independent of particle size (≥ 0. 5 μm), of particle material and of temperature. Gentle heating of the floor of a containment is shown to have a stabilizing effect on the enclosed aerosol. Introduction of aerosol in a containment with a heated pool of liquid on the floor leads to particle growth by vapour condensation followed by an accelerating removal by sedimentation. Experimental observations support a model describing aerosol behaviour in such systems. The knowledge of this aerosol behaviour allows study of condensation on aerosol particles and particle growth under conditions of variable degrees of supersaturation. The degree of supersaturation can be varied by means of the heating power dissipated in the pool of liquid as well as by means of solving substances in the liquid. Investigations of aerosol behaviour in photochemical smog chambers show insignificant deposition due to thermophoresis or photophoresis under these conditions. Observed aerosol stabilities could be explained by electrophoretic deposition, yielding a coherent picture with electrophoresis in other investigations. Coagulation constants of aerosol could be calculated from measurements on number concentrations of aerosols in enclosed spaces. The results obtained agree fairly well with Davies' theory on coagulation. Decay curves of number concentration of aerosols in metal vessels can be used for assessment of diffusion coefficients...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel glowworm metaphor based distributed algorithm that enables a minimalist mobile robot swarm to effectively split into subgroups, exhibit simultaneous taxis towards, and rendezvous at multiple source locations. The locations of interest could represent radiation {{sources such as}} <b>nuclear</b> and hazardous <b>aerosol</b> spills spread within an unknown environment. The glowworm algorithm {{is based on a}} glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) technique that finds multiple optima of multimodal functions. The algorithm is in the same spirit as the ant-colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, but with several significant differences. A key feature of the CSO algorithm is the use of an adaptive local-decision domain, which is used effectively to detect the multiple optimum locations of the multimodal function. We conduct sound source localization experiments, using a set of four wheeled robots (christened Glowworms), to validate the glowworm approach to the problem of multiple source localization. We also examine the behavior of the glowworm algorithm in the presence of uncertainty due to perceptional noise. A comparison with a gradient based approach reveals the superiority of the glowworm algorithm in coping with uncertainty...|$|R
