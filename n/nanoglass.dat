A glimpse of our gamut research activities with some significant results is highlighted and facilely analyzed. The term 'nanoglass' refers to the science and technology dealing with the manipulation of the physical properties of rare earth doped inorganic glasses by embedding metallic nanoparticles (NPs) or nanoclusters. On the other hand, the word 'plasmonics' refer to the coherent coupling of photons to free electron oscillations (called plasmon) at the interface between a conductor and a dielectric. <b>Nanoglass</b> plasmonis being an emerging concept in advanced optical material of nanophotonics has given photonics the ability to exploit the optical response at nanoscale and opened up a new avenue in metal-based glass optics. There is {{a vast array of}} <b>nanoglass</b> plasmonic concepts yet to be explored, with applications spanning solar cells, (bio) sensing, communications, lasers, solid-state lighting, waveguides, imaging, optical data transfer, display and even bio-medicine. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can enhance the optical response of <b>nanoglass</b> by orders of magnitude as observed. The luminescence enhancement and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are new paradigm of research. A thumbnail sketch of the fundamental aspects of SPR, LSPR, SERS and photonic applications of various rare earth doped/co-doped binary glasses containing metallic NPs are presented.

40|$|Nanoglasses are solids {{consisting}} of nanometer-sized glassy regions connected by interfaces having a reduced density. We studied {{the structure of}} Sc(75) Fe(25) nanoglasses by electron microscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, and small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering. The positron annihilation spectroscopy measurements showed that the as-prepared nanoglasses consisted of 65 vol% glassy and 35 vol% interfacial regions. By applying temperature annealing to the nanoglasses and measuring in situ small-angle X-ray scattering, we observed that {{the width of the}} interfacial regions increased exponentially {{as a function of the}} annealing temperature. A quantitative fit to the small-angle X-ray scattering data using a Debye-Bueche random phase model gave a correlation length that is related to the sizes of the interfacial regions in the <b>nanoglass.</b> The correlation length was found to increase exponentially from 1. 3 to 1. 7 nm when the sample temperature was increased from 25 to 230 °C. Using simple approximations, we correlate this to an increase in the width of interfacial regions from 0. 8 to 1. 2 nm, while the volume fraction of interfacial regions increased from 31 to 44 %. Using micro-compression measurements, we investigated the deformation behavior of ribbon glass and the corresponding <b>nanoglass.</b> While the <b>nanoglass</b> exhibited a remarkable plasticity even in the annealed state owing to the glass-glass interfaces, the corresponding ribbon glass was brittle. As this difference seems not limited to Sc(75) Fe(25) glasses, the reported result suggest that nanoglasses open the way to glasses with high ductility resulting from the nanometer sized microstructure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nanoglasses</b> are non-crystalline solids whose {{internal}} structure {{is characterized by}} fluctuations of the free volume. Due to the typical dimensions of the structural features in the nanometer-range and the disordered atomic structure of the interfacial regions, the atomic structure and the structural stability of <b>nanoglasses</b> is not yet completely understood. <b>Nanoglasses</b> are typically produced by consolidation of glassy nanoparticles. Consequently, {{the basis for the}} understanding of the atomic structure of <b>nanoglasses</b> lies in the atomic structure of the primary glassy nanoparticles. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the elemental distribution in the Fe 90 Sc 10 primary glassy nanoparticles and in the corresponding <b>nanoglasses</b> produced by consolidation of these glassy nanoparticles have been studied. Due to surface segregation, Fe {{has been found to be}} enriched at the surface of the primary Fe 90 Sc 10 glassy nanoparticles. This behavior was found to be consistent with theoretical results based on a monolayer model for surface segregation behavior of the binary liquid alloys. In addition, the heterogeneous structure of Fe 90 Sc 10 <b>nanoglasses</b> with Fe enriched interfaces was also directly observed, and may be attributed to the segregation of the primary glassy nanoparticles on the surface. Furthermore, the electron density of the isolated and loosely compacted primary glassy nanoparticles was investigated using small- and wide- angle X-ray scattering. The results indicate that the surface shells of glassy nanoparticles have an electron density that is lower than the electron density in the cores of the glassy nanoparticles. The lower electron density seems to result mainly from a lower atomic packing density of the surface shells rather than from compositional variations due to the surface segregation. During the consolidation of the glassy nanoparticles, the inhomogeneous elemental distribution and the short-range order in the shells of Fe 90 Sc 10 glassy nanoparticles can be transferred into the interfaces of the resulting bulk Fe 90 Sc 10 <b>nanoglasses.</b> The free volume within the shells of the Fe 90 Sc 10 glassy nanoparticles may delocalize into the interfaces between the Fe 90 Sc 10 glassy nanoparticles resulting in interfacial regions of lower atomic packing density in the Fe 90 Sc 10 <b>nanoglasses.</b> The structural stability of Fe 90 Sc 10 <b>nanoglasses</b> has been studied by means of low temperature annealing in situ in a transmission electron microscope, and ex situ in an ultra-high-vacuum tube-furnace. The analysis of both experiments showed similar results. The structure of the Fe 90 Sc 10 <b>nanoglasses</b> was stable for up to 2 hours when annealed at 150 °C. Annealing of <b>nanoglasses</b> at higher temperatures resulted in the formation of a metastable nanocrystalline bcc-Fe(Sc) with Sc-enriched interfaces.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to {{elucidate}} structure-property relationships in copper-zirconium amorphous alloys using molecular dynamics simulations. We investigate the plastic deformation of Cu-Zr glasses {{in the absence of}} free surfaces or other heterogeneities and show that strain localization is an intrinsic metallic glass property. Tensile tests of metallic glass nanowires reveal that even in samples with a diameter of only 5 nm shear banding is the dominant deformation mode and that there is no intrinsic size effect in the plastic deformation of metallic glasses. The structure and properties of shear bands are investigated in a comprehensive study considering chemical short range order, topological short range order and medium range order. Our results suggest that the picture of a structural backbone, which is locally destabilized and causes strain localization, is not a universal concept for describing shear banding in metallic glasses. When subjected to thermal annealing, shear bands recover and, depending on the annealing temperature, collective motion or nearest neighbor jumps in addition to collective motion are the relevant relaxation mechanisms. Linking free volume theory and experimental observations, our results provide an explanation why shear bands do not recover instantaneously at elevated temperatures but rather on time scales in the range of hours. We finally investigate the deformation of nanostructured metallic glasses, namely <b>nanoglasses</b> obtained by powder consolidation. <b>Nanoglasses</b> comprise a network of glass-glass interfaces with a defective short range order, which act as shear band precursors. This leads to a more homogeneous distribution of plastic strain in a pattern of multiple shear bands, wherefore we predict an enhanced ductility for metallic <b>nanoglasses</b> as compared to conventional metallic glasses...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{thermodynamically}} consistent non-local plasticity model, the mechanistic {{origin of}} enhancement in ductility and suppression of dominant shear banding in <b>nanoglasses</b> (NGs) is analysed. It is {{revealed that the}} interaction stress between flow defects plays {{a central role in}} promoting global plasticity of NGs. Specifically, we find that the intrinsic length associated with this stress provides a scaling for the shear band width and its coupling with grain size governs the level of enhancement in the deformation behaviour of NGs. The present work may provide useful insights in developing highly ductile NGs for practical engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{prospect}} of realizing new bulk metallic glasses with improved properties has driven {{a large amount}} of research since the early work of Duwez [1]. In analogy to nanocrystalline solids, a new type of metallic glasses may by synthesized by consolidating glassy powder. This so-called <b>nanoglass</b> consists of glassy grains separated by interfaces [2]. So far, the existence of nanoglasses was only indirectly proven by experiments [2, 3, 4, 5]. This dissertation presents molecular dynamics simulations of nanoglasses and provides detailed insights into the structure and properties of this class of material. In the first part, an investigation of the structure and stability of a planar glass-glass interface is conducted by analyzing the local topology, alloy composition and density in comparison to the bulk structure. An analogy between an internal interface and a shear band is established. The stability of the glass-glass interfaces under thermal treatment and hydrostatic pressure is also analyzed. The second part is dedicated to the deformation behavior of metallic nanoglasses. Here, mechanical properties of a Cu 64 Zr 36 -nanoglass are characterized under tensile load and compared to the deformation behavior of a homogeneous bulk glass. For this study, dense and porous nanoglasses are used and the influence of grain size and porosity on the plastic behavior of nanoglasses is investigated. In addition, it is studied how thermal treatment and prior-deformation change the plastic response of the metallic <b>nanoglass.</b> In the third part, the phonon density of states (PDOS) of nanoglasses is studied in comparison to other nanostructures (nanoparticles, nanocrystals and embedded nanoparticles). In this case, germanium is used as representative reference material. By comparing with the PDOS of single crystalline and amorphous structures, the physical origins of additional or vanishing vibrational modes or frequency shift are identified. A general view on the interplay of nanostructural features and lattice vibrations is provided. In the last part, an investigation of the crystalline to amorphous transition of thin iron films embedded in AlFe glass is conducted. For the first time theoretical evidence is provided for the existence of a single-component metallic glass. The calculated PDOS reinforce the aforementioned statements. In addition, the investigation of finite size effects in PDOS is extended for the case of Fe thin films...|$|E
40|$|Nanoglasses are a {{new class}} of noncrystalline solids. They differ from today’s glasses due to their {{microstructure}} that resembles the microstructure of polycrystals. They consist of regions with a melt-quenched glassy structure connected by interfacial regions, the structure of which is characterized (in comparison to the corresponding melt-quenched glass) by (1) a reduced (up to about 10 %) density, (2) a reduced (up to about 20 %) number of nearest-neighbor atoms and (3) a different electronic structure. Due to their new kind of atomic and electronic structure, the properties of nanoglasses may be modified by (1) controlling the size of the glassy regions (i. e., the volume fraction of the interfacial regions) and/or (2) by varying their chemical composition. Nanoglasses exhibit new properties, e. g., a Fe 90 Sc 10 <b>nanoglass</b> is (at 300 K) a strong ferromagnet whereas the corresponding melt-quenched glass is paramagnetic. Moreover, nanoglasses were noted to be more ductile, more biocompatible, and catalytically more active than the corresponding melt-quenched glasses.

40|$|The {{influence}} of grain size and composition on the mechanical properties of Cu–Zr nanoglasses (NGs) is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations using two model glasses of different alloy composition, namely Cu 64 Zr 36 (Cu-rich) and Cu 36 Zr 64 (Zr-rich). When the grain size is increased, or {{the fraction of}} interfaces in these NGs is decreased, we find a transition from a homogeneous to an inhomogeneous plastic deformation, because the softer interfaces are promoting the formation shear transformation zones. In case of the Cu-rich system, shear localization at the interfaces is most pronounced, since both the topological order and free volume content of the interfaces {{are very different from}} the bulk phase. After thermal treatment the redistribution of free volume leads to a more homogenous deformation behavior. The deformation behavior of the softer Zr-rich <b>nanoglass,</b> in contrast, is only weakly affected by the presence of glass–glass interfaces, since the interfaces don’t show topological disorder. Our results provide clear evidence that the mechanical properties of metallic NGs can be systematically tuned by controlling the size and the chemical composition of the glassy nanograins...|$|E
40|$|An inelastic neutron {{scattering}} {{study has been}} carried out to assess the effects of mechanical milling treatments (10, 20 and 70 h) on an amorphous melt-spun FeSiB ribbon. Faint traces of crystallization were observed after 10 and 20 h milling by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy and a minor fraction of bcc-Fe was clearly detected after 70 h. Whilst the neutron spectrum S(E) of the 10 h-milled sample, at temperature T = 300 K, does not differ from that of the precursor FeSiB ribbon, the area of the inelastic region of S(E) decreases more and more after 20 and 70 h milling. Moreover, in the samples milled for 20 and 70 h, also the area of the elastic region of the S(E) spectrum is definitely smaller than the one of the FeSiB ribbon. This is consistent with a reduction of the magnetic cross section upon milling and it agrees also with magnetization measurements. We interpret this behavior assuming that the milling treatment causes local alterations of the short-range atomic order within the amorphous phase, and hence of the precursor collinear ferromagnetic order, finally giving rise to a sort of magnetic <b>nanoglass</b> structure...|$|E

The absorption and emission spectra displays several prominent peaks corresponding to the transitions from the ground state to the excited states of RE ion. The observed efficient enhancement of up-conversion emissions and absorbance in the entire visible region is attributed to strong localized electric field in vicinity of NPs.

Metal nanoparticles (NPs) together with RE ions in the glass matrix are thought as a suitable alternative to overcome the limitations of concentration quenching and weak absorption of inorganic glasses. We prepare a series of Titania-Erbium doped Tellurite glass system with the form (69 -x) TeO 2 - 20 ZnO- 10 Na 2 O- 1 Er 2 O 3 -(x) TiO 2, where 0 ≤ x≤ 1. 0 mol% via melt-quenching method with optimum erbium contents and varying TiO 2 NPs concentrations. The NPs concentration dependent modifications in the absorption characteristics are scrutinized. Glasses are characterized via UV-Vis-NIR and XRD measurements. XRD pattern verifies the amorphous nature of prepared samples. The incorporation of TiO 2 NPs is demonstrated to enhance the absorption intensity significantly. This augmentation is attributed {{to the effect of}} Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) mediated strong local electric field that is swallowed by neighboring Er 3 + ions. The observed modification in optical energy band gap and Urbach energy are ascribed to the strong electric field around NPs that interact with the ligand of glass network to transform weak bond into defects.

30|$|There {{have been}} several methods {{proposed}} {{in recent years to}} improve the mechanical and transfer characteristics of the cement used for sequestration practices. Changing the water-to-cement ratio, applying pozzolanic materials and employing non-Portland cement are the most important approaches proposed so far with limited success once tested under reservoirs conditions (Abid et al. 2015). Employing nanoparticles might be another approach that worth consideration as a solution for reinforcing the cement. This is mainly because chemical and mechanical properties of materials are changed when their particle size is reduced. It is also known that Calcium–Silicate–Hydrate (C–S–H), {{which is one of the}} main components required to resist against the CO 2 attack, is widely available in a high order structure at the nanoscale (Abid et al. 2015; Arina and Irawan 2010). The benefits of using nanoparticles, such as nanosilica (SiO 2), nanoalumina (Al 2 O 3), clay nanocomposites, nanotitanium oxide (TiO 2), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and <b>nanoglass</b> flake (NGFs) have been widely presented in the building and polymer industries (Abid et al. 2015; Jahangir and Kazemi 2014; Lee 2012; Ghadami et al. 2014). However, there have been a very limited discussion on their potential applications in the oil and gas industries, especially for CO 2 sequestration sites. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the characteristics of different nanoparticles and evaluate their potential applications in the cement used for the storage sites. This may shed some lights as to how the physical and mechanical characteristics of the cement can be improved for a safer storage of CO 2.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{marginal}} leakage of two aesthetic cervical restorative materials viz the newly introduced light cured nano glass ionomer cement and nano ceramic composites, and also to evaluate the effect of unfilled resin sealant coating on marginal leakage of these aesthetic restorations. Thirty freshly extracted human upper premolars were used for the study. Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and lingual surface of each tooth, with occlusal margin in enamel and cervical margin in cementum. The teeth were randomly divided into two groups of fifteen teeth each. Cavities of group 1 were restored with nano composite and group 2 were restored with light curing nano glass ionomer cement, following manufacturer’s instructions. After rinsing and drying one thin coat of unfilled resin sealant was applied only on to the surface of lingual restoration and were light polymerized for 15 seconds. The procedures for dye penetration using Methylene Blue were followed and examined under stereomicroscope for evaluation. The data collected were analyzed statistically using Mann-Whitney U test. Nanocomposite recorded less microleakage than <b>nanoglass</b> ionomer cement at occlusal and cervical margins. Results showed that cervical margin had significantly more microleakage than occlusal margin. Palatal surfaces, which were coated with resin sealant showed significantly less dye penetration in comparison with buccal surfaces in both groups. Though the coating of unfilled resin sealant did not completely eliminated microleakage, unfilled resin sealant was definitely effective in reducing microleakage of the esthetic restorations, especially on the gingival margin of the class V restorations...|$|E
30|$|Carbon {{capture and}} {{sequestration}} (CCS) has been employed to reduce global warming, {{which is one}} of the critical environmental issues gained the attention of scientific and industrial communities worldwide. Once implemented successfully, CCS can store at least 5  billion tons of CO 2 per year as an effective and technologically safe method. However, there have been a few issues raised in recent years, indicating the potential leakages paths created during and after injection. One of the major issues might be the chemical interaction of supercritical CO 2 with the cement, which may lead to the partial or total loss of the cement sheath. There have been many approaches presented to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the cement against CO 2 attack such as changing the water-to-cement ratio, employing pozzolanic materials, and considering non-Portland cements. However, a limited success has been reported to the application of these approaches once implemented in a real-field condition. To date, only a few studies reported the application of nanoparticles as sophisticated additives which can reinforce oil well cements. This paper provides a review on the possible application of nanomaterials in the cement industry where physical and mechanical characteristics of the cement can be modified to have a better resistance against corrosive environments such as CO 2 storage sites. The results obtained indicated that adding 0.5  wt% of Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) and <b>NanoGlass</b> Flakes (NGFs) can reinforce the thermal stability and coating characteristics of the cement which are required to increase the chance of survival in a CO 2 sequestrated site.

40|$|Rare earth (RE) doped {{oxyfluoride}} {{glass ceramics}} possess interesting optical properties with applications in telecommunications and optoelectronics, such as solid state lasers, optical amplifiers, etc. These materials combine the transparency and mechanical and chemical resistance of aluminosilicate glasses with the low phonon energy and facile incorporation of RE ions in the fluoride crystals. The incorporation of RE ions in the crystalline phases enhances the laser emission intensity, a major property of these materials. Transparency is achieved when crystal size {{is in the}} nanometric scale, usually below 40 nm, which avoids light scattering. A strict control of the nucleation and crystal growth processes is therefore necessary which requires a deep knowledge of the crystallisation mechanisms. The great activity and publications in this field in the last decades merit a review providing a comparative study of the different <b>nanoglass</b> ceramic systems, their structural and optical characterisation and their main properties and applications.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and energy conversion and redistribution pathways in collisions of nanocrystals with bare solid surfaces and with adsorbed liquid films are investigated with molecular dynamics simulations. While impact of an ordered Cu 14, icosahedral cluster on a bare C u (l l 1) surface at velocities larger than thermal leads to various outcomes including implantation, indentation, disordering, and spreading, deposition into a low-density liquid film (argon) results in efficient energy {{transfer to the}} liquid which for incidence velocities as high as 2 - 4 km/s can lead to controlled soft landing of a crystalline cluster on the solid substrate. For an incidence velocity of 2 km/s the cluster does not melt, maintaining its icosahedral structure, while for a velocity of 4 km/s the cluster superheats and melts and subsequently recrystallizes after soft landing on the C u (l l 1) surface. In collisions of the cluster with a higher-density liquid (xenon), with incidence velocities of 2 - 4 km/s, a larger fraction of the cluster translational energy is converted into internal energy of the cluster than {{in the case of}} the argon film. Such collisions lead to rapid attenuation of the cluster incident velocity, accompanied by ultrafast heating to high temperatures, superheating, and melting of the cluster. For certain impact velocities, e. g., 2 km/s into xenon, fast cooling via heat transport into the fluid can quench the metallic cluster into a glassy state. The branching ratios for conversion, partitioning, and dissipation of the incidence translational energy of the projectile cluster into internal degrees of freedom of the cluster and those of the target fluid are determined by the relative mass densities and sound velocities of the two materials. New methods for controlled growth of nanophase materials and for preparation of <b>nanoglass</b> aggregates, based on cluster deposition onto liquids, are suggested. 1...|$|E
40|$|While the {{standard}} beam-induced deposition {{approach is to}} grow deposits on a substrate, deposition of self-supporting suspended structures {{can be obtained by}} slowly moving the beam laterally from an elevated edge, in order to grow an overhanging deposit behind the beam path. An example of nanofabrication by lateral-EBID is given in fig. 1, where a suspended nanowire has been deposited across two vertical pillars. The structure is obtained (fig. 1 c) by moving the electron beam from the top of left pillar toward the right one with a scan speed of 33 nm/s, at steps of 5 nm, under a Pt-metallorganic gas flow. As indicated by the lateral dimensions in fig. 1 a and fig. 1 b, an advantage of this deposition method is the high lateral resolution {{because of the lack of}} secondary emissions from the substrate, that enlarge the deposit footprint well above the beam spotsize. The growth mechanism at the basis of lateral deposition, as proposed by Liu and co-workers, is depicted in fig. 2, where a gaussian electron beam, positioned over a thin edge and then moved to the right, is considered. On the first spot, the beam generates a gaussian deposit above (A) and below (B) the edge (because of the deep electron penetration), having a volume and gaussian width which are proportional to the beam dwell time and also depend on the beam shape. When the beam is shifted laterally it falls on a point of the deposit that may be above (O 1 a), at the same level of (O 2), or below (O 3 b) the edge, depending on the amplitude of the shift, and thus give rise to upward (A 1 B 1), parallel (A 2 B 2) or downward (A 3 B 3) growth, respectively. If the lateral shift is much larger than the deposit width, lateral growth doesn’t take place. The process is ruled by the interplay of several parameters, such as the deposition rate, the beam dwell time, the lateral shift amplitude and the beam shape. In most studies, these are often resumed into the beam shift speed which is also a reasonable parameter for a given beam shape and gas flux. A major capability offered by lateral deposition is the three-dimensional (3 D) nanofabrication. Matsui and co-workers demonstrated the potentiality of the technique with several examples of both functional (nanocoils, electrical circuit elements, nanogrippers) and artwork shapes (<b>nanoglass)</b> produced with IBID of carbon precursor. In the case of EBID, Ooi and co-workers presented the fabrication of tools and probes based on suspended nanowires for the manipulation and observation, with SNOM microscopy, of DNA fibers. The structures were realized by lateral-EBID of carbon-contamination gas. Another noteworthy example are the 10 nm-size nanotweezers, with a gap of 25 nm, fabricated at the ends of conventional Si microtweezers by lateral-EBID of C contamination by Boggild et al. Several works were devoted to the study of the growth mechanism and material properties. EBID of 3 D freestanding nanostructures from a Cu precursor was explored by Utke et al [...] Suspended horizontal nanorods were used as a support for the growth of vertical pillars, and it was found that the reduced thermal conductivity with respect to a bulk substrate, resulted in a thermal decomposition of the precursor with higher crystallinity of the Cu deposit. Fujita et al. fabricated 5 nm-width suspended nanowires by lateral-EBID of C contamination with a SEM. They compared the suspended growth with the one of vertical pillars and concluded that the higher resolution in the former was due to the reduced secondary electrons generation within the structure. Liu and co-workers studied the lateral deposition of W precursors with TEM high energy electrons (200 keV), deriving the growth model presented in fig. 2. Lateral EBID has been also investigated on bulk substrates. By varying the lateral scan speed, the inclination of pillars deposited from Au and Mo precursors [] and the periodicity of arch-like structures grown from Cu precursor [] have been studied. The geometry of suspended depositions, grown from a gold precursor in an environmental SEM, has also been explored []. In the following paragraphs we will focus on lateral EBID of suspended nanostructures from Pt-metallorganic and TEOS precursors, performed with an SEM. We will cover the growth mode as a function of e-beam parameters, the characterization (structure and composition) and sculpting by TEM, and, limited to the Pt structures, the thermal processing, the electrical characterization, and the structural modifications under high electrical current densities...|$|E
