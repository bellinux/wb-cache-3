25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with me because everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E

Jon Blistein of Billboard commented that the video [...] "is sweet and will probably make you smile." [...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make you fall head over heels, the gorgeous scenery surely will, as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'." [...] However, Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the video [...] "sugary". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote, [...] "Lady A's [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] video got us choked up after one viewing.

Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of [...] "cherry-picking statistics" [...] and [...] "massaging information". Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker [...] "Two of our nation's most capable public servants" [...] and said Democrats feel [...] "esteem for their professionalism".

2500|$|Firemen {{frequently}} pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. The modern closer, {{reduced to}} a one-inning role, is available to pitch more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game. Gossage had more saves {{of at least two}} innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. [...] "The times I did a one-inning save, I felt guilty about it. It's like it was too easy", said Gossage. ESPN.com wrote that saves have not been determined to be [...] "a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply a function of opportunities". It also noted that blown saves are [...] "non-qualitative", pointing out that the two career leaders in blown saves—Gossage (112) and Rollie Fingers (109)—were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, [...] "But {{you have to be a}} great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [...] saved many, many more than he did not save." [...] More than half of Gossage's and Fingers' blown saves came in tough save situations, where the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. [...] The pitchers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the initial situation and pitch additional innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall of Fame found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations compared to past relievers. The modern closer also earned significantly more [...] "easy saves", defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more than a one-run lead. The study offered [...] "praise to the combatants who faced more danger for more innings." ...|$|E

5000|$|There is {{no visible}} warning to {{electrified}} water. [...] Swimmers {{will be able}} to feel the electricity if the current is substantial. If the swimmers notice any unusual tingling feeling or symptoms of electrical shock, it is highly likely that stray currents exist and everyone <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> Swimmers should always swim away from the suspected current source. In most cases this means swimming away from docks and boats and toward another safer portion of the shoreline.|$|R

50|$|If the 502nd {{was going}} to rebuild, it would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and train. In {{opportunistic}} fashion, much of that training came from other units' funding.

The next two summers found it New York bound again, supporting the Army Reserve's 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate).|$|E

Illegal documents and microfilms were also smuggled out. For German transport trains, track-side employees tried to create [...] "delays".|$|R
50|$|Ran is {{involved}} in the transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope by interacting with karyopherins and changing their ability to bind or release cargo molecules. Cargo proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) are bound by importins and transported into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin and releases the import cargo. Cargo that <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the nucleus into the cytoplasm binds to exportin in a ternary complex with RanGTP. Upon hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP outside the nucleus, the complex dissociates and export cargo is released.|$|R

But I felt there was {{a part of me that}} really <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> express myself in ways that were beyond just musical—something that was dramatic and flamboyant and beyond myself in a way.
