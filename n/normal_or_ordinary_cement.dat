Mechanical properties of concrete including compressive strength and flexural strength were measured. Phase composition of samples was determined by means of x-ray diffraction (XRD). Results indicate that increasing flexural stress ratios reduced compressive strength and flexural strength of concrete, and presented higher improvement of mineral admixtures in concrete strength. Incorporation of mineral admixtures and air-entraining agent decreased the loss of concrete strength.

40|$|Without using strong {{alkaline}} solution <b>or</b> <b>ordinary</b> Portland <b>cement,</b> a new structural binder consisting of fly ash and hydrated lime was hardened through an intensified pozzolanic reaction.

A series of experiments consisting of mechanical testing (compressive and flexural strength, modulus of elasticity), X-ray diffraction, and measurements of the heat of hydration, pore structure, and shrinkage were conducted. These tests show that this new fly ash-based mortar has a compressive strength of 15 MPa at 91 days without any silica fume addition or initial thermal treatment. The strength increased to over 50 MPa based on the acceleration of the intensified pozzolanic reaction from the silica fume addition and initial thermal treatment. This is explained by a significant synergistic effect induced by the silica fume. It intensifies the pozzolanic reaction under thermal treatment and provides a space filling effect.

30|$|However, Ronda (2013) cited {{that all}} the {{teachers}} in the LS group commented that, “they used the strategies learned during the Lesson Study to teach the succeeding topics but went back to their old way of teachings”. Ronda stressed {{that there is a need}} to find ways of sustaining teachers in their effort to improve their own teaching and further pointed out that, though the innovation of LS was effectively practiced, it did not result in the level of adaptation found in the United States. Ebaeguin and Stephens (2015) confirmed this in the result of his investigation on the adaptation and cultural transition of the implementation of LS in non-Japanese context, the Philippines. He found out that it is necessary to consider the existing habits and values teachers have in a particular school that may support the implementation of LS because if not taken into consideration possible cultural barriers in transferring and implementing LS into a different national context may lead to delay in reaping its benefits, if not wastage of time, effort and resources of its stakeholders. He also stressed that fidelity approach should be taken into consideration by asking what skills and knowledge teachers need in order to implement LS faithfully. Nonetheless, Laynesa et al. (2013) also concluded in their reports that the positive response of the teachers under study signifies that the approach is possible in the Philippines, that eventually, teachers will regard the practice as a <b>normal</b> <b>or</b> <b>ordinary</b> occurrence. However, they are quick to point out that LS is not yet widely in use in the Philippines and initial barriers to its implementation included negative feelings experienced by the teachers at the onset. Nevertheless, Stigler and Hiebert (1999); Yoshida (1999 a, b) have seen LS as a promising school-based TPD activity which can be used in the Philippines.|$|R
25|$|White Portland <b>cement</b> <b>or</b> white <b>ordinary</b> Portland <b>cement</b> (WOPC) {{is similar}} to <b>ordinary,</b> grey, Portland <b>cement</b> in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour {{requires}} high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|R

The testing program me considers aspects of engineering properties fundamental to embankment d am construction.

Since the stabilized material will require protection by a durable facing, the durability of the materials are considered, b u t to a limited extent, as are the thermal properties. Further research is required to investigate the suitability of the presently accepted durability test methods which appear to be to o harsh for soil-lime.

This improvement can be mainly attributed to the large surface area of nano-silica particles, which has pozzolanic and filler effects on the cementitious matrix.

Hwangtoh, a type of red clay broadly deposited around the world, has traditionally been considered an eco-friendly construction material, with bonus advantages of having health and cost benefits. Presently, Hwangtoh is not commonly used as a modern construction material due to properties such as low strength and high rates of shrinkage cracking. Recent studies, however, have shown that Hwangtoh {{can be used as}} a mineral admixture to improve the strength of concrete. In addition, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers recycled from PET bottle waste can be used to control shrinkage cracks in Hwangtoh concrete. Therefore, in this study, performance verification is conducted on newly developed Hwangtoh concrete mixed with short recycled PET fibers.
