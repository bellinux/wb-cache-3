This was a critical finding, for the United States Constitution, various rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Montana statehood act, and federal law gave title to the beds of <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> to the state, and the state {{had the right to}} regulate access and use of its property.

25|$|There are {{situations}} where the Court has original jurisdiction, such as when two states have a dispute against each other, or {{when there is a}} dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include United States v. Texas, a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and Virginia v. Tennessee, a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v. Brailsford, parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact. Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> in New Jersey v. Delaware, and water rights between riparian states upstream of <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> in Kansas v. Colorado.|$|E

Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils. It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground, and which might discharge to <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> (as defined in the Clean Water Act) or adjoining shorelines. Secondary spill containment is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites.|$|E

25|$|The United States Merchant Marine {{refers to}} either United States {{civilian}} mariners, or to U.S. civilian and federally owned merchant vessels. Both the civilian mariners and the merchant vessels are managed {{by a combination}} of the government and private sectors, and engage in commerce or transportation of goods and services {{in and out of the}} <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> of the United States. The Merchant Marine primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime; in times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense. This is commonly achieved by commissioning unlimited tonnage Merchant Marine officers as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Naval Reserves.|$|E
25|$|The various Native American {{peoples who}} lived along its banks used the river European {{settlers}} would later name after Henry Hudson, {{the first of}} them to explore it, for commerce and trade. They {{were aware of the}} navigational hazards it offered their canoes, and built bonfires on the shores nearest tricky currents and hidden shallows. Colonists followed them as first sailing ships, then steamships, carried goods and passengers between New York City and the upper limit of <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> at Troy. Commerce sharply increased in the 1820s with the development of the Erie and Delaware and Hudson canals. The former connected the East Coast with the recently settled Midwest; the latter brought anthracite coal from Northeastern Pennsylvania to New York City. The development of the railroad in the mid-19th century took much, but not all, of this traffic, and river shipping continues today.|$|E
25|$|As noted previously, {{prior to}} SWANCC, {{virtually}} all US wetlands were, at least theoretically, subject to regulation under section 404. As federal jurisdiction is diminished, {{the responsibility to}} protect affected wetlands falls on states primarily and local governments, which also regulate some wetlands. State and local wetlands regulatory programs focus primarily upon <b>navigable</b> <b>waters,</b> tributaries, and adjacent wetlands. They supplement but do not substitute for federal jurisdiction. According to the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), 14 states {{have some form of}} regulatory program for freshwater wetlands, but they are quite variable. Differences exist in part because freshwater wetland types vary greatly across the nation and because of differing state preferences. Some of the state programs are very comprehensive, but regulations in many of the 14 states are limited by wetland size, mapping requirements, and exemptions for specified activities. According to ASWM, state regulations do not generally apply to federal lands. Some of the states with the largest isolated wetland acreages provide little or no state protection, including Alaska, Louisiana, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Nebraska, Kansas, and Mississippi.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{recognize}} {{the value of}} wetlands {{on the basis of a}} range of physical functions that they perform. One group of functions relates to water quality. Wetlands are good water filters: they remove and retain nutrients, they process chemical and organic wastes, and they reduce sediment loads to receiving waters. Wetlands also provide flood damage protection to urban and agricultural lands by storing flood waters that overflow river banks or surface waters and by collecting waters in isolated depressions. Wetlands recharge groundwater reserves that are hydrological: connected to surface waters. According to a 1995 National Research Council report, many of these functions occur irrespective of whether the wetlands are isolated or contiguous to <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> because of groundwater connections between isolate) wetlands and surface waters. Small, shallow wetlands that are isolated from rivers are frequently important to waterfowl, the NRC said, for food and forage. Also, sites that are intermittently flooded, even those that may be completely dry for several years, can be important for storing flood waters and can have distinctive water-dependent biota (plants and animals) that persist over dry intervals but return when water return to the site.|$|E
500|$|Paul opposes {{all forms}} of gun control as a {{violation}} of Second Amendment rights, including provisions of the Patriot Act. His advocacy of personal property rights includes introducing House Bill S. 890, the Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2012. Provisions of the bill include restricting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies to [...] "impinge upon states' power over land and water use." [...] The bill holds requires Federal agencies to reimburse private property owners double the amount of any economic losses arising from new Federal regulations [...] "that relate to the definition of <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> or waters of the United States", and holds the enforcement of any such regulation in abeyance until such payments are complete.|$|E
500|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for <b>navigable</b> <b>waters</b> and flood protection, among many other peacetime and wartime tasks. From 2005 to 2007, the USACE spent $9,773,662 to ensure the navigation of the Mississippi River at Randolph for boats and barges and to provide flood protection for the immediately surrounding areas of the town. Contracts include surveying and mapping, engineering and construction, as well as tasks related to conservation {{and development of the}} Mississippi River and the river basin at Randolph. Maintenance related projects include dredging of the navigable channel of the Mississippi River at Randolph to remove sedimented sand and mud. Tasks related to conservation include dike construction to protect low-lying areas at Randolph from flooding and subsequent erosion. The Navigation Bulletin No. 2, issued by the USACE in 2006, describes a stone dike construction at Randolph with an approximate elevation of [...] at river mile 770L.|$|E
