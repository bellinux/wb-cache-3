25|$|The best {{manuscript}} of Tibullus is the Ambrosianus (A), {{which has been}} dated , whose earliest known owner was the humanist Coluccio Salutati. Two early 15th-century manuscripts are Paris lat. 7989 (written in Florence in 1423) and the Vatican MS. Ottob. lat. 1202 (also written in Florence, 1426). These form only a small share of the over 100 Renaissance manuscripts. There are also a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracts</b> from Tibullus in Florilegium Gallicum, an anthology from various Latin writers collected in the mid-twelfth century, and a few extracts in the Excerpta frisingensia, preserved in a manuscript now at Munich. Also excerpts from the lost Fragmentum cuiacianum, made by Scaliger, and now in the library at Leiden are of importance for their independence of A. It contained the part from 3.4.65 to the end, useful as fragments go as the other manuscripts lack 3.4.65. The Codex cuiacianus, a late manuscript containing Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius, is still extant.|$|E

60|$|Of the {{two works}} which now demand our report, we {{conceive}} the former {{to be by}} far the most interesting to the reader, as the latter is indisputably the most serviceable to the traveller. Excepting, indeed, the running commentary which it contains on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracts</b> from Pausanias and Strabo, it is, as the title imports, a mere itinerary of Greece, or rather of Argolis only, in its present circumstances. This being the case, surely it would have answered every purpose of utility much better by being printed as a pocket road-book of that part of the Morea; for a quarto is a very unmanageable travelling companion. The maps [2] and drawings, we shall be told, would not permit such an arrangement; but as to the drawings, they are not in general to be admired as specimens of the art; and several of them, as we have been assured by eye-witnesses of the scenes which they describe, do not compensate for their mediocrity in point of execution, by any extraordinary fidelity of representation. Others, indeed, are more faithful, according to our informants. The true reason, however, for this costly mode of publication is in course to be found in a desire of gratifying the public passion for large margins, and all the luxury of typography; and we have before expressed our dissatisfaction with Mr. Gell's aristocratical mode of communicating a species of knowledge, which ought to be accessible to a much greater portion of classical students than can at present acquire it by his means:--but, as such expostulations are generally useless, we shall be thankful for what we can obtain, and that {{in the manner in which}} Mr. Gell has chosen to present it.|$|E

First, the lifting scheme is employed to generate multiscale DEMs. The catchments {{extracted from the}} generated multiscale DEMs are then characterized based on their numbers. A power law relationship is derived between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> catchments and the kernel size.

40|$|In a document, {{the high}} {{dimensionality}} of text {{has not been}} fruitful for the task of categorization, for which, feature clustering has beenproven for text categorization problems and to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. In this paper, we propose a Self Clustering Algorithm (SC) for feature clustering in which the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> Features is obtained automatically. In this method words are represented as distributions and processed one by one sequentially. Words with specific similar feature are clustered together. A new cluster is created for a word which is notsimilar to any existing cluster. Each and Every Cluster {{is characterized by a}} membership function with statistical mean and deviation. Once all the words have been fed in, a desired <b>number</b> <b>of</b> clusters are formed, having an extracted feature. Besides the user need not specify the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> features in advance and trial -and - error for determining the appropriate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> features can be avoided. Evaluation results forthese tasks show that the proposed methodology obtains reliable performance for text classification tasks...|$|R

30|$|Data mining {{algorithms}} {{provide a}} substantial solution for extracting association rules. However, these algorithms produce a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rules, {{which do not}} allow the decision makers {{to make their own}} choice of the most interesting rules. To solve this problem, the integration of multi-criteria decision analysis within the big data platform would be practically useful for the decision makers who are suffering from a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> rules. In this approach, the huge <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> rules by the PFP-growth algorithm in Spark required the use of multi-criteria analysis ranking method that deals with a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> alternatives. Therefore, we are interested in an existing method called PROMITHEE by using a set <b>of</b> previously <b>extracted</b> rules as the alternatives to be evaluated according to given criteria in Table  2.|$|R

30|$|However, {{the success}} of this method largely depends on the {{appropriate}} selection of model parameters, namely, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> components and the rank of the factor matrices. In a simulation study, we investigated the impact of the model parameters given different underlying ictal patterns and different noise levels.

It outperformed CPD and CWT-BTD in reconstructing the time course of the ictal pattern. However, depending on the waveform of the ictal source, different rank settings were necessary. In contrast, the best model parameters for CWT-BTD were identical regardless of the underlying ictal pattern. Although CWT-BTD was less robust than CPD or H-BTD against a SNR below 0.4, one can expect lower noise levels in real EEG recordings.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> charge {{carriers}} is a suitable measure to compare lifetime measurements on organic solar cells at different intensities.

Extended lifetime measurements under constant monochromatic or white illumination at defined temperatures of 50 °C or 90 °C are done. On the one hand, we {{show that the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> charge carriers is important to determine the degree of degradation.

This is an major advantage for the realisation of accelerated lifetime measurements. Additionally, we find that not single charge carriers, but excitons cause the degradation of the observed solar cells. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Coleridge {{originally}} {{had no intention}} of making his notebooks public, but in his later years he came to think of them as a legacy to be passed down to his disciples. He even allowed his friend Robert Southey to use a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracts</b> in their collaborative work Omniana, published in 1812 and reprinted in an expanded form in 1836. In 1895 the poet's grandson Ernest Hartley Coleridge released a larger selection under the title Anima Poetæ, and the following year the scholar Alois Brandl published in Germany an edition of the first notebook. The notebooks were not made available in a complete form until Kathleen Coburn produced the lavishly annotated Bollingen Edition. Coburn began work on this in the 1930s; the first volume appeared in 1957, and the fifth and final one (completed by Anthony John Harding) in 2002, 11 years after her death.

40|$|Guaranteeing {{the quality}} <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> {{features}} that describe relevant knowledge to users or topics {{is a challenge}} because <b>of</b> the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> features. Most popular existing term-based feature selection methods suffer from noisy feature extraction, which is irrelevant to the user needs (noisy). One popular method is to extract phrases or n-grams to describe the relevant knowledge. However, extracted n-grams and phrases usually contain a lot of noise. This paper proposes a method for reducing the noise in n-grams. The method first extracts more specific features (terms) to remove noisy features. The method then uses an extended random set to accurately weight n-grams based on their distribution in the documents and their terms distribution in n-grams. The proposed approach not only reduces the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> n-grams but also improves the performance.

50|$|The first {{writer who}} {{is known to have}} {{attempted}} to obtain, on correct mathematical principles, the value of a life annuity, was Jan De Witt, grand pensionary of Holland and West Friesland. Our knowledge of his writings on the subject is derived from two papers contributed by Frederick Hendriks to the Assurance Magazine, vol. ii. (1852) p. 222, and vol. in. p. 93. The former of these contains a translation of De Witt's report upon the value of life annuities, which was prepared in consequence of the resolution passed by the states-general, on the 25th of April 1671, to negotiate funds by life annuities, and which was distributed to the members on the 30th of July 1671. The latter contains the translation of a number of letters addressed by De Witt to Burgomaster Johan Hudde, bearing dates from September 1670 to October 1671. The existence of De Witt's report was well known among his contemporaries, and Hendriks collected a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracts</b> from various authors referring to it; but the report is not contained in any collection of his works extant, and had been entirely lost for 180 years, until Hendriks discovered it among the state archives of Holland in company with the letters to Hudde.
