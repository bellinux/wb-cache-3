40|$|AbstractIn Volvox carteri adults, {{reproductive}} cells called gonidia are enclosed {{within a}} spherical monolayer of biflagellate somatic cells. Embryos must “invert” (turn inside out) {{to achieve this}} configuration, however, {{because at the end}} of cleavage the gonidia are on the outside and the flagellar ends of all somatic cells point inward. Generation of a bend region adequate to turn the embryo inside out involves a dramatic change in cell shape, plus cell movements. Here, we cloned a gene called invA that is essential for inversion and found that it codes for a kinesin localized in the cytoplasmic bridges that link all cells to their neighbors. In invA null mutants, cells change shape normally, but are unable to move relative to the cytoplasmic bridges. A <b>normal</b> <b>bend</b> region cannot be formed and inversion stops. We conclude that the InvA kinesin provides the motile force that normally drives inversion to completion...|$|E

The {{results show that the}} cross-sectional deformation and the wall thickness variation during NC bending of TA 18 tubes using a small bending radius (less than 2 times of tube outside diameter) are clearly different from that using a <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> radius (between 2 and 4 times of tube outside diameter). For <b>bending</b> with a <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> radius, with or without a mandrel, the distribution of the flattening in the bending area resembles a platform and an asymmetric parabola, respectively. For bending with a small bending radius, with or without a mandrel, the flattening both distributes like a parabola, but the former has a stable peak which deflects toward the initial bending section, and the latter has a more pronounced peak with a bending angle and deflects slightly toward the bending section. The wall thickness variations with a <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> radius, with and without a mandrel, both resemble a platform when the bending angle exceeds a certain angle. For the bending with a small radius, the distribution of the wall thickness variation without a mandrel follows an approximate parabola which increases in value as the bending angle increases. If a mandrel is used, the thickening ratio increases from the initial bending section to the bending section...|$|R

However, several different operational modes (imaging, force versus distance and lateral force), need to be deployed {{in order to gain}} insight into the structure, tribiological and mechanical properties. A new method, based on a variation of the force versus distance mode, has been developed. In essence, a coupling of the deformational modes of the probe is exploited whereby the tip is induced to undergo lateral travel in response to application of an out-of-plane force (and thus <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> of the force-sensing lever). The lateral travel induces in-plane forces that are then measurable as a consequence of stimulation of the 'buckling' deformational mode of the lever.

It develops the subject by first assessing the flow characteristics of the Großer Windkannal (GroWiKa) in the Hermann-Föttinger Institute (HFI) at the Technical University of Berlin and continues with establishing the effectiveness of local flow control on the Reasearch Wind Turbine (BeRT) designed by the institute. It is divided into six chapters; the first chapter gives an overview of the literature review required, to study the different methodologies used during the experiments. In following the different experimental set-ups used will be explained, which will lead to the presentation of the different characteristics of the flow into the settling chamber of GroWiKa, so that its effects on the wind turbine can be evaluated by means of pitot tubes and hot-wires. Chapter 4 reflects the different effects of blockage calculated during the experiments and its corrections for a blockage of 40 %, while chapter 5 gives an overview on the system dynamics of the flaps, where three servos has been used and compared with each other, in order to give an assesment on its effectiveness for the rotative system.

It is gaining increased interest for its capability to excite {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) microcantilevers with wide frequency bandwidth in liquid environments yielding clean resonance peaks without spurious resonances.

However, photothermal efficiency is low, which means {{a large amount of}} laser power is required for a given mechanical response.

In the following study, laser {{ultrasonic detection}} {{is used for the}} experimental study of spurious normal vibration modes of a disk quartz sensor excited by a voltage pulse. The AT cut crystal (cut of the crystal relative to the the main crystallographic axis is 35. 25) is optimal for generating mainly thickness–shear vibrations (central frequency 6 MHz) on the quartz surface. However, resulting from shear-to-longitudinal and shear-to-surface mode conversion, and from the weak coupling with the other crystallographic axes, other modes (thickness-compressional and bending modes) are always present in the plate response. Since the laser vibrometer is sensitive to normal displacements, the laser investigation shows waves that can be considered as unwanted for the AT quartz used as a shear sensor.

Bone mending stiffness is evaluated in relation to microscopic changes in cortical bone and Norland bone mineral analysis. Restraint in the semireclined position is found to produce regional losses of bone most obviously in the anterior-proximal tibiae. After six months of restraint, the greatest losses of bone mineral in the proximal tibiae range from 23 percent to 31 percent; the largest changes in bone stiffness range from 36 percent to 40 percent.

40|$|The {{failure of}} wing panels {{on a number}} of TBF- 1 and TBM- 1 {{airplanes}} in flight has prompted several investigations of the possible causes of failure. This report describes tests in the Langley 16 -foot high-speed tunnel to determine whether these failures could be attributed to changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the ailerons at high speeds. The tests were made of a 12 -foot-span section including the tip and aileron of the right wing of a TBF- 1 airplane. Hinge moments, control-link stresses due to aerodynamic buffeting, and fabric-deflection photographs were obtained at true airspeeds ranging from 110 to 365 miles per hour. The aileron hinge-moment coefficients were found to vary only slightly with airspeed in spite of the large fabric deflections that developed as the speed was increased. An analysis of these results indicated that the resultant hinge moment of the ailerons as installed in the airplane would tend to restore the ailerons to their neutral position for all the high-speed flight conditions covered in the tests. Serious aerodynamic buffeting occurred at up aileron angles of - 10 degrees or greater because of stalling of the sharp projecting lip of the Frise aileron. The peak stresses set up in the aileron control linkages in the buffeting condition were as high as three times the mean stress. During the hinge-moment investigation, flutter of the test installation occurred at airspeeds of about 150 miles per hour. This flutter condition was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with this flutter condition and was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with the motion of the wing through the mass unbalance of the aileron in the normal-to-chord plane due to location of the hinge line 2. 17 inches below the center of gravity of the aileron. Flutter did not occur when the installation was stiffened to prevent chordwise motion or when the bending frequency of the aileron system was appreciably higher than that of the wing as in the complete airplane installation...|$|R

Here we propose a highly accurate method to determine κ¯ in computer simulations. It relies on the interplay between curvature stress and edge tension of partially curved axisymmetric membrane disks and requires determining their closing probability. For a simplified lipid model we obtain κ¯ and its relation to the <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> modulus κ for membranes differing both in stiffness and spontaneous lipid curvature. The elastic ratio κ¯/κ can be determined with a few percent statistical accuracy. Its value agrees with the scarce experimental data, and its change with spontaneous lipid curvature is compatible with theoretical expectations, thereby granting additional information on monolayer properties. We also show that an alternative determination of these elastic parameters based on moments of the lateral stress profile gives markedly different and unphysical values...|$|R

Estimates for two main rotor sensors (main rotor <b>normal</b> <b>bending</b> and pushrod axial load) on the Australian Black Hawk helicopter were generated from an input set that consisted of thirty standard flight state and control system parameters. These estimates were produced for two flight conditions: full speed forward level flight and left rolling pullout at 1. 5 g. Two sampling schemes were attempted, specifically k-leaders sampling and a biased sampling scheme. Ensembles were constructed from the top performing models that used conjugate gradient, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), extreme learning machines, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as the learning method. Hybrid and memetic approaches combining the deterministic optimization and evolutionary computation techniques were also explored. The results of this work show that using a biased sampling scheme significantly improved the predictions, particularly at the peak values of the target signal. Hybrid models using PSO and LM learning provided accurate and correlated predictions for the main rotor loads in both flight conditions. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
