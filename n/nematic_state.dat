It frequently {{goes by the}} common name 5CB. 5CB was first synthesized by George William Gray, Ken Harrison, and J.A. Nash at the University of Hull in 1972 {{and at the time}} it was the first member of the cyanobiphenyls. The liquid crystal was discovered after Gray's group received a grant from the UK Ministry of Defence to find a liquid crystal that had liquid crystal phases near room temperature with the specific intention of using them in liquid crystal displays. The molecule is about 20 Å long. The liquid crystal 5CB undergoes a phase transition from a crystalline state to a <b>nematic</b> <b>state</b> at 18 °C and it goes from a nematic to an isotropic state at 35 °C.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nematic</b> <b>state,</b> {{where the}} system is {{translationally}} invariant but breaks the rotational symmetry, has drawn great attentions recently due to experimental observations of such a state in both cuprates and iron-based superconductors. The mechanism of nematicity that is likely tied to the pairing mechanism of high-Tc, however, still remains controversial. Here, we studied the electronic structure of multilayer FeSe film by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found that the FeSe film enters the <b>nematic</b> <b>state</b> around 125 K, while the electronic signature of long range magnetic order has not been observed down to 20 K indicating the non-magnetic origin of the nematicity. The band reconstruction in the <b>nematic</b> <b>state</b> {{is characterized by the}} splitting of the dxz and dyz bands. More intriguingly, such energy splitting is strong momentum dependent with the largest band splitting of ~ 80 meV at the zone corner. The simple on-site ferro-orbital ordering is insufficient to reproduce the nontrivial momentum dependence of the band reconstruction. Instead, our results suggest that the nearest-neighbor hopping of dxz and dyz is highly anisotropic in the <b>nematic</b> <b>state,</b> the origin of which holds the key in understanding the nematicity in iron-based superconductors.

The predicted intra-unit-cell nematic orbital order is consistent with the recent experimental reports on BaTi 2 (As,Sb) 2 O.

40|$|We {{consider}} the hydrodynamic theory {{of an active}} fluid of self-propelled particles with nematic aligning interactions. This class of materials has polar symmetry at the microscopic level, but forms macrostates of nematic symmetry. We highlight three key features of the dynamics. First, as in polar active fluids, the control parameter for the order-disorder transition, namely the density, is dynamically convected by active currents, resulting in a generic, model independent dynamical self-regulation that destabilizes the uniform <b>nematic</b> <b>state</b> near the mean-field transition. Secondly, curvature driven currents render the system unstable deep in the <b>nematic</b> <b>state,</b> as found previously.
