John Arthur {{came from a}} well-to-do family, which he upset by leaving the Episcopalian church to become a Unitarian minister. His family disowned him when he married Caroline, the {{daughter}} of a waiter. When Tunis was seven and his brother Robert five their father died of Bright's disease; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tunis side of the family attended the funeral. After his death their mother taught at Brearley School for girls in Manhattan, later moving the family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she ran a boarding house.|$|E
5|$|Senior {{officers}} of the army also met {{the leaders of the}} political parties and called on them to form the transitional government, but added that the army would control the defence and interior ministries. The meeting was also attended by: Indjai, who was later arrested; the deputy chief-of-staff General Mamadu Ture Kuruma; the heads of the army, air force and navy; the army's spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Daha Bana na Walna and four colonels; however there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incumbent PAIGC. Consultations with 23 parliamentary and extra-parliamentary parties discussed issues such as: a transitional government including, an interim president and head of the National Assembly, as well as a PAIGC-nominated prime minister other than the incumbent and a government of national unity inclusive of all parties; and the dissolution of the National Assembly with a government led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) under interim leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} in 1981, but Paramount was hesitant to release the film out of continuing concerns that the film would be misconstrued. Though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> organization had viewed the completed film, the NAACP threatened boycotts. In early 1982, the studio finally held a preview screening in Seattle and later, in August, in Denver, with mixed responses. It was finally released in the US at five Detroit theatres on November 12, 1982 for just one week, with no trailer, no poster and no promotion at all. It did no business and was shelved as uncommercial by Paramount. Dumbfounded and hurt by the film's shelving, Fuller moved to France, and never directed another American film.|$|E

5|$|This rivalry {{intensified}} when Irene fell {{seriously ill}} in May 799. With {{the backing of}} the Domestic of the Schools, Niketas Triphyllios, Aetios accused Staurakios to Irene of planning to usurp the throne. Irene held a council at the Palace of Hieria, where her powerful minister was rebuked but got off with an apology. Staurakios now began preparing his own counter stroke, bribing members of the tagmata, although he seems to have lacked supporters among the higher command echelons. Although a eunuch was legally barred from the imperial throne, Staurakios nevertheless seems to have aspired to seize it for himself. Warned by Aetios, Empress Irene issued orders in February 800 that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> military should have any contact with Staurakios. This measure curbed the latter's designs, and introduced a precarious balance between Staurakios and Aetios, the latter still supported by Niketas Triphyllios. Soon after, Staurakios fell fatally ill, reportedly coughing up blood. Nevertheless, persuaded by doctors, monks and soothsayers that he would live and become Byzantine emperor, he instigated a revolt in Cappadocia against his adversary Aetios, who had by then secured the post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme (the highest-ranked military position in the Byzantine Empire). However, even before news of the revolt, which was swiftly suppressed, reached the capital, Staurakios died on 3 June 800.|$|E

He blames the local tap water for his hair's coarseness; as for his skin color, he considers himself white, along with 84% of the Puerto Rican population.|$|E

Fifteen years later, he {{received a phone call}} from Gary Wright, the Seahawks publicity director, saying that new owner Paul Allen wanted to induct Easley into the Ring of Honor, and that no other players would receive the honor again until he accepted. Easley saw this, as well as the fact that the old ownership was now gone, as an opportunity to reconcile and re-connect with the Seahawks organization. He accepted the honor and has had cordial relations with the organization since.|$|E
500|$|English writer Brian Sibley found Travers still gun-shy {{from her}} {{experiences}} with Disney {{when he was}} hired in the 1980s to write a possible Mary Poppins sequel. Sibley reported that Travers told him, [...] "I could only agree if I could do {{it on my own}} terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust." [...] Regardless, while watching the original film together—the first time Travers had seen it since the premiere—she became excited at times and thought certain aspects were excellent, while others were unappealing. The sequel never went to production, and when approached to do a stage adaptation in the 1990s, she only acquiesced on the condition that English-born writers and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film production were to be directly involved with the musical's development.|$|E

According to a senior federal agent associated with managing security, {{the fact that no}} arrests were made by any agency during the inaugural events was unheard of for a record crowd of nearly two million gathering in Washington,D.C. In the 2009 book In the President's Secret Service, author and journalist Ronald Kessler said intelligence officials received information that individuals associated with Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based Islamist insurgency group, might try to disrupt the inauguration. More than a dozen counter-sniper teams were stationed along the inauguration parade route in response, and the criminal records of nearby employees and hotel guests were scrutinized, but no such attack took place. Kessler also reported a number of perceived inadequacies in the security during the inauguration, including an instance in which more than 100 major campaign donors and VIPs were able to board [...] "secure" [...] buses without being checked.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Douglas Avery, and was filmed in Monte Carlo in July 2000. The plot was loosely based on Martin Scorsese's 1995 crime drama movie Casino, with Minogue herself portraying a character using aspects of Sharon Stone's bored trophy wife. Dutch actor Rutger Hauer served as Minogue's on-screen mob partner and husband. According to Hauer, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> set—including the singer, and apart from Avery—knew he was appearing as a cameo. Regarding the on-screen relationship, the singer stated; [...] "In my opinion, the Rutger Hauer character {{is kind of like}} a minder or he's in charge of her, although there is that kind of strong sexual tension." [...] The artist wore three outfits in the video—a multi-coloured dress {{at the start of the}} visual, a black dress during her appearance at a casino in Monte Carlo, and a final blue cocktail dress. She had sported an estimated $2 million worth of jewellery and diamonds during filming, with a few security guards having to accompany her on the set.|$|E
500|$|The {{next season}} Kennedy's {{juvenile}} team {{made it to}} the finals. During the season, Kennedy had scored seven goals in one game and six in another and it was efforts such as those which were attracting the attention of professional hockey people. The first team to approach Kennedy was the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, although for Kennedy [...] "It was a boyhood dream to play for Toronto." [...] Dinty Moore, also of Port Colborne, brought Kennedy to the attention Montreal General Manager Tommy Gorman and Kennedy was put on their negotiation list. In the fall of 1942, Montreal contacted the sixteen-year-old about joining the Canadiens. Kennedy's mother was wary of a career in hockey for her son as he was also headed towards studying business at the University of Western Ontario. She agreed to let her son attend the training camp when Montreal scout Dinty Moore assured her Ted was going to receive a good education at Montreal's prestigious Lower Canada College {{and they were going to}} cover the cost. Upon arriving in Montreal, foreshadowing future troubles, Kennedy discovered there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Canadiens to greet him at the train. The teenager was left to his own devices to check into a hotel and make his way around the new city. Then later, as he tried to combine hockey and school, he became concerned his studies were suffering and approached Canadien management to ask if they could find him accommodation closer to the school. He felt they were unresponsive and he soon became disillusioned with the experience in Montreal. After three weeks in Montreal he was feeling homesick and upon completing spring training with the Montreal Royals, he returned to Port Colborne in mid-November.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of Supernaturals first season, Morgan was {{also working on}} the shows Weeds and Grey's Anatomy, so he was often traveling {{back and forth between}} Los Angeles and Vancouver, British Columbia. This interfered at times with Morgan's acting, as he had trouble getting [...] "Winchester-y enough" [...] after portraying the nice character of Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy. Morgan commented, [...] "I was stuck in Denny-land, where I was being too nice. Winchester's harder to find. Denny's more me. He's an intense guy, John is. And Denny, for a guy who's having trouble living, he's just a charming dude." [...] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for Supernaturals second season due to his role on Grey's Anatomy. Although he lent his voice for the third season episode [...] "Long-Distance Call," [...] future appearances of Morgan as the character after the second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule. Nevertheless, both Kripke and writer Sera Gamble have stated that they [...] "would love to have him back." [...] The scheduling conflict has continued into the sixth season of Supernatural, with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the writers had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] instead of Ellen Harvelle, but due to concerns {{that they would not be}} able to secure Morgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they would have (temporarily) return in the episode. During the {{production of}} the fifth season, Morgan had an interview with MovieWeb in which he stated that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed the desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed to be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and he felt that John's storyline had ended too soon.|$|E
