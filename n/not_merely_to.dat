5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>to</b> Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma {{of the classical}} unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which I have described eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism.

25|$|Problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) is {{a principle}} {{based on the}} educational philosophy of the French educationalist Célestin Freinet in the 1920s, and is used in many subject areas including medicine.

50|$|According to Ryle, mental {{processes}} are merely intelligent acts. There are no mental {{processes that are}} distinct from intelligent acts. The operations of the mind are <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> represented by intelligent acts, {{they are the same}} as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing are <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> clues <b>to</b> hidden mental processes or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those mental processes or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions are <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> clues <b>to</b> modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.|$|R

25|$|He made {{it clear}} that the Church's aim was <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>to</b> help the {{faithful}} make due satisfaction for their sins, but chiefly to bring them to greater fervour of charity. For this purpose he decreed that partial indulgences, previously granted as the equivalent of a certain number of days, months, quarantines (forty-day periods) or years of canonical penance, simply supplement, and to the same degree, the remission that those performing the indulgenced action already gain by the charity and contrition with which they do it.|$|E

These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>to</b> be lectured as they are in school.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the American {{crocodile}} consists largely of coastal areas. It {{is also found}} in river systems, but has a tendency to prefer, <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>to</b> tolerate, some level of salinity, resulting in the species congregating in brackish lakes, mangrove swamps, lagoons, cays, and small islands. Other crocodiles also have tolerance to salt water due to salt glands underneath the tongue, but the American crocodile is the only species other than the saltwater crocodile (C. porosus) to commonly live and thrive in salt water. They can be found on beaches and small island formations without any freshwater source, such as some of the many cays and islets across the Bahamas and the Caribbean. They are also found in hypersaline lakes; one of the largest known populations inhabits the Lago Enriquillo.|$|E

25|$|The Lobund Institute (Laboratory Of Biology University of Notre Dame) {{grew out}} of {{pioneering}} research in germ-free-life which began in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and {{that it can be}} prolonged through generations. But the objective was <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>to</b> answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.|$|E

Furthermore, Trimmer argues that the responsibility for educating the poor rests {{on the shoulders of}} the middle class alone. By eliminating the aristocracy from an active role in her philanthropic programs, [...] "Trimmer ensures that those who actually regulate the Sunday School curriculum are those who will both embody and perpetuate bourgeois culture". As Wills points out, this distinguishes her from other philanthropists of the time such as Hannah More.|$|E

It was also understood as {{the study of the}} operations of reason, the divine reason (logos) which governs the universe, of which human beings are a part. The goal was to find valid rules of inference and forms of proof to help people find their way in life.|$|E

The Miranda decision was intended to prevent coercion <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>to</b> require a [...] "disclosure of legal facts".

500|$|The Mathews test {{employed}} {{consists of}} three considerations: the private interests affected, the risk posed by erroneous judgement, and the government interest affected.

In analyzing the second factor, the Court stated that {{the interests of the}} parents and the child in their natural relationship are not distinct and thus the balancing factors are between the parents and the State. The Court then found that the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] burden did not fairly allocate risk and that a higher burden would be practically and symbolically important. The Court found that while the State had an interest, a higher burden would have little impact on the ability for the State to achieve its goal. Following from this review, the Court held that [...] "the State [...] support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence." ...|$|E
