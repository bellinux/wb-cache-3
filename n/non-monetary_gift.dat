40|$|We {{study the}} Lagos and Wright (2005) model of {{monetary}} exchange in the laboratory. With a finite population of sufficiently patient agents, this model {{has a unique}} monetary equilibrium and a continuum of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>gift</b> exchange equilibria, some of which Pareto dominate the monetary equilibrium. We find that subjects avoid the gift-exchange equilibria {{in favor of the}} monetary equilibrium. We also study versions of the model without money where all equilibria involve non-monetary gift-exchange. We find that welfare is higher in the model with money than without money, suggesting that money plays a role as an efficiency enhancing coordination device...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>non-monetary</b> <b>gifts</b> over more highly valued and e$cient monetary transfers in social relationships. We demonstrate that under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, ine$cient <b>non-monetary</b> <b>gifts</b> will be o!ered by a donor in lieu of cash in order to signal the donor's quality of information about the recipient's preferences. This result emerges because gift giving is ine$cient relative to cash, and not because of any arbitrary assumptions regarding communication. In particular, the donor has available the strategy of o!ering cash and saying what he would have purchased. Nonetheless, there is still an important equilibrium role for buying gifts. 200...|$|R

40|$|From an {{economic}} perspective, {{the practice of}} gift-giving in social rela- tionships makes little sense due to the ineffciencies that arise from commonly mismatched gifts and preferences. This paper addresses the frequency of non- monetary gifts compared to more efficient cash transfers. While there is a vast literature concentrated on this cultural phenomenon, we examine a model {{based on the idea}} that the sentimental value of a gift can be measured in terms of the time and energy the donor spent to select a desirable gift for the recipient. We demonstrate that under a variety of circumstances, individuals choose to give <b>non-monetary</b> <b>gifts</b> over cash in order to signal to the recipient that they exerted this effort.

40|$|In this study, we {{consider}} how gift-exchange and bonus systems {{function in a}} natural field setting by measuring the effort response of participants to <b>non-monetary</b> <b>gifts</b> over time. Our field experiment tests the difference in effort response to unconditional gifts delivered immediately, promised unconditional gifts delivered later, and conditional gifts linked to reaching a specific performance target. We find important benefits from promising to give an unconditional gift later: participants respond positively to a promised gift twice by increasing effort when the gift is promised and again when it is received. A promised gift outperforms both the unconditional gift delivered immediately, {{which leads to a}} single positive response, and the conditional gift based on performance, which does not trigger any significant behavioural change after the gift is delivered. The study lends insights into the relativ...|$|R

The {{crime of}} bribery is {{described}} in Section 1 as occurring when a person offers, gives or promises to give a [...] "financial or other advantage" [...] to another individual in exchange for [...] "improperly" [...] performing a [...] "relevant function or activity". Section 2 covers the offence of being bribed, which is defined as requesting, accepting or agreeing to accept such an advantage, in exchange for improperly performing such a function or activity. [...] "Financial or other advantage" [...] is not defined in the Act, but, according to Aisha Anwar and Gavin Deeprose in the Scots Law Times, [...] "could potentially encompass items such as contracts, <b>non-monetary</b> <b>gifts</b> and offers of employment". The [...] "relevant function or activity" [...] element is explained in Section 3it covers [...] "any function of a public nature; any activity connected with a business, trade or profession; any activity performed {{in the course of}} a person's employment; or any activity performed by or on behalf of a body of persons whether corporate or unincorporated". This applies to both private and public industry, and encompasses activities performed outside the UK, even activities with no link to the country. The conditions attached are that the person performing the function could be expected to be performing it in good faith or with impartiality, or that an element of trust attaches to that person's role.|$|R
40|$|Starting from a {{definition}} {{of the concept of}} development centered on the satisfaction of the essential needs, health, education, feeding, we show that the present pattern of development, while trying to impose Western values all over the world, prevents developing countries from building their future and, on the contrary, maintains them under the domination of Occidental countries. If the liberalism carried out during the twenty last years accelerated the merchandization of the world, capitalist system in its mondialized version has to be re-examined. Maximum profit research, primacy of private economic values, competition and technical progress must be questioned. The other development wants, starting from the current situation, to take the measurement of the essential changes that we must implement as quickly as possible. Thus, in order to replace humans at the center of economic system, we have to grant a more important place to the non-commercial activities and the <b>non-monetary</b> relations, like <b>gift,</b> which implies to reconsider the unlimited growth target and to define a new measurement of wealth. We will be able to avoid the ecological disaster announced only by reintroducing ethical and moral values and by adopting with respect to technical progress a principle of reason.
