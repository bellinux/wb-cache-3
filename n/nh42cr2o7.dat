50|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1863. NH4Cr(NCS)4(NH3)2 is prepared by treatment of molten NH4SCN (melting point around 145-150 °C) with (<b>NH4)2Cr2O7.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ammonium {{dichromate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula (<b>NH4)2Cr2O7.</b> In this compound, {{as in all}} chromates and dichromates, chromium is in a +6 oxidation state, commonly known as hexavalent chromium. It is a salt consisting of ammonium ions and dichromate ions.|$|E
50|$|The (<b>NH4)2Cr2O7</b> crystal (C2/c, z=4) {{contains}} a single type of ammonium ion, at sites of symmetry C1(2,3). Each NH4+ centre is surrounded irregularly by eight oxygen atoms at N—O distances ranging from ca. 2.83 to ca. 3.17 Å, typical of hydrogen bonds.|$|E
50|$|Gel-like Chromium(III) {{phosphate}} {{is prepared}} through {{the reduction of}} ammonium dichromate, (<b>NH4)2Cr2O7,</b> using ethanol, CH3COOH, and nitric acid, HNO3. This process {{is done in the}} presence of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and urea at an elevated temperature where tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTBr) is used as structure directing agent.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Few {{drops of}} ethanol {{are added to}} a small pile of {{ammonium}} dichromate ((<b>NH4)2Cr2O7)</b> and ignited. Sparks are emitted and an ash-like product is formed. The phenomenon resembles the eruption of a volcano. The reaction starts at 180 °С, becoming self-sustaining at approximately 225 °С.|$|E
