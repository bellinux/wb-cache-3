From the experience of Trogir Municipal Museum it is clear that certain rules need abiding by, rules that are different for each social network and for blogs as well. However, some of the universal criteria are: the need for the clear determination of shortterm and long-term goals; consistency; need for high quality, interesting, relevant and reliable contents and the correct grammar and usage in which they are framed; and two-way communications. If we also literally abide by the rules of museology and communications science, the Internet, with all the modern possibilities that it offers, can indeed become a window onto traditional culture and art, a custodian of the heritage and promoter of inherited values. Museums have at their disposal such a vivid and impressive language that they can present everything to everyone, and in the new, virtual, Internet age – when the rule that if it is not online it did not even happen holds true – the possibilities for presentation are day by day more and more accessible and numerous.

U radu se iznose rezultati istraživanja do kojih se došlo analizom dokumentacije Hrvatskoga centra za dječju knjigu i koji govore o nakladništvu suvremene slikovnice, kao i spoznaje o jeziku slikovnica. Slikovnica predstavlja prvi susret djeteta s književnošću i pisanom riječju općenito, a ostvaruje se u čovjekovu najosjetljivijem razdoblju, djetinjstvu, pa je stoga nužno voditi brigu o kvaliteti slikovnice radi djetetove dobrobiti. Hrvatske slikovnice objavljene u prošlosti, od samih početaka pojave slikovnica pa do početka 80 -ih godina 20. stoljeća, sustavno su istražene do određene razine. No slikovnice koje su na hrvatskom tržištu i u knjižnicama prisutne u posljednjih trideset godina rijetko su predmet istraživanja. Svrha je ovoga rada aktualizirati tematiku slikovnica, produbiti svijest o važnosti postojanja kvalitetne slikovnice zbog potencijala koje posjeduje te potaknuti kontinuirana istraživanja slikovnice u različitim znanstvenim i umjetničkim područjima. Early literacy {{has recently}} become a current topic, and there’s a widespread belief that literacy startsdeveloping {{almost as soon}} as the child is born, if the child is surrounded with adequate materials and persons who will motivate the development of literacy. The first structured reading materials that a child interacts with are picture-books. It is usually the first contact a child has with literature and a written word in general, and it happens during childhood, the child 2 ̆ 7 s most sensitive period, which is why it is important to pay special attention to the quality of picture-books. Croatian picture-books published till the early 80 ies of the past century have been investigated to a some extent. However, the picture-books found on the Croatian market and in the libraries in the past 30 years {{have been the subject of}} research only sporadically. There 2 ̆ 7 s little data on the quality and features of this multifunctional material that is of such great importance for children. The aim of the paper is to give an overview of the relevant data found in literature on the historical development of picture-book publishing, their features, functions they help develop, their age-appropriateness, and quality. The paper presents research results stemming from the analysis of the Croatian Children 2 ̆ 7 s Book Centre documentation on contemporary picture-book publishing and data on the language of picture-books that are the result of a picture-book corpus study made as part of the PhD research by the author. The data on contemporary authors and illustrators was obtained by analysing the documentation of the Croatian Library Association, Commission for library services for children and youth. The language of the picture-book corpus was analysed using a computer programme, i. e. the analysis was conducted of the lexical diversity of picture-books for three-year olds. The picture-books have not been investigated from the linguistic perspective before, which makes this research innovative. The findings and results of this research can be applicable in picture-book publishing, first of all in changing the attitude of publishers, i. e. their approach to age-appropriateness and quality of picture-books. The aim of the paper is to give on overview of the picture-book situation, trying to raise awareness of the importance of their quality and potential, and spark off further picture-book research in different fields of arts and sciences. Thus, this paper will have an indirect practical value that may affect the current practice...|$|E

Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 447 građana, a u ispitivanju je korišten anketni upitnik konstruiran za potrebe istraživanja. Rezultati su obrađeni i interpretirani u odnosu <b>na</b> spol, <b>dob,</b> stupanj obrazovanja i stupanj urbaniziranosti sredine u kojoj ispitanici žive. Rezultati pokazuju da mlađi ispitanici podupiru korištenje NE, kao i većina muških ispitanika, dok ispitanici iznad 24 godine starosti i ispitanice misle suprotno. Za stanovnike Zagreba korištenje NE nije opravdano kao ni ideja izgradnje odlagališta u RH. Općenito, negativan stav prema izgradnji odlagališta u RH ima polovica ispitanika u ukupnom uzorku. Glavni razlozi zabrinutosti građana su opasnost po zdravlje ljudi i sigurnost za okoliš. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the familiarity of the Croatian citizens with the issue of radioactive waste management, their opinion on the idea of building a radioactive waste landfill in the Republic of Croatia, potential concern and its determinants. The research was conducted on a sample of 447 Croatian citizens using a questionnaire designed for the purpose of the research. Results were processed and interpreted depending on the gender, age, educational level and urbanization of the area the examinees live in. The results have shown that the younger examinees support the use of nuclear energy as well as most of the male examinees, while the examinees older than 24 and the female examinees think the opposite. For the residents of Zagreb, the use of nuclear energy isn’t justified, nor is the idea of building a landfill in the Republic of Croatia. In general, a negative stance towards building the landfill in Croatia is shared by half {{of the total number of}} examinees.

Osim toga, željelo se ustanoviti razlikuju li se pojedini dijelovi populacije starih slijepih osoba u svojem bračnom i obiteljskom statusu s obzirom <b>na</b> spol, <b>dob,</b> mjesta prebivanja i vrijeme nastanka oštećenja vida. U tu svrhu provedeno je anketno istraživanje na uzorku od l 74 ispitanika s područja cijele Hrvatske, među slijepim osobama treće životne dobi, članova Hrvatskog društva slijepih s oštećenjem vida u zakonski određe-nim granicama. Na obiteljskom planu stare slijepe osobe susreću se sa sličnim problemima kao i općenito starija populacija. Važan problem za ovu skupinu predstavlja gubitak bračnog partnera i samački život. S procesom starenja rapidno se smanjuje broj ispitanika koji živi u potpunim obiteljima, tj. sa supružnikom i djecom. Izdvajanje iz domicilne sredine stvara svakako veće teškoće za slijepe stare osobe nego za one koje nisu slijepe. Statističkom provjerom ustanovljeno je da ispitanike, s obzirom na bračno i obiteljsko stanje, najviše diferenciraju varijable spola i dobi. Značajne promjene u obiteljskim obrascima ranije se događaju kod (slijepih) žena (između 64 i 75 godine) nego kod (slijepih) muškaraca (nakon 75 godina). Mjesto stanovanja i vrijeme gubitka vida nisu važni s aspekta bračnog i obiteljskog statusa. Stare slijepe osobe imaju uvelike pozitivan stav prema vlastitoj obitelji, ali nisu općenito zadovoljne ulogom starih ljudi u obiteljskom procesu odlučivanja. Različitisegmenti ispitanika na sličan način percipiraju obiteljski položaj starih ljudi, što znači da je utjecaj demografskih varijabli manji nego pri analizi bračnih ili obiteljskih oblika. Stupanj nezavisnosti stare slijepe osobe ovisit će uvelike o obiteljskim odnosima i izgrađenosti "potporne mreže" između naraštaja. Odvojeno življenje starih slijepih osoba od njihove djece ne mora značiti njihovu otuđenost od obitelji. lt was the {{intention}} {{in this work}} to explore the basic features of marital and family situations in elderly blind persons in Croatia, {{as well as their}} perception of their own position in the family. Furthermore, the aim was to establish whether there is a statistically significant difference among the specific parts of the population of elderly blind persons with regard to variables of gender, age, residence and time of visual impairment. Therefore, a survey was conducted on a sample of 174 examinees throughout Croatia. The sample was selected among blind persons at an advanced age who are members of the Croatian Association of the Blind and have impaired vision within legally defined limits. At the family level elderly blind persons are often confronted with similar problems shared by the elderly population in general. A significant problem for this group is the loss of amarital partner and single life. Along with the ageing process the number of examinees living in complete families, i. e. with a husband and children is rapidly falling. Isolation from the domicile environment certainly creates greater difficulties for blind persons than for those who are not. With the aid of the chi-square test it has been established that in respect to the marital and family situation the examinees are mostly differentiated by variables of gender and age. Significant changes in family patterns occur earlier in (blind) women (between 64 and 75) than in (blind) men (after 75). The domicile and time of visual impairment are not significant from the aspect of marital and family status. Elderly blind persons have a considerably positive attitude towards their families, but are not generally satisfied with the role of elderly people in the family decision-making process. Different segments of the examinees perceive similarly the elderly people 2 ̆ 7 s position in the family, meaning that the influence of demographic variables is smaller than in the analysis of marital or family forms. The degree of independence of an elderly blind person will depend significantly on family relations and the completeness of the "supporting network" between generations. By living alone, separated from their children, elderly blind persons do not necessarily have to be alienated from their families. Ziel dieser Arbeit war, die Hauptmerkmale des ehelichen und forniličren Status der člteren Blindenpopulation zu ermitteln sowie die Art und Weise, wie die untersuchten Personen selbst ihren forniličren Status wahrnehmen. Man wollte auBerdem sehen, ob es statistiseh wesentliche Unterschiede gibt zwischen einzelnen Teilen dieser Bev 61 kerungsgruppe im Hinblick auf Ehestand und Familienverheltnisse, genauer: im Hinblick auf die Variablen Geschlechtszugeh 6 rigkeit, Altersgruppe, Wohnort und Dauer der Sehbehinderung. lu diesem lweck wurde eine Umfrage unter 174 Personen aus ganz Kroatien durchgefUhrt.

Emocionalna inteligencija predstavlja sposobnost prepoznavanja, kontroliranja, izražavanja te razumijevanja misli i osjećaja. Medicinske sestre koje posjeduju emocionalnu inteligenciju usrećuju svoje pacijente i čine ih zadovoljnijima. Emocionalna inteligencija čini medicinske sestre otvorenijima, komunikativnijima, empatičnima i punim razumijevanja i strpljenja što pacijenta potiče na otvaranje osjećaja, na povezivanje sa medicinskim osobljem te na stvaranje povjerenja prema medicinskoj sestri koja brine o njegovom zdravlju. Cilj istraživanja je spoznati koliku razinu emocionalne inteligencije (razinu emocionalne regulacije, kontrole te emocionalnih vještina, kompetentnosti) posjeduju studenti sestrinstva. Pokušati će se utvrditi utječu li nezavisne varijable poput starosne dobi, godine studija i godine radnog staža na razvoj emocionalne inteligencije odnosno na razvoj regulacije i kontrole te na razvoj emocionalnih vještina i kompetencija. Podaci za istraživanje sposobnosti regulacije i kontrole emocija te emocionalnih vještina i kompetentnosti, prikupljeni su online anketom između studenata studija sestrinstva na Sveučilištu Sjever u razdoblju od 22. svibnja 2017. do 25. svibnja 2017. godine. Anketu je ispunilo ukupno 157 studenata studija Sestrinstva, svih godina studija. Anketa se sastoji od ukupno 6 pitanja zatvorenog tipa. U prvom dijelu obuhvaćena su pitanja koja su se odnosila <b>na</b> spol, <b>dob,</b> duljinu radnog staža te godinu studija. Drugi i treći dio provedene ankete su upitnici: upitnik emocionalne regulacije i kontrole (ERIK) te upitnik emocionalnih vještina i kompetentnosti (UEK- 15), uz pisanu suglasnost preuzeti od prof. dr. sc. Vladimira Takšića. Dobiveni rezultati pokazuju kako ispitanici, odnosno studenti studija sestrinstva u Sveučilišta Sjever postižu iznadprosječne rezultate, tj. imaju iznadprosječne sposobnosti regulacije i kontrole emocija, ali i emocionalnih vještina i kompetentnosti. Hipoteza koja je ukazivala da studenti treće godine studija posjeduju više rezultate sposobnosti regulacije i kontrole emocija, ali i emocionalnih vještina i kompetentnosti od studenata prve i druge godine studija djelomično je potvrđena jer iako je utvrđena razlike između druge i treće godine studija, nije utvrđena statistički značajna razlika između studenata prve i treće godine studija. Provjerom povezanosti godina staža u struci sa sposobnosti emocionalne regulacije i kontrole te emocionalnih vještina i kompetentnosti je utvrđeno da dob, ali ni godine staža nisu povezane s mjerama emocionalne inteligencije. Emotional {{intelligence}} {{is considered to}} be particularly important in every context, {{as well as in the}} direction of our profession, nursing. Emotional intelligence represents the ability to recognize, control, express and understand thoughts and feelings. Medical nurses who possess the ability of showing their emotional intelligence can improve their patient's well being and make them more satisfied. Emotional intelligence makes nurses more communicative, open minded, empathetic, and full of understanding which will encourage their patients to open up, connect to the medical staff and build trust with the nurse taking care of them. The aim of the research was to perceive the level of emotional intelligence (level of emotional regulation, control and emotional skills, competence) of nursing students. The goal was to try and determine whether the independent variables such as age, years of study, and years of work experience affect the development of emotional intelligence, ie. the development of regulation and control, and the development of emotional skills and competencies. Data for researching the ability to control, emotional control and emotional skills and competencies were collected through an online survey conducted by nursing students of the North University in the period from May 22 nd 2017 to May 25 th 2017. The survey was completed by a total of 157 students of Nursing studies, all years of studying included. The survey consisted of a total of 6 closed-type questions. The first part covered issues related to gender, age, length of practical experience and a current year of study. The second and third part of the conducted survey were questionnaires: Emotional Regulatory and Control Questionnaire (ERIK) and Questionnaire of Emotional Skills and Competence (UEK- 15), with written consent taken from Prof. dr. sc. Vladimir Takšić. The given results show that participants - students of nursing studies at the North University achieve above-average scores, ie. have above-average ability to regulate and control emotions as well as emotional skills and competencies. The hypothesis showing that third year students had higher results of control and emotional control skills, as well as emotional skills and competencies then the students of the first and second year was partially confirmed.

Obilježena je svojstvima pionirskih i prijelaznih vrsta drveća, osjetljiva je na ljetnu sušu, a tijekom razvoja na staništima stvara uvjete za razvoj klimatogenih šuma. Razvija se u regularnim i raznodobnim sastojinama, a u prebornim je manje zastupljena u omjeru smjese. Danas je izložena propadanju, tako da joj je postotak osutih krošanja u Hrvatskoj 59 %, i to u sastojinama koje se nalaze u najvišim debljinskim razredima, što upućuje <b>na</b> njihovu visoku <b>dob</b> i fiziološko slabljenje.

Izmjerene su {{temperature}} u posljednjih 15 godina najviše u razdoblju od 150 godina otkada se mjere. Temeljem prosječnih godišnjih temperaturnih odstupanja za Europu od 1850. do 2009. godine uočavaju se dva hladna i tri topla razdoblja. Sve to smanjuje areal na kojem smreka ima dobre uvjete za razvoj. Obična je smreka značajna i vrlo upotrebljiva vrsta kojoj moramo u gospodarskim zahvatima uvažavati biološka svojstava, ekološke zahtjeve i gospodarske vrijednosti, što će joj osigurati veću stabilnost i bolji razvoj na pogodnim staništima i u sastojinama. Common spruce (Picea abies Karst.) is a {{tree species}} that occurs naturally {{in the valleys}} and other frost sites in high mountain regions, where it is free of serious competition of other tree species. Being resistant to frost, the winter colds of the continental and mountainous climate suit it. It is highly tolerant of winter chills of the continental and mountainous climate, it likes areas with abundant precipitation and snow in particular and avoids those with little precipitation and low relative air humidity. In Croatia, it naturally occurs in high mountain areas of Gorski Kotar, Velebit {{and other parts of}} Lika, and especially in frost spots where it is free of competition with other tree species. In Europe, spruce is a favourite tree species for the establishment of forest cultures. It has the properties of both pioneer and transitional tree species. It is highly sensitive to summer droughts. During its growth, in its habitats it creates the conditions for the development of tree species of a climatogenous forest. It develops in regular and uneven-aged stands, while its percentage in selection stands with stable structural and stand conditions is lower. The total growing stock amounts to 13, 200, 000 m³, which accounts for 5. 57 m³/ha of the forested area in Croatia. Its volume share in the highest age and diameter classes is 80 %, which indicates its advanced age and physiological weakening. Regular and uneven-aged spruce forests of high silvicultural form cover an area of 6, 300 ha, of which spruce accounts for 52 % in the composition mixture, silver fir for 35 %, common beech for 11 %, and other species for 2 %. Spruce is currently significantly affected by dieback; at the level of Croatia, the percentage of defoliated crowns is 59. 3 %, while in the Gorski Kotar area alone it is 96. 2 %. Droughts {{are one of the most}} important factors contributing to the physiological weakening and dieback of spruce in Croatia, while in Europe they are the major cause of dieback of catastrophic proportions. Temperatures measured in the past 15 years are the highest in the 150 -year period, with a linear trend of temperature increase amounting to 0. 74 °C. There is controversy as to the causes of droughts: according to many, they are the consequence of global warming, whereas others disagree. Data are given (Fig. 1) on climate change from the past warm period, over the cold one, to the present warm period. Based on average annual temperature deviations for Europe from 1850 to 2009 (Fig. 2), the current warm period has had two cold and three warm sub-periods, which contradicts the frequently emphasised negative impact of man’s activity on climate. Apart from extreme droughts, another cause of spruce dieback is attributed to the impact of the unfavourable »chemical climate« and acid rains arriving most probably from the industrially developed western countries. This is the reason why the lead content in the soils of Gorski Kotar reaches the extreme values of 71 to 128 mg/kg. Accordingly, the unfavourable »chemical climate« and acid rains are the second most important reason for the dieback of not only spruce but other tree species as well (fir, beech). The third cause of dieback is the artificial and natural expansion of spruce into unsuitable sites, coupled with the absence of timely tending and regeneration procedures in natural and artificially established forest cultures. Spruce cannot be managed with the selection method because it is a pioneer species, which does not regenerate in climatogenic and coherently forested sites. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech and simultaneously disappears from such stands. Its pioneer properties enable it to expand naturally in all the empty spaces within a broad complex of beech-fir forests in particular, as well as in deforested and degraded forest areas, frost sites, abandoned pastures, meadows, degraded forests such as thickets and scrub and in other areas at higher altitudes. Most of these sites are unsuitable for spruce, causing it to physiologically weaken and decline. Methods of common spruce management used to date have in general not been adjusted to its biological properties and ecological requirements or to the newly created site conditions. In our opinion, in addition to dry periods and unfavourable impact of »chemical climate«, management methods also represent an important cause of dieback. When all the three causes take place simultaneously, the ensuing result is catastrophic dieback. Low intensity dieback occurring in every stand, including a spruce stand, is a normal phenomenon characteristic of management with natural forests and forest cultures. It is usually the consequence of competition between certain species, particularly because tending operations such as cleaning and thinning are not performed, or it is the reaction to minor local site changes. Spruce is the desirable »third species« in selection forests of fir and beech, but with a lower percentage share in the composition mix. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech to the sites from which they have disappeared for different reasons. With the return of these species, the spruce gradually undergoes physiological weakening and should generally be removed from the composition mix of selection stands by means of tending and regeneration procedures. Spruce is a tree species whose stands have been subjected either to very little tending or none at all. In regular and uneven-aged stands, regeneration procedures have generally been postponed, while in selection stands spruce has been treated like fir in the selection of trees for cutting. All this has led to the currently unfavourable status of spruce: the spruce is old, over-mature, physiologically weak and prone to dieback in all stand forms. In view of the newly created unfavourable climate conditions, as well as air, water and soil pollution, common spruce should not be expanded into inadequate sites beyond its natural distribution range. If established in southern expositions and on stony and shallow soils, it is subject to premature dieback, so timely measures should be taken to replace it with another species that tolerates such conditions. Common spruce is an important, noble and highly usable species and it should not be neglected in future management. Better knowledge should be acquired of its biological properties, ecological requirements and commercial value. These silvicultural-management properties should be fully observed in the application of management procedures...|$|R
