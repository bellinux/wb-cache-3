5000|$|A <b>non-signatory</b> <b>party</b> of the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation, Pakistan is an {{influential}} {{member of the}} IAEA. In recent events, Pakistan has blocked an international treaty to limit fissile material, arguing that the [...] "treaty would target Pakistan specifically". In the 20th century, Pakistan's nuclear deterrence program focused on countering India's nuclear ambitions in the region, and nuclear tests by India eventually led Pakistan to reciprocate to maintain a geopolitical balance as becoming a nuclear power. Currently, Pakistan maintains a policy of credible minimum deterrence, calling its program vital nuclear deterrence against foreign aggression.|$|E
40|$|Tesis (master en derecho internacional (LL. M.) de la inversión, el comercio y arbitraje) This thesis {{concerns}} {{the issue of}} third <b>non-signatory</b> <b>parties</b> and analyses under what circumstances they should be bound by an arbitration agreement not signed by them. First {{it refers to the}} effects of signing an arbitration agreement between the parties, and then analyses the different theories that eventually could support an extension of the arbitration agreement to third parties. Also, it refers to the legislation of different countries and the treatment courts dispense on this subject, as well as to some international rules to discover which approaches are contained in those rules. It concludes by referring to the most important trends existing presently regarding the subject, used by arbitral tribunals to bring third <b>non-signatory</b> <b>parties</b> into arbitration proceeding...|$|R
40|$|The 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act (AWSA) is {{the current}} {{standard}} for what a comprehensive, negotiated settlement can achieve in terms of water rights reallocation, water resource management, and water supply reliability enhancement. This note reviews the flows of money and water specified in Titles I and II of the AWSA to identify the signatory and <b>non-signatory</b> <b>parties</b> that benefit from the settlement and the allocation of costs between the various parties to the agreement. Opportunity costs are also considered. Innovative elements of the agreement are discussed particularly those that improve water supply reliability for the Gila River Indian Community and third parties. The central roles of water resource management tools and market mechanisms in the AWSA are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate over whether the Mk 211 {{projectile}} is legal to use against personnel, {{or if it is}} strictly anti-matériel ammunition. The International Committee of the Red Cross has sought to have the ammunition banned, due to concern over the incendiary and explosive components and their effect on personnel. Under the Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 the [...] "military or naval" [...] use of explosive or incendiary projectiles with a mass of under 400 grams is forbidden. Very few nations were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration, however, and that declaration does not govern the conduct of <b>non-signatory</b> <b>parties.</b> Further, the Hague treaties of 1899 and 1907 - which superseded the St. Petersburg Declaration, and were signed by a far wider circle of nations - do permit the use of such ammunition for auto-cannons and heavy machine guns. Machine guns firing [...]50 cal/12.7mm ammunition are heavy machine guns. At best, the ICRC's position can be applied to only a small group of nations that were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration; at worst, the ICRC's position is made moot by more than 100 years of subsequent international treaties.|$|R

40|$|Arizona {{like many}} other {{semi-arid}} regions {{in the world is}} facing a suite of policy issues that stem from water scarcity and security of supply issues intersecting with growing and competing water demands. A vexing issue in southern Arizona has been the preservation of riparian habitat. The study of environmental economics provides researchers with techniques to estimate the value of natural resources, such as riparian habitat, {{to level the playing field}} in policy discussions on development and water management. In Appendices B-D results from two hedonic property analyses suggest that homebuyers, one of the main consumers of riparian habitat in urban areas, have preferences for greener and higher condition riparian habitat and furthermore that they are willing to pay property premiums to benefit from this resource. There is also some evidence that riparian habitat conservation and restoration can be self-financing. The economics of another water using sector in the state, the recreation sector, specifically winter-based recreation, is assessed in Appendix E. The analysis finds that although ski areas in Arizona are subject to large inter-year variability in terms of snowfall and season length that snowmaking adaptations, a technology that is water-intensive, is financially feasible in the medium term as a climate variability and climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, ski areas in the state are likely to face increased financial pressures if climate change scenarios are realized and will have to implement other adaptation strategies to remain viable. Finally, water competition in the state between Indian and non-Indian users and the techniques used to dispel such tensions, namely water settlements, are discussed in Appendix F. The research finds that settlements offer opportunities for win-win agreements between the settling tribe and other water users in the same watersheds and for the introduction of new water supply management tools that benefit signatory and <b>non-signatory</b> <b>parties</b> alike...|$|R
40|$|Globalized {{commerce}} and its characteristically complex production and supply chains have shaped {{the way the}} concept of contracting is perceived today. It is no longer appropriate to view commercial contracts as singular, exclusive, and private acts between two sovereign participants. Modern business operations form much more intricate contractual phenomena, multilateral contractual chains or networks that, when observed together, constitute entire contractual complexes, which allow the contracting entities to pursue their own, often intertwined interests most efficiently. The interrelation of interests renders these contractual creatures extremely volatile. The dependence on a successful performance of not only one's own contractual counterparty, {{but also on the}} performance of extra-contractual participants – a subcontractor, an execution assistant, or other related third party – is emphasized. When disputes arise, commercial conflicts, neither, can be viewed as singular, exclusive and private anomalies in a relationship between two sovereign participants. Instead, a disturbance in one relationship may cause ripple effects that penetrate the entire contractual complex. Multi-party arrangements transform into multi-party conflicts. 	 Arbitration has steadily grown in significance as the principal system of commercial dispute resolution. With the number of multi-party disputes constantly growing, the status of <b>non-signatory</b> third <b>parties</b> in the proceedings exerts pressure on the institution of international arbitration to evolve to satisfy the needs of its core audience. Central to the discussion is the dichotomy between market realities of globalized business on one hand, and the consensual nature of arbitration on the other. This thesis addresses the status of non-signatories in international commercial arbitration, providing an analytical summary of (i) the formation and limits of the contemporary legal framework for international commercial arbitration, (ii) the choice-of-law issues encountered in non-signatory situations, and (iii) the practical legal constructions employed to address the status of non-signatories, including a possibility for a hybrid non-signatory theory. The conclusion of the thesis is that a universal approach to the non-signatory issue does not come in a form of transnationalist application of supra-national rules (at times referred to as the new lex mercatoria). Instead, the contemporary approach to non-signatory issues is one of transnational territorialism, i. e. application of internationally harmonized legislative framework in conjunction with pertinent national legislation...|$|R
40|$|The crucial {{statutory}} provision that governs {{the validity of}} arbitration agreements in China is Article 16 of the Arbitration Law (AL), which stipulates, “An arbitration agreement shall include arbitration clauses stipulated in the contract and agreement of submission to arbitration that are in writing before or after disputes arise. ” Further, “[a]n arbitration agreement shall contain the following particulars: (1) an expression of intention to arbitrate; (2) matters for arbitration; and (3) a designated arbitration commission. ” It {{is clear from the}} first paragraph of Article 16 that parties’ agreement to arbitrate must be made in writing. The writing requirement tends to clarify the issue of whether parties have actually consented to arbitration. 5 That said, however, the AL fails to define what forms might satisfy the provision’s writing requirement. With respect to this issue, an indirect answer may be found by referring to Article 11 of the Contract Law (the CL), which stipulates that “written contracts” refer to “contracts signed in written instruments such as letters and electrically or electronically transmitted documents. ” The jurisprudence on this issue, however, has been restricted to “signature-based consent” without taking up the scenario in which the consent to arbitrate is manifested by other means. It is true that consent will be easily established if the arbitration agreement is signed by both parties. However, this may not always be the case in modern arbitration practice. According to a premier international arbitrator, Jingzhou Tao, the “written” requirement shall be stipulated dynamically in light of the rapid development of modern means of communications and for the convenience of transactions. Problematic situations often arise as to whether a <b>non-signatory</b> third <b>party</b> can be bound by the arbitration agreement, a situation that is seen frequently with the rising use of arbitration in China; in particular, to what extent the “written form” can be upheld in cases of contract assignment, agency relationship, etc. The AL is silent as to these particular issues and the vague regulation under Article 16 (1) could be interpreted to deny the validity of arbitration agreements when the consent is given under a different capacity, until the practice is later resolved by the SPC through a series of judicial replies and opinions. postprin...|$|R
