5|$|As {{platinum}} is {{a catalyst}} {{in the manufacture}} of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study. The Food and Drug Administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest toxicity in vivo.|$|E
5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms. However two of his four known grants were annulled and or regranted, because their {{recipients}} were within the heraldic jurisdiction of other kings of arms.

5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} recovery was fastest during the first six months, but there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E

Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support such a relation.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined that there was <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support the allegations and no need for further investigation.|$|E

5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptlyâ€“ almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support this.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, {{near the}} village of Tickenham. It is a {{scheduled}} monument. Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot; however there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support this.|$|E
5|$|Castleshaw Roman fort was a castellum in the Roman {{province}} of Britannia. Although there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> substantiate the claim, {{it has been}} suggested that Castleshaw Roman fort is the site of Rigodunum, a Brigantian settlement. The remains of the fort are located on Castle Hill on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley at the foot of Standedge but overlooking the valley. The hill is on the edge of Castleshaw in Greater Manchester. The fort was constructed in c.AD79, but fell out of use at some time during the 90s. It was replaced by a smaller fortlet, built in c.105, around which a civilian settlement grew. It may have served as a logistical and administrative centre, although it was abandoned in the 120s.|$|E
