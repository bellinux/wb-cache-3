In the ONU, by wavelength shifting the upstream optical spectrum with respect to the downstream optical spectrum, the Rayleigh backscattering (RB) interference beat noise affecting the upstream signal can be significantly mitigated. The optimum bandwidth for the downstream DPSK demodulation is analyzed. The downstream and upstream transmission performances at different split ratios are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A Bluetooth {{scatternet}} is {{a network}} topology that is formed by inter-connecting piconets. A piconet is a starshaped ad-hoc <b>networking</b> <b>unit</b> that can accommodate eight Bluetooth devices, a master {{and up to}} seven slaves. By designating certain piconet nodes as bridges, or gateways, we can interconnect piconets by forcing the bridge nodes to interleave their participation in multiple piconets. Bridge nodes form an auxiliary relay connection between adjacent piconet masters and are fundamental for establishing scatternets. In this paper we present a new fault-tolerant approach to scatternet formation that is selfhealing and operates in a multi-hop environment. Our Bluetooth Distributed Scatternet Formation Protocol (BTDSP) establishes a flat scatternet topology, allows incremental node arrival, and automatically heals scatternet partitions by re-incorporating disconnected nodes. By maintaining neighbor associations in soft state, existing links can also be re-established quickly upon disconnection due to intermittent wireless connectivity. By only using slave/slave bridges, the algorithm is resilient to both node failure and wireless interference. It also prevents time-slot waste due to master/slave bridges being away from their piconets. Index Terms — Bluetooth, Scatternet, formation, piconet, bridge, personal area networkin...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} over glass (RFoG) is a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network. An RFoG {{network is}} essentially a hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) network, whose coaxial portion has been replaced with a passive point-to-multipoint optical network. Thus, the fiber is brought {{all the way to}} subscriber homes. Downstream and upstream transmissions share the same optical fiber, which is enabled by wavelength division multiplexing. The downstream and upstream signals are transmitted using semiconductor lasers with wavelengths of 1550 nm, and 1310 or 1610 nm, respectively. A radio frequency over glass optical <b>networking</b> <b>unit</b> (R-ONU), also called the micronode, is located at customer premises. A micronode is basically an optical-to-electrical converter: its receiver converts optical downstream signals into electrical and its transmitter electrical upstream signals into optical. The downstream signals are continuous, whereas the upstream signals coming in from the home cable modem operate in burst mode. When an upstream signal is not present in the coaxial input, the bias current of the transmitting laser is turned off. The upstream transmitter turns on when an upstream signal coming from the cable modem is detected. On turn-on, the bias current of the laser is switched on and the upstream RF signal is fed to the laser. This will lead to amplitude modulated (AM) optical signal, where the carrier is the optical power of the laser and the modulating signal the upstream RF signal. The objective of this thesis was to design a concept that enables the burst mode operation of an RFoG micronode upstream transmitter. Different components and electrical architectures were evaluated and compared in order to achieve a design that met the laser turn-on/turn-off requirements of Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) Radio Frequency over Glass Specification. The specification states that a micronode upstream laser must exhibit turn-on and turn-off times of 1. 3 us and 1. 6 us, respectively. In addition, the specification sets ranges for input RF powers for which the laser must turn on and off. The proposed concept was proven to be suitable for an RFoG micronode. The design achieved turn-on and turn-off times of 700 ns and 600 ns, respectively. It is also shown that by utilizing a hysteresis circuit in a voltage comparator, the range of input powers for laser turn-on and turn-off can be adjusted to meet the specification. Teleste Corporation, for whom this thesis was written, offers a great portfolio in HFC network optical node products. The proposed concept can be used to modify these products in order to achieve a device that could be utilized in an RFoG network...|$|E

To design a structured network, it is necessary to achieve clarity about each unit’s role without hemming managers in with too much detail. It is also necessary to support mutual learning without compromising distinctive differences, to defend specialist culture units from domination by mainstream units, to promote cooperation without embarking on unnecessary synergy initiatives, to recognise shared responsibilities without diluting unit accountability, and to encourage the corporate hierarchy to add value without creating redundant overheads and interference.

We identify a necessary condition for the separating equilibrium to exist and to reject the pooling equilibrium even in the presence of agglomeration economies from networking. We derive the maximum profit of an agency and show the condition has a directly testable implication in the empirical specification of the agency’s profit function.

Extending the control from the digital world to the physical world can be achieved by controlling actuators.

The world of networking sensors is vast and covers aspects such as communication protocols, ubiquitous computing environments, embedded operating systems, embedded system designs, security, low-power operations, location- awareness, and middleware issues etc. At EISLAB, the development of various applications requires a platform, in terms of both hardware and software, to form a network of wireless nodes. A platform that is intelligent and accessible over the Internet opens new possibilities for system fault detection, control, maintenance, and remote monitoring. In this thesis commercial off-the-shelf hardware components are used in combination with software based on standard protocols as a basis for the platform architecture.
