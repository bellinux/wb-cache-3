5|$|De Infantia Sancti Edmundi, {{a fictitious}} 12th-century hagiography of Edmund's early life by Geoffrey of Wells, {{represented}} {{him as the}} youngest son of 'Alcmund', a Saxon king of Germanic descent. 'Alcmund' may <b>never</b> <b>have</b> existed.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko's inauguration {{ceremony}} of 22 January 2011 was boycotted by EU ambassadors, and only thirty-two foreign diplomats attended.

5|$|The loss of Kona Lanes was a {{repeated}} topic at political events. One Costa Mesa city council candidate said {{he made a}} commitment to public service when the building was torn down with little resistance. Another would-be council member agreed that the demolition should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> happened.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Confucianism, Taoism favors {{philosophical}} anarchism, {{pluralism and}} laissez-faire-government. Laozi {{has been cited}} as an early example of a proponent of liberalism. On the other hand, politics <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been a main issue in Taoism.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E

5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or <b>never</b> <b>have</b> to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae <b>never</b> <b>have</b> mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not {{attached to the}} body and {{are said to be}} exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E

5|$|Elvis might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been born, {{but someone}} else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E

5|$|I think I was {{the first}} woman to play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days.

However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film was no exception.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce {{during his}} {{long years of}} writing Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's {{constant}} financial support), {{there is a good}} possibility that his books might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France.|$|E
5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted {{to get in touch}} with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been aware of it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner and <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{been in the}} 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is {{the business of the}} managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{to small}} audiences, on tiny stages, in {{communal}} troupes where {{all but the}} stars had day jobs, and playing only Saturday and Sunday (the pious London Jews would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater like never before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater {{in a series of}} other locations, notably Paris, but eventually came back to London, where Israel Grodner died in 1887.|$|E
