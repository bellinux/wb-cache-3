40|$|Abstract:- An {{efficient}} and secure protocol in certified e-mail delivery is proposed in this paper. With {{the widespread use}} of public Internet, communication via electronic mail (e-mail) becomes a convenience application instead of traditional manuscript letter. People can easily append his/her digital signature to the e-mail in order to achieve the goal of <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> However, the evidence of receipt still relies on the willingness of the recipient in the standard e-mail service. Hence, the recipient has no responsible for the received e-mail. In this paper, we present an {{efficient and}} secure protocol in fair certified e-mail delivery (CEMD). Our protocol efficiently provides <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and receipt in the fair manner. In other words, the sender can obtain the irrefutable receipt if and only if the recipient gets the certified e-mail from the sender, otherwise, neither of them. Moreover, the proposed CEMD is efficiently in sending the other mails to the same recipient by using the pre-computation function. As the evaluations of computational cost and communication overhead, our protocol is cost-effective and efficient than other relevant protocols...|$|E

E. g, for certified e-mail: receivers may deny having received e-mails (e. g., bills) agents may forge e-mail receipts to falsely claim they have sent messages This threat model is different from what we considered so far. So far: We have analyzed runs between honest agents in the presence of external attackers (external threat model) and spies inside the system (internal threat model). Today: We analyze runs between agents that try to cheat each other. Non-repudiation Non-repudiation protocols protect agents from cheating each other. They provide the agents with evidence that certain steps in the protocol have occurred "Evidence " consists of a set of messages that (in case of dispute) can be given to a judge to prove that the evidenced protocol step has happened. <b>Non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> and Receipt A protocol guarantees <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (NRO) if it provides evidence to receivers that the message has been sent by the claimed sender.
