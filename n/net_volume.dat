40|$|Background: Flow volume {{quantification}} in {{the great}} thoracic vessels {{is used in the}} assessment of several cardiovascular diseases. Clinically, it is often based on semi-automatic segmentation of a vessel throughout the cardiac cycle in 2 D cine phase-contrast Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. Three-dimensional (3 D), time-resolved phase-contrast CMR with three-directional velocity encoding (4 D flow CMR) permits assessment of <b>net</b> flow <b>volumes</b> and flow patterns retrospectively at any location in a time-resolved 3 D volume. However, analysis of these datasets can be demanding. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop and evaluate a fully automatic method for segmentation and analysis of 4 D flow CMR data of the great thoracic vessels. Methods: The proposed method utilizes atlas-based segmentation to segment the great thoracic vessels in systole, and registration between different time frames of the cardiac cycle in order to segment these vessels over time. Additionally, <b>net</b> flow <b>volumes</b> are calculated automatically at locations of interest. The method was applied on 4 D flow CMR datasets obtained from 11 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with heart failure. Evaluation of the method was performed visually, and by comparison of <b>net</b> flow <b>volumes</b> in the ascending aorta obtained automatically (using the proposed method), and semi-automatically. Further evaluation was done by comparison of <b>net</b> flow <b>volumes</b> obtained automatically at different locations in the aorta, pulmonary artery, and caval veins. Results: Visual evaluation of the generated segmentations resulted in good outcomes for all the major vessels in all but one dataset. The comparison between automatically and semi-automatically obtained <b>net</b> flow <b>volumes</b> in the ascending aorta resulted in very high correlation (r(2) = 0. 926). Moreover, comparison of the <b>net</b> flow <b>volumes</b> obtained automatically in other vessel locations also produced high correlations where expected: pulmonary trunk vs. proximal ascending aorta (r(2) = 0. 955), pulmonary trunk vs. pulmonary branches (r(2) = 0. 808), and pulmonary trunk vs. caval veins (r(2) = 0. 906). Conclusions: The proposed method allows for automatic analysis of 4 D flow CMR data, including vessel segmentation, assessment of flow volumes at locations of interest, and 4 D flow visualization. This constitutes an important step towards facilitating the clinical utility of 4 D flow CMR.

50|$|Refined coal is {{the product}} of the {{application}} of a coal upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals and raising their calorific values. Coal refining or upgrading technologies are typically pre-combustion treatments and/or processes that alter the characteristics of a coal before it is burned. The goals of pre-combustion coal upgrading technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when coal is burned. Depending on the situation, pre-combustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to post-combustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers. A primary benefit of refined coal is the capacity to reduce the <b>net</b> <b>volume</b> of carbon emissions that is currently emitted from power generators and would reduce the amount of emissions that is proposed to be managed via emerging carbon sequestration methodologies. Refined coal technologies have primarily been developed in the United States, several similar technologies have been researched, developed and tested in Victoria, Australia, including the Densified coal technology (Coldry Process) developed to alter the chemical bonds of brown coal to create a product that is cleaner, stable (not prone to spontaneous combustion), exportable and of sufficiently high calorific value to be a black coal equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|The log scaler is an {{occupation}} in the timber industry. The Log Scaler measures the cut trees {{to determine the}} scale (volume) and quality (grade) of the wood {{to be used for}} manufacturing. When logs are sold, {{in order to determine the}} basis for a sale price in a standard way, the logs are [...] "scaled" [...] which means they are measured, identified as to species, and deductions for defects assigned to produce a <b>net</b> <b>volume</b> of merchantable wood. There are several different scales or rules that are used to determine the volume of wood. Scribner Decimal C rule is based on diagrams of circles that show the amount of boards that will be utilized from diameters of logs. Cubic rule, often called Metric in Canada, determines the cubic volume of the log material. The logs are recorded as gross scale (actual log measurements, length and diameter) and net scale (volume after deductions for defects are taken out). This occupation is usually performed by a third party organization qualified to [...] "scale" [...] government timber. Since internal defects are determined by external indications, scaling is not an exact science and is subject to interpretation of log scaling rules. The log scaler is subject to random [...] "check scales" [...] in which another scaler rescales exactly the same logs and the results are compared. The log scaler must be within + or - 1% of the gross scale and + or - 2% of the net scale to keep their certification to scale. The scale is used for payment, quality control and inventory purposes.|$|E

A relationship based on the Longuet-Higgens theory is derived for wave-induced, nonzero mass-transport currents in intermediate water depths for a viscous fluid. The relationship is in a form useful for experimental applications; therefore, some design criteria for experimental wave-tank tests are also presented. Sample parametric cases for typical wave-tank conditions and a typical ocean swell were assessed by using the relation in conjunction with an equation developed by Unluata and Mei for the maximum wave-induced volume transport.

A maximum volume transport, corresponding to an infinite channel or idealized ocean condition, produces the largest wave-induced mass-transport currents.

The average measurement period was 31 years for Scots pine and 30 years for Norway spruce. All Scots pine thinning treatments reduced the total gross stemvolume production compared to the unthinned control, whereas only the heaviest thinning treatments, in which a largeproportion of the basal area was removed, reduced the total gross stem volume production for Norway spruce. Thinningfrom above did not affect total gross stem volume production of Scots pine, but there was a tendency towards lowerproduction in Norway spruce.
