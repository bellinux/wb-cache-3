Matt Shiverdecker of Austin American-Statesman was largely laudatory of the film at the same event as well, dubbing it as a [...] "small miracle". He praised the added realism, unlike the clichéd storybook romance. He attributed the film's success to its actors and the beautiful scenery. Siddhant Adlakha of Birth Movies Death called Loev a [...] "minuscule film of miraculous construction" [...] and [...] "a melancholy tale where questions have <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>answers,</b> [...] but one where bliss, even momentary, feels infinite".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named {{it as one}} of his favorite episodes of the series, calling it [...] "not only funny and moving, but incredibly important", both for its religious element and message of tolerance. Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a [...] "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated the fact there were <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} cited feminist {{writer of the}} time was Mary Wollstonecraft, often {{characterized}} as the first feminist philosopher. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) {{is one of the}} first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument.

[...] He argued that no researcher is neutral and that we all need to engage in reflexivity to guard against bias and the imposition of a priori presuppositions, so that, as a reviewer commented, [...] "suddenly the act of observation becomes the subject of observation" [...] and [...] "for a teacher like Bennett, his own experience as an ordained minister and missionary, his own experience with the give and take of ecumenical teaching becomes the data of religious thought". [...] "Bennett", Dening continued, [...] "is not independent of all the observations made through centuries of thought", so [...] "there is convergence: library and field, intellect and emotion, thought and experience in the end come together". [...] The book, said this reviewer, helped [...] "to make the exposition of {{more than a hundred years}} of thought on the study of religions lucid and memorable". [...] Alan Race, in another review, described the book as cutting [...] "through a dense thicket, yielding a clear, highly readable survey of how" [...] anthropology and Religious Studies [...] "have interacted and failed to interact", although remarking that it mainly discussed European history. Bennett followed this in 1998 with In Search of Muhammad and in 2001 with In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images. [...] A. G Noorani describes In Search of Muhammad as [...] "an earnest effort by a devout Christian to understand Muhammad, and places" [...] Bennett [...] "in the ranks of others whose services Minou Reeves [...] acknowledges in her survey of Western writing on Muhammad." [...] Commenting on Bennett's discussion of the sources available for the life of Muhammad, Hugh Goddard says that while he is [...] "not as negative" [...] as [...] "some modern Western scholars", neither [...] "is he uncritical of them", suggesting that [...] "some traditions, particularly concerning Muhammad’s miracles and the role of women, should be judged as unreliable." [...] Referring to Bennett's attempt to suggest how [...] "Christ and Muhammad might be viewed as somehow complementary, rather than as rivals" [...] he called this a [...] "brave attempt" [...] even though [...] "there are <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> to such a significant question."
