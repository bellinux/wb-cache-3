25|$|Plants {{have long}} been used in {{perfumery}} {{as a source of}} essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually secondary metabolites produced by plants as protection against herbivores, infections, as well as to attract pollinators. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of coriander have remarkably different odors from each other. Orange leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of petitgrain, <b>neroli,</b> and orange oils.|$|E

500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} gave Heat's scent {{a negative}} review. She criticized the fragrance's packaging {{as being very}} similar to that of K-Y Jelly. She stated: [...] "Once on the skin, the scent transformed in a matter of just a few minutes from something floral-y and vaguely acceptable to an offensive mix of car fumes and that vanilla body spray Victoria's Secret used to sell to 12-year-olds", then adding that the perfume's logo and gold swirls [...] "sway too similar to that of KY Jelly's", before concluding that [...] "calling to mind sex is kind of Beyoncé's thing, which is why this fragrance could just be a smashing success."
