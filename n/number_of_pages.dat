5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{operating}} systems use virtual memory concept {{because of its}} advantages but they use different page replacement techniques. An efficient page replacement technique is required so as to produce minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>page</b> faults.

Two simple models are proposed, one based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>page</b> faults along the critical path of the computation, and one based on the aggregated <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>page</b> faults. Two different sDSM systems are considered. The models are evaluated using the OpenMP NAS Paral-lel Benchmarks on an 8 -node AMD-based Gigabit Ether-net cluster. Both models gave estimates accurate to within 10 % in most cases, with the critical path model showing slightly better accuracy; accuracy is lost if the underly-ing page faults cannot be overlapped, or if the application makes extensive use of the OpenMP flush directive. 1...|$|R
