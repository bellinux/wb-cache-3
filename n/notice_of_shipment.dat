40|$|<b>Shipments</b> <b>of</b> cargo and {{household}} goods {{have been identified}} as pathways for brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) transport from Guam to other locations. We analyzed data regarding <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> military household goods leaving Guam during 2006 to 2009 to identify the potential for human transport of brown treesnakes to the United States by determining when shipments most commonly occur and identifying primary receiving areas. We found that the number <b>of</b> <b>shipments</b> was highest during the months of May and June and that California receives more <b>shipments</b> (23 % <b>of</b> total <b>shipments)</b> than any other location. Approximately 98 % <b>of</b> <b>shipments</b> originated from the U. S. Navy and U. S. Air Force, with naval shipments increasing over time. Guam is currently undergoing a military buildup during which shipments are expected to increase, suggesting the need for increased vigilance and prioritization of inspection efforts...|$|R
40|$|Outstanding ThesisApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} study is to compare the cost and time-to-reliably-replenish constraints of commercial and military modes <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> to the main three annual joint United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) exercises conducted in three distinct allied countries. This study also estimates potential cost savings if commercial shipment becomes the primary means. Using a business case analysis, we compare the estimated costs of current methods for providing logistical support in USPACOM, and provide recommendations to improve the system. The utilization of commercial companies as the primary means <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> aircraft parts in USPACOM is a national and military strategic imperative. Specifically, the current costs of operating KC- 130 J aircraft as primary means <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> far exceeds costs if the primary mode <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> became commercial agencies. Equally important is improving upon joint multi-national relationships and joint logistics best business practices that would facilitate optimal asset throughput in the Customs Departments of our allied nations. In considering and analyzing the above dynamics, this study will provide a cost based analysis and qualitative evaluation regarding the use of commercial agencies and/or United States Marine Corps KC- 130 J heavy-lift aircraft in the <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> F/A- 18 aircraft parts within the USPACOM Area of Responsibility.

The thesis aspires to describe and interpret the various regulations and norms that govern this area, {{regardless of whether they}} are of international, European or national origin; it also evaluates whether the legislation provides sufficient tools for protection of the environment and whether the cross-border <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> waste are desirable from the perspective of environmental protection. The thesis consists of eleven chapters. The first three chapters provide a theoretical introduction to the topic - chapter one contains the basic objectives and definition of the legal regulation <b>of</b> cross-border <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> waste; chapter two outlines the fundamental principles of the environmental law and their applicability to the <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> waste; and chapter three introduces the reader to the historical development of the subject matter in question. Chapters four to eight of the paper are devoted to the description and analysis of the legislation currently applicable. The fourth chapter describes international treaties such as Basel, Bamako, and other conventions. The fifth chapter focuses on [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{how and why}} transport prices become imbalanced {{with respect to the}} direction <b>of</b> <b>shipments</b> and how this affects economic geography. It is shown that the equilibrium transport price <b>of</b> the <b>shipment</b> in a particular direction is a nondecreasing function of the relative size of the embarkation region. Furthermore, we show that the directional imbalance in transport prices increases the likelihood of the symmetric pattern being stable and decreases the likelihood of the core-periphery patterns being sustainable. In short, the imbalance acts as a dispersion force.
