You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

40|$|It is {{not easy}} to predict what will happen tomorrow. It is perhaps even more {{difficult}} knowing what will occur <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> even <b>two</b> <b>years</b> from today. To put it short we are uncertain about the future. Swedish firms attempting to capture new export markets are also facing uncertainty. If a firm succeeds with predicting customer’s preferences {{they might be able to}} create a position for the firm´s products before any competition. It is however almost amusing to study successful marketing cases for export markets in a rear window. It is striking how firms have found winning positions which captured market after market with such apparent ease.  In this thesis the author attempts to present theoretical frameworks including internationalization theory and traditional marketing theory which can support exporting firms attempts to find new positions on export markets.  Previously in traditional marketing theory the solution has been to put trust in the marketing concept. Success in the marketplace was then a result of a careful segmentation process ending up in a positioning-decision supported by the marketing mix. The Nordic school of marketing among others introduced a new track in marketing with the relationship marketing concept focusing on the development of existing customer relationships. Internationalization theory (the process theory of internationalization) suggested that that firms increase commitment on export markets after a gradual learning process. Effectuation on the other hand has offered new perspectives. With its roots in the paradigm of bounded rationality a differing stance is offered for predicting the unpredictable. By following a model of bounded rationality the presented firms manage to craft positions for new and as a matter of fact as presented in the empirical part, also for existing markets. The paper highlights the importance of positioning for Swedish firms success on export markets.   It is a case study of how Swedish firms craft positions on new markets by taking action instead of making formal positioning decisions.  A model of bounded rationality is tested during interviews with five Swedish top-exporting firms. The paper finally presents a revised developed model for how successful firms act on export markets in order to craft positions. The model includes traditional marketing theory based upon a paradigm of bounded rationality. The paper contains however some question marks for the application of the marketing concept and traditional marketing theory. Rather a stance towards bounded rationality is emphasized. The final point of the thesis is the urge for emergence of alternatives in marketing to the marketing concept founded upon bounded rationality. These new models need to capture the actual actions taken by successful exporting firms in a more proficient and graspable way than existing traditional marketing models...|$|R

60|$|But of all {{differences}} between an Englishman and an American, that {{in politics is}} the strongest and the most essential. I cannot here, in one paragraph, define that difference with sufficient clearness to make my definition satisfactory; but I trust that some idea of that difference may be conveyed by the general tenor of my book. The American and the Englishman are both republicans. The governments of the States and of England are probably the two purest republican governments in the world. I do not, of course, here {{mean to say that}} the governments are more pure than others, but that the systems are more absolutely republican. And yet no men can be much farther asunder in politics than the Englishman and the American. The American of the present day puts a ballot-box into the hands of every citizen, and takes his stand upon that and that only. It is the duty of an American citizen to vote; and when he has voted, he need trouble himself no further till the time for voting shall come round again. The candidate for whom he has voted represents his will, if he have voted with the majority; and in that case he has no right to look for further influence. If he have voted with the minority, he has no right to look for any influence at all. In either case he has done his political work, and may go about his business till the <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>or</b> the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> four <b>years,</b> shall have come round. The Englishman, on the other hand, will have no ballot-box, and is by no means inclined to depend exclusively upon voters or upon voting. As far as voting can show it, he desires to get the sense of the country; but he does not think that that sense will be shown by universal suffrage. He thinks that property amounting to a thousand pounds will show more of that sense than property amounting to a hundred; but he will not, on that account, go to work and apportion votes to wealth. He thinks that the educated can show more of that sense than the uneducated; but he does not therefore lay down any rule about reading, writing, and arithmetic, or apportion votes to learning. He prefers that all these opinions of his shall bring themselves out and operate by their own intrinsic weight. Nor does he at all confine himself to voting, in his anxiety to get the sense of the country. He takes it in any way that it will show itself, uses it for what it is worth, or perhaps far more than it is worth, and welds it into that gigantic lever by which the political action of the country is moved. Every man in Great Britain, whether he possesses any actual vote or no, can do that which is tantamount to voting every day of his life by the mere expression of his opinion. Public opinion in America has hitherto been nothing, unless it has managed to express itself by a majority of ballot-boxes. Public opinion in England is everything, let votes go as they may. Let the people want a measure, and there is no doubt of their obtaining it. Only the people must want it--as they did want Catholic emancipation, reform, and corn-law repeal, and as they would want war if it were brought home to them that their country was insulted.|$|R

60|$|His younger brother, Charles Austin, of whom at {{this time}} and for the <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> I saw much, had also a great effect on me, though of a very {{different}} description. He was {{but a few years}} older than myself, and had then just left the University, where he had shone with great éclat as a man of intellect and a brilliant orator and converser. The effect he produced on his Cambridge contemporaries deserves to be accounted an historical event; for to it may in part be traced the tendency towards Liberalism in general, and the Benthamic and politico-economic form of it in particular, which showed itself in a portion of the more active-minded young men of the higher classes from this time to 1830. The Union Debating Society, at that time at the height of its reputation, was an arena where what were then thought extreme opinions, in politics and philosophy, were weekly asserted, face to face with their opposites, before audiences consisting of the élite of the Cambridge youth: and though many persons afterwards of more or less note (of whom Lord Macaulay is the most celebrated) gained their first oratorical laurels in those debates, the really influential mind among these intellectual gladiators was Charles Austin. He continued, after leaving the University, to be, by his conversation and personal ascendency, a leader among the same class of young men who had been his associates there; and he attached me among others to his car. Through him I became acquainted with Macaulay, Hyde and Charles Villiers, Strutt (now Lord Belper), Romilly (now Lord Romilly and Master of the Rolls), and various others who subsequently figured in literature or politics, and among whom I heard discussions on many topics, as yet to a certain degree new to me. The influence of Charles Austin over me differed from that of the persons I have hitherto mentioned, in being not the influence of a man over a boy, but that of an elder contemporary. It was through him that I first felt myself, not a pupil under teachers, but a man among men. He was the first person of intellect whom I met on a ground of equality, though as yet much his inferior on that common ground. He was a man who never failed to impress greatly those with whom he came in contact, even when their opinions were the very reverse of his. The impression he gave was that of boundless strength, together with talents which, combined with such apparent force of will and character, seemed capable of dominating the world. Those who knew him, whether friendly to him or not, always anticipated that he would play a conspicuous part in public life. It is seldom that men produce so great an immediate effect by speech, unless they, in some degree, lay themselves out for it; and he did this in no ordinary degree. He loved to strike, and even to startle. He knew that decision is the greatest element of effect, and he uttered his opinions with all the decision he could throw into them, never so well pleased as when he astonished anyone by their audacity. Very unlike his brother, who made war against the narrower interpretations and applications of the principles they both professed, he, on the contrary, presented the Benthamic doctrines in the most startling form of which they were susceptible, exaggerating everything in them which tended to consequences offensive to anyone's preconceived feelings. All which, he defended with such verve and vivacity, and carried off by a manner so agreeable as well as forcible, that he always either came off victor, or divided the honours of the field. It is my belief that much of the notion popularly entertained of the tenets and sentiments of what are called Benthamites or Utilitarians had its origin in paradoxes thrown out by Charles Austin. It must be said, however, that his example was followed, haud passibus aequis, by younger proselytes, and that to outrer whatever was by anybody considered offensive in the doctrines and maxims of Benthamism, became at one time the badge of a small coterie of youths. All of these who had anything in them, myself among others, quickly outgrew this boyish vanity; and those who had not, became tired of differing from other people, and gave up both the good and the bad part of the heterodox opinions they had for some time professed.|$|E
