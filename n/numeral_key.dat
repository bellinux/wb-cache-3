We make a second (and common) simplification in the model by assuming the time scales of the electrical and magnetic components are such that the electrical field responds instantaneously {{to changes in the}} fluid motion. This report gives a comprehensive error analysis for both the semi-discrete and a fully-discrete approximation. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is illustrated in several <b>numeral</b> experiments. <b>Key</b> words. Navier-Stokes, MHD, finite element, Crank-Nicolson 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new theory}} of simplex numerals that incorporates a slight revision of Chomsky’s (2008) set-theoretic conception of natural number, which assumes {{that the notion of}} natural number is innate. The new theory makes it possible to account for the behavior of numerals in counting as well as the developmental stages that children go through in learning <b>numerals.</b> The <b>key</b> idea is that set-theoretic objects corresponding to natural number notions are subject to operations that apply when a syntactic object is converted to phonological form. These operations provide a crucial link that connects the meaning of a numeral with the count list consisting of numerals. A notable feature of the proposed analysis is that the Cardinal Principle is derived by recruiting linguistic computation and therefore is no longer stipulated as such...|$|R

For example, {{in the early}} years of the Selectric, typists were used to using the lower-case L for the numeral 1, as many {{previous}} typewriters lacked a dedicated <b>numeral</b> 1 <b>key.</b> The Selectric had a dedicated key for 1/!, but this was also marked , as many of the early elements had square brackets in these positions. Using such an element required the typist to continue the old convention. Later elements tended to have the dedicated numeral 1 and exclamation point characters instead. Some moved the square brackets to the positions formerly occupied by the 1/4 and 1/2 fractions, while others lost them completely. Some put a degree symbol in place of the exclamation point. IBM would furthermore customize any element for a fee, so literally endless variations were possible. Such customized elements were identified by a gray plastic flip-up clip instead of a black one.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recognition of Odia {{handwritten}} {{and machine}} characters and numerals is an emerging {{area of research}} and finds extensive applications in banks, offices and industries. Very little standard research work has been reported on recognition of handwritten and machine characters and numerals. This paper makes an in depth study on the existing literature on recognition of machine and handwritten Odia characters and <b>numerals.</b> The <b>key</b> steps [44] such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification involved in the recognition process of Odia characters are dealt in details. The well known techniques employed for segmentation, feature extraction and classification tasks of Odia characters are reviewed and their relative strengths and weaknesses are outlined. The paper also discusses the current trends and future research scope {{in the area of}} Odia character recognition. It is expected that this paper will be useful to those who will be interested to work in the fields of recognition of Odia characters...|$|R

50|$|The {{first part}} of this linguascale is the decimal {{classification}} referred to above, consisting of a linguasphere <b>key</b> of two <b>numerals</b> denoting the relevant phylozone or geozone: from 00. to 99. This provides a systematic numerical key for the initial classification of any of the world's languages, following the principles set out in the Linguasphere Register. The first <b>numeral</b> of the <b>key</b> represents one of the ten referential sectors into which the world's languages are initially divided. The sector can either be a phylosector, in which the constituent languages are considered to be in a diachronic relationship one with another, or a geosector, in which languages are grouped geographically rather than historically.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of arabic}} numerals {{as the main}} carrier of content in musical {{notation}} is common in certain forms of early European and contemporary experimental music. The central aim of the paper is to survey this use and discuss why some experimental composers work with numerals over other forms of notation. Does the abstract nature of individual integers communicate something extra-mathematical to the reader, something that would bring about a particular approach to performance? Do numerals possess inherent qualities which express the objectivity desired by particular experimental composers? Early Spanish and Italian forms of tablature employed arabic numerals to indicate fret numbers, and recent research has uncovered English keyboard tablature designed for amateur players which uses <b>numerals</b> to represent <b>keys</b> on the keyboard which had previously only been though to exist on the continent. The instructional nature of these scores is {{compared with that of}} recent experimental music which employ only numerals in {{the main body of the}} score. Often intrinsically related to the compositional concept, this usage is explored in works by Michael Pisaro and Antoine Beuger, and younger composers Taylan Susam and Joseph Kudirka, addressing various methods of this 'numeral-only' approach. Just Intonation notational systems, which employ numerical ratios, and composers' approaches to their employment in scores, are also included in the discussion. The notion of a score appearing more 'instructional' than 'interpretational' is explored, and by noting similarities in documented reports from performers on approaches towards playing this music, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to what a numerical notation communicates - opening up various creative possibilities for the future...|$|R
