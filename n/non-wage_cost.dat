An obvious threshold condition is that the subsidy be large enough to make it profitable for the employer to hire the worker. Operationalizing this criterion is more difficult. One benchmark against which wage subsidies can be assessed is the <b>non-wage</b> <b>cost</b> of labor. If the subsidy does not offset a substantial fraction of the <b>non-wage</b> <b>cost</b> of labor, it may not be worthwhile for the employer to hire subsidized workers. The structure of the subsidy will also influence the employer’s decisions about whether to hire subsidized labor and, if so, which workers.|$|E

40|$|In Sweden, {{employers}} pay <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> {{for their}} workforce {{in the form}} of legislated employment tax and collective fees. For parts of the workforce, the collective fees are progressive with respect to the employee’s age and wage. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine how <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> affect voluntary early retirement. To this end we use a large longitudinal employer–employee matched data set with administrative records of the private sector in Sweden. We exploit the variation in collective fee costs across companies to identify employer incentives to encourage early retirement. The results from the instrumental variable estimator suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> in relation to wage costs increases retirement by 6 percent. Further, given the wage sum and workforce structure, large firms spend more on non-wage compensation than small firms. The share of <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> in relation to the wage sum is also positively linked to net employment growth.

40|$|Informality is at {{the center}} of the {{economic}} debate in Colombia, fueled by the high level prevalent in the country and its substantial increase during the 1990 s. We study the effect of labor market rigidities, namely the increase in <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> and the minimum wage on the size of the informal sector, the transition into and out of informality, and wages. Our results indicate that rises in <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> and the minimum wage, increase the probability of transition into informality as well as the size of the informal sector. The analysis of these effects along the income distribution points towards strong exclusion motives for low skilled informal workers, mainly driven by labor demand adjustments in response to increasing hiring costs; and argues somehow in favor of exit motives for workers at the top of the wage distribution. Furthermore, there is strong indexation of salaries to the minimum wage, except for low skilled informal workers. In addition, firms adjust salaries in response to increasing <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> for all workers within the labor force.

30|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the previous studies}} based on labor demand estimates, Mondragón-Vélez et al. (2010) study the effect of <b>non-wage</b> labor <b>costs</b> on the probability of being informal. For that purpose, the authors propose a probit model that allows individual characteristics to be controlled for. They use household survey data for the major Colombian cities and consider alternative definitions for informality, including the definition by the national statistics office and a definition based on health insurance coverage 8.

40|$|<b>Non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> are {{relatively}} high in Austria. This is due, above all, {{to the level}} of employer contributions to social security, payroll-dependent charges, and the extent of non-productive times. If – in the interest of logical coherence – bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries) are added to base pay, the rate of <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> amounts to 61. 4 percent of the hourly wage. Relative to the yearly income (corrected for non-productive times), <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> (social charges) account for approximately one third of total labour costs. If the anticipated surpluses of the existing funds in the field of social security are used to reduce contributions rather than increase spending, there ought to be some scope for a lowering of <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> in the years to come. This applies, in particular, to contributions to the family relief fund, the fund to secure wage and salary payments in the event of insolvency, accident insurance, subsidised housing construction, and – in view of the expected economic upswing – unemployment insurance. Reducing non-productive times is yet another way to lower <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs.</b> If all possibilities to reduce contributions are fully utilised in the coming years, <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> can be cut by up to ATS 16 billion. In addition, the related reduction of employees' contributions by up to ATS 6 billion would not only result in higher net wages and stronger consumer demand, but also have a moderating effect on the increase of gross wages. However, a reduction of contributions requires a departure from the past practice of using potential surpluses to increase spending and/or transfer payments or redistributing them to the old-age pension system – which in turn limits the scope for budget consolidation. Moreover, the margin available for reductions of contributions cannot be fully utilised, unless appropriate reforms are implemented {{at the same time to}} take account of the changing priorities of economic and social policy. Reducing contributions has the added benefit of imposing a more stringent spending discipline, whereas surpluses from earmarked revenues tend to generate further expenditure increases. The effects of a reduction of <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> on the economy and the labour market have been calculated on the basis of the WIFO macro-model: • The impact largely depends on whether and to what extent enterprises are willing to pass on the reduction of <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> in the form of lower prices, which in turn would have a moderating effect on collective bargaining agreements. If the entire ATS 16 billion margin is used to lower <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> and enterprises partly adjust their prices accordingly (as assumed in the model), this will translate into a growth of real GDP by 0. 3 percent and an increase in the number of persons in employment by 6, 400 (over baseline) after no more than two years. These effects continue to increase in subsequent years. • If the reduction of <b>non-wage</b> labour <b>costs</b> were passed on fully to prices, the effect would be about twice as strong: after two years, real GDP would be about 0. 7 percent higher, and the number of jobs would increase by 12, 300. The faster the cost reduction is passed on to buyers in Austria and abroad, the more favourable the effects on economic growth and employment.

40|$|Informality is at {{the center}} of the {{economic}} debate in Colombia, fueled by the substantial increase in the size of the informal sector observed during the 1990 s. Labor market rigidities, namely the increase in <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> and the minimum wage, have sizeable effects on the size of the informal sector and the observed wages across sectors. Our estimates indicate that as a result of a 10 percentage points (pp) rise in <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs,</b> the probability of being informal increases by 8 pp, formal wages are not affected and informal wages fall by 9 pp. An increase of 20 pp in the minimum wage increases the likelihood of informality by 6 pp, and decreases formal and informal wages by 10. 8 pp and 28 pp, respectively. We also analyze the transition into and out of the informal sector by measuring the flows across sectors, and study the determinants of entry and exit into and out of informality. Given the level of labor market rigidities in Colombia, the formal sector adjusts to the economic cycle through quantities-cutting back on jobs, while the informal sector does so through prices, i. e. decreasing the wages. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{so-called}} “non-wage costs” {{refer to}} the part of total labor cost that is {{not directly related to}} actual working hours, including income tax on wages, employers’ and employees’ contributions to the social security premiums and unemployment insurance fund. These costs create a wedge between the cost the employer has to bear for hiring an employee and the wage received by the employee. As the wedge gets wider, the labor cost incurred by employers increases and employers become less willing to hire new workers in the formal sector. A widely used indicator to measure the weight of <b>non-wage</b> <b>costs</b> is tax wedge. It is calculated as the ratio of income taxes plus employers’ and employees’ social security contributions (SSC) to total labor cost.

The Colombian case is interesting for two reasons. First, <b>non-wage</b> labor <b>costs</b> are very high: previous to the 2012 reform, they accounted for more than 60 percent of the average wage rate (Hernández, 2012; Moller, 2012).
