25|$|A 2009 {{clinical}} trial at Massachusetts General Hospital used the cancer drug Bevacizumab (commercial name: Avastin) to treat 10 patients with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>II.</b> The result {{was published in}} The New England Journal of Medicine. Of the ten patients treated with bevacizumab, tumours shrank in 9 of them, with the median best response rate of 26%.

Bevacizumab works by cutting the blood supply to the tumours and thus depriving them of their growth vector. Side effects during the study included alanine aminotransferase, proteinuria, and hypertension (elevated blood pressure) among others. A separate trial, published in The Neuro-oncology Journal, show 40% tumour reduction in the two patients with NF2, along with significant hearing improvement.|$|E
25|$|NF II {{is caused}} by a defect in the gene that {{normally}} gives rise to a product called Merlin or Schwannomin, located on chromosome 22 band q11-13.1. This peptide is thought to have a tumor-suppressive function.

It is known that Merlin's deficiency can result in unmediated progression through the cell cycle {{due to the lack of}} contact-mediated tumour suppression, sufficient to result in the tumors characteristic of <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>II.</b> Mutations of NF II is presumed to result in either a failure to synthesize Merlin or the production of a defective peptide that lacks the normal tumor-suppressive effect. The Schwannomin-peptide consists of 595 amino acids. Comparison of Schwannomin with other proteins shows similarities to proteins that connect the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. Mutations in the Schwannomin-gene are thought to alter the movement and shape of affected cells with loss of contact inhibition.|$|E

Differentiating keratinocytes became intensely immunoreactive for <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 protein, which was apparently associated with cellular fibrils. Double immunolabeling with antibodies to cytokeratin 14 and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 protein suggested an association of intermediate <b>type</b> cytoskeleton and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 protein. The presence of <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 protein in cell preparations treated with cytoskeletal buffer indicated a high affinity interaction between intermediate filaments and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 protein. Further studies utilizing double immunolabelings revealed that the intense <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 tumor suppressor signal on intermediate filaments was temporally limited to the period in keratinocyte differentiation in which the formation of desmosomes takes place.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between corpus callosum morphology and cognitive function in children with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 using quantitative neuroanatomic imaging techniques. Children with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 (n = 46) demonstrated a significantly larger total corpus callosum and corpus callosum index compared with control participants (n = 30). A larger corpus callosum index in children with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 was associated with significantly lower IQ, reduced abstract concept formation, reduced verbal memory, and diminished academic ability, specifically reading and math.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 is {{a common}} {{heritable}} neurocutaneous disorder. <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 {{may be associated with}} tumors of the central nervous system and pheochromocytoma. However, papillary thyroid carcinoma associated with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 is very rare. We present what is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first case of papillary thyroid carcinoma to be detected incidentally by ultrasonography in a patient with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1. Case presentation A 63 -year-old South Korean man with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 presented to our study hospital because of thyroid nodules detected incidentally by ultrasonography. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed by ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration, and then a total thyroidectomy with central compartment neck dissection was performed. The B isoform of the Raf V 600 E mutation was identified by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Conclusions Papillary thyroid carcinoma associated with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 is very rare. However, it is speculated that papillary thyroid carcinoma is more likely to be detected in patients with <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> 1 if screening by ultrasonography is performed for them. </p...|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} several {{diseases}} linked to Schwann cells {{that ought to}} be noted. To begin with, some demylelinating disorders include: multiple sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Although science has yet to offer up conclusive evidence that Schwann cell transplantation is an effective treatment for demylelinating disorders, it is possible that this could be applied in clinical practice in the future. There are also two inherited tumor disorders that have been connected with Schwann cells, Neurofibromatosis type 1 and type 2. While both are genetic conditions associated with benign tumors, Neurofibromatosis type I are neurofibromas and are therefore composed of a variety of cells and elements including Schwann cells and mast cells among others. In contrast, <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>II</b> is characterized by schwannomas located on the eighth cranial nerve.

Children with certain hereditary diseases, such as <b>neurofibromatosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>II</b> (NF2), {{have been found to be}} more frequently afflicted with this class of tumors, but a firm genetic link remains to be established. Symptoms associated with the development of pediatric ependymomas are varied, much like symptoms for a number of other pediatric brain tumors including vomiting, headache, irritability, lethargy, and changes in gait.
