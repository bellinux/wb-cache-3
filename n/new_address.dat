The Motherhouse was planned to be a multistory building, built of grey stone, financed by borrowed money. Plans for the motherhouse had been drawn up in 1852 but the Montreal fires of July 8, 1852, which destroyed around 11,000 homes along with the Saint-Jacques Cathedral, had the result of delaying construction projects throughout the city.|$|E

25|$|Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's Agnes Grey, {{appeared}} in 1847 after many tribulations, again {{for reasons of}} finding a publisher. The packets containing the manuscripts often returned to the parsonage and Charlotte simply added a <b>new</b> <b>address</b> and did this {{at least a dozen}} times during the year. The first one was finally published by Smith, Elder & Co in London, of which the 23-year-old owner George Smith had been specialised until then in publishing scientific revues aided by his perspicacious reader, William Smith Williams and remained faithful to the family. Those of Emily and Anne were confided to Thomas Cautley Newby who intended to compile a three-decker, more economical for sale and for loan in the circulating libraries the two first volumes to include Wuthering Heights and the third one Agnes Grey. Both the novels attracted critical acclaim, occasionally harsh about Wuthering Heights, praised for the originality of the subject and its narrative style, but viewed with suspicion because of its outrageous violence and immorality – surely, the critics wrote, a work of a man with a depraved mind – fairly neutral about Agnes Grey, more flattering in spite of certain commentators denouncing it as an affront to morals and good mores, for Jane Eyre which soon became what would be called today a best-seller.|$|E

Using the <b>new</b> <b>addressing</b> scheme, many routing algorithms designed for networks using square-based topologies such as mesh and torus {{can also be}} applied to hexagonal networks. Methods of applying the turn model to hexagonal networks are derived, with some new minimal and partial adaptive routing algorithms obtained.

The {{results show that the}} proposed algorithms can offer lower packet delay and loss rate than the popular dimension order routing algorithm. key words: routing algorithm, hexagonal network, addressing, turn model 1...|$|R

500|$|Grant {{was fascinated}} by the work of the occultist Aleister Crowley, having read a number of his books. Eager to meet Crowley, Grant unsuccessfully wrote to Crowley's {{publisher}}s, asking them to give him his address; however, the publisher had moved address themselves, meaning that they never received his letter. He also requested that Michael Houghton, proprietor of Central London's esoteric bookstore Atlantis Bookshop, introduce him to Crowley. Houghton refused, privately remarking that Grant was [...] "mentally unstable." [...] Grant later stated his opinion that Houghton had refused because he didn't wish to [...] "incur evil karma" [...] from introducing the young man to Crowley, but later suggested that it was because Houghton desired him for his own organisation, The Order of Hidden Masters, and thereby didn't want him to become Crowley's disciple. Persisting, Grant wrote letters to the <b>new</b> <b>address</b> of Crowley's publishers, asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself. These resulted in the first meeting between the two, in autumn 1944, at the Bell Inn in Buckinghamshire.|$|E

Police officer Cybil Bennett arrives and decides {{to take him to}} the police station, but they become caught in a blizzard, and Harry eventually leaves her car to continue his search. Eventually, Harry finds his way to the local high school, where he learns from a woman named Michelle Valdez that a Cheryl Mason attended school there previously, but then moved.

Contrary to previous approaches, the proposed approach focuses on the addressing mode of the instruction set architecture. It adopts scaled register offset addressing mode and post-indexed addressing mode from the 32 -bit ARM architecture, which is the superset of the 16 -bit Thumb architecture. To provide the encoding space for the <b>new</b> <b>addressing</b> modes, the register fields in the LDM and STM instructions are reduced, which are not frequently executed.
