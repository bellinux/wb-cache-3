5|$|Because Lynott {{had worked}} {{alongside}} Smith at the Rainbow Pub, West Midlands Police wished to re-examine {{the cause of}} her death. In early 2001, investigators asked the Irish authorities for a <b>new</b> <b>post</b> mortem, and on 8 March Lynott's body was exhumed by Gardai from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to Dublin City Morgue for further examination by Ireland's State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison. However, {{the results of this}} autopsy also proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Captain Charles Morris assumed {{command of}} Congress and {{assigned}} to the squadron under Bainbridge.

5|$|Following the battalion's move up {{the railway}} line in July, Blackader was {{transferred}} to a <b>new</b> <b>post</b> at Balmoral; {{as well as the}} railway station, he was made responsible for a civilian concentration camp outside the town. These camps were frequently crowded, unhealthy, and badly supplied; few reports have survived on the Balmoral camp, however, and {{it is not clear how}} efficient or otherwise Blackader's administration was.|$|E

5|$|In 1584 Skarga was {{transferred}} to the new Jesuit College at Kraków. On 26 March 1587 he founded the Polish version of the Mount of Piety, a pawnbroker run as a charity and called in Polish the Bank Pobożny (lit. the Pious Bank). In 1588 the newly elected King Sigismund III Vasa established the <b>new</b> <b>post</b> of court preacher, and Skarga became the first priest to hold it. Skarga became a valued adviser to the King, and Sigismund became so fond of him that when the priest considered retirement, Sigismund rejected this, requesting that he remain at court for as long as possible.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic mailing lists: The main {{difference}} between forums and electronic mailing lists is that mailing lists automatically deliver new {{messages to the}} subscriber, while forums require the reader to visit the website and check for <b>new</b> <b>posts.</b> Because members may miss replies in threads they are interested in, many modern forums offer an [...] "e-mail notification" [...] feature, whereby members can choose to be notified of <b>new</b> <b>posts</b> in a thread, and web feeds that allow members to see {{a summary of the}} <b>new</b> <b>posts</b> using aggregator software.

5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the <b>new</b> <b>post</b> of Vice-President.|$|E
5|$|When White {{retired as}} Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely {{expected}} to succeed him, {{as he had}} {{as chief of staff}} of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from more senior officers, particularly Major General Victor Sellheim, at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the <b>new</b> <b>post</b> of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock {{that his father had}} {{received}} from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the <b>new</b> <b>post</b> of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Gates and Allen {{launched}} Microsoft, {{which became}} the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. Gates stepped down as {{chief executive officer of}} Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a <b>new</b> <b>post</b> as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.|$|E
5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the <b>new</b> <b>post,</b> becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1913, Howe {{journeyed to}} Northwestern Ontario {{to take up}} his <b>new</b> <b>post.</b> The Board was {{headquartered}} in Fort William, Ontario, where Canadian wheat was transferred from rail to ship. The Board sought to build a series of large terminal grain elevators, which could process as well as store grain. The project would increase both capacity and competition—grain elevator companies had been accused by farmers' interests of charging excessive prices. The first such elevator for the Board was raised in nearby Port Arthur, Ontario, and was acclaimed {{as one of the}} best grain elevators ever built in Canada, and one of the cheapest. Over the next two years, Howe traveled the West, supervising the construction of terminal elevators near major cities and ports. The capacity would be needed, as Canadian farmers increased production during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his <b>new</b> <b>post.</b> In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|Like scholar-officials, {{military}} generals {{were ranked}} in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations {{every five years}} (as opposed to three years for officials). However, military officers had less prestige than officials. This was due to their hereditary service (instead of solely merit-based) and Confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence (wu) over the cultured pursuits of knowledge (wen). Although seen as less prestigious, military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations, and after 1478 the military even held their own examinations to test military skills. In addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the Yuan period, the Ming emperors established the <b>new</b> <b>post</b> of the travelling military inspector. In the early half of the dynasty, men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office; this trend was reversed during {{the latter half of}} the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E
5|$|Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a pacifistic journalist, {{had built}} up the {{educational}} resources of the Navy and made its Naval War College an essential experience for would-be admirals. However, he alienated the officer corps with his moralistic reforms (no wine in the officers' mess, no hazing at Annapolis, more chaplains and YMCAs). Ignoring the nation's strategic needs, and disdaining the advice of its experts, Daniels suspended meetings of the Joint Army and Navy Board for two years because it was giving unwelcome advice. He chopped in half the General Board's recommendations for new ships, reduced the authority of officers in the Navy yards where ships were built and repaired, and ignored the administrative chaos in his department. Bradley Fiske, {{one of the most}} innovative admirals in American naval history, was Daniels' top aide in 1914; he recommended a reorganization that would prepare for war, but Daniels refused. Instead, he replaced Fiske in 1915 and brought in for the <b>new</b> <b>post</b> of Chief of Naval Operations an unknown captain, William S. Benson. Chosen for his compliance, Benson proved a wily bureaucrat who was more interested in preparing for an eventual showdown with Britain than an immediate one with Germany.|$|E
