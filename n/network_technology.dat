25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{formation}} through mergers and acquisitions, as well as the rapid technological change in the wireless industry, AT Mobility operates the second largest digital voice and data network within its United States footprint, reaching over 310 million people or 99.99999% established coverage using different wireless communication standards. The core technology standard for the AT Mobility wireless network is called Global System for Mobile Communications, or GSM. Much of the AT Mobility network footprint now uses UMTS / HSPA+ Version 2 standard 3GPP+ wireless technologies (UMTS/HSPA) for simultaneous circuit switched voice and packet switched data communications. AT Mobility also offers Push To Talk (PTT) service using <b>network</b> <b>technology</b> from Kodiak Networks.|$|E

The University acquired the building and adjacent property in 2004, formerly home to the Angelica Uniform Factory. Several University administrative departments are located at the North Campus location, including offices for Quadrangle Housing, Accounting and Treasury Services, Parking and Transportation Services, Army ROTC, and <b>Network</b> <b>Technology</b> Services. The North Campus location also provides off-site storage space for the Performing Arts Department. Renovations are still ongoing; recent additions to the North Campus space include a small eatery operated by Bon Appétit Management Company, the University's on-campus food provider, completed during spring semester 2007, {{as well as the}} Family Learning Center, operated by Bright Horizons and opened in September 2010.|$|E

The energy consumption of ICTs is today significant even when compared with other industries. Some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices (network elements). This analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself.

2500|$|Three Growlers {{networked}} together {{can generate}} targeting tracks for hostile radio-frequency sources in real time, {{but this is}} difficult to arrange with the current minimum strength US Navy squadrons. Utilizing faster data-links, the Growler could use its EW pods to accurately locate signal sources. In {{a group of three}} planes, when one detects a signal from a source such as a cell phone, the other two can also listen for the same signal, all three measuring the amount of time taken for transmissions to travel from the source to each aircraft to triangulate the location in [...] "a very, very small area." [...] By early 2015, the Navy had demonstrated this concept using EA-18s equipped with Rockwell Collins' tactical targeting <b>network</b> <b>technology</b> (TTNT) and ALQ-218 receivers to acquire emissions from a target vessel and target it from a stand-off range without using their own detectable radar emissions.
