5|$|On May 19, {{prior to}} the start of the season, NOAA forecasters issued a 55%probability of above <b>normal</b> <b>activity.</b> The forecasters {{predicted}} 11–15 tropical storms, 6–9 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2–4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The above <b>normal</b> <b>activity</b> predicted was due to the likelihood of La Niña developing in the season.|$|E

5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, {{the first time}} it had done so. The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below <b>normal</b> <b>activity</b> this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which is the opposite of its effect in the Atlantic.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Intrusions into {{computer}} systems have caused many quality/reliability problems. Detecting intrusions {{is an important}} part of assuring the quality/reliability of {{computer systems}} by quickly detecting intrusions and associated quality/reliability problems in order to take corrective actions. In this paper, we present and compare two methods of forecasting <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> in computer systems for intrusion detection. One forecasting method uses the average of long-term <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> as the forecast. Another forecasting method uses the EWMA (exponen-tially weighted moving average) one-step-ahead forecast. We use a Markov chain model to learn and predict <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> used in the EWMA forecasting method. A forecast of <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> is used to detect a large deviation of the observed activities from the forecast as a possible intrusion into computer systems. A Chi square distance metric is used to measure the deviation of the observed activities from the forecast of <b>normal</b> <b>activities.</b> The two forecasting methods are tested on computer audit data of <b>normal</b> and intrusive <b>activities</b> for intrusion detection. The results indicate that the Chi square distance measure with the EWMA forecasting provides better performance in intrusion detection than that with the average-based forecasting method.

5|$|After {{the season}} began, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near <b>normal</b> <b>activity,</b> {{but the same}} number of storms forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, which matched CSU's final prediction on October1.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had maintained his previous prediction; with an active {{start of the}} season, {{the rest of the}} season was forecast to have been only slightly above average, due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the Atlantic Ocean. A day later, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 60% probability of above <b>normal</b> <b>activity,</b> with 12–15 named storms, 7–9 hurricanes, and 3–4 major hurricanes expected.|$|E

5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a <b>normal</b> <b>activity</b> at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was {{certainly}} well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. <b>Normal</b> <b>activity</b> should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E

25|$|After a nerve lesion {{of either}} C fibers or Aδ fibers, they become {{abnormally}} sensitive and cause pathological spontaneous activity. This alteration of <b>normal</b> <b>activity</b> {{is explained by}} molecular and cellular changes of the primary afferent nociceptors {{in response to the}} nerve damage. The abnormal activity of the damaged nerves is associated with the increased presence of mRNA for voltage-gated sodium channels. Irregular grouping of these channels in sites of the abnormal activity may be responsible for lowering the activation threshold, thus leading to hyperactivity.|$|E
25|$|Compulsions in male lab mice, such {{as those}} in {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme aromatase in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. Hypothalamic protein levels in the gene COMT are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to <b>normal</b> <b>activity.</b> Aromatase deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|Lateral {{internal}} sphincterotomy (LIS) is {{the surgical}} procedure {{of choice for}} anal fissures due to its simplicity and its high success rate (~95%). In this procedure the internal anal sphincter is partially divided {{in order to reduce}} spasming and thus improve the blood supply to the perianal area. This improvement in the blood supply helps to heal the fissure, and the weakening of the sphincter is also believed to reduce the potential for recurrence. The procedure is generally performed as a day surgery after the patient is given general anesthesia. The pain from the sphincterotomy is usually mild and is often less than the pain of the fissure itself. Patients often return to <b>normal</b> <b>activity</b> within one week.|$|E

25|$|Endovascular repair {{first became}} {{practical}} in the 1990s {{and although it}} is now an established alternative to open repair, its role {{is yet to be}} clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in intensive care, less time in hospital overall and earlier return to <b>normal</b> <b>activity.</b> Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone. Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.|$|E

40|$|Healthy {{aging is}} one of the most {{important}} social issues. In this paper, we propose a method for abnormal activity detection without any manual labeling of the training samples. By leveraging the Field of View (FOV) modulation, the spatio-temporal characteristic of human activity is encoded into low-dimension data stream generated by the ceiling-mounted Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensors. The similarity between normal training samples are measured based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of each pair of them. The natural clustering of <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> is discovered through a self-tuning spectral clustering algorithm with unsupervised model selection on the eigenvectors of a modified similarity matrix. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are employed to model each cluster of <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> and form feature vectors. One-Class Support Vector Machines (OSVMs) are used to profile the <b>normal</b> <b>activities</b> and detect abnormal activities. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted experiments in real indoor environments. The encouraging results show that our method is able to detect abnormal activities given only the normal training samples, which aims to avoid the laborious and inconsistent data labeling process...|$|R
