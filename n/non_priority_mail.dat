50|$|In May 2007, the USPS {{restructured}} international service {{names to}} correspond with domestic shipping options. Formerly, USPS International services were categorized as Airmail (Letter Post), Economy (Surface) Parcel Post, Airmail Parcel Post, Global Priority, Global Express, and Global Express Guaranteed Mail. The former Airmail (Letter Post) is now First-Class Mail International, and includes small packages weighing up to four pounds (1.8 kg). Economy Parcel Post was discontinued for international service, while Airmail Parcel Post was replaced by <b>Priority</b> <b>Mail</b> International. <b>Priority</b> <b>Mail</b> International Flat-Rate packaging in various sizes was introduced, with the same conditions of service previously used for Global Priority. Global Express is now Express Mail International, while Global Express Guaranteed is unchanged.

5000|$|The term <b>Priority</b> <b>Mail</b> Express International {{is often}} {{confused}} with their domestic service called <b>Priority</b> <b>Mail</b> Express, {{which is a}} specific classification of mail for domestic accelerated postal delivery within the U.S. In 2013, the USPS changed {{the name of the}} service from [...] "Express Mail International" [...] to [...] "Priority Mail Express International".

40|$|Load {{balancing}} is {{an efficient}} solution that distributes excess workload evenly to all nodes in cloud environment. The Load balancing model {{is used for}} the public cloud having numerous nodes in different geographic locations. The model divides public cloud into several cloud partitions. When partition status becomes overloaded, cloud partitioning is repeated. It reduces the working efficiency and expected response time of the system. To overcome this issue we propose a novel load balancing strategy for overloaded cloud partition. The overloaded load balancing strategy maintains two queues at overloaded condition. Priority queue is used when the cloud partition status is idle and normal and <b>non</b> <b>priority</b> queue is used when partition status is overloaded. At overloaded condition an overloaded partition scheduling algorithm {{is used for the}} allocation of jobs to <b>Non</b> <b>priority</b> queue.

On this survey NASS collects highly detailed economic data from agricultural producers nationwide. The ARMS Phase III Core version is a self-administered data collection instrument that uses a mail-out/mail back methodology. For 2004, an incentive experiment was conducted using this component of the ARMS. The use of incentives, particularly monetary ones, in surveys {{has proved to be}} effective at increasing response rates. Five treatment groups, including a control group, were used for the incentive experiment. Prepaid and promised indirect cash incentives – in the form of $ 20 automated teller machine (ATM) cards – and <b>priority</b> <b>mail</b> were used as stimuli. The prepaid incentives were the most effective at increasing response rates and decreasing data collection costs.
