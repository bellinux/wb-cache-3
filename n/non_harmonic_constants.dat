40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} baroclinic {{shelf sea}} model is employed {{to evaluate the}} precision of the predicted tidal <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants</b> under different conditions in the South China Sea (SCS). Several numerical experiments, including different model dimensions (two-dimension or three-dimension), prescribed open boundary conditions (without or with mean sea surface elevation), astronomical tidal forcing, stratifications (without or with baroclinic effect) and wind forcing, are carried out. The resulted time series of surface elevation data are stored to yield <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants</b> for the four most significant constituents, M- 2, S- 2, K- 1 and O- 1, and the computed <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants</b> are compared with the observed ones.

The model {{is based on}} the major regional inundation factors - spring tides and warm-water mass, integrated with the digital elevation. Nineteen years of sea level data from tide gauge and satellite altimetry are analyzed to predict regional flooding. Harmonic analysis is used in analyzing tidal variations to determine the major astronomical tidal constituent <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants.</b> Tidal variation prediction can be performed with these <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants.</b> The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is then applied to the sea level data derived from altimetry for extracting warm-water mass variation. Ninety percent of sea level data points are used for analysis, and the remaining 10 % are used for testing the prediction accuracy. The sea level data derived from along-track satellite altimeter near Tuvalu is decomposed into eight modes and one local trend using the EMD method. The EMD mode periods found by fast Fourier transform (FFT) include monthly, intra-seasonally, half-yearly, yearly, bi-annually, and inter-annually oscillations. We apply these periods to harmonic analysis to predict the variations in warm-water mass. The sea level tide and warm-water mass combination predictions are compared to field measurements.

This means that time, gain and offset mismatch errors are introduced in the ADC system, which cause <b>non</b> <b>harmonic</b> distortion in the sampled signal. One way to decrease the impact of the mismatch errors is to spread the distortion over a wider frequency range by random-izing the order in which the ADCs are used in the interleaved structure.
