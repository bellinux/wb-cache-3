5|$|<b>New</b> <b>methods</b> of {{producing}} it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, <b>new</b> <b>methods</b> {{of producing}} bar iron without charcoal were devised {{and these were}} later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E

The <b>new</b> <b>method</b> requires solving five linear systems per iteration. An important feature of the <b>new</b> <b>method</b> is that the LU (lower upper, also called LU factorization) decomposition of the Jacobian matrix is computed only once in each iteration.

5|$|Major Hans-Günther von Kornatzki {{had formed}} an {{experimental}} unit to evaluate <b>new</b> <b>methods</b> of bomber attack. Sturmstaffel 1 consisted entirely of volunteers trained {{to engage the}} enemy bombers in extremely close quarters, utilising specially armed and up-armored Fw 190's (so-called Sturmböcke) or Battering Rams). These were intended to attack the bombers from the rear in tight arrowhead formations, closing to extreme close range, as replacements for the formerly-dedicated Zerstörer twin-engined heavy fighters, which themselves were being shot down in ever-increasing numbers by Allied escort fighters. In January 1944, the 18 Staffel unit was transferred to Dortmund where they were subordinated to Major Rudolf-Emil Schnoor and his I./JG 1.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying <b>new</b> <b>methods</b> within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders.

He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E

5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of <b>new</b> <b>methods</b> of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E

This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers.

5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. <b>New</b> <b>methods</b> are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E
