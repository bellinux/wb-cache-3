On 27 June 1387, the Constable was seized and imprisoned, and the Duke ordered that Olivier be sealed in a bag and thrown into water, but this order is not followed through by Jehan Bazvalan, <b>the</b> weapons master <b>of</b> Duke John IV, who was content to keep him locked up.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> assignment <b>of</b> {{assets to}} tasks where each asset can potentially execute any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tasks, but assets execute tasks with a probabilistic outcome of success. There is a cost {{associated with each}} possible assignment of an asset to a task, and if a task is not executed {{there is also a}} cost associated with <b>the</b> <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task. As we proposed in [Gelenbe, E., Timotheou, S., and Nicholson, D. (2010). Fast distributed near optimum assignment of assets to tasks. Comput. J., doi: 10. 1093 /comjnl/bxq 010], we formulate <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> assets to tasks in order to minimize the overall expected cost, as a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem. We propose <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> network flow algorithms which are based on solving a sequence of minimum cost flow problems on appropriately constructed networks with estimated arc costs. We introduce three different schemes for <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arc costs and we investigate their performance compared with a random neural network algorithm and a greedy algorithm. We also develop an approach for obtaining tight lower bounds to the optimal solution based on a piecewise linear approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considered problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} evaluates <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Framework <b>Agreements</b> on Telework and Work-related Stress in Belgium, Denmark, UK, and Czech Republic and in {{the banking}} and local Government sectors within these countries. Further, it evaluates the various factors that explain divergent implementation outcomes in countries and sectors. It develops two benchmarks to assess <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> as modes <b>of</b> European social partner ‘soft’ law governance; a benchmark that assesses <b>the</b> procedural implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements,</b> and a benchmark that assess <b>the</b> substantive implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements.</b> A multi-level governance theoretical approach is also adopted. It emerged that ‘effective’ procedural implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> largely occurred in Belgium and Czech Republic, but did not occur {{to the same degree}} in Denmark and UK. It also emerged that <b>the</b> substantive effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> was patchy and that <b>the</b> substantive impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Telework <b>Agreement</b> was greater than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Work-related Stress <b>Agreement.</b> Although structural factors were important in explaining divergent implementation outcomes, it also emerged that it was primarily policy and actor related factors that explained divergent national and sectoral implementation outcomes. The research ends with a rather skeptical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> as modes <b>of</b> European social partner ‘soft’ law governance.
