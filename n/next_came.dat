5|$|However, pay {{would have}} been much more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The top of the pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|Labour {{comprised}} skilled volunteers, engineers, {{designers and}} supervisors, who were paid and treated well, second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and metal workers, again these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly, lastly came effective slave labour, paid so little, badly fed and treated very harshly. The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.|$|E
5|$|<b>Next</b> <b>came</b> the {{assembly}} {{of a team of}} producers who were to organize the festival's events. Notably Kyle Gibson, an Emmy Award-winning former producer of Nightline with Ted Koppel, joined the festival as senior program producer, while production of the Youth and Family Program was put into the hands of Robin Reardon, a former show producer for Walt Disney Imagineering and former vice president of Universal Studios Creative, who also became the festival's managing director.|$|E

New ECM devices had hurriedly been deployed to protect aircraft from missile attacks, but they remained subject to frequent breakdowns because of climate conditions in Southeast Asia. Also {{included in the}} missions were KC-135 aerial tankers and Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters, which were, in turn, protected by propeller-driven A-1 escorts.|$|E
5|$|Kidd's first choreography on Broadway was for E.Y. Harburg's Finian's Rainbow, a lyrical musical that {{explored}} racial prejudice. Kidd won {{his first}} Tony Award for that play. However, his next Broadway musicals were not successful. They were Hold It, a college musical, and the Kurt Weill/Alan Jay Lerner musical Love Life, directed by Elia Kazan, which both had short runs in 1948. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> Arms and the Girl (1950), directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with Pearl Bailey and Nanette Fabray, also a flop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Next</b> <b>came</b> {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E

5|$|The {{relief of}} the {{garrison}} and replacement with fresh troops were finally agreed. The first stage saw the 1st Polish Carpathian Brigade replace the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> the 6th Infantry Division's 16th Infantry Brigade, during late September, with {{elements of the}} 32nd Army Tank Brigade, {{in lieu of the}} 24th Australian Infantry Brigade. On 10October, for security reasons and in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence as to when the division was fully redeployed, the 6th Infantry Division was renamed the 70th Infantry Division. Major-General Ronald Scobie was given command.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the carpet}} quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no {{more for the}} Savoy. When The Gondoliers closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends George Dance, Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece, The Nautch Girl, which ran for a {{satisfying}} 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy's The Vicar of Bray, which ran through the summer of 1892. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, which held the stage until April 1893. While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{dominated}} in {{all aspects}} of the game and defeated Minnesota 58–0. In the first quarter Vincent Smith ran in a three-yard touchdown, which was followed by a Denard Robinson nine-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter Drew Dileo caught a 17-yard pass from Vincent Smith, which was followed by a Vincent Smith 28-yard touchdown reception, his second touchdown of the game. Michigan's next scoring play came on a 25-yard field goal by Brendan Gibbons. Just before halftime, Kevin Koger caught an 18-yard pass for a touchdown. After the break, Fitzgerald Touissant rushed for a one-yard touchdown. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> two more field goals from Gibbons: first from 32 yards, then in the fourth quarter from 38 yards. Michigan scored its final points when Courtney Avery picked up a Minnesota fumble and ran it back 83 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|After this truce, Grant's army {{began to}} fill the 12-mile ring around Vicksburg. In short time {{it became clear that}} even 50,000 Union {{soldiers}} {{would not be able to}} effect a complete encirclement of the Confederate defenses. Pemberton's outlook on escape was pessimistic, but there were still roads leading south out of Vicksburg unguarded by Federal troops. Grant found help from Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, the Union general-in-chief. Halleck quickly began to shift Union troops in the West to meet Grant's needs. The first of these reinforcements to arrive along the siege lines was a 5,000 man division from the Department of the Missouri under Maj. Gen. Francis J. Herron on June 11. Herron's troops, remnants of the Army of the Frontier, were attached to McPherson's corps and took up position on the far south. <b>Next</b> <b>came</b> a three division detachment from the XVI Corps led by Brig. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn on June 12, assembled from troops at nearby posts of Corinth, Memphis, and LaGrange. The final significant group of reinforcements to join was the 8,000 man strong IX Corps from the Department of the Ohio, led by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, arriving on June 14. With the arrival of Parke, Grant had 77,000 men around Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Next</b> <b>came</b> {{the match}} between Irwin R. Schyster and Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental Championship, for which Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon {{took over the}} {{commentary}} roles. The match began with a brawl between the two, and Ramon got the early advantage. Schyster eventually threw Ramon over the top rope and attacked him on the floor. I.R.S. kept control of the match for quite a while, applying a reverse chinlock while using the ring ropes for additional leverage. After Ramon escaped the hold, {{he was able to}} perform a fallaway slam on Schyster. He then used an Irish Whip to throw Schyster into the corner, but the match turned around with a ref bump when referee Joey Marella was in the way and was kayfabe knocked unconscious. Shawn Michaels ran to the ring with his fake Intercontinental belt and hit Ramon with it, and Schyster helped revive Marella to count the pinfall. I.R.S. appeared to win the title, but referee Earl Hebner came to the ring and explained the situation to Marella. When Michaels' belt was discovered in the ring, the match was restarted. Ramon simply grabbed Schyster, who was standing on the second turnbuckle celebrating, and performed the Razor's Edge for the victory.|$|E
