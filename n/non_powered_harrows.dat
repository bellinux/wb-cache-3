40|$|Farmers try {{to reduce}} steps of soil {{preparation}} by using subsoiler and then following by equipment for soil pulverization such as a rotary tiller and a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the tilling performances of a rotary tiller and a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> applying after subsoiling. The results showed that both the rotary tiller and the <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> had negative slip, indicating that they generated force to push a tractor. The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the <b>power</b> <b>harrow.</b> Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for two equipment types were significantly different. However, {{no significant differences were found}} for the forward speeds, slips, drawbar pulls and drawbar powers. Comparative analysis showed that two equipment types had significant difference in PTO power to working depth, drawbar power to working depth, PTO power to working area, drawbar power to working area and soil pulverization...|$|R

Each set of tines is rotated on a vertical axis and tills the soil horizontally. The result is that, unlike a rotary tiller, soil layers are not turned over or inverted, which {{is useful in}} preventing dormant weed seeds from being brought to the surface, {{and there is no}} horizontal slicing of the subsurface soil that can lead to hardpan formation.|$|R

50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the disc harrow, the chain harrow, the tine harrow or spike harrow and the spring tine harrow.

40|$|The wear {{resistance}} of rotary plows {{operating in a}} clay loam soil was studied. The degree of damage caused to the soil {{and the amount of}} mass lost by the tools were determined in order to establish correlations between the physical properties of the soil and the wear mechanisms acting on the tribosystem. Field tests were carried out in 12 plots and a randomized experimental design with 4 levels, 3 replicas per level and 2 passes per plot was applied. The levels relate to the tillage implements employed: rotary tiller, rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> small motorized rotary tiller and control (unaltered soil). The highest mass losses were measured in rotary tiller and rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow's</b> tools, while the small motorized rotary tiller's tools showed generally lower levels of damage. It was determined that the effective contact time between tool and soil, the rotating speed and the sudden impact forces are the most significant factors affecting the {{wear resistance}} in field operations. Thirty days after tillage operation the soil samples were taken from each plot at a mean depth of 100 mm in order to determine bulk density, gravimetric moisture content and percentage of aggregates smaller than 5 mm. No significant differences among the values of these properties were found in the experiments. The wear mechanisms acting on the tools' surface are complex and include 2 -body and 3 -body abrasion as well as the presence of sudden impact forces...|$|R

40|$|About 60 % of the {{mechanical}} energy consumed in mechanized agriculture is used for tillage operations and seedbed preparation. On the other hand, unsuitable tillage system resulted in soil degradation, affecting soil physical properties and destroying soil structure. The objective {{of this research was}} to compare the effects of three types of secondary tillage machines on soil physical properties and their field performances. An experiment was conducted in a wheat farm in Jouybar area of Mazandaran as split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications. The main independent variable (plot) was soil moisture with three levels (23. 6 - 25, 22. 2 - 23. 6 and 20. 8 - 22. 2 percent based on dry weight) and the subplot was three types of machine (two-disk perpendicular passing <b>harrow,</b> <b>Power</b> <b>harrow</b> and Rotary tiller).

40|$|For {{three-phase}} four-wire circuits, two compensation criteria {{have been}} established: {{one based on}} the instantaneous value concept {{and the other on}} the average value concept. Thus, according to the instantaneous value concept the <b>non</b> instantaneous <b>power</b> current is reduced, without altering the instantaneous active power. According to the average value concept, the nonactive average-current is reduced, without altering the average power. When the zero-sequence voltage component exists, both compensation types would not enable the zero-sequence (neutral) source current elimination. Then, two approaches are marked in this paper. The first one is for eliminating the <b>non</b> instantaneous <b>power</b> current or the nonactive average-current but the neutral current can still flow. The second one for eliminating the modified <b>non</b> instantaneous <b>power</b> current or the modified nonactive average-current, thus the neutral current component is compensated. According to recent recommendations in this work three-phase systems are considered as four-conductor systems. Experimental results are obtained to confirm the theoretical properties and to show the compensator performance.

40|$|Soil surface {{roughness}} (SSR) and porosity were evaluated from soils located in two farms {{belonging to the}} Plant Breeding Institute of the University of Sidney. The sites differ in their soil management practices; the first site (PBI) was strip-tilled during early fall (May 2010), and the second site (JBP) was under <b>power</b> <b>harrowed</b> tillage {{at the end of}} July 2010. Both sites were sampled in mid-August. At each location, SSR was measured for three 1 [*]m 2 subplots using shadow analysis. To evaluate porosity and aggregation, soil samples were scanned using X-ray computed tomography with 5 [*]μm resolution. The results show a strong negative correlation between SSR and porosity, 20. 13 % SSR and 41. 38 % porosity at PBI versus 42. 00 % SSR and 18. 35 % porosity at JBP. However, soil images show that when soil {{surface roughness}} is higher due to conservation and soil management practices, the processes of macroaggregation and structural porosity are enhanced. Further research must be conducted on SSR and porosity in different types of soils, as they provide complementary information on the evaluation of soil erosion susceptibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} of {{fracture}} toughness K 1 C prediction of <b>non</b> <b>power</b> law hardening material by using cleavage fracture local approach is proposed in this paper. The fracture toughness of A 508 - 16 MnR at different cleavage fracture probability are predicted {{by using the}} method. To most of pressure vessel carbon-manganese steels, cleavage fracture is likely to occur at the load corresponding to 62 % cleavage fracture probability. Hence, the fracture toughness corresponding to the load is the most possible fracture toughness of the steels. The values of fracture toughness corresponding to 62 % cleavage fracture probability is close to that of testing fracture toughness. The work of this paper expends the application of Beremin cleavage fracture model in predicting fracture toughness...|$|R
