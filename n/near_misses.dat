40|$|Abstract Background Falling {{numbers of}} {{maternal}} deaths have stimulated {{an interest in}} investigating cases of life threatening obstetric morbidity or <b>near</b> <b>miss.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to document the frequency and causes of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> and maternal deaths in four hospitals in West Java, Indonesia. Methods Cross sectional study in four hospitals in two districts in Banten province, Indonesia. We reviewed registers and case notes to identify the numbers and causes of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> and death between November 2003 and October 2004. <b>Near</b> <b>miss</b> cases were defined based on organ dysfunction, clinical and management criteria. <b>Near</b> <b>miss</b> were categorized by whether or not the woman was at a critical state at admission by reviewing the final signs at admission. Results The prevalence of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> was much greater in public than in private hospitals (17. 3 % versus 4. 2 %, p = 0. 000). Hemorrhage and hypertensive diseases were the most common diagnoses associated with <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> and vascular dysfunction was the most common criterion of organ dysfunction. The occurrence of maternal deaths was 1. 6 %, with non-obstetric complications as the leading cause. The majority (70. 7 %) of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> in public hospitals were in a critical state at admission but this proportion was much lower in private hospitals (31. 9 %). Conclusion This is the first study to document <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> in public and private hospitals in Indonesia. Close to a fifth of admissions in public hospitals were associated with near miss; and the critical state in which the women arrived suggest important delays in reaching the hospitals. Even though the private sector takes an increasingly larger share of facility-based births in Indonesia, managing obstetric emergencies remains the domain of the public sector. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{neonatal}} <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> {{has been proposed}} {{as a tool for}} assessment of quality of care in neonates who suffered any life-threatening condition. However, there are no internationally agreed concepts or criteria for defining or identifying neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform a systematic review of studies and markers that are able to identify neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> cases and predict neonatal mortality. Electronic searches were performed in the Medline, Embase and Scielo databases, with no time or language restriction, until December 2014. The term neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> was used alone or in combination with terms related to neonatal morbidity/mortality and neonatal severity scores. Study selection criteria involved three steps: title, abstract and full text of the articles. Two researchers performed study selection and data extraction independently. Heterogeneity of study results did not permit the performance of meta-analysis. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria adopted, only four articles were selected. Preterm and perinatal asphyxia were used as <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> markers in all studies. Health indicators on neonatal morbidity and mortality were extracted or estimated.

40|$|Maternal {{mortality}} {{is one of}} the important indicators used for the measurement of maternal health.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} self-reported maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> and adverse nutritional status in children under one year of age. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a study in which women who took their children under one year of age to the national vaccine campaign were interviewed. The self-reported condition of maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> used the criteria of Intensive Care Unit admission; eclampsia; blood transfusion and hysterectomy; and their potential associations with any type of nutritional disorder in children, including deficits in weight-for-age, deficits in height-for-age, obesity and breastfeeding. The rates of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> for the country, regions and states were initially estimated. The relative risks of infant adverse nutritional status according to <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> and maternal/childbirth characteristics were estimated with their 95 % CIs using bivariate and multiple analyses. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> was 2. 9 % and was slightly higher for the Legal Amazon than for other regions. No significant associations were found with nutritional disorders in children.

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} use of the {{neonatal}} <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> concept as a tool to evaluate the quality of neonatal care, as 3 million early neonatal deaths occur every year around the world and the majority of these deaths are avoidable and take place in developing countries. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the 2005 WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health, a cross-sectional study, using data from 19 randomly selected Brazilian hospitals. A pragmatic definition of neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> was developed and tested. <b>Near</b> <b>miss</b> indicators were calculated. Results: Among the 15, 169 live born infants included in this analysis, 424 presented {{at least one of the}} following conditions: very low birth weight, less than 30 gestational weeks at birth or an Apgar score at the 5 th minute of life less than 7. According to the operational definition, these survivors from life-threatening conditions were considered neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> cases. The early neonatal mortality rate was 8. 2 / 1, 000 live births, the neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> rate was 21. 4 neonatal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> cases/ 1, 000 live births. Substantial variations in the mortality among neonates with life-threatening conditions at birth were observed suggesting intra-hospital quality of care issues. Conclusion: The <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> concept and indicators provided information that could be useful to evaluate the quality of care and set priorities for further assessments and health care improvement for newborn infants.

40|$|A {{pregnancy}} can {{be composed}} {{of a range of}} clinical conditions, ranging from a healthy pregnancy to another limit that is maternal death. Between these two extremes are the conditions described as severe maternal morbidity and <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> which is a more severe condition than the maternal morbidity. In 2009, the WHO standardized maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> approach, as an important tool to uniformly identify cases and evaluate the quality of care for women with serious complications. It is worth emphasizing that women who fall into these situations share many characteristics with maternal deaths, but represent a rich source of details about the determinant factors of their maternal health condition, since they are alive. Participated in this research 941 women who had severe maternal morbidity criteria and/or <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> during the period of July 2009 to June 2010, at the Maternity School Assis Chateaubriand - UFC. They were identified 61 cases of maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> and 880 of severe maternal morbidity non-near miss. The incidence of maternal morbidity non-near miss was 190. 6 and <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> was 10. 8 / 1, 000 live births. The mortality rate of maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> was 18 %. The variables significantly different between the two groups were: color (p = 0. 002) and number of prenatal visits (p < 0. 001). Among the severe maternal morbidity conditions, it was found that eclampsia and the need for ICU admission were the defining of the risk of progressing to death, while the use of magnesium sulfate acted as a protective factor. It was found, also, that have criteria of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> is statistically significant for maternal death (p < 0. 001; ORB = 3. 94; 95 % CI: 1. 66 - 9. 37). Among the defining criteria of <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> the more directly associated with maternal death was the presence of management criteria: all the 11 cases that resulted in death had some management discretion. It was concluded that based health policies and actions in cases of maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> is the most effective means of improving maternal health. Uma gravidez pode ser constituida por uma gama de condiÃÃes clÃnicas, que vÃo desde uma gravidez saudÃvel atÃ o outro limite que Ã a morte materna. Entre os extremos encontram-se as condiÃÃes descritas como morbidade materna grave e <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> que Ã uma condiÃÃo mais grave do que a morbidade materna. Em 2009, a OMS padronizou a abordagem <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> materno, como uma ferramenta importante para identificar uniformemente os casos e avaliar a qualidade dos cuidados prestados Ãs mulheres com complicaÃÃes graves. Vale enfatizar, que as mulheres que se enquadram nestas situaÃÃes compartilham muitas caracterÃsticas com os Ãbitos maternos, porÃm representam uma fonte rica de detalhes acerca dos fatores determinantes da sua condiÃÃo de saÃde materna, uma vez que estas estÃo vivas. Participaram da presente pesquisa 941 mulheres que possuÃam critÃrios de morbidade materna grave e/ou <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> durante o perÃodo de julho de 2009 a junho de 2010, na Maternidade-Escola Assis Chateaubriand-UFC. Foram identificados 61 casos de <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> materno e 880 de morbidade materna grave nÃo-near miss. A incidÃncia de morbidade materna nÃo-near miss foi de 190, 6 e <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> foi de 10, 8 / 1. 000 nascidos vivos. A taxa de mortalidade de <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> materno foi de 18 %. As variÃveis significativamente diferente entre os dois grupos foram: cor (p= 0, 002) e nÃmero de consultas de prÃ-natal (p< 0, 001). Dentre as condiÃÃes de morbidade materna grave, verificou-se que a eclÃmpsia e a necessidade de internaÃÃo em UTI foram os definidores do risco de evoluir ao Ãbito, enquanto a utilizaÃÃo do sulfato de magnÃsio atuou como fator de proteÃÃo. Constatou-se que ter critÃrio de <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> Ã estatisticamente siginificante para a morte materna (p < 0, 001; ORB= 3, 94; IC 95 %: 1, 66 - 9, 37). Entre os critÃrios definidores de <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> o mais diretamente associado ao Ãbito materno foi Ã presenÃa de critÃrios de manejo: todos os 11 casos que culminaram em Ãbito apresentaram algum critÃrio de manejo. Concluiu-se que basear polÃticas e aÃÃes de saÃde nos casos de <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> materno Ã o meio mais eficaz de melhorar a saÃde materna...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: WHO {{proposes a}} set of organ-failure based {{criteria}} for maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss.</b> Our objective was to evaluate what implementation of these criteria would mean {{for the analysis of}} a cohort of 386 women in Thyolo District, Malawi, who sustained severe acute maternal morbidity according to disease-based criteria. Methods and Findings: A WHO Maternal <b>Near</b> <b>Miss</b> (MNM) Tool, created to compare disease-, intervention- and organ-failure based criteria for maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> was completed for each woman, based on a review of all available medical records. Using disease-based criteria developed for the local setting, 341 (88 %) of the 386 women fulfilled the WHO disease-based criteria provided by the WHO MNM Tool, 179 (46 %) fulfilled the intervention-based criteria, and only 85 (22 %) the suggested organ-failure based criteria. Conclusions: In this low-resource setting, application of these organ-failure based criteria that require relatively sophisticated laboratory and clinical monitoring underestimates the occurrence of maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss.</b> Therefore, these criteria and the suggested WHO approach may not be suited to compare maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> across all settings. © 2013 van den Akker et al...|$|R
