5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

25|$|CPI {{increased}} to 148.2. There {{have been relatively}} large <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> increases in particular sectors, such as construction where, on average, workers' nominal wages have risen to almost Rp.60,000 per day, from Rp.29,000 pre-tsunami. This is also reflected in Aceh's minimum regional wage (UMR, or Upah Minimum Regional), which increased by 55% from Rp.550,000 pre-tsunami to Rp.850,000 in 2007, compared with an increase of 42% in neighboring North Sumatra, from Rp.537,000 to Rp.761,000.|$|E

30|$|The {{striking}} {{feature is}} the fact that <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> (as measured by the hourly total labour cost) have always grown above the CPI with hardly any exception, even during the most severe crisis years 2011 – 2012. Between 2000 and 2007, <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> grew by 40  %, consumer prices by 20  % and, as a result, real wages grew by around 20  %. This figure, therefore, shows that <b>nominal</b> <b>wages,</b> consumer prices and, therefore, real wages, are highly insensitive to the business cycle.|$|R
50|$|Labour-market adjustments: <b>Nominal</b> <b>wages</b> {{are slow}} to adjust downwards. This can lead to {{prolonged}} disequilibrium and high unemployment in the labor market. Since inflation allows real wages to fall even if <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> are kept constant, moderate inflation enables labor markets to reach equilibrium faster.|$|R
25|$|The {{government}} actually {{succeeded in}} generating a small surplus {{in the budget}} during {{the second quarter of}} 1994, mainly as a result of higher taxes, after running a deficit of 17 percent of GDP in the first quarter. The slowdown in government spending, a sharp loss in business confidence, and the resulting decline in economic activity reduced tax revenues, however. The fiscal crisis resulted in a decline in real GDP of 5 percent in 1994 after the economy had grown briskly in 1992 and 1993. Real wages also fell in 1994: average <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> increases of 65 percent were about 20 percent below the rate of consumer price inflation.|$|E
500|$|Although the Ross Sea party's main {{role was}} to lay supply depots, Shackleton [...] added a small {{scientific}} team to carry out biological, meteorological and magnetic research in the region. [...] The chief scientist in this group was Alexander Stevens, a Scots geologist and former theology student. John Cope, a 21-year-old Cambridge graduate, was the team's biologist; a would-be medical student, he later became ship's surgeon. [...] Two other scientists were appointed in Australia, the physicist Dick Richards (who {{signed up for a}} <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> of £1 per week) and industrial chemist Keith Jack. An Australian cousin of Spencer-Smith's, Irvine Gaze, was taken on as a general assistant.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E
40|$|Excess {{supply of}} labor leads to low {{the levels of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> {{received}} by workers. The amount of minimum wage rate exceeds the market wage rate. The determination of minimum wage is a factor manifested in the institutional and regulatory Provincial Minimum Wage or a District Minimum Wage. Unfortunately, it has made nominal wages  difficult to drop below the minimum wage level. High or low level of <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> are associated with worker productivity. Further, <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> are rigid to go down. If they have increased, {{they can not be}} dropped in the future even though the company's performance is declined. Knowing that condition, in designing the remuneration system, an employer should pay attention to the rigidity of <b>nominal</b> <b>wages,</b> so that when  company's performance declines, the company will not be interfered because of the wages burden.  Furthermore, unions and government should consider the rigidity impact of <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> that go down. Thus, when macroeconomic conditions deteriorate and company's performance drops, the company will not go bankrupt due to high labor costs. If the company goes bankrupt, the workers will loose their jobs as a result of employment termination, while the government will face the unemployment problem.  </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} international {{labor movement}} in a two-country macroeconomic model {{taking into consideration}} the effects of international labor movement on aggregate demand. For this purpose we assume that inflow (outflow) of foreign (domestic) workers increases (decreases) aggregate demand through the expansion (contraction) of government spending. We show that employment levels decrease in one country when <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> increase in another, implying that labor demanded in two countries are gross complements of each other. We also show that the unemployment rate in one country is independent of <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> in the foreign country. These results are in marked contrast with ones derived in the case where international labor movement does not affect aggregate demand. If international labor movement does not affect aggregate demand, employment levels are independent of the foreign country's <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> and the unemployment rate decreases when <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> increase in the foreign country...|$|R

Here, we further extend this result by disentangling the real wage in its two components.

5000|$|The {{short run}} AS curve is drawn given some nominal {{variables}} such as the <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> rate, which is assumed fixed in the short run. Thus, a higher price level P implies a lower real wage rate and thus an incentive to produce more output.

50|$|To Keynes, the {{determination}} of wages was more complicated. First, he argued {{that it is not}} real but nominal wages that are set in negotiations between employers and workers, as opposed to a barter relationship. Second, <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> cuts would be difficult to put into effect because of laws and wage contracts. Even classical economists admitted that these exist; unlike Keynes, they advocated abolishing minimum wages, unions, and long-term contracts, increasing labour market flexibility. However, to Keynes, people will resist <b>nominal</b> <b>wage</b> reductions, even without unions, until they see other wages falling and a general fall of prices.|$|E

40|$|Using a two-country {{macroeconomic}} model where <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> {{are determined}} by the efficiency wage hypothesis, we investigate how workers move between two countries and how migration affects the workerreceiving and worker-sending countries. For this purpose, we assume that a firm in each country determines <b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> to keep workers from shirking, given the effort exerted by the workers in that country. We also assume that workers move between two countries due to differences in real-consumption <b>wages</b> (<b>nominal</b> <b>wages</b> divided by the consumer price index).

Under non-cooperation between policy authorities, the unemployment rate and the consumer price index are higher in the receiving country than in the sending country, implying that the policy authority in the receiving country has the lower utility than the one in the sending country, while the real-consumption wages are higher in the receiving country than in the sending country...|$|R
