However, the basic language of PDL's lack several {{features that are}} important for a sophisticated treatment of actions. In this paper, we present a new logic that is obtained by enriching the basic PDL with powerful modeling constructs {{that allow us to}} represent determinism and nondeterminisms, concurrency, hierarchies, mutual exclusion, backward execution, and <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> actions. We demonstrate, by means of examples, the expressive power of the formalism. In particular, we show that although nonmonotonicity is not generally captured by PDL's, our logic is perfectly suited for exploiting monotonic solutions to the frame problem. Finally, we establish that the proposed formalism is decidable, and that the basic reasoning problems are EXPTIME-complete. 1 Introduction Propositional Dynamic Logics (PDL's) are modal logics for describing and reasoning about system [...] ...|$|R

These association measures have been used in various domains, for example, to evaluate whether a particular medical practice is associated positively to a cure of a disease or whether a particular marketing strategy is associated positively to an increase in revenue, etc. This paper models the problem of locating faults as association between the execution or <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> par-ticular program elements with failures.

The extension of Ilsan subway line was evaluated by future travel demand, economic effect, and cost-benefit analysis.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of lower bounds on wages, e. g., minimum wages or {{liability}} limits, on job design within firms. In our model, two tasks contribute to non-veriable firm value and affect an imperfect performance measure. The tasks can be assigned to either one or two agents. In {{the absence of a}} wage floor, it is optimal to assign the tasks to different agents whenever the agents' reservation utility is not too large. Under such a job design, the principal can tailor incentives according to each task's marginal productivity. By contrast, with a relatively large wage floor, the principal gradually lowers effort incentives to avoid rent payments to the agents, even before the wage floor exceeds the agents' reservation utility. If the wage floor is sufficiently large, the principal hires only one agent even though this leads to a distortion of effort across tasks or the <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> one task altogether...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} TD has helped {{professionals}} and researchers to discuss those {{issues associated with}} software evolution [4]. The concept of technical debt (TD) contextualizes problems faced during software evolution considering the tasks that are not carried out adequately during software development.

More recently, Avgeriou et al. [7] defined TD as “TD is a collection of design or implementation constructs that are expedient in the short term, but set up a technical context that can make future changes more costly or impossible. TD presents an actual or contingent liability whose impact is limited to internal system qualities, primarily maintainability and evolvability.” The use of such TD concept facilitates the understanding of the costs incurred unintentionally or by decisions taken during the software development life cycle [8, 9].|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, {{intimidation}} and harassment of survivors and the witnesses during the case proceedings, lack of survivors' protection mechanisms {{and lack of}} confidence in prosecuting and investing among the agencies are reported as the main reasons for low registration of trafficking cases in the courts. This is illustrated by the study of Forum for Women, Law and Development (FWLD) and United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) which found that in 70% of trafficking cases, the police submit the investigation report to the Government attorney {{on the last day of}} the submission of the investigation report in court - making it delay in the investigation by the Government attorney. The same study identified that 23% of reported trafficking cases of the Government attorney did not appear during the hearing. At the trial level, the cases are delayed by insufficient evidence, excessive delay in court process and <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> judgment. In addition, there is gross lacking of awareness on gender issues, lack of conceptual clarity on trafficking issues, lack of skilled human resources, corruption, political pressure and lack of coordination among police and Government attorney. Another explanation to underreporting is that after trafficking raids in India, many women are immediately deported to their homelands before they can give evidence against traffickers. Finally, Nepal’s courts also have no jurisdiction over brothel owners in India, who are one of the main drivers of trafficking.|$|R
40|$|With {{reference}} to a previous work, {{the problem of the}} experimental detection of non-causal synordination patterns between two series of physical events is examined. It is necessary that the patterns in question act in a reproducible, or at least regular, manner, {{so that they can be}} identified by means of statistical analysis; action on individual occasional facts cannot be proved statistically, though it is hypothetically possible. As established in the previous work, the first series must be constituted by microevents (Penrose R processes), that can be amplified at the macroscopic level so that they are translated at this level into a choice between alternatives. The obtained result defines (by means of a structural constraint which is not, however, a causal link) the choice between execution or <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> certain actions on a macroscopic system S, without any feedback on the microevents source. A succession of macroevents is thus generated, which makes up the second series. Statistics of the events belonging to the second series is thus completely defined by the probability distribution of the first series of events. In the absence of a synordination, this is the a priori probability distribution, which can be measured by removing the constraint between the two series. If there is synordination, the probability distribution of the two sets of events will deviate in a measurable manner from the expected trend once the constraint is activated.

Material of study: From January 2007 to January 2010, we have conducted a retrospective study on a sample of patients operated on in our department. We include only those {{cases in which the}} jaw was fractured in 2 places, in particular patients who suffer a fracture in tooth-bearing areas (symphysis, parasymphysis, and anterior body) and also contralaterally in non tooth-bearing areas (posterior body, angle, ramus, and condyle). The sample was divided into 2 groups based on the fracture sequence of reduction. Results: At 1 -year follow-up, the group of patients who received first the tooth-bearing fractured areas treatment, followed by treatment of non tooth-bearing fractured area on bifocal mandibular fracture (Group A), showed less postoperative complications and reduced surgical time and costs. Discussion: In patients of group B, the <b>non-execution</b> <b>of</b> rigid IMF for the non tooth-bearing fractures made bone segments more free to move. Thus, reduction and fixation of non tooth-bearing fractures is facilitated, but poses a greater risk of complications. The surgeon in this case does not have the occlusal help guide; thus, the tooth-bearing fracture reduction and the subsequent fixation may be imperfect. Conclusion: It is recommended from this study that reduction of the tooth-bearing fragment be prior to that of the tooth-free fragment for the double mandibular fracture...|$|R
