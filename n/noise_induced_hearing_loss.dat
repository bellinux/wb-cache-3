40|$|Introduction: We {{estimated}} the noise {{in an industrial}} shoe factory {{to determine the effect}} of noise in the workplace on the hearing status of the workers in such environments. Materials and method: the intensity of noise in dB {{in different parts of the}} factory was estimated. Then working people in each part was selected randomly and their hearing thresholds were evaluated by Conventional audiometry. Results: The results demonstrated that 23 % were required to estimate thresholds more precisely and 95 needed close examination by Otolaryngologist. Besides, 10 % of the workers suffered sensory neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> whose 2 % of them diagnosed as NIHL.

The results showed that most of the workers (72. 2 %) in maintenance section of PLTD Ampenan had the compliance of wearing ear protector. There were significant correlation between knowledge, training, supervision, and positive reinforcement with the compliance of wearing ear protector. Supervision has a very strong correlation (coefficent 1, 000). The more workers feel himself under supervision, the better their behaviour will be.

Mice were exposed to a moderately damaging level of loud sound revealing the phosphorylation of STAT 3 tyrosine 705 residues and nuclear localization in many cell types in the inner ear including the marginal cells of the stria vascularis, type II, III, and IV fibrocytes, spiral ganglion cells, and in the inner hair cells. Treatment of the mice with the JAK 2 /STAT 3 inhibitor before noise exposure reduced levels of phosphorylated STAT 3 Y 705. We performed auditory brain stem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission measurements and found increased recovery of hearing sensitivity at two weeks after noise exposure with JAK 2 /STAT 3 inhibition. Performance of cytocochleograms revealed improved outer hair cell survival in JSI- 124 treated mice relative to control.

50|$|OSHA, NIOSH, MSHA, and FRA {{were all}} created in {{response}} to an increase in <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> resulting from hazardous sound levels in industrial work environments. Noise can cause detrimental effects to the outer, middle, and inner ear, as well as the auditory nerve and central auditory system. In the outer ear, with high noise exposure the eardrum can rupture and bleed. In the middle ear, dislocation of the bones that reside in the middle ear (the ossicles) can occur. These problems occur when exposed to extremely high sound levels. In the inner ear, low, middle, and high sound levels can all cause damage to structures residing in the cochlea. This damage can cause what is called a 'noise notch' and hearing loss is evident at 3000 - 6000 Hz frequencies.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{describes}} {{standards for}} occupational noise exposure in articles 1910.95 and 1926.52. OSHA states that an employer must implement hearing conservation programs for employees if {{the noise level}} of the workplace is equal to or above 85 dB(A) for an averaged eight-hour time period. OSHA also states that [...] "exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level". [...] The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that all worker exposures to noise should be controlled below a level equivalent to 85 dBA for eight hours to minimize occupational <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> NIOSH also recommends a 3 dBA exchange rate so that every increase by 3 dBA doubles {{the amount of the}} noise and halves the recommended amount of exposure time.The United States Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 605512 has some differences from OSHA 1910.95 standard, for example, OSHA 1910.95 uses a 5 dB exchange rate and DoD instruction 605512 uses a 3 dB exchange rate.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} reasons why a worker may choose not to adopt the {{protocols}} of a hearing conservation program. Employees may not follow protocol because they feel that <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> will not happen to them. [...] They may believe this because they think the level of sound that they are exposed is not loud enough to cause hearing loss or that loud noise just toughens their ears. They might also think hearing loss is not a serious condition and can easily be fixed with hearing aids. Another reason is the worker may believe that hearing protection does not actually work and that he/she may still develop noise-induced hearing loss even with hearing protection. [...] If the employee feels that hearing protection may impinge his/her work, whether it be missing important warning signals {{or the ability to}} communicate, he/she is less likely to wear it. Finally, the comfort of the hearing protection offered through the hearing conservation program.

50|$|One work {{environment}} health risk that often gets overlooked is <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (NIHL). NIHL has recently {{become one of}} the biggest occupational disease risks with occupational NIHL contributing to 16% of global deafness. Chronic exposure to high decibels can lead to the development of NIHL among manufacturing workers by damaging sensory hair cells in the inner ear. These two points illustrate how NIHL is a significant occupational health risk. Asia has, over the last 50 years, seen a significant growth in the manufacturing of both primary products and finished products. The increase in manufacturing has led to an increased exposure to high levels of noise and has contributed to increased NIHL among workers. In Bangladesh, occupations which have the greatest exposure to noisy {{work environment}}s are automobile drivers, traffic police, shopkeepers, road-side hawkers, and garment workers. Garment workers in Bangladesh face noise levels of 96-100 Decibels Adjusted (dBA), which is a significant contributor to NIHL among women textile workers in Bangladesh. There are options available to protect workers from chronic exposure to high noise levels in the textile industry. Some simple measures which could be implemented on machinery would include such actions as decreasing noise and creating noise barriers. For workers, the use of personal protective equipment, as well as the establishing maximum daily exposures, {{can go a long way}} to mitigate worker exposures to chronic noise.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to {{mutations}} in the connexin gene family which encodes gap junctional proteins {{is a common}} form of hereditary deafness. In particular, connexin 26 (Cx 26, GJB 2) mutations are responsible for ~ 50 % of nonsyndromic <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> which is the highest incidence of genetic disease. In the clinic, Cx 26 mutations cause various auditory phenotypes ranging from profound congenital deafness at birth to mild, progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in late childhood. Recent experiments demonstrate that congenital deafness mainly results from cochlear developmental disorders rather than hair cell degeneration and endocochlear potential (EP) reduction, while late-onset <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> results from reduction of active cochlear amplification, even though cochlear hair cells have no connexin expression. Moreover, new experiments further demonstrate that the hypothesized K+-recycling disruption is not a principal deafness mechanism for connexin deficiency <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Additionally, {{there is no clear}} relationship between specific changes in connexin (channel) functions and the phenotypes of mutation-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Cx 30, Cx 29, Cx 31, and Cx 43 mutations can also cause <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> with distinct pathological changes in the cochlea.

Methodology: This was a descriptive cross sectional study. The source population were from grass trimming worker works under USM Health Campus, Majlis Perbandaran Kota Bharu (MPKB), Majlis Daerah Pasir Puteh, Bachok, Ketereh and Tumpat. The data was collected at HUSM /ORL-HNS outpatient clinic to fill the Proforma, otoscopic examination and hearing tests. Hearing tests consist of pure tone audiometry, tympanogram and distortion product otoacoustic emission. Results: A total of 77 grass trimming workers participate in this study. All of them were male with age range from 20 - 53 years old with majority of them fall in age group of 40 - 50 years old. Two of the subjects were excluded as they have history of working in noisy job before and for at least 10 years. None of them use any protecting hearing device.

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} on military aviation noise was conducted because the personnel working with military aircraft {{were concerned about}} <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> damage. In addition, comprehensive data on hearing impairments and occupational exposure of military pilots in the Finnish Air Force was not available. Moreover, data {{on the effects of}} overflight noise of military jets was necessary for the evaluation of <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> deteriorations of members of the public who might be exposured accidentally for the low-level jets' overflights. The averaged noise exposure levels of pilots varied during a flight from 97 dB(A) to 106 dB(A) in the cockpit and from 83 dB(A) to 100 dB(A) at the entrance of the ear canal. Radio noise was 4 – 10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. The attenuation provided by air crew helmets varied from 10 to 21 dB(A) in the laboratory, and was at the same level during real flights. The attenuation measured in the laboratory and in working conditions was about 30 dB(A) for earmuffs. An active noise cancellation (ANC) device decreased averaged noise exposure (LAeq 8 min) 4 – 8 dB over the noise attenuation of the same helmets when the ANC system was off. The noise of overflights by military jets were measured and the noise levels were lower than those known to cause the permanent threshold shifts. However, <b>noise</b> <b>induced</b> <b>hearing</b> damages might be possible in certain conditions. In order to assess the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> risk of pilots, hearing thresholds were measured before and after one flight using both conventional and extended high frequency (EHF) audiometry. Minor temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were revealed. The risk of noise-induced damage at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. A novel NoiseScan data management system proved to be an interesting tool in assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. Due to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots was shown to be at considerably less risk than that of industrial workers in Finland...|$|R
