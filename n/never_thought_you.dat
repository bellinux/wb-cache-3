6000|$|Mrs. Farnam {{gave her}} a {{thoughtful}} look. [...] "Well, that's plausible; but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> greedy. Why {{do you want the}} extra pay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} very wrong," [...] she said suddenly, after walking for some time in silence. [...] "You must have worked hard indeed. I own I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> would. I used to {{consider}} your sketches very pretty, but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> would come {{to be a great}} artist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of this," [...] she murmured. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> might be--oh! you cannot understand," [...] {{she broke}} off. [...] "You cannot {{know what you}} are doing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "O heavens!" [...] {{cried the}} poor woman; [...] "have I no friend left? I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you,</b> too, would have deserted me, Mr. Archibald." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would, Userti, {{but when}} you have leisure, ask Ana here to explain the matter to you. I am sure that he understands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> had the face. Well, {{and what}} did the last one say to ye? Nothing that can't be got over, perhaps, after all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all!" [...] exclaimed the doctor. [...] "I {{had no idea}} of {{throwing}} you aside. In fact, Miss Panney, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>you</b> in the matter at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Vincent," [...] {{she said}} after a pause, [...] "I <b>never</b> once <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> loved me--never once. You have not been a bit like what I thought people were when they felt like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't you ask me--you little goose? I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{know those}} things. We farm girls {{know all that}} when we are toddlers. We can't help it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I can't say,' he said honestly. 'I suppose {{just for}} a moment I must have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> had really got into some serious sort of scrape.

6000|$|... "You a woman, Jack! That is very remarkable. Since when {{have you}} hailed for a woman? You have shipped with me twice, {{and each time}} as a man--though I've <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> able to do seaman's duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; I {{am glad to}} hear it. To {{tell the}} truth, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> would run the risk. A gentleman of your sort, when {{he is looking for}} a wife with money, likes to have the money quite certain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{answered}} Tua. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> would rob us, for if {{you were}} of the tribe of thieves, surely you would be richer, and less hungry than you seem.
