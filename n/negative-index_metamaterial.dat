One of the possible approaches is compensating losses by the amplifying centers embedded into a NIM host material to provide amplification due to population inversion [1]. An alternative approach based on optical parametric amplification in NIMs has been proposed in [2], where the precondition is the non-symmetric current-voltage characteristics of NIM’s structural elements that give rise to its quadratic nonlinearity. Here, we investigate a different option that does not require strong nonlinear-optical response by the building blocks of the NIM. Instead, it employs strong resonant nonlinearities inherent to embedded four-level centers (lik...|$|R

In addition, 3 D optical NIMs for the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions could well become the basis for novel and useful lenses, resonators, and other photonic devices. However, these materials, which usually consist of complicated periodic nanostructures made of both dielectrics and metals, have been virtually impossible to scale to sizes {{large enough to be}} used for anything but initial experimentation. This problem is easing, though, with the advent of a printing process that produces large-area 3 D multilayer optical NIMs — 8. 7 × 8. 7 cm square, in the largest example so far. Developed by researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the US Navy NAVAIR-Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (China Lake, CA), and Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM), the process can transfer high-quality metamaterials to a rigid or flexible substrate; these metamaterials exhibit a strongly negative refractive index in the NIR region.
