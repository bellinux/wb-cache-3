25|$|Neon {{lighting}} {{is closely related}} to fluorescent lighting, which developed about 25 years after <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting. In fluorescent lights, the light emitted by rarefied gases within a tube is used exclusively to excite fluorescent materials that coat the tube, which then shine with their own colors that become the tube's visible, usually white, glow. Fluorescent coatings and glasses are also an option for <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting, but are usually selected to obtain bright colors.|$|E
25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting. While <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions.|$|E
25|$|When Georges Claude {{demonstrated}} an impressive, practical form of <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting in 1910, he apparently envisioned {{that it would}} be used as a form of lighting, which had been the application of the earlier Moore tubes that were based on nitrogen and carbon dioxide discharges. Claude's 1910 demonstration of neon lighting at the Grand Palais (Grand Palace) in Paris lit a peristyle of this large exhibition space. Claude's associate, Jacques Fonseque, realized the possibilities for a business based on signage and advertising. By 1913 a large sign for the vermouth Cinzano illuminated the night sky in Paris, and by 1919 the entrance to the Paris Opera was adorned with <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Neon</b> <b>tubes</b> {{that are}} used for the underglow of a car start of heating it up to high temperatures. From there they are filled with neon gas. Though neon gas only {{produces}} the color red, adding other elemental gases could change the tube up to 150 colors. Mercury makes blue, carbon dioxide makes white, helium makes gold, and phosphorus creates different colors under various pressures. Because <b>neon</b> <b>tubes</b> are gas compressed, they tend to break often while going over speed bumps. With the <b>neon</b> <b>tubes,</b> people are more able to adjust them to follow specific rhythms like music.|$|R
25|$|Claude's patents {{envisioned the}} use of gases such as argon and mercury vapor to create {{different}} colors beyond those produced by neon. In the 1920s, fluorescent glasses and coatings were developed to further expand the range of colors and effects for tubes with argon gas or argon-neon mixtures; generally, the fluorescent coatings are used with an argon/mercury-vapor mixture, which emits ultraviolet light that activates the fluorescent coatings. By the 1930s, the colors from combinations of <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lights had become satisfactory for some general interior lighting applications, and achieved some success in Europe, {{but not in the}} US. Since the 1950s, the development of phosphors for color televisions has created nearly 100 new colors for <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting.|$|E
25|$|Neon lamp tubes were {{introduced}} into series production for the centre high-mount stop lamp on the 1995 Ford Explorer. Notable later uses included the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII with a <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> spanning {{the width of}} the trunk decklid, and the BMW Z8, which made extensive use of neon. Concept cars such as those from Volvo have included neon lamp features. Hella offered an aftermarket neon CHMSL in the late 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Divinyls [...] (often {{incorrectly}} {{referred to}} as The Divinyls) was an Australian rock band that was formed in Sydney in 1980. The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience.|$|E
2500|$|In neon glow lamps, the {{luminous}} {{region of the}} gas is a thin, [...] "negative glow" [...] region immediately adjacent to a negatively charged electrode (or [...] "cathode"); the positively charged electrode ("anode") is quite close to the cathode. These features distinguish glow lamps from the much longer and brighter [...] "positive column" [...] luminous regions in <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting. The energy dissipation in the lamps when they are glowing is very low (about 0.1 W), hence the distinguishing term cold-cathode lighting.|$|E
2500|$|Neon was {{discovered}} in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. After obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [...] "electrical gas-discharge" [...] tube that {{was similar to the}} tubes used for neon signs today. Georges Claude, a French engineer and inventor, presented <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting in essentially its modern form at the Paris Motor Show from December 3–18, 1910. Claude, sometimes called [...] "the Edison of France", had a near monopoly on the new technology, which became very popular for signage and displays in the period 1920-1940. Neon lighting was an important cultural phenomenon in the United States in that era; by 1940, the downtowns of nearly every city in the US were bright with neon signage, and Times Square in New York City was known worldwide for its neon extravagances. [...] There were 2000 shops nationwide designing and fabricating neon signs. The popularity, intricacy, and scale of neon signage for advertising declined in the U.S. following the Second World War (1939–1945), but development continued vigorously in Japan, Iran, and some other countries. In recent decades architects and artists, in addition to sign designers, have again adopted <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting as a component in their works.|$|E

The CHMSL (pronounced [...] ) is sometimes informally called the [...] "centre brake lamp", the [...] "third brake light", the [...] "eye-level brake lamp", the [...] "safety brake lamp", or the [...] "high-level brake lamp". The CHMSL may use one or more filament bulbs or LEDs, or a strip of <b>Neon</b> <b>tube</b> as its light source.|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} series {{was based on}} a play by Danish author Bjarne Reuter.

("Was There Light in the <b>Neon</b> <b>Tube,</b> Boys?") [...] in addition to Busters Verden. Director Bille August had already worked with Reuter, on the 1983 movie Zappa where August's script {{was based on a}} book by Reuter. August was still a relatively unknown director outside Denmark at the time, but the success he had with Buster helped pave the way for his international break-through with the Oscar-winning Pelle the Conqueror in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, however, neon {{displays}} {{became less}} fashionable, and some cities discouraged their construction with ordinances. Nelson Algren titled a 1947 collection of his short stories The Neon Wilderness. Margalit Fox has written, [...] "... after World War II, as neon signs were replaced increasingly by fluorescent-lighted plastic, {{the art of}} bending colored tubes into sinuous, gas-filled forms began to wane." [...] A dark age persisted {{at least through the}} 1970s, when artists adopted neon with enthusiasm; in 1979 Rudi Stern published his manifesto, Let There Be Neon. Marcus Thielen wrote in 2005, on the 90th anniversary of the US patent issued to Georges Claude, [...] "The demand for the use of neon and cold cathode in architectural applications is growing, and the introduction of new techniques like fiberoptics and LED — into the sign market have strengthened, rather than replaced, neon technology. The evolution of the 'waste' product <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> remains incomplete 90 years after the patent was filed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} neon's discovery, <b>neon</b> <b>tubes</b> {{were used}} as scientific instruments and novelties. However, the scarcity of purified neon gas precluded its prompt application for electrical gas-discharge lighting {{along the lines of}} Moore tubes, which used more common nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the working gas, and enjoyed some commercial success in the US in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company in France, Air Liquide, began producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of the air liquefaction business. From December 3–18, 1910, Claude demonstrated two large ( [...] long), bright red <b>neon</b> <b>tubes</b> at the Paris Motor Show.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next step}} in gas-based {{lighting}} {{took advantage of the}} luminescent qualities of neon, an inert gas that had been discovered in 1898 by isolation from the atmosphere. Neon glowed a brilliant red when used in Geissler tubes. By 1910, Georges Claude, a Frenchman who had developed a technology and a successful business for air liquefaction, was obtaining enough neon as a byproduct to support a neon lighting industry. While neon lighting was used around 1930 in France for general illumination, it was no more energy-efficient than conventional incandescent lighting. <b>Neon</b> <b>tube</b> lighting, which also includes the use of argon and mercury vapor as alternate gases, came to be used primarily for eye-catching signs and advertisements. Neon lighting was relevant to the development of fluorescent lighting, however, as Claude’s improved electrode (patented in 1915) overcame [...] "sputtering", a major source of electrode degradation. Sputtering occurred when ionized particles struck an electrode and tore off bits of metal. Although Claude’s invention required electrodes with a lot of surface area, it showed that a major impediment to gas-based lighting could be overcome.|$|E
2500|$|Neon {{lighting}} {{consists of}} brightly glowing, electrified glass tubes or bulbs that contain rarefied neon or other gases. [...] Neon lights are {{a type of}} cold cathode gas-discharge light. [...] A <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> is a sealed glass tube with a metal electrode at each end, filled with {{one of a number}} of gases at low pressure. [...] A high potential of several thousand volts applied to the electrodes ionizes the gas in the tube, causing it to emit colored light. [...] The color of the light depends on the gas in the tube. [...] Neon lights were named for neon, a noble gas which gives off a popular orange light, but other gases and chemicals are used to produce other colors, such as hydrogen (red), helium (yellow), carbon dioxide (white), and mercury (blue). [...] Neon tubes can be fabricated in curving artistic shapes, to form letters or pictures. [...] They are mainly used to make dramatic, multicolored glowing signage for advertising, called neon signs, which were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The first strobe tuner {{dates back}} to 1936 and was {{originally}} made by the Conn company; {{it was called the}} Stroboconn and was produced for approximately 40 years. However, these strobes are now mainly collector pieces. They had 12 strobe discs, driven by one motor. The gearing between discs was a very close approximation to the 12th root of two ratio. This tuner had an electrically driven temperature-compensated tuning fork; the electrical output of this fork was amplified to run the motor. The fork had sliding weights, an adjustment knob, and a dial to show the position of the weights. These weights permitted setting it to different reference frequencies (such as A4 = 435Hz), although over a relatively narrow range, perhaps a whole tone. [...] When set at A4 = 440Hz the tuning fork produced a 55Hz signal, which drove the four-pole 1650 RPM synchronous motor to which the A disc was mounted. [...] (The other discs were all gear-driven off of this one.) [...] Incoming audio was amplified to feed a long <b>neon</b> <b>tube</b> common to all 12 discs. Wind instrument repair people liked this tuner because it needed no adjustment to show different notes. [...] Anyone who had to move this tuner around was less inclined to like it because of its size and weight: two record-player-sized cases of 30-40 pounds each.|$|E

During shooting Robby's voice was performed by an uncredited actor who spoke the robot's lines offscreen into a microphone that was fed into to a voice-actuated circuit which was connected by cable to the <b>neon</b> <b>tubes</b> in Robby's head; this device generated a control voltage that synchronised the flashing of the <b>neon</b> <b>tubes</b> to the dialogue.
