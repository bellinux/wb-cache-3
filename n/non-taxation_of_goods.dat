40|$|M. Com. (Economics) The {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to examine the}} fiscal importance' of indirect taxation with specific reference to value added taxation. The investigation takes cognisance of the unique characteristics of the South African economy, especially its strong dualistic characteristics, very unequal distributlon of income and extensive backlogs in the areas of social services and infrastructure. The South African tax system has undergone a rather fundamental shift in the early 1970 s when the sales duty was replaced by a general sales tax. This tax, implemented in July 1978 at the rate of 4 per cent provided for the exemption of basic foodstuffs and the issuing of exemption certificates mandating the <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>goods.</b> These certificates led to abuse and fraud. The tax was a cascading tax and double taxation was an inherent characteristic of it. Within 13 years of its existence the rate of the tax soured to 13 per cent. An European-styled value added tax, engineered on the New Zealand model, was implemented in September 1991. Value added tax has in the past been criticised on account of its regressive properties. Unions have depicted value added tax as an unfair tax because of its skewed income and wealth effects. Providing relief for the perceived regressivity of valued added tax is not an easy decision. The regressivity of value added tax can be reduced by zero ratings, differential rates and exemptions, but it was found that there are convincing reasons why the value added tax base should be kept as broad as possible. Internationally it is accepted that economic distortions are kept to a minimum when value added tax is levied on a broad base with a minimum number of zero ratings and differential rates. A broadly based tax effects current and future consumption to the same degree and is therefore neutral as to consumption and saving. Irrespective of this best-policy-advice, various countries still make considerable use of zero ratings and differential rates to lessen the regressivity of the tax system. Theoretically value added tax does not add to inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding this theoretical view {{there is some evidence that}} value added tax could sometimes lead to cost push inflation should compensating salary increases follow after a broadening of the base. The dissertation agrees with South African studies indicating that the cascading effects of value added tax is negligible. Although the rate of inflation increased during the twelve month period following the introduction of the tax in South Africa, it had an once-off impact on the general level of prices and could thus not be typified as inflation. Financial services are by and large exempted from value added tax due to its many definitional problems. In this connection, the Poddar-English model is regarded by some observers as a means of addressing this problem. The model does not provide solutions for all the problems and remains to a large extent impractical. Notwithstanding this, the extension of the tax base to include financial services will enhance the efficiency of the tax...|$|R

Two tax distortions were of particular importance during the 1980 s: the <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> capital gains and the double taxation of dividends. These were important in encouraging corporate leverage and asset acquisition. It is argued that despite their substantial removal in 1985 and 1987 tax reforms, some distortions associated with {{the interaction of the}} tax system with inflation remain. In particular, capital gains continue to be treated favourably, and inflation continues to influence investment decisions through its interaction with the treatment of depreciation and nominal interest flows. ...|$|R

We find that experts rank actions that are aimed at enhancing international coordination and cooperation, as well as actions that reduce legal uncertainty, higher than other actions.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the possibility}} <b>of</b> double <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> hybrid instruments in cross border transactions {{where the country}} of the investor has implemented the indirect credit method for mitigation or elimination of double taxation. From an isolated perspective a double non-taxation cannot be obtained because typically no taxes are paid in the foreign country due to the classification as debt and therefore even {{in the case of}} a classification as a dividend in the country of the investor no indirect credit can be given to the taxpayer. Using this as a starting point this paper investigates the impact of asymmetric tax treatment of hybrid instruments on the indirect credit method and the potentials for minimizing the tax burden or even the possibility of obtaining a double non-taxation. On this basis the paper develops a formula that identifies the optimal investment strategy based on given tax rates. Special interest is given to the limitations and possible barriers to hybrid transactions. This paper intents to initiate a scientific discussion concerning the tax impact of hybrid instruments in countries where the indirect credit method is employed.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} any housing policy which {{attempts}} to redistribute expenditure on housing by {{working within the}} confines of the public sector must be extremely limited and is unlikely to be effective. It examines both the potential for and distributional implications of providing additional resources for expenditure on housing in Australia by going beyond the existing framework of government expenditure and withdrawing the implicit subsidies which accrue to owner-occupiers through the <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> their imputed income. It is shown that the distributional implications of taxing imputed income from owner-occupied housing depend on the interaction of house value, equity and income over the life-cycle of the owner-occupier and that a failure to take all of these factors into account could result in a policy of imputed income taxation having unintended distributional effects within the owner-occupied sector. However, since the survey data analysed shows that the subsidy to owner-occupiers which resulted from not taxing this income outweighted explicit public authority expenditure on housing at the time of the survey by a margin of more than 500 %, it is argued that the revenue gained from the introduction of such a policy would be more than adequate to offset these effects and to ensure that housing resources were redistributed in an equitable manner. ...|$|R
40|$|The “pre-collection” of tax on imputed {{consumption}} {{generated by}} owner-occupied housing plays {{a crucial role}} in both consumption tax theory and real-world tax regimes. However, even under current VAT systems with the widest tax bases, the taxation of imputed housing consumption is incomplete because pre-existing housing stock is typically not taxed when the VAT is introduced, and because housing value may appreciate after initial sale. In response, some have recommended taxing residential re-sale to capture previously untaxed consumption value. This paper argues that because the incidence of any properly-designed tax on resale will fall only on economic rent and existing assets, taxing housing resale in itself cannot produce efficiency gains. Moreover, to avoid causing distortions and be consistent with consumption tax theory, a tax on resale must be refined to ensure <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> investment returns other than economic rent. The refinements are alien to normal VAT mechanisms and can no longer be viewed as embodying the “pre-collection” method. Finally, the paper highlights the difference between traditional efficiency concerns about the under-taxation of imputed income/consumption and the equity concerns that likely motivate the proponents of taxing resale. Indeed, in countries where the modern VAT is in place, the aggregate tax burden on housing consumption may be rather high, and under-taxation may not be an issue...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing and its taxation on income distribution in Finland. Using micro-data from the 2004 Wealth Survey produced by Statistics Finland we find that owner-occupied housing has {{a significant impact on}} the well-being of many households. In 2004 imputed rental income constituted on average about 10 percent of homeowner households? disposable income. Furthermore, including imputed rental income to household disposable income decreased overall inequality measured by the Gini index. The estimated tax revenue forgone in 2004 was 1. 9 billion euros amounting to almost 15 percent of the total government income and wealth tax revenue collected that year. On the other hand, the tax subsidy resulting from <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> imputed rental income is skewed toward high-income households who are more likely to be homeowners and also more likely to own outright. The paper also made a comparison of the current tax system where imputed rental income is untaxed to two alternative tenure neutral tax systems where imputed rental income is taxed. The results indicate that the effects on overall inequality depend vitally on the way the increased tax revenue is transferred back to the households. The calculations in this paper ignore any behavioural responses by the households. JEL Codes: H 23, H 24, R 21. Imputed rental income, tax subsidy, income distribution...|$|R
40|$|More {{than three}} {{quarters}} of the United States tangible capital stock represents structures. Tax policies potentially {{have a major impact on}} both the level and composition of investment in structures and equipment. This point is explicitly recognized in most discussions of the effects of capital income taxation. Two aspects of the taxation of structures [...] the relative burden placed on structures as opposed to equipment investment and the <b>non-taxation</b> <b>of</b> owner occupied housing under the income tax [...] have attracted substantial attention in recent years. This paper explores these two aspects of the taxation of structures investments. While the tax system may well have a potent impact on the level and composition of structures investment, this paper argues that conventional analyses of these effects are very misleading. We reach two main conclusions. First,under current tax law, certain types of structures investment are very highly tax favored. Structures can be transferred and therefore depreciated more than once, and structures may be readily financed with tax-favored debt. Overall, itis unlikely that a significant bias towards equipment and against structures exists under current law. Second, the conventional view that the tax system is biased in favor of homeownership is wrong. Because of the possibility of "tax arbitrage" between high bracket landlords and low bracket tenants, the tax system has long favored rental over ownership for most households. The 1981 reforms by reducing the top marginal tax rate reduced this bias somewhat. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} dissertation is threefold: (1) to investigate the relationship theoretically as well as empirically between homeowner tax preferences, in particular, nominal mortgage interest and property tax deductions, and housing demand, (2) to examine empirically the vertical equity consequence of removing housing tax deductions, (3) to develop an interval estimate {{of the change in}} Suits Indices between the current federal income tax and an alternative income tax that excludes housing tax deductions to test the significance of the estimated vertical equity effect of eliminating housing tax deductions. ^ In this dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for housing demand to analyze the impact of housing tax deductions on the demand for housing. A comparative static result is derived and it indicates that the housing tax deductions have an ambiguous effect on housing demand. A deterministic simulation of the effect of housing tax deductions on housing demand is performed using time series data for the period 1974 - 1993. Simulation results reveal that housing tax deductions have positive influences on housing demand. ^ I also simulate the effect of housing tax deductions on net per capita single family housing expenditure utilizing a linear expenditure system for housing demand. Simulation results reveal a direct relationship between housing tax deductions and housing demand. ^ I am able to assess both the non-revenue and revenue neutral vertical equity effects of removing housing tax deductions. Results in both cases show that eliminating housing tax deductions increases the vertical equity of the tax system. ^ I then test the significance of the estimated vertical equity effect using both the bootstrap-t and percentile methods. The results reveal that the estimated vertical equity effect is statistically significant. ...|$|R
