500|$|Despite Lennon's antiwar feelings, he had yet {{to become}} anti-establishment, and {{expressed}} in [...] "Revolution" [...] that he wanted [...] "to see the plan" [...] from those advocating toppling the system. The repeated phrase [...] "it's gonna be alright" [...] in [...] "Revolution" [...] came directly from Lennon's Transcendental Meditation experiences in India, conveying the idea that God would take care of the human race <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> politically. Another influence on Lennon was his burgeoning relationship with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono; Ono attended the recording sessions, and participated in the unused portion of [...] "Revolution 1" [...] which evolved into [...] "Revolution 9".|$|E
500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E

Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of}} the night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge learned of the crash via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight. He landed and mailed a letter and two photographs to Barker: a photo of Blink aboard a submarine in the Middle East and another of himself and his two kids. [...] "One was 'Do you remember who we were?' and the other was 'This is who I am now,' [...] " [...] DeLonge said DeLonge also commented that, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> between himself and Barker in the past, [...] "none of it matters when it comes down to somebody getting hurt." [...] Hoppus first spoke on the matter in a blog post in November 2008, writing that he [...] "hadn't had it in him" [...] to post, adding that [...] "these past two months have been the hardest times I can remember." [...] He also revealed that he, DeLonge, and Barker had all spoken in the aftermath. Barker quashed reunion rumors in December, but noted that they had been getting along.|$|E

500|$|Black soon {{signed with}} RCA {{at that time}} {{considered}} one of the [...] "most aggressive" [...] labels in country music. His first album, Killin' Time, was released in 1989. [...] Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black; four of them were attributed solely to him, while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas. [...] In a departure from most other country albums, Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record Killin' Time. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990. He made his debut in 1989 with the single, [...] "A Better Man", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in early June. This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked {{at the top of the}} chart. In total, five singles off of his debut album reached number one, the first time any country artist had accomplished this feat. Black won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989. At the end of the year, his singles, [...] "A Better Man" [...] and [...] "Killin' Time" [...] place number one and number two on the year-end country singles charts. [...] It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year. Looking back at the early stages of his career, Black recalled: [...] "'At one point, I knew I crossed this line out of obscurity and I felt like <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> from that point on I would always be remembered for [...] "Killin' Time." [...] There was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitement.'" ...|$|E

His doctor, Asrat Woldeyes, denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his death. Some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated, and this belief remains widely held to this day.

2500|$|Even the band's {{fan base}} has {{been subject to}} commentary. In 2001, music theorist Fred Maus wrote that, {{contrary}} to the ideologies of anti-commercialism and authenticity embodied by [...] "serious" [...] discussions of popular music such as rock, Pet Shop Boys fans exhibit [...] "an undisguised love of commercial success". This was demonstrated through mailing list discussions from 1998 onwards, in which fans voiced concern over the [...] "most commercially promising selection and marketing of singles" [...] for the then-upcoming Nightlife, and debated {{the quality of the}} then-recent Bilingual, spurred by the album's poorer performance in sales. Most posters, Maus summarised, feared that the band's appeal would become essentially limited to a cult following; [...] "dissent, along the lines that the fans would always have the Pet Shop Boys, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> commercially, was scarce and ineffectual". Noting the fact that Pet Shop Boys [...] "began their career with hits", Maus made the point that this early success was valued by fans: the band's [...] "large audiences" [...] were just as important to [...] "many fans" [...] as the making of [...] "distinctive music that individual fans loved".|$|E
2500|$|A year later, {{after taking}} his third world championship, Senna {{explained}} to the press his actions {{of the previous year}} in Suzuka. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed by Jean-Marie Balestre after he had taken pole. Senna said {{that he was not going}} to accept what he saw as unfair decision-making by Balestre, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990 (though some in the F1 paddock noted that the pole position at Suzuka was actually on the same side of the track it had been since F1 returned to Japan in 1987, and many privately wondered why Senna was suddenly making a fuss about it, considering he had been on pole there in both 1988 and 1989, when he was also fighting Prost for the championship). Senna stated that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost would later go on record criticising Senna's actions as [...] "disgusting", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident.|$|E
