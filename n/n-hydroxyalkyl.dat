40|$|Previously {{reported}} {{experimental results}} indicate that photooxygenation of homochiral <b>N-(hydroxyalkyl)</b> - 2 -methylpyrroles with singlet oxygen yields transrather than cis-bicyclic lactams as the major product. In this study, the origin of selectivity in this reaction has been investigated with computational methods. Relative stabilities of homochiral <b>N-(hydroxyalkyl)</b> - 2 -methylpyrrole conformers and their effect on pi-facial selectivity of O- 1 (2) were extensively studied. Stepwise and concerted reaction mechanisms, starting from the endoperoxide intermediates, were proposed and modeled in vacuum using the UB 3 LYP method with the 6 - 31 +G** basis set. Solvent calculations were carried out in CH 2 Cl 2, {{by means of the}} integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) at the UB 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G** level of theory. Free energies of activation leading to both diastereomers were analyzed in an effort to explain the stereoselectivity and product distribution. Steric interactions among the pyrrole substituents were shown to lead to a rotational barrier higher than 10 kcal/mol. Hence, hindered internal rotation is suggested to cause one pyrrole conformer to be substantially overpopulated. This in turn has a major effect on pi-facial selectivity of O- 1 (2), thereby favoring one endoperoxide over the other and leading to the diastereoselective synthesis o trans-pyrrolooxazolones. The importance of hindered internal rotors, for an accurate calculation of the frequency factors of a chemical reaction, has already been mentioned in the literature many times; however, in this work hindered internal rotors also seem to dictate the diastereoselective outcome of the reaction...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{different}} N-alkyl-beta-D-glucosylamines {{were evaluated}} for both antifungal and antibacterial activity against Fusarium proliferatum (INRA, MUCL 1807. 7), Listeria innocua (ISTAB, Universite Bordeaux 1), and Salmonella typhimurium (Institut Pasteur 5858). The tested glucosylamines were beta-D-glucosylamine (GPA), N-ethyl-beta-D-glucosylamine (EtGPA), N-butyl-beta-D-glucosylamine (BuGPA), N-hexyl-beta-D-glucosylamine (HeGPA), N-octyl-beta-D-glucosylamine (OcGPA), N-dodecyl-beta-D-glucosylamine (DoGPA), N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -beta-D-glucosylamine (HEtGPA), N,N-di(2 -hydroxyethyl) -beta-D-glucosylamine (DHEtGPA) and N,N-diethyl-beta-D-glucosylamine (DEtGPA). The effectiveness of N-alkyl length, N-substitution, and <b>N-hydroxyalkyl</b> groups on both antibacterial and antifungal activity were evaluated. Results indicated that these compounds exhibited different biological activities and their effectiveness was highly increased from short to long N-alkyl chains. DoGPA exhibited more potent biological activity against all target strains than other N-alkyl glucosylamines tested. Using a radial growth method, we demonstrated that this compound completely inhibited fungal growth at 0. 5 x 10 (- 4) mol mL(- 1), while OcGPA and HeGPA lead to 71 % and 43 % fungal inhibition, respectively. Using the coating method, we demonstrated that DoGPA completely inhibited bacterial growth at 0. 025 x 10 (- 4) and 0. 05 x 10 (- 4) mol mL(- 1) for L. innocua and S. typhimurium, respectively, {{while at the}} same concentrations, OcGPA exhibited weaker antibacterial activity of 12 % and 27 %, respectively, for L. innocua and S. typhimurium. The hole plate method enabled us to estimate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of DoGPA found to be 0. 02 x 10 (- 4) and 0. 025 x 10 (- 4) mol mL(- 1) for L. innocua and S. typhimurium, respectively. Glucosylamines with <b>N-hydroxyalkyl</b> and short N-alkyl chains varying from C- 2 to C- 4 exhibited weaker antimicrobial activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} new thiol-derivatized {{ibuprofen}} monolayer protected gold clusters {{have been prepared}} by amidation of ibuprofen with alkyl alcohol or aminophenol affording the carboxamides, <b>N-hydroxyalkyl</b> amide 2, and N-hydroxyphenyl amide 6, which were then tosylated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride at hydroxyl group to give 3 and 7. Reactions of 3 and 7 with NaSH afforded the mercapto derivatives 4 and 8. Conducting Brust’s reaction with a 3 [*]:[*] 1 mole ratio of thiolate ibuprofen/AuCl 4 - yielded polydisperse thiol-derivatized ibuprofen-MPCs 5 and 9. All compounds have been identified by NMR, MS, UV, and IR spectroscopies. Compounds 4 and 8 and the MPCs 5 and 9 have been investigated by using the method of 1 H NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|N-acyloxyalkylation of NH-acidic {{compounds}} {{can be a}} prodrug {{approach for}} e. g. tertiary or some N-heterocyclic amines and secondary amides and {{have the potential to}} modify the properties of the parent drug for specific uses, for example its physicochemical, pharmacokinetic or biopharmaceutical properties. Aripiprazole lauroxil was prepared as a model compound for such prodrugs and its bioconversion was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Theoretically, N-acyloxyalkyl derivates of NH-acid compounds undergo a two-step bioconversion into the parent NH-acidic drug through an <b>N-hydroxyalkyl</b> intermediate. However, to our knowledge no published studies have investigated the formation of an intermediate in vivo. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the assumed N-hydroxymethyl intermediate was readily observed both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the observed plasma concentration of the intermediate was at the same level as the drug (aripiprazole). When prodrug intermediates are formed, it is important to make a proper pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluation of the intermediates to ensure patient safety; however, several challenges were identified when testing an N-acyloxyalkyl prodrug. These included the development of a suitable bioanalytical method, the accurate prediction of prodrug bioconversion and thereby the related pharmacokinetics in humans and the toxicological potential of the intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anticancer {{activities}} of several substituted naphthalimides (1 H-benz[de]isoquinoline- 1, 3 -diones) are well documented. Some {{of them have}} undergone Phase I-II clinical trials. Presently a series of ten <b>N-(hydroxyalkyl)</b> naphthalimides (compounds 1 a-j) were evaluated as antitumor agents. Methods: Compounds 1 a-j were initially screened in MOLT- 4, HL- 60 and U- 937 human tumor cell lines and results were compared with established clinical drugs. Cytotoxicities of compounds 1 d and 1 i were further evaluated in a battery of human tumor cell lines and in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cell cycle analysis of compound 1 i treated MOLT- 4 cells was studied by flow cytometry. Its apoptosis inducing effect {{was carried out in}} MOLT- 4 and HL- 60 cells by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method. The {{activities of}} caspase- 3 and caspase- 6 in MOLT- 4 cells following incubation with compound 1 i were measured at different time intervals. Morphology of the MOLT- 4 cells after treatment with 1 i was examined under light microscope and transmission electron microscope. 3 H-Thymidine and 3 H-uridine incorporation in S- 180 cells in vitro following treatment with 8 μM concentration of compounds 1 d and 1 i were studied.

Results 6 -Nitro- 2 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) - 1 H-benz[de]isoquinoline- 1, 3 -dione (compound 1 i), has exhibited maximum activity as it induced significant cytotoxicity in 8 out of 13 cell lines employed. Interestingly it did not show any cytotoxicity against human PBMC (IC 50 value 273 μM). Cell cycle analysis of compound 1 i treated MOLT- 4 cells demonstrated rise in sub-G 1 fraction and concomitant accumulation of cells in S and G 2 /M phases, indicating up-regulation of apoptosis along with mitotic arrest and/or delay in exit of daughter cells from mitotic cycle respectively. Its apoptosis inducing effect was confirmed in flow cytometric study in MOLT- 4 and the action was mediated by activation of both caspase 3 and 6. Light and transmission electron microscopic studies corroborated its apoptosis inducing efficacy at a concentration of 10 μM in MOLT- 4 cells. Its apoptosis induction was also observed in HL- 60 cells to an extent much greater than well known apoptosis inducing agents as camptothecin and cis-platin at 10 μM concentration each. It significantly inhibited DNA and RNA synthesis in S- 180. Conclusions In essence, compound 1 i showed potential as an antitumor agent. </p...|$|E
