His own comments at the conference of senior statesmen gave <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> that he favored any early cessation of the war...Suzuki's selections for the most critical cabinet posts were, with one exception, not advocates of peace either.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} Holkham {{were of a}} large central block of two floors only, {{containing}} on the piano nobile level a series of symmetrically balanced state rooms situated around two courtyards. <b>No</b> <b>hint</b> of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at each corners {{is linked to the}} main house not by long colonnadesas would have been the norm in Palladian architecturebut by short two-storey wings of only one bay.|$|E

5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and {{there is reason to}} believe that dates in this source are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{scrutiny}} about the stub end at Exit 6A for Route 138 {{that was to}} be a part of an extension of the freeway for its final five miles (8km) from Route 138 to the Brielle Circle. Some of the right-of-way that was acquired in the 1960s for the Route 35 freeway were transformed into a multi-use trail for bicycles and other vehicles to link the Wall Township Municipal Complex to the existing Edgar Felix Bikeway that runs from Manasquan to Allaire State Park. In 2001, the Brielle Circle was replaced with a new four-approach interchange between Route 35, Route 34 and Route 70, but the project included <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> of the Route 18 Extension. NJDOT is in planning to create a Park & Ride at the southern terminus of the Route 18 freeway. It will be placed along the four lane right of way just south of Route 138. Residents are in opposition to this proposal for fear of loitering and vandalism that may accompany the parking lot.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{chemical}} names specify exactly the chemical {{structure of the}} molecule. The Cy3 and Cy5 nomenclature was first proposed by Ernst, et al. in 1989, and is non-standard, since it gives <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> of their chemical structures. In the original paper the number designated the count of the methines (as shown), and the side chains were unspecified. Thus various structures are designated Cy3 and Cy5 in the literature.|$|E

50|$|Although old Russian sources often {{mention that}} the rulers of Kievan Rus' {{requested}} warriors from Scandinavia, Yakun is the only commander who is mentioned by name.

25|$|The only {{reference}} in the sources {{to any kind}} of treaty at Wedmore is the above quotation from Asser. All we know, therefore, is that it was at Wedmore that Guthrum accepted Alfred as his adoptive father and accepted the Christian faith.

25|$|The {{removal of}} the ban did not imply a genuine reconciliation, and no basis was gained for a {{settlement}} of the main question that divided Henry and Gregory: that of investiture.

Gregory, on the other hand, was intent on reserving his freedom of action and gave <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> on the subject at Canossa.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, liberal intellectuals {{crafted a}} new vision for {{achieving}} economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s contained <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, {{and to ensure that}} the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.|$|E

His watch and a valuable piece of jewelry were found on his body. One source asserted that his death {{could not have been}} a suicide because he was held in high regard in military circles and gave <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> that morning that something was wrong. It was suggested that certain individuals threw him off the Pont des Arts (bridge) for political reasons. QUESNEL is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on the west panel.|$|E
25|$|Several dialogues tackle {{questions}} about art: Socrates says that poetry {{is inspired by}} the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, {{and other forms of}} divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.|$|E

The Synagogue of Casale Monferrato is inside a building at Vicolo Olper 44 that offers <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> from its nondescript exterior that it is a synagogue, built in 1595, and recognized as one of the most beautiful in Europe. The women’s galleries now host an important Jewish museum. Of particular interest are the Tablets of the Law in gilded wood, dating from the 18th century, numerous Rimonim (finials to scrolls of the Law) and Atarot (crowns for the scrolls of the Law) carved and with silver filigree.|$|E
25|$|Silverlink: In {{the autumn}} of 2007, Shere Fasticket {{machines}} were installed at stations on the Barking & Gospel Oak line.

The machines are able to take cash, but are (at the time of writing) payment card only, pending cash collection (i.e. emptying) arrangements being put in place.

25|$|Daniel Treisman, a UCLA {{political}} scientist, {{has criticized}} Freedom House's assessment of Russia. Treisman {{has pointed out}} that Freedom House ranks Russia's political rights on the same level as the United Arab Emirates, which, according to Freedom House, is a federation of absolute monarchies with <b>no</b> <b>hint</b> of democracy anywhere in the system. Freedom House also ranks Russia's civil liberties on the same scale as those of Yemen. In Yemen, according to the constitution, Sharia law is the only source of legislation, and allows assaults and killings of women for alleged immoral behaviour. Criticising the president is illegal in Yemen. Treisman contrasts Freedom House's ranking with the Polity IV scale used by academics and in which Russia has a much better score. In the Polity IV scale, Saudi Arabia is a consolidated autocracy (-10), while the United States is a consolidated democracy (+10); Russia has a score of +4, while United Arab Emirates has a score of -8.|$|E
