5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E

5|$|Meg {{catches the}} mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual Star Trek convention, because Peter {{forced her to}} stand <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> irresponsible {{attendee}} with mumps to take a picture, believing {{him to be in}} costume as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a born-again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|South of the four-level stack {{interchange}} with I-69, I-475 crosses over {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. North of this interchange, {{the freeway}} runs more northwesterly as it skirts {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Flint. Near the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint, I-475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing it <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> industrial area. There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M-54 (Dort Highway). I-475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail line operated by CSX Transportation. North of Carpenter Road, the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township. The Interstate turns to the east to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street. There is one more interchange for Clio Road before I-475 terminates at a full interchange with I-75's exit125.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Dwarfs {{may move}} the Rock instead of moving a dwarf piece. It may move only one square in any direction. To be moved {{it must be}} <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dwarf and {{it must also be}} <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dwarf {{at the end of its}} move.|$|R

25|$|The {{estate is}} bounded {{on the east}} by Annandale Road, on the north by the Saw Kill and the west by the river. A tree-lined {{driveway}} from the road leads west to a visitor center and parking lot <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> orchard. From there it is short walk through a grove of trees to an open lawn {{in front of the}} main house, atop a bluff overlooking the river and the Catskill Escarpment across it in the distance.|$|E
25|$|The {{phosphor}} {{drops off}} in efficiency during use. By around 25,000 operating hours, it will typically be half {{the brightness of}} a new lamp (although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps). Lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode. They still work, but have become dim and inefficient. The process is slow, and often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> old one.|$|E

The hotel still stands today and the segment of Midland Road that ran {{in front of it}} is now a parking area. Midland Road crossed the railway via a bridge. It had a single platform and a booking office, waiting room and a passing loop. A goods yard was located {{to the west of the}} station.|$|E
25|$|All UC chancellors {{traditionally}} {{live for}} free in a mansion {{on or near}} campus that is usually known as University House, where they host social functions attended by guests and donors. UC San Diego's University House was closed from 2004 to 2014 for $10.5 million in renovations paid for by private donors, which were so expensive because the 12,000-square-foot structure sits {{on top of a}} sacred Native American cemetery and <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unstable coastal bluff.|$|E
25|$|The late 20th {{century has}} seen {{a change in the}} {{faithfulness}} of emulation of the style, since in a modern development it is common to have only a few basic floor plans for buildings, these combined with variations in interior surface treatment and in the exterior in rooflines and setbacks to provide a visual variety to the street view. Owing to the smaller lots employed in modern developments (especially in the Western US), Tudor Revival may be placed directly <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unrelated style such as French or Italian Provincial, resulting in an eclectic mix.|$|E

25|$|The nation hosts two Airports {{such as the}} Gjakova Airport and {{the only}} International Airport of Pristina. The Gjakova Airport was built by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) {{following}} the Kosovo War, <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights. The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership {{with the aim of}} turning it into a civilian and commercial airport. The Pristina International Airport is located southwest of Pristina. It is Kosovo's only international airport and the only port of entry for air travelers to Kosovo.|$|E
25|$|The Exposition {{ended in}} October 1893, and the wheel closed in April 1894 and was {{dismantled}} and stored {{until the following}} year. It was then rebuilt on Chicago's North Side, near Lincoln Park, <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> exclusive neighborhood. This prompted William D. Boyce, then a local resident, to file a Circuit Court action against {{the owners of the}} wheel to have it removed, but without success. It operated there from October 1895 until 1903, when it was again dismantled, then transported by rail to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair and finally destroyed by controlled demolition using dynamite on May 11, 1906.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1812 earthquake, the two largest bells cracked and split open. Due to this damage neither produced clear tones. Regardless, they were hung in the campanario that went up the following year. During the Mission's heyday, a lone bell also hung at the west end of the front corridor, <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> entrance gate which has long since eroded away. One of O' Sullivan's companions during his tenure at San Juan Capistrano was José de Gracia Cruz, better known as Acú, who related many stories and legends of the Mission. A descendent of the Juaneño Indians, he served as the Mission's bell ringer until his death in 1924.|$|E

25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} if you move your fire demon <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.|$|E
25|$|A wreath of galax leaves was {{provided}} for each casket, {{which was also}} draped with an American flag. Each coffin was placed <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open grave. Once the funeral cortege departed, two companies of bluejackets and a battalion of U.S. Marines acted as honor guards for the dead. They were joined by the United States Marine Corps Band. Captain Sigsbee was {{in command of the}} three honor guards. A small dais draped in red, white, and blue {{was provided}} for the speakers and officiators. President McKinley, his Cabinet, Admiral George Dewey, Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles, Lieutenant Commander Richard Wainwright (former Executive Officer of the Maine), Lieutenant Frederic C. Bowers (former Passed Assistant Engineer aboard the Maine), and Coal Passer Jeremiah Shea attended the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} {{was dedicated}} in 1995 to the seven {{victims of the}} 1979 fire, with a tree planted <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> antique bench decorated {{with the names of}} the victims. During the 2003 redevelopment, the tree was removed and the bench lost. Park director Warwick Doughty claimed that the memorial and events had little relevance, although North Sydney mayor Genia McCaffery, among others, disagreed and campaigned for the memorial's reinstatement. In 2004, a plaque listing the names of the victims was placed on an external wall of the Big Top, which was constructed {{on the site of the}} Ghost Train. The plaque was to be the centrepiece of a mural painted by former Park Artist Martin Sharp, but this has never been painted. At least one person present at the unveiling of the plaque was unimpressed with the new memorial.|$|E
