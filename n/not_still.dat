25|$|Mother tongue : The first {{language}} learned by a person, {{which may or}} may <b>not</b> <b>still</b> be used by that individual in adulthood, is a basic measure of a population's language.

25|$|The left-back and the right-back (generally {{referred}} to as the full-backs) are the defenders stationed either side of the centre-backs to provide protection from attacking wide players. They often have to defend against the opponent's wingers, who will try to take the ball past them down the flanks in order to cross or pass into the penalty area to their attackers. Full-backs traditionally do not go up to support the attack but may move up as far as the halfway line depending on the defensive line being held. In the modern game, there has been the tendency to prefer the use of the attacking full-back (wing-back) role though they are more often than <b>not</b> <b>still</b> {{referred to}} as right- or left-backs.|$|E

25|$|After Israel was {{established}} in 1948, the country experienced a wave of mass immigration lasting from 1948 to 1951, primarily from post-Holocaust Europe and Arab and Muslim countries, absorbing 688,000 immigrants during this period. However, some 10% of these immigrants would leave {{the country in the}} following years, primarily to Canada, Australia, and South America.

25|$|Arena's latest venture, her {{new album}} Eleven, is so named {{because it is the}} 11th album of her {{recording}} career, but also because she likes its astrological implications' '11' being a figure of enlightenment and artistic sensitivity. Like its predecessor, 2013's Reset, Eleven is a pop-heavy collection, featuring songwriting collaborations with, among others, Kate Miller-Heidke, Hayley Warner and Evermore's Jon Hume. Her new album, was recorded in Sydney, Melbourne, London and Stockholm, as well as in Paris. The Eleven album is a mix of atmospheric electronica (Unravel Me, Overload), smouldering anthems (Wouldn't Be Love If It Didn't, Love Falls, <b>Not</b> <b>Still</b> in Love with You) and dance-friendly pop (Magic). Arena's most recent release, Eleven, became her seventh Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart in November 2016, and is now certified gold.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, Guth heard colleagues {{discussing}} {{something called}} the horizon problem. The microwave background radiation discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson appeared extremely uniform, with almost no variance. This seemed very paradoxical because, when the radiation was released about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the observable universe had a diameter of 90 million light-years. There {{was no time for}} one end of the cosmos to communicate with the other end, because energy can not move faster than the speed of light. The paradox was resolved, as Guth soon realized, by the inflation theory. Since inflation started with a far smaller amount of matter than the Big Bang had presupposed, an amount so small that all parts would have been in touch with each other. The universe then inflated at billion times the speed of light so the homogeneity remained unbroken. The universe after inflation would have been very uniform even though the parts were <b>not</b> <b>still</b> in touch with each other.|$|E

500|$|An example {{progress}} curve for {{an enzyme}} assay is shown above. The enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear {{for a short}} period after the start of the reaction. [...] As the reaction proceeds and substrate is consumed, the rate continuously slows (so long as substrate is <b>not</b> <b>still</b> at saturating levels). To measure the initial (and maximal) rate, enzyme assays are typically carried out while the reaction has progressed only a few percent towards total completion. [...] The length of the initial rate period depends on the assay conditions and can range from milliseconds to hours. [...] However, equipment for rapidly mixing liquids allows fast kinetic measurements on initial rates of less than one second. These very rapid assays are essential for measuring pre-steady-state kinetics, which are discussed below.|$|E

[...] Stengel remains the only manager to lead his club to victory in five consecutive World Series. How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managedâTotal Baseball deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, [...] "the argumentâeven among some Yankeesâwas that the team was so good anybody could manage it to a title". Rizzuto stated, [...] "You or I could have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants." [...] Appel noted, [...] "There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager. Once again, it was clear that with good players he was a good manager, and with bad players, <b>not.</b> <b>Still,</b> his Yankee years had put him so {{high on the list of}} games won, championships won, etc., that he will always be included in conversations about the greatest managers." ...|$|E
