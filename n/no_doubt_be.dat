5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> {{accounted for by the}} extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E

500|$|Sense and Sensibility has {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included {{on more than}} a hundred top-ten of the year lists. Writing for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy observed that the film's success was assisted by its [...] "highly skilled cast of actors," [...] as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, [...] "Although [...] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing The Remains of the Day." ...|$|E

[...] However, he argued that players who [...] "accept Hodj 'n' Podj in the spirit {{in which it is}} offered" [...] will derive [...] "considerable delight in playing it — {{especially}} if you have kids." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai found the game's use of traditional games [...] "downright baffling", given their presence in past compilations, as well as in [...] and the Dr. Brain series. Although he enjoyed the game's graphics and humor, he summarized, [...] "You've seen all the puzzles before, often done better than they're done here.

Like the original Scream, this movie is too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E

[...] The insane, eminently quotable one-liners were flying so fast and so furious that I could barely keep up with them." [...] In regards to Jack's love triangle, Rabin opined that this arc [...] "could easily have worn out its welcome long ago" [...] but that Alec Baldwin, Julianne Moore, and Elizabeth Banks [...] "have kept lively and vibrant." [...] In conclusion, he gave it an A− grade rating. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive about Liz getting engaged, noting that she has become a woman, and concluded that [...] "it will <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> one of television's most memorable weddings" [...] if Liz and Wesley get married. Nick Catucci of New York magazine said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was good, [...] "aybe the best episode ever."

500|$|In {{preparation}} for his appearance on Question Time, Griffin researched the first appearance of Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams.

I am relishing this opportunity, and I [...] know that ... the ordinary members, supporters and voters of the BNP will [...] be in the studio with me as I take on the corrupt, treacherous swine [...] destroying our beautiful island nation." [...] Contrasting to Griffin's earlier 2001 appearance on HARDtalk and later appearances on Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman, Griffin claimed that he was non-combative in his Question Time appearance in order to gain sympathy from the viewers via a [...] "root-for-the-underdog mentality". He had expected to salvage his reputation in expected a later 12 episodes of the programme with him appearing as a panellist, which did not occur. However, he also stated in a letter on the BNP website: [...] "I will, <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>be</b> interrupted, shouted down, slandered, put on the spot, and subjected to a scrutiny that would be a thousand times more intense than anything directed at other panellists. It will, in other words, be political blood sport. But I am relishing this opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal. Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which will <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but {{a bit on the}} dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year."

Chris Bumbray reviewed the film for JoBlo.com and gave it 9 out of 10, and said, [...] "Like Woodroof, the film never wants your pity, and while tears will <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> shed while watching it, they're well-earned." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea talked about McConaughey's role, [...] "Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club, beginning with Matthew McConaughey's literally transformative portrayal. McConaughey's performance isn't just about the weight loss. It's about gaining compassion, even wisdom, and it's awesome." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Dallas Buyers Club" [...] takes audiences back to {{the worst of the}} AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper reviewed the film for his own website, and talked about McConaughey: [...] "Once we get past McConaughey's stunning transformation, we're transfixed by a performance that reminds us of why this guy became a movie star in the first place." [...] Ann Hornaday gave the film 4 out of 4 ratings, and then gave her remarks on McConaughey's remarkable performance for The Washington Post, [...] "McConaughey delivers the performance of his career, characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reviews for}} the Virtual Console release ranged from mixed to positive, applauding the {{gameplay}} and depth, but criticizing {{the choice to}} release the primitive NES version over the more comprehensive SNES version.

[...] Aaron Thomas of GameSpot gave Wario's Woods a score of 7.0 out of 10, admiring the [...] "fun, addictive game play" [...] and [...] "surprising amount of depth", but criticizing the game's repetitive music and poor sound effects, adding that he also prefers the [...] "ideal" [...] SNES version.

2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what you are seeing. We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." [...] Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer to provide us with a computer print-out staged across the seconds that you were watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description {{of the state of the}} screen, nowhere in that list would there be a mention of [...] "English sentences" [...] or [...] "a 7-Up can".|$|E
