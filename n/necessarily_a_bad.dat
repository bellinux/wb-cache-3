25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} was not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, {{with all its}} detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E

[...] In 1987, Spin magazine called the album [...] "an inspired and brilliantly crafted work. It's charged with a positive spirit that makes art soul food; imbued with the contagious energy that gives ideas a leg to dance on", but in 1989 a different reviewer for the magazine called the album [...] "disappointing". Rolling Stone magazine called the work an [...] "odd, freewheeling pastiche of elements from all the previous Bowies," [...] "unfocused," [...] and possibly [...] "the noisiest, sloppiest Bowie album ever. ... Being noisy and sloppy isn't <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing, but sad to say, Never Let Me Down is also something of a mess."

2500|$|A common way [...] "around" [...] Arrow's {{paradox is}} {{limiting}} the alternative set to two alternatives. Thus, whenever {{more than two}} alternatives should {{be put to the}} test, it seems very tempting to use a mechanism that pairs them and votes by pairs. As tempting as this mechanism seems at first glance, it is generally far from satisfying even Pareto efficiency, not to mention IIA. The specific order by which the pairs are decided strongly influences the outcome. This is not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> feature of the mechanism. Many sports use the tournament mechanism—essentially a pairing mechanism—to choose a winner. [...] This gives considerable opportunity for weaker teams to win, thus adding interest and tension throughout the tournament. This means that the person controlling the order by which the choices are paired (the agenda maker) has great control over the outcome. In any case, when viewing the entire voting process as one game, Arrow's theorem still applies.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, Beckett clearly {{realised}} {{that the}} greater part of Godots success came down {{to the fact that it}} was open to a variety of readings and that this was not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing. Beckett himself sanctioned [...] "one of the most famous mixed-race productions of Godot, performed at the Baxter Theatre in the University of Cape Town, directed by Donald Howarth, with [...] two black actors, John Kani and Winston Ntshona, playing Didi and Gogo; Pozzo, dressed in checked shirt and gumboots reminiscent of an Afrikaner landlord, and Lucky ('a shanty town piece of white trash') were played by two white actors, Bill Flynn and Peter Piccolo [...] The Baxter production has often been portrayed as if it were an explicitly political production, when in fact it received very little emphasis. What such a reaction showed, however, was that, although the play can in no way be taken as a political allegory, there are elements that are relevant to any local situation in which one man is being exploited or oppressed by another." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album drew a mixed {{critical}} reaction, {{with many}} reviewers commenting favorably on it but criticizing its traditional rock sound. The staff of Ultimate Guitar enjoyed the album, rating it 7 stars out of 10, but declared that it [...] "seems to be {{frozen in the}} '70s", criticizing Heppner's singing and the overt influences from bands such as AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Motörhead (even though Heppner has stated {{he is not a}} Motörhead fan), but otherwise praising the group for the song [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] and the cowbell on [...] "Run Home". Tom Breihan wrote for Pitchfork Media that Hello Master was largely derivative of some of the aforementioned acts plus Ted Nugent, but noted that that was not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing; Breihan mainly disliked [...] "Living Like a Dog" [...] but praised [...] "Talk to Her" [...] and [...] "Time Will Cut You Down", the latter in particular for its chorus, and gave the record 7.3 points out of 10. Prefix writer Zach Hothorn, giving the album a 6.0 out of 10, considered [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] as [...] "a nice reprieve from the incessant open-A Angus Young riffing", and criticized [...] "Blood" [...] as [...] "sound like an afterthought" [...] and compared it to Queens of the Stone Age. Rating the album 3.0 out of 5 and suggesting that the band were having a crisis of musical identity on the record, as the album art seemed indicative of a different style of music than was present on the album, Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Irving Tan wrote that {{the second half of the}} album strove too diligently to mimic Metallica, Black Sabbath and Budgie, except for closing track [...] "Blood" [...] (which he said was the album's [...] "most intriguing" [...] song and evidence of the band's true potential). IGN's Chad Grishow gave a mixed review of 6.6 out of 10 and explained that [...] "Two Kids" [...] (mistakenly identifying Heppner as singing lead vocals on that song) and [...] "Blood" [...] (which he said sounded like a [...] "completely different band" [...] and would have been most fitting as a B-side) were the best tracks on the album, but that Priestess were inferior to like-minded [...] "retro sound" [...] contemporaries Wolfmother.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper revisits {{the topic}} of {{relative}} performance evaluation (RPE) of top management using a large panel of community banks. We show that penalizing executives for poor performance arising from economic downturns is not necessarily inconsistent with the theory. Our empirical results indicate that weak downturn-linked performance is strongly related to increased executive turnover. Furthermore, this relationship is more pronounced in bettergoverned banks, which {{are more likely to}} engage in value-enhancing disciplinary actions. Our analysis suggests that executive dismissals during adverse economic conditions are not <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> result of <b>bad</b> luck; rather, the analysis implies that bad times are informative about management quality. 2 I...|$|R
60|$|Such a promise, {{provided}} {{the children have}} the double confidence in their mother which such a method requires--namely, first, a full belief that she will really bring home the promised rewards, if they obey her; and secondly--and this is a confidence much less frequently felt by children, and much less frequently deserved by their mothers--a conviction that, in case they disobey, no importunities on their part or promises for the next time will induce their mother {{to give them the}} good things, but that the rewards will certainly be lost to them unless they are deserved, according to the conditions of the promise--in such a case--that is, when this double confidence exists, the promise will have great influence upon the children.

Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|R
