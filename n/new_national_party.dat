5|$|The {{official}} opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) received 16.7% of {{the vote}} in 2009, up from 12.4% in 2004. The DA is led by Helen Zille, who was re-elected unopposed as Leader of the Democratic Alliance at the party's Federal Congress in Gauteng in 2012, while Lindiwe Mazibuko continued as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. At provincial level, the DA has been in power in the Western Cape province since 2009, and came to power in several Western Cape municipalities in the 2011 municipal election. Traditionally, the DA was seen as a party rallying against apartheid laws, especially in the 1980s. However, one of its larger following bases are the whites in the south, especially after it absorbed the <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> in 2001 (although NNP was disbanded in 2004).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, Coloured {{identity}} politics {{have grown in}} influence. The Western Cape has been a site {{of the rise of}} opposition parties, such as the Democratic Alliance (DA). The Western Cape is considered as an area in which this party might gain ground against the dominant African National Congress. The Democratic Alliance drew in some former <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> voters and won considerable Coloured support. The <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> collapsed in the 2004 elections. Coloured support aided the Democratic Alliance's victory in the 2006 Cape Town municipal elections.|$|E
25|$|During the 1994 all-race elections, some Coloured {{people voted}} for the white National Party. The National Party recast itself as the <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> partly to attract non-White voters. This {{political}} alliance, often perplexing to outsiders, has sometimes been {{explained in terms of}} the culture and language shared by White and Coloured <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> members, who both spoke Afrikaans. In addition, both groups opposed affirmative action programmes that might give preference to non-Coloured Black people, and some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if African National Congress gained leadership in the government.|$|E

25|$|Patricia de Lille, current {{mayor of}} Cape Town {{and founder of}} the now-defunct Independent Democrats, does not use the label Coloured but many {{observers}} would consider her as Coloured by visible appearance. The Independent Democrats party sought the Coloured vote and gained significant ground in the municipal and local elections in 2006, particularly in districts in the Western Cape with high proportions of Coloured residents. The firebrand Peter Marais (formerly a provincial leader of the <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party)</b> has sought to portray his New Labour Party as the political voice for Coloured people.|$|E

2500|$|Harry Schwarz {{retired from}} {{politics}} upon returning from Washington, {{and returned to}} law to practice in Schwarz-North in Johannesburg and continued to work until he died. His areas of legal practice were primarily corporate and commercial with special interests in banking, insurance, diplomacy and advocacy. He was {{highly critical of the}} Democratic Party's decision to merge with the <b>New</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> in 2000 and in 2008 stated that the DP [...] "should have sought an alliance with black political groups". He remained active in the Jewish community, notably serving as president of the South Africa-Israel Chamber of Commerce between 1999 and 2010 and vice-president of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. Schwarz delivered his final public speech at the South African Parliament in November 2009 at a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the formation of the Progressive Party, in which he stated that [...] "freedom is incomplete if it is exercised in poverty". Upon returning to South Africa, Schwarz and his wife set up a charity trust called the Schwarz Upliftment Trust. He lived in Johannesburg with his wife Annette, who is an accomplished artist and ran all of his election campaigns. They were married for 57 years with three children and four grandchildren.|$|E

Seven years ago, it was," [...] he went on reminiscently, [...] "when the <b>new</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> came into supreme power. You know one of their first battle cries--'Down with all secret treaties! Down with all secret diplomacy! Let nothing exist but an honest {{commercial}} understanding between the different countries of the world!' How Germany and Russia howled with joy! In place of an English statesman with his country's broad interests at heart, we have in Berlin and Petrograd half a dozen representatives of the great industries, whose object, in their own words, is, I believe, to develop friendly commercialism {{and a feeling of}} brotherhood between the nations. Not only our ambassadors but our secret service were swept clean out of existence. I remember going to Broadley, the day he was appointed Foreign Minister, and I asked him a simple question. I asked him whether he did not consider it his duty to keep his finger upon the pulses of the other great nations, however friendly they might seem, to keep himself assured that all these expressions of good will were honourable, and that {{in the heart of the}} German nation that great craving for revenge which is the natural heritage of the present generation had really become dissipated. Broadley smiled at me. 'Lord Dorminster,' he said, 'the chief cause of wars in the past has been suspicion. We look upon espionage as a disgraceful practice. It is the people of Germany with whom we are in touch now, not a military oligarchy, and the people of Germany no more desire war than we do. Besides, there is the League of Nations.' Those were Broadley's views then, and they are his views to-day. You know what I did?" ...|$|E
