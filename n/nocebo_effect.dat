25|$|The {{placebo effect}} {{is related to}} the {{perceptions}} and expectations of the patient; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but, if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the <b>nocebo</b> <b>effect.</b> In 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different. According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect, and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those that think that a treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.|$|E

40|$|Physical complaints, such as pain, can be {{effectively}} altered by placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> due to induction of {{positive or negative}} expectations. While verbal suggestion and conditioning are recognized as playing {{a key role in}} placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on pain, these mechanisms have barely been investigated with regard to other somatosensory sensations, such as itch. Results on contagious itch in both animals and humans suggest that itch sensations might be even more susceptible for placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> than pain. Research on placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on pain and itch can further deliver insight into the common and specific mechanisms underlying these effects in different physical complaints. Work of our research group on verbal suggestions inducing <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> demonstrated an important role of verbal suggestions with regard to itch, with stronger <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch than a comparable procedure for pain. Recent work also demonstrated that placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch sensations were most effectively induced by procedures that consist of both conditioning and verbal suggestion principles. This work adds to previous prospective studies showing that expectation mechanisms, such as preservative worrying about negative consequences, are relatively consistent predictors of future disease outcomes, including itch, in chronic somatic conditions. Future studies should focus on the specific psychoneurobiological mechanisms of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> in various physical sensations, to get insight into the common and specific effects and to contribute to the long-term and clinically relevant use of placebo effects in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> {{are known}} to {{play a key role}} in {{treatment}} effects in a wide variety of conditions. These effects have frequently been investigated with regard to pain and also in other physical sensations, but have hardly been investigated with regard to itch. In addition, neither in pain nor in any other physical sensation, the single and combined contribution of the expectancy mechanisms of conditioning and verbal suggestion have ever been investigated in both placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> within one design. For the first time, the role of verbal suggestion and conditioning in placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch was experimentally investigated. Expectations about itch stimuli were induced in healthy subjects by verbal suggestion, conditioning, or a combination of both procedures, and compared with a control group without expectation induction. Itch was induced electrically by means of quantitative sensory testing. Significant placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> were induced in the group in which combined procedures of conditioning and verbal suggestion were applied in comparison with the control group. The conditioning and verbal suggestion procedures applied individually did not induce significant placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> when compared with the control group. The results of this study extend existing evidence on different physical sensations, like pain, by showing that also for itch, the combination of conditioning and verbal suggestion is most promising in inducing both placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects.</b> More research on placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> at a perceptive and neurobiological level is warranted to further elucidate the common and specific mechanisms underlying placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch and other physical sensations...|$|R
40|$|Placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{studied in the}} field of pain and more recently also on itch. In accordance with placebo research on pain, expectancy learning via verbal suggestion or conditioning has shown to induce placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch, in which the combination of both procedures seems most promising. Moreover, itch can also be transferred 'contagiously' in which suggestion and social behavioural learning seem to play a role. With regard to predictors of placebo and nocebo responding on itch and contagious itch, preliminary evidence suggests a role for individual psychological characteristics and personality traits regarding negative outcome expectancies. Although findings on placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch seem comparable to pain, we have only just begun to understand the underlying mechanisms and predictors of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch...|$|R
2500|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{opposite to}} {{the placebo effect}} has also been observed.

40|$|AbstractExpectation and {{previous}} experience are both well established key mediators of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects.</b> However, {{the investigation of}} their respective contribution to placebo and nocebo responses is rather difficult because most placebo and nocebo manipulations are contaminated by pre-existing treatment expectancies resulting from a learning history of previous medical interventions. To circumvent any resemblance to classical treatments, a purely psychological placebo-nocebo manipulation was established, namely, the “visual stripe pattern–induced modulation of pain. ” To this end, experience and expectation regarding the effects of different visual cues (stripe patterns) on pain were varied across 3 different groups, with either only placebo instruction (expectation), placebo conditioning (experience), or both (expectation + experience) applied. Only the combined manipulation (expectation + experience) revealed significant behavioral and physiological placebo–nocebo effects on pain. Two subsequent experiments, which, in addition to placebo and nocebo cues, included a neutral control condition further showed that especially nocebo responses were more easily induced by this psychological placebo and nocebo manipulation. The results emphasize the great effect of psychological processes on placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects.</b> Particularly, <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> should be addressed more thoroughly and carefully considered in clinical practice to prevent the accidental induction of side effects. PerspectiveEven purely psychological interventions that lack any resemblance to classical pain treatments might alter subjective and physiological pain correlates. A manipulation of treatment expectation and actual treatment experience were mandatory to elicit this <b>effect.</b> <b>Nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> were especially induced, which indicated the necessity for prevention of accidental side effects besides exploitation of placebo responses...|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that, due to the <b>nocebo</b> <b>effect,</b> warning {{patients}} about side effects of drugs {{can contribute to the}} causation of such effects, whether the drug is real or not. This effect has been observed in clinical trials: according to a 2013 review, the dropout rate among placebo-treated patients in a meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials of Parkinson's disease treatments was 8.8%.

40|$|Placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> {{are often}} {{regarded}} by clinicians {{as either a}} quaint reminiscence from the pre-therapeutic era, or simply as a technique for establishing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions within the locus of evidence-based practice.

40|$|Physical complaints, such as pain, can be {{effectively}} reduced by placebo effects through induction of positive expectations, or increased by <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> through induction of negative expectations. In the present study, verbally induced <b>nocebo</b> and placebo <b>effects</b> on itch were experimentally investigated {{for the first}} time. In part 1, the role of verbal suggestions in inducing <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> on itch and pain was investigated. All subjects received the same somatosensory quantitative sensory testing stimuli, that is, mechanical and electrical stimuli and application of histamine, and verbal suggestions to manipulate expectations regarding the stimuli. The suggestions were designed to produce either high expectations for itch (itch nocebo) or pain (pain nocebo) or low expectations for itch (itch nocebo control) or pain (pain nocebo control). Results showed that high itch and pain expectations resulted in higher levels of itch and pain, respectively. When comparing <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects,</b> induced by verbal suggestions, results were more pronounced for itch than for pain. In part 2, verbal suggestions designed to produce a placebo effect on itch (itch placebo) or pain (pain placebo), or neutral suggestions (itch placebo control and pain placebo control) were given regarding a second application of histamine and compared with the first application applied in part 1. Results of placebo effects only showed a significantly larger decrease in itch in the itch placebo condition than in the pain placebo condition.

40|$|Introduction Placebo and nocebo {{represent}} {{complex and}} distinct psychoneurobiological phenomena in which behavioural and neurophysiological modifications occur {{together with the}} application of a treatment. Despite a better understanding of this topic in the medical field, little is known about their role in physiotherapy.

Implications The physiotherapist's features, the patient's features, the patient–physiotherapist relationship, the characteristics of the treatment and the overall healthcare setting are all contextual factors influencing clinical outcomes. Since every physiotherapy treatment determines a specific and a contextual effect, physiotherapists should manage the contextual factors as a boosting element of any manual therapy to improve placebo effects and avoid detrimental <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients’ {{expectations}} of treatment effects {{may contribute to}} positive (placebo) and negative (<b>nocebo)</b> outcomes. The <b>effect</b> of patient expectations may be pronounced in subjectively assessed conditions, such as male erectile dysfunction. The aim of this project {{is to examine the}} magnitude of expectancy in trials of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors. We hypothesize that randomized controlled trials with inadequate blinding will report enhanced placebo effects for intervention groups and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> for placebo groups, compared with adequately blinded studies. Methods/design We will quantify the magnitude of expectancy by comparing the effect estimates of trials with inadequate and adequate blinding. Blinding will be assessed using four domains from the Cochrane ‘risk-of-bias’ tool: allocation concealment; blinding of patient; caregiver; and outcome assessor. Our secondary aim is to identify factors that can modify expectations, such as prior experience with the intervention and drug side effects. We will perform an electronic search using a combination of controlled vocabulary and free text words in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and a clinical trials register. We will include randomized controlled trials, with either parallel or crossover design, that compare one phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor with a placebo. The study’s primary aim should be to investigate the efficacy of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors for treating male erectile dysfunction. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by full text reports. Two reviewers will independently extract data on the primary outcome and assess risk of bias. We will meta-analyze treatment effects, if appropriate, to assess the magnitude of enhanced placebo <b>effects</b> and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> in intervention and placebo groups, respectively. We will explore possible mediators of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> with subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Discussion Treatments may confer significant costs and risk of adverse effects; it is important, therefore, to determine whether the effects of treatments are larger than expectancy alone. If treatment expectations {{can be used in a}} non-deceptive way to produce clinically advantageous outcomes, then it may be possible to incorporate such mechanisms into evidence-based healthcare decision-making. </p...|$|R
40|$|Placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> {{are known}} to {{contribute}} significantly to the response to symptom control, including analgesia. Clinical trial methodologies using placebo controls are designed to identify the magnitude of these effects in the research context. An adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ketamine in cancer pain has recently been reported, which demonstrated no net clinical benefit for ketamine over and above that of placebo. Rates of placebo and nocebo responses were high. The setting of a clinical trial provides an opportunity to quantify the nonpharmacologic aspects of patient responses to analgesia, raising important clinical and ethical issues for practice.

Along with reviewing the use of ketamine after this negative trial, clinicians need to remain aware of the strength and significance of both placebo and nocebo responses in their own practices and the biopsychosocial complexity of why and how patients actually respond to pain management strategies.

50|$|The <b>nocebo</b> <b>effect</b> {{is when a}} {{negative}} expectation of a phenomenon causes it {{to have a more}} negative effect than it otherwise would. A <b>nocebo</b> <b>effect</b> causes the perception that the phenomenon will have {{a negative}} outcome to actively influence the result. Mental states such as beliefs, expectations and anticipation can strongly influence the outcome of: disease; experience of pain; and even success of surgery. Positive expectations regarding a treatment can result in more positive outcomes and this effect is known as the placebo effect. Both placebo and nocebo effects are presumably psychogenic but also produce measurable physiological changes as well as changes in the brain, the body and behavior. For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a treatment, he/she can suffer them even if the medication provided is an inert substance. One article that reviewed 31 studies on nocebo effects reported a wide range of symptoms that could manifest as nocebo effects including nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction and severe hypotension.|$|E

40|$|The role of placebo and nocebo effects-that is {{positive}} or negative treatment effects that are entirely {{a consequence of the}} patient's expectations and beliefs about a treatment outcome in terms of efficacy, safety, usability or side effects-has been shown for almost all types of diseases and physiological response systems. Evidence for the relevance of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> in dermatology is also increasing, particularly for symptoms of itch and learned (conditioned) immune function. In addition, increasing knowledge is available about the neurobiological mechanisms of action, such as the role of the dopaminergic system. Studies on this topic offer innovative perspectives to unravel the multifactorial pathways of treatment effects and to use research designs for experimental research that provide full insight into the role of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects.</b> Moreover, intervention strategies can be developed for dermatology practice that optimize regular treatments with innovative non-pharmacological treatment strategies (e. g. optimized doctor-patient communication and treatment adherence, or prevention of nocebo reactions with regard to adverse side effects).

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{unwanted}} adverse events and symptoms reported by patients in clinical trials are not caused by the drug provided, since most of adverse events also occur in corresponding placebo groups. These <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects</b> also {{play a major role}} in drug discontinuation in clinical practice, negatively affecting treatment efficacy as well as patient adherence and compliance. Experimental and clinical data document a large interindividual variability in nocebo responses, however, data on psychological, biological or genetic predictors of nocebo responses are lacking. Thus, with an established paradigm of behaviorally conditioned immunosuppressive effects we analyzed possible genetic predictors for nocebo responses. We focused on the genetic polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (Val 158 Met) and analyzed drug specific and general side effects before and after immunosuppressive medication and subsequent placebo intake in 62 healthy male subjects. Significantly more drug-specific as well as general side effects were reported from homozygous carriers of the Val 158 variant during medication as well as placebo treatment compared to the other genotype groups. Val 158 /Val 158 carriers also had significantly higher scores in the somatosensory amplification scale (SSAS) and the BMQ (beliefs about medicine questionnaire).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationships}} among classical conditioning, expectancy, and fear in placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. A total of 42 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups: placebo, nocebo, and control. They received 96 electrical stimuli, preceded by either orange or blue lights. A hidden conditioning procedure, in which participants were not informed about the meaning of coloured lights, was performed in the placebo and nocebo groups. Light of one colour was paired with pain stimuli of moderate intensity (control stimuli), and light of the other colour was paired with either nonpainful stimuli (in the placebo group) or painful stimuli of high intensity (in the nocebo group). In the control group, both colour lights were followed by control stimuli of moderate intensity without any conditioning procedure. Participants rated pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity, and fear. In the testing phase, when both of the coloured lights were followed by identical moderate pain stimuli, we found a significant analgesic effect in the placebo group, and a significant hyperalgesic <b>effect</b> in the <b>nocebo</b> group. Neither expectancy nor fear ratings predicted placebo analgesia or nocebo hyperalgesia. It appears that a hidden conditioning procedure, without any explicit verbal suggestions, elicits placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>effects,</b> however we found no evidence that these effects are predicted by either expectancy or fear.
