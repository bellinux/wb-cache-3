5|$|Benítez {{was also}} {{prepared}} {{to break up}} his winning side after the final with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> expected to leave the club {{to make way for}} new arrivals. One of those leaving was Vladimír Šmicer, who had scored Liverpool's second goal in Istanbul, and whose contract was known not to be renewed before the final, meaning he entered knowing the final was his last game for the club.|$|E

Real had concerns over striker Laurie Cunningham who had been sidelined since November.|$|E
5|$|Both the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS {{versions}} were {{criticized for}} limiting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> to two. The Windows version was particularly criticized {{as it did}} not allow for online play, a feature available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 releases, nor would receive the downloadable content for the game. The lack of multiplayer in the pulled iOS version was lamented though the other facets of the game's humor remained.|$|E
5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{the most}} popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic. It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia, primarily by players who have played field lacrosse.

5|$|In 1867, Montreal Lacrosse Club member William George Beers codified {{the modern}} game. He {{established}} the Canadian National Lacrosse Association {{and created the}} first written rules for the game, Lacrosse: The National Game of Canada. The book specified field layout, lacrosse ball dimensions, lacrosse stick length, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players,</b> and number of goals required to determine the match winner.|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players,</b> each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players,</b> each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> {{have been}} called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player {{has been able to}} modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended.|$|E

5|$|Two booster {{tapes were}} {{released}} following {{the success of}} The Harbingers. The tapes provide a challenging experience to The Harbingers for experienced players. The booster tapes run for forty-five minutes instead of the sixty minutes of the original, and come with a new rule {{to limit the number}} of Keystones added to each province based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players.</b> Other than this limit the normal rules apply.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of}} the likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E

Adam Oates has been a six-time finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy but has never won.|$|E
5|$|By moving {{ice hockey}} game indoors, the smaller {{dimensions}} of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players,</b> the number being {{more or less the}} number that could fit on a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens. The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} variations in rules, so {{a discussion of}} house rules generally occurs before play begins. The following variations can be employed to accommodate different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>players.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2009 {{following}} the heavy loss to Tipperary, McCarthy dropped a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> high-profile <b>players</b> from the training panel for the 2010 season {{which led to}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other <b>players</b> not making themselves available.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the draft, around 40% of {{the players}} {{selected}} in it were born from countries outside the United States. It would remain the highest influx of international players selected in the modern NBA draft era until the 2016 NBA draft, where almost half of the selected players were born in countries outside the US. In addition, four of the players selected in the draft were Russians, which not only marked the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> born in that region to be taken in one draft, but also was the highest representation of a country in one draft until 2016 when five Frenchmen would be taken in the draft.|$|E

5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper.
