This is because for less number {{of production}} cycle the manufacturer has to produce more amount in individual cycle and it require more time to prepare the lot amount hence the total cycle time also increases. As more amount of items are produced due to the longer production run time, the rework cost, labor cost, energy cost and other costs per unit product decreases automatically and thus the total costing decreases and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|Parallelism, {{a massive}} {{achievement}} {{in the field of}} processor architecture leading towards increased speed up by incorporating data as well as computation intensive work. Parallel architectural components interconnected with major consideration as communication among coupled hardware in order to stabilize workload distribution and management. Workload distribution with load stability fundamentally a tricky aspect of parallel distribution. Static policies covers load factors which are pre-determined before actually distribution takes place. Dynamic load stability and distribution periodically measures the load for each and every processor in heterogenic parallel processor systems [...] Development of heterogenic multiprocessor machines with dynamic load stability matrices or measurements incorporates vast amount of efforts and covers varied amount of configuration factors on the behalf of the underlying communication architecture. So much of the processor’s efforts may lose for load stabilization, which may be controlled by improved dynamic load stability techniques and theories. In this research, the major aspect of development is to measure processor efficiency by analyzing frequency speed along with current processor load, only then the distribution takes place. Measuring cycle speed (i. e. <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycle</b> per second elapsed) in terms of Hz, Mhz, Ghz is one of the measurement metric to analyze the processor efficiency. Further the research covers MIMD based core processor simulation version integrate frequency based distribution for load steadiness and control. Although, load consistency will not be completely managed with in any type of system. Load steadiness and uniformity will only be controlled up to some extent...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Restenosis, {{in which}} the {{interactions}} of Smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (EC) play a significant role, is a major complication in treating peripheral arterial disease. Though {{recent studies have shown}} that cryoplasty may produce less restenosis but its underlying mechanism is still not well understood. This study investigates the survival responses of SMC and EC after different cycle treatments of supercooling and re-warming in an in vitro model simulating cryoplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bovine aortic SMC and EC were cultured separately in 6 well plates with medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum. In the 1 cycle treatment group, the cells were supercooled for 60 seconds to - 10 degree C and then re-warmed rapidly in a water bath at 37 degree C for another 60 seconds. The samples were then put into an incubator at 37 degree C for 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours. 2 cycles treatment was done by supercooling and re-warming the cells twice. TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot (WB) were used to measure apoptosis and Akt activation. Results are given as mean +/- standard error of mean and analysed by ANOVA. RESULTS: Both EC and SMC showed increasing apoptotic rates with increasing re-warming time and <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycle</b> treatment, but significantly higher in SMC (p< 0. 05), corresponding to its decreasing Akt activation with prolonging re-warming time and cycles of treatment (p< 0. 05). On the other hand, EC showed significant higher Akt activation, as assessed by IHC and WB, at 6 and 12 hours re-warming time compared with SMC (p< 0. 001). It was significantly peaked at 6 hours by 3 fold (p< 0. 05) and then decreased with re-warming time. CONCLUSION: The higher apoptotic rate and lower Akt activation with increasing re-warming times and treatment cycles in SMC, together with the relative lower apoptosis in EC may explain why cryoplasty can produce lower restenosis, where the integrity of EC and the lower SMC survival are the important factors in reducing restenosis. This information will also be useful in determining optimal cycle regimen for cryoplasty. The 2 nd Annual Academic Surgical Congress, Phoenix, AZ., 6 - 9 February 2007.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate mass and cost reduction for forged crankshaft of two wheeler. Every stroke of the engine subjected to its adjacent components to cyclic loading that pulls and pushes the components like piston, connecting rod and crankshaft. The crankshaft, in turn, is connected to the transmission system and is a critical component from the design perspective. The design of the crankshaft can be done in a justifiable manner if an attempt is made to identify the effects of the operating loads on the component in the form of the type of stress induced with its peak value and the location of these stresses over the component. This study consists of two major sections, Finite Element Analysis and Optimization for mass reduction. In this dissertation work, 3 -D finite element analysis is planned to be carried out by virtue of static stress analysis of crankshaft. Alternatives for Design would be suggested while attempting to modify the geometry of the Crankshaft by changing the different parameter.
