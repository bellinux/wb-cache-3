Eventually, the destination node's borrowed channel timer will expire, {{causing it to}} tune back to the primary channel.|$|R

5|$|The 189th Infantry Brigade {{was first}} {{constituted}} and activated on 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves, and {{assigned to the}} 95th Division. The brigade was organized in 1922 at Muskogee, Oklahoma. However, {{it would never be}} mobilized for World War I, and thus <b>never</b> <b>received</b> participation credit for the action. It would stay active as a reserve brigade for the interwar period, but it would never be used.|$|E

5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he <b>never</b> <b>received</b> the large funeral and the {{temporary}} location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting place. His body was lost in the fire {{at the end of the}} 18th century, which also prevents a modern reexamination of the cause of his death.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Tenney {{worked for the}} Equitable Life Insurance Society and continued writing for The New York Times. In 1912, he was vice-president of the Usher–Stoughton shoe manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts; later, he formed the Tenney–Spinney Shoe Company in partnership with Henry Spinney. He was balloted for the National Baseball Hall of Fame from 1936–1942 and again in 1946, but <b>never</b> <b>received</b> more than eight votes, receiving eight (3.1% of total ballots cast) during the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting in 1938. Tenney died on July 3, 1952 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long illness. He was interred at Harmony Chapel and Cemetery in Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson <b>never</b> <b>received</b> formal training, {{he still}} {{possesses}} a wide vocal range which was trademarked by his quasi-operatic tenor. Along with Ronnie James Dio and Rob Halford, Dickinson {{is one of}} the pioneers of the operatic vocal style later to be adopted by power metal vocalists and regularly appears near the top in lists of the greatest rock vocalists/front-men of all time. Dickinson says that his style was influenced primarily by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill (Van der Graaf Generator), Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) and Ian Gillan (Deep Purple).|$|E
5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has <b>never</b> <b>received</b> the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E

5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has <b>never</b> <b>received</b> a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, she had <b>never</b> <b>received</b> a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her {{unofficial}} {{status and the}} unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{high-profile}} start of Henry's cultus, {{it took more}} than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Linköping seems to have {{played a key role in}} establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry <b>never</b> <b>received</b> the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{international}}-class chess at the strong London 1932 tournament, which World Champion Alexander Alekhine won. Milner-Barry's best results in international competition were achieved in three straight {{years at the}} Margate tournaments from 1937–39, and at Hastings 1938. In all four events he finished just above the middle against strong fields, with performance ratings (as calculated by Chessmetrics) between 2538 and 2565. This places him at a solid International Master standard, although he <b>never</b> <b>received</b> this title. He reached as high as No. 65 in the world between June and August 1941, according to Chessmetrics, which ranks historical chess performances retrospectively, using modern algorithms.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they <b>never</b> <b>received</b> the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
50|$|A feminist {{perspective}} might criticise his {{separation of}} spheres of justice. For {{people who are}} not engaged in one sphere, they can <b>never</b> <b>receive</b> their 'just' distribution in reference to their needs or deserts. For example, a person with no family or close friends may not belong to any 'solidaristic community' willing to distribute to compensate for their 'needs' beyond those which their position as a citizen will confer. A person who has never and will never work (home-makers, severely disabled people) will <b>never</b> <b>receive</b> 'dues' for the labour or activity which they do engage with.|$|R
