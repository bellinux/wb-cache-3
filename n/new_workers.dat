5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that <b>new</b> <b>workers</b> {{would be able to}} fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Following the ruling, {{the company}} barred the union from soliciting new {{members on the}} company {{property}} and began offering incentives to <b>new</b> <b>workers</b> to sign contracts wherein they promised not to join the union. The AASEREA objected to the company's policy and the prior agreement required the Public Service Commission rule on the matter. The commission sided with the company on both issues on August 26, 1914 and barred union solicitation on company property, and upheld {{the right of the}} company to hire non-union employees.|$|E
5|$|As the {{industrialisation}} of {{the valleys}} began {{there was little}} shift {{in the use of}} Welsh as a first language. Initial immigrants were Welsh and {{it was not until the}} 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, but it wasn't these <b>new</b> <b>workers</b> who changed the language; the erosion of Welsh had already begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars, and that Welsh was a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity. In 1901 35.4% of Rhondda workers spoke only English but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1%, while Welsh speaking monoglots had dropped from 11.4% to 4.4% in the same period.|$|E

5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with <b>new</b> <b>workers,</b> or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, a large plot of {{land was}} sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the {{construction}} of 1,200houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of <b>new</b> <b>workers.</b> Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of <b>new</b> <b>workers</b> migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E

40|$|The Assembly lines {{typically}} employ {{dozens and}} sometime hundreds of workers. So absenteeism and turnover are encountered daily in these lines. This research analyzes {{the impact of}} absenteeism and turnover in assembly and production lines of mixed model mass production. It shows that model sequencing policy has very {{significant effect on the}} line's throughput. Replacing an experienced absent <b>worker</b> by a <b>new</b> one in a station results in a learning curve of the <b>new</b> <b>worker.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>worker</b> starts slowly and has a good chance of becoming a bottle-neck and dictating the pace for all the line. In that case, the throughput {{at the end of the}} line mirrors the <b>new</b> <b>worker</b> learning curve. In mixed model assembly lines the work in some stations varies according to the arriving model. A <b>new</b> replacement <b>worker</b> at such a station has slower learning process due to the less repetitive work. Still, there are typically many work elements that are common to all the models; there may be work elements that are only missing in one model, etc. We show how to compute the station's learning curve in such cases. A small case study shows that sustitute workers generate smaller throughput on mixed model lines than on a single model line...|$|R
