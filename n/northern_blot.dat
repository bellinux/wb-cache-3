25|$|Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively {{measured}} by northern blotting, which provides size and sequence {{information about the}} mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an autoradiograph. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern blotting are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in {{an image of a}} gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.|$|E
25|$|To {{localize}} INMT, {{a qualitative}} leap is accomplished {{with use of}} modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT {{to be present in}} large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland.|$|E
2500|$|PCR allows rapid {{production}} of short pieces of DNA, even when {{not more than}} the sequence of the two primers is known. [...] This ability of PCR augments many methods, such as generating hybridization probes for Southern or <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization. [...] PCR supplies these techniques with large amounts of pure DNA, sometimes as a single strand, enabling analysis even from very small amounts of starting material.|$|E
5000|$|Analysis of gene {{expression}} {{can be done}} by several different methods including RT-PCR, RNase protection assays, microarrays, RNA-Seq, serial analysis of {{gene expression}} (SAGE), as well as <b>northern</b> <b>blotting.</b> [...] Microarrays are quite commonly used and are usually consistent with data obtained from northern blots; however, at times <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> is able to detect small changes in gene expression that microarrays cannot. [...] The advantage that microarrays have over <b>northern</b> <b>blots</b> is that thousands of genes can be visualized at a time, while <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> is usually looking at one or a small number of genes.|$|R

[...] <b>Northern</b> <b>blots</b> can be searched by a blot ID, paper reference, gene identifier, or by tissue. [...] The results of a search provide the blot ID, species, tissue, gene, expression level, blot image (if available), and links to the publication that the work originated from.

40|$|We {{introduce}} here {{an alternative}} to conventional <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> that requires only minute amounts of RNA. This has been achieved by modification of methods currently used for the mapping of mRNA 5 â€²-terminal ends. The terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated G-tailing, cap finder, ligation-anchored and RNA ligase-mediated approaches followed by polymerase chain reaction protocols all produced high quality cDNAs in large amounts. These cDNAs could be separated by electrophoresis to obtain virtual <b>northern</b> <b>blots</b> that could replace con-ventional <b>northern</b> <b>blots.</b> All the essential information, including transcript length and the expression pattern, are preserved in these cDNAs, even if the transcripts are long or GC-rich. In addition, minute amounts of material (less than 100 cells) are sufficient to produce more than 100 virtual <b>northern</b> <b>blots,</b> making this approach extremely versatile...|$|R
2500|$|The name {{western blot}} is {{a play on}} the eponymously-named Southern blot, a {{technique}} for DNA detection developed earlier by Edwin Southern. Similarly, detection of RNA is termed <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> and was developed by James Alwine, David Kemp, and George Stark at Stanford. The term [...] "western blot" [...] {{was given to the}} technique by W. Neal Burnette, although the method itself originated in the laboratory of Harry Towbin at the Friedrich Miescher Institute.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> {{analysis}} {{found that}} miR-155 pri-miRNA was abundantly {{expressed in the}} human spleen and thymus and detectable in the liver, lung, and kidney. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments demonstrated that miR-155-5p was detectable in all human tissues investigated. Sequence analysis of small RNA clone libraries comparing miRNA expression to all other organ systems examined established that miR-155-5p was one of five miRNAs (i.e. miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223) that was specific for hematopoietic cells including B-cells, T-cells, monocytes and granulocytes. [...] Together {{these results suggest that}} miR-155-5p is expressed in a number of tissues and cell types and, therefore, may {{play a critical role in}} a wide variety of biological processes, including hematopoiesis ...|$|E
50|$|Reverse <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> {{much like}} the <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> upon which it is based, is used to {{determine}} levels of gene expression in particular tissues. In comparison to the <b>Northern</b> <b>blot,</b> the reverse <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> is able to probe {{a large number of}} transcripts at once with less specificity with regard to probes than is required for <b>Northern</b> <b>blot.</b> Often this will involve the use of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries or differential display to isolate differentially expressed transcripts and create bacterial clones containing inserts for these sequences. These will serve as the targets hybridized to the membrane and will be probed by sample RNA. Expression levels can be quantified by increase or decrease in fluorescent or radioactive signal over a control treatment. Bands or dots which appear darker and larger signify transcripts which are over-expressed in a sample of interest and lighter dots indicate that a transcript is down-regulated versus a control sample.|$|E
5000|$|A {{problem in}} <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> is often sample {{degradation}} by RNases (both endogenous to the sample and through environmental contamination), {{which can be}} avoided by proper sterilization of glassware {{and the use of}} RNase inhibitors such as DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate). [...] The chemicals used in most <b>northern</b> <b>blots</b> can be a risk to the researcher, since formaldehyde, radioactive material, ethidium bromide, DEPC, and UV light are all harmful under certain exposures. [...] Compared to RT-PCR, <b>northern</b> <b>blotting</b> has a low sensitivity, but it also has a high specificity, which is important to reduce false positive results.|$|R

30|$|To date, {{high-throughput}} sequencing {{has revealed}} thousands of predicted small RNAs; however, {{only a few}} of them have been characterized. Most researchers use isotope-labeled probes for small RNA detection and validation. Although biotin has been used in many fields, <b>Northern</b> <b>blots</b> using biotin-labeled probes have not been reported. In this study, we improved <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> with the use of biotin-labeled probes. <b>Northern</b> <b>blots</b> using RNA derived from both Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa were performed, and the results suggest that this improved method is both sensitive and efficient. Furthermore, biotin-labeled probes are more stable and safer for researchers and the environment than traditional probes. This protocol represents an important contribution to the small RNA field.|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of nm 23 -H 1 mRNA and protein was studied in colorectal cancers by <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> and immunohistochemistry. All 21 colorectal cancers studied by <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> had {{increased levels of}} nm 23 -H 1 mRNA relative to the adjacent normal colonic mucosa. Increased nm 23 -H 1 protein expression was also observed in all 36 colorectal cancer cases including those studied by <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting.</b> There was no significant correlation between nm 23 -H 1 expression and tumour histology, serosal invasion, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or lymph node metastasis. However, the {{expression of}} both mRNA and protein was significantly lower in tumours associated with liver metastasis than in those without such metastasis.

50|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1977, <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> {{had been used}} extensively for RNA quantification despite its shortcomings: (a) time-consuming technique, (b) requires a large quantity of RNA for detection, and (c) quantitatively inaccurate in the low abundance of RNA content. However, the discovery of reverse transcriptase during the study of viral replication of genetic material {{led to the development}} of RT-PCR, which has since displaced <b>Northern</b> <b>blot</b> as the method of choice for RNA detection and quantification.|$|E
50|$|The reverse <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> is {{a method}} by which gene {{expression}} patterns may be analyzed by comparing isolated RNA molecules from a tester sample to samples in a control cDNA library.

A reverse <b>northern</b> <b>blot</b> can be used to profile expression levels of particular sets of RNA sequences in a tissue or to determine presence of a particular RNA sequence in a sample. Although DNA Microarrays and newer next-generation techniques have generally supplanted reverse northern blotting, it is still utilized today and provides a relatively cheap and easy means of defining expression of large sets of genes.|$|E

Because the low abundance of small RNAs can be problematic for detection via <b>northern</b> <b>blotting,</b> some researchers have enriched small RNAs using LiCl or other methods (Song et al, [2012]). Although isotope labeling is often inconvenient, hazardous and restricted by many institutions, this classic method {{is still the most}} popular method for investigating the expression of small RNAs. Several improvements have been made to traditional <b>Northern</b> <b>blotting</b> protocols, and non-isotopic-labeling methods using digoxigenin (DIG) represent a safe alternative for the detection of small RNAs (Ramkissoon et al, [2006]).
