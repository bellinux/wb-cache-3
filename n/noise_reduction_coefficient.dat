40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of new type of composite materials based on multilayer concept. The multilayer composites were mainly composed of waste fibre based nonwoven fabrics, woven glass fibres and wood layers. Each of these layers was designed to operate with different functionalities; but when these layers were combined into a single composite, these functionalities were expected to work together. This particular aspect allowed to develop a single structure for fire doors (fire resistance time of more than 90 min), as well as to get a better acoustic insulation behaviour (up to 47 dB). The multilayer structure was comprised of different layers such as MDF panels (2 mm), woven glass fibre layer (220 and 400 g/m 2), wood materials (10 mm), woven glass fibre (220 and 400 g/m 2) and waste fibre based no-woven fabrics (3 different types). Composite panels were produced using these combinations in a compression moulding machine using two types of thermosetting resin systems. Acoustic insulation behaviour of these composites was characterized using a method similar to the one applied in the EN ISO 140 - 3 standard. In this testing method, a white noise was applied in an insulated chamber and the noise level (in decibels, dB) for various frequencies was measured in the first and second compartments of the chamber. The difference between the noises measured in those two compartments, called the <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> (α), was used to assess the acoustic insulation behaviour. It was observed that a good <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> (up to 47 dB) was observed in case of developed composite materials at 500 Hz frequency. It was also observed that increasing the thickness of the panels was not found beneficial for sound reduction capacity and the use of non-woven fabrics in the panel increased the <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> significantly...|$|E

The MVDR beamformer can be used for both speech dereverberation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> This paper provides new insights into the MVDR beamformer. Specifically, the local and global behavior of the MVDR beamformer is analyzed and novel forms of the MVDR filter are derived and discussed. In earlier works it was observed that there is a tradeoff between the amount of speech derever-beration and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> when the MVDR beamformer is used. Here, the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> is analyzed thoroughly. The local and global behavior, as well as the tradeoff, is analyzed for different noise fields such as, for example, a mixture of coherent and non-coherent noise fields, entirely non-coherent noise fields and diffuse noise fields. It is shown that maximum <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> is achieved when the MVDR beamformer is used for <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> only. The amount of <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> that is sacrificed when complete dereverber-ation is required depends on the direct-to-reverberation ratio of the acoustic impulse response between the source and the reference microphone. The performance evaluation supports the theoretical analysis and demonstrates the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> When desiring both speech dereverberation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction,</b> the results also demonstrate that the amount of <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> that is sacrificed decreases when the number of microphones increases.

Enhanced Egg Carton – Dry and Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet were tested based on the ASTM C 423 - 02 method of sound absorption measurement. Enhanced Egg Carton – Dry has a <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 6 and a sound absorption average of 0. 59, while Enhanced Egg Carton – Wet has a <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 54 and sound absorption average of 0. 54.

It has been extensively used as decoration element in Malay architecture especially in palaces, mosques, public building and some houses. The important aspect focused on this DPCWP is its ability to act as sound absorber. The sound absorption coefficient (SAC) an, of wood perforated wall panel with uniform and small geometric patterns at 1 kHz to 4 kHz frequency band shall be improved optimally through the contribution of perforation ratio and resonance frequencies. From previous findings, the hypothesis is that wood perforated wall panel with uniform small geometric patterns gives good sound absorption performance at 1 kHz to 4 kHz frequency region. Two patterns of DPCWP are designed using resonance frequency technique at 1 / 3 octave centre frequency from 1. 6 kHz to 5 kHz with perforation ratio in the range of 35 % to 40 % and have been successfully investigated. Simulation process is carried out using BEASY acoustics software, which is an established numerical modelling tool for Boundary Element Method (BEM) works. Numerical modelling based on BEM has been widely used for engineering design and prediction. Results show that it has almost the same trend with those in previous results. However, at frequency 1 kHz to 4 kHz, an results show an increment to the higher an compared to the previous results which are show small an values at the same frequencies. The higher an phenomena at high frequencies shown by the best samples, S 5 and S 7 are due to resonance frequency inside the air column in DPCWP apertures. <b>Noise</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> (NRC) calculated in the region of 0. 75 to 0. 95 prove that DPCWP with uniform and small geometric pattern able to act as good sound absorber.

40|$|Abstract—Noise reduction, {{which aims}} at {{estimating}} a clean speech from a noisy observation, {{has long been}} an active research area. The standard approach to this problem is to obtain the clean speech estimate by linearly filtering the noisy signal. The core issue, then, becomes how to design an optimal linear filter that can significantly suppress noise without introducing perceptually noticeable speech distortion. Traditionally, the optimal noise-re-duction filters are formulated in either the time or the frequency domains. This paper studies the problem in the Karhunen–Loève expansion domain. We develop two classes of optimal filters. The first class achieves a frame of speech estimate by filtering the corresponding frame of the noisy speech. We will show that many existing methods such as the widely used Wiener filter and subspace technique are closely related to this category. The second class obtains <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> by filtering not only the current frame, but also a number of previous consecutive frames of the noisy speech. We will discuss how to design the optimal noise-reduction filters in each class and demonstrate, through both theoretical analysis and experiments, the properties of the deduced optimal filters.

40|$|Abstract—Noise reduction, {{which aims}} at {{estimating}} a clean speech from noisy observations, {{has attracted a}} considerable amount of research and engineering attention over the past few decades. In the single-channel scenario, an estimate of the clean speech can be obtained by passing the noisy signal picked up by the microphone through a linear filter/transformation. The core issue, then, is how to find an optimal filter/transformation such that, after the filtering process, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved but the desired speech signal is not noticeably distorted. Most of the existing optimal filters (such as the Wiener filter and subspace transformation) are formulated from the mean-square error (MSE) criterion. However, with the MSE formulation, many desired properties of the optimal noise-reduction filters such as the SNR behavior cannot be seen. In this paper, we present a new criterion based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). We show that in the context of <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> the squared PCC (SPCC) has many appealing properties and can be used as an optimization cost function to derive many optimal and suboptimal noise-reduction filters. The clear advantage of using the SPCC over the MSE is that the noise-reduction performance (in terms of the SNR improvement and speech distortion) of the resulting optimal filters can be easily analyzed. This shows that, as far as <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> is concerned, the SPCC-based cost function serves as a more natural criterion to optimize as compared to the MSE.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [96]- 99) This thesis employs line spectral pairs (LSP) for {{acoustic echo}} cancellation (AEC) and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> LSP <b>coefficients</b> possess several important properties which make them attractive {{for use in}} speech enhancement and speech coding techniques, such as adaptive Wiener filtering and QCELP vocoder. Since LSP parameters have been computed for transmission in QCELP, these coefficients {{can be applied to}} an acoustic echo canceler. In conventional acoustic echo cancellation, the system attempts to model the acoustic echo path with far-end talking exclusively. During double-talk, the adaptive filter coefficients are frozen to prevent the echo canceler from being affected by the near-end?s signal. In order to obtain the best near-end speech quality, two conditions have to be assumed that (1) the echo path will not change during double-talk; (2) the adaptive filter has already converged to optimal value. These two conditions are not always satisfied, especially in a moving automobile. If the phase of the echo path changing or a impulse response shift occurs, the near-end speech will be seriously degraded. Therefore, a new echo canceler is proposed in which an adaptive Wiener filter is added during double-talk. Inter- and intra-frame spectral constraints are applied to LSP coefficients to ensure convergence to reasonable values and hence lead to improved speech quality. The basis of these evaluation involved comparisons of results from conventional schemes to from the new algorithm with near-end speech degraded by acoustic echo. Noticeable quality improvement can be observed by the new algorithm with echo path changing. Furthermore, a new echo canceler is designed to integrate acoustic echo cancellation with <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> The algorithm is evaluated over different signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio condition. Different measure methods (Itakura distance, segment SNR and informal listening tests) are used to verify it.

The foams show a significant improvement in sound absorption compared with close-celled Al foams, because of their high flow resistance.

30|$|This section {{proposes a}} test that {{addresses}} the stated requirement. Since {{the scope of this}} article is limited to steady-state responses of modulation-based <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> subsystems, we will not cover the verification of a transient <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> subsystem here. Rather, we show how to test that the traditional <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> subsystem has maintained its steady-state performance after a short intervention of a superposed transient <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> subsystem.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> {{problem in the}} Karhunen-Loève {{expansion}} (KLE) domain from a multichannel perspective. Based on formulations proposed {{for the design of}} optimal single-channel <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> in the KLE domain, we formulate the multichannel <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> in the KLE domain. Two different performance measures are presented: the <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> and speech distortion. The optimal multichannel Wiener filter is derived and its performance in terms of <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> and speech distortion is compared with the performance of the optimal single-channel Wiener filter. Experimental results show that a significant improvement in performance is obtained when using multiple microphone signals. The multichannel Wiener filter results also in better <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> in the presence of coherent noise sources...|$|R
