As the show built towards its thirtieth anniversary in 2016, Hossington revealed {{in an interview that}} the special episode will do something [...] "no other show has done before." [...] In the interview, Hossington said: [...] "I'm very keen to make it a big event! We spoke about live episodes and things like that, but we decided that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> were satisfying as they've all been done. What we're doing, no other show has done before..." [...] Producer of Holby City, Simon Harper, also announced in an interview plans for a crossover event with sister show Holby City in celebration for Casualty's thirtieth anniversary. It was later revealed by Charles Venn in an interview with What's on TV on 8 June 2016, that his character, Nurse Jacob Masters, would be {{at the forefront of the}} anniversary episode. Venn said in the interview his character would play [...] "an integral part" [...] in the 110-minute special anniversary episode. Venn also went on to say that the cast and crew brand the thirtieth anniversary episode Casualty: The Movie.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} later {{described}} by one journalist as [...] "the most pompous, overblown British rock {{record of the}} decade." [...] Anderson has said that its overblown sound was down to his use of psychedelic drugs. [...] "I was doing {{an awful lot of}} acid at the time, and I think it was this that gave us the confidence to push boundaries." [...] Anderson has said that he thrived on the surreal environment he lived in at the time; next door were a sect known as the Mennonites, who would often sing hymns during Anderson's drug binges. After the success of their debut album, Suede were hailed as the inventors of Britpop, something they were proud of for a short while. However, Britpop started to be dominated by the [...] "big four", who along with Suede, were Blur, Oasis and Pulp. This disgusted Anderson, who called Britpop [...] "horribly twisted, a musical Carry On film", and he began to distance himself from the scene. [...] "We {{could not have been more}} uninterested in that whole boozy, cartoon-like, fake working-class thing." [...] the singer said in 2008, [...] "As soon as we became aware of it, we went away and wrote Dog Man Star. You could not find a less Britpop record. It's tortured, epic, extremely sexual and personal. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> apply to Britpop." ...|$|E

6000|$|This was not {{the first}} time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of Lydgate's {{expenses}} being obviously too great to be met by his practice, but he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or expectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate's marriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the disappointment in his practice. One evening, when he took the pains to go to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he noticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy way of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he had anything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain biological views; but he had <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> definite <b>things</b> to say or to show which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such as he used himself to insist on, saying that [...] "there must be a systole and diastole in all inquiry," [...] and that [...] "a man's mind must be continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and the horizon of an object-glass." [...] That evening he seemed to be talking widely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long they went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond to give them music, sank back in his chair in silence, but with a strange light in his eyes. [...] "He may have been taking an opiate," [...] was a thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother's mind--"tic-douloureux perhaps--or medical worries." ...|$|R

60|$|Donkin's {{position}} in the forecastle was distinguished but unsafe. He stood on the bad eminence of a general dislike. He was left alone; and in his isolation he could do nothing but think of the gales of the Cape of Good Hope and envy us the possession of warm clothing and waterproofs. Our sea-boots, our oilskin coats, our well-filled sea-chests, were to him so many causes for bitter meditation: he had <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> and he felt instinctively that no man, when the need arose, would offer to share them with him. He was impudently cringing to us and systematically insolent to the officers. He anticipated the best results, for himself, from such a line of conduct--and was mistaken. Such natures forget that under extreme provocation men will be just--whether {{they want to be}} so or not. Donkin's insolence to long-suffering Mr. Baker became at last intolerable to us, and we rejoiced when the mate, one dark night, tamed him for good.|$|E

Variety of, and the terribleness that attends afflictions, call, {{not only for the}} beholding of things, but also a laying hold of them by faith and feeling; now this also is with God to the making of HIS to sing in the night. Paul and Silas sang in prison, the apostles went away from the council rejoicing, when they had shamefully beaten them for their preaching in the temple (Acts 5). But whence came this but from an inward feeling by faith of the love of God, and of Christ, which passeth knowledge? Hence he says to those under afflictions, [...] "Fear <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> which thou shalt suffer" [...] (Rev 2:10). There are things to be suffered, as well as places to suffer in; and there are things to be let into the soul for its emboldening, as well as things to be showed to it (Rom 5:5).|$|E
60|$|The {{persecution}} of Dioclesian {{began in the}} year of Christ 302, and lasted ten years in the Eastern Empire and two years in the Western. To this state of the Church the second Epistle, to the Church of Smyrna, agrees. I know, saith [2] Christ, thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, but thou art rich; and I know the blasphemy of them, which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Fear <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> which thou shalt suffer: Behold, the Devil shall call some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. The tribulation of ten days can agree to no other persecution than that of Dioclesian, it being the only persecution which lasted ten years. By the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan, I understand the Idolatry of the Nicolaitans, who falsly said they were Christians.|$|E

There was nothing to shoot at but rocks--he knew quite well that there would be nothing to shoot at but rocks--and he knew that artillery and rifles have no effect upon rocks. He was badly overloaded with unessentials. He had 8 Maxims--a Maxim is a kind of Gatling, I believe, and shoots about 500 bullets per minute; he had one 12 1/2-pounder cannon and two 7-pounders; also, 145,000 rounds of ammunition. He worked the Maxims so hard upon the rocks that five of them became disabled--five of the Maxims, not the rocks. It is believed that upwards of 100,000 rounds of ammunition of the various kinds were fired during the 21 hours that the battles lasted. One man killed. He must have been much mutilated. It was a pity to bring those futile Maxims along. Jameson should have furnished himself with a battery of Pudd'nhead Wilson maxims instead.
