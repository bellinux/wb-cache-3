2500|$|Craving has {{increasingly}} received attention {{as a critical}} phenomenon in addictive psychopathology. [...] Craving {{has been defined as}} [...] "the desire or the memory of a pleasant experience superimposed on a negative affective state". [...] Hence, conceptually, craving combines elements of desire/motivation and emotions. Pathologic gamblers with an addictive personality have been linked to high RD scores. Pathological gambling disorder (PGD) is defined as incessant and repetitive gambling behaviors that cause significant disruption in an individual's day-to-day life. The positive relation of gambling craving to depression and <b>negative</b> <b>relation</b> to reward dependence suggests that, individuals who have a lesser disposition to experience positive emotions are the ones who most miss gambling when abstaining. Meanwhile, pathologic gamblers seem to turn to gambling as a way to cope with depressive feelings and lack of positive experiences in life. Pathologic gamblers would potentially benefit from interventions targeting early relief of depression symptoms and replacement of the activity and joy once prompted by gambling.|$|E
2500|$|Anupalabdi (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. Anupalabdhi pramana {{suggests}} that knowing a negative, such as [...] "there is no jug in this room" [...] {{is a form}} of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means. In Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, a valid conclusion is either sadrupa (positive) or asadrupa (<b>negative)</b> <b>relation</b> - both correct and valuable. Like other pramana, Indian scholars refined Anupalabdi to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept [...] "non-perception" [...] as a pramana. Advaita considers this method as valid and useful when the other five pramanas fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth. A variation of Anupaladbi, called Abhava (अभाव) has also been posited as an epistemic method. It means non-existence. Some scholars consider Anupalabdi to be same as Abhava, while others consider Anupalabdi and Abhava as different. Abhava-pramana has been discussed in Advaita in the context of Padartha (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A Padartha is defined as that which is simultaneously Astitva (existent), Jneyatva (knowable) and Abhidheyatva (nameable). Abhava was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: dhvamsa (termination of what existed), atyanta-abhava (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), anyonya-abhava (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and pragavasa (prior, antecedent non-existence).|$|E

Little research has investigated these multiple relations. NSFH respondents aged 50 + with adult children (N = 2, 270) {{are used to}} assess patterns of quality and contact across multiple children in the same family. This illuminates mixed experiences, especially for lowest quality and contact across children, contributing to collective ambivalence in parent-adult child relations within families.

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted {{with the aim of}} examining the contribution of facets of the adjustment of mother and father for explaining the adolescents’ perception of <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> with parents. The following adjustment measures were used in this research: anxiety, hypersensitivity, inner coherence, interpersonal orientation and aggression of mother and father individually. The measures of negative interactions between adolescents and parents are conceptualized through the dimension of <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> with parents, which includes adolescents’ assessment regarding the rejection by father and mother and the assessment of <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> with father and mother. The {{research was}} conducted on a sample including 273 subjects in total: 47 female subjects, 44 male subjects and their parents. For testing the hypotheses, the multiple regression analysis was used. The obtained results show that adjustment facets are important predictors for explaining the perception of <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> with father. The facet of aggression stands as the most significant predictor among adjustment factors for the group of fathers. For the group of mothers, adjustment did not prove a significant predictor for explaining perception of <b>negative</b> <b>relations.</b> Possible explanations for a modest contribution of mother’s adjustment {{can be found in the}} possibility for the quality of family interactions with mother is more explained by an emotional relation that is established between her and the child in early childhood and does not change its quality at later development stages. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} {{of the theory of}} the natural rate of unemployment came in the 1960s where economists observed that the Phillips-curve relationship between inflation and unemployment began to break down.

This belief had the policy implication that unemployment could be permanently reduced by expansive demand policy and thus higher inflation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} how the {{semantics}} of conjunctions affects prosody across clauses/sentences. Nespor and Vogel (1986) observe that phonological rules across sentences may apply when {{there exists a}} positive semantic relation (i. e., and, therefore, because) between two sentences. The question is whether a positive semantic relation universally helps to join two prosodic domains. We conducted experiments to see whether {{this is the case}} in English and Japanese. The result shows that in English, a positive semantic relation helps to join two prosodic domains, but a <b>negative</b> semantic <b>relation</b> does not. However, the data show that in Japanese, a positive semantic relation does not help to join two prosodic domains any more than a <b>negative</b> semantic <b>relation.</b> In fact, in Japanese, two prosodic domains were more detached in the examples of positive semantic relations than in those of <b>negative</b> semantic <b>relations.</b> We discuss syntactic brackets, word/morpheme status of conjunctives and the semantic closeness of <b>negative</b> <b>relations.</b> 1...|$|R

5000|$|The {{two main}} capital {{structure}} theories as taught in corporate finance textbooks are the Pecking order {{theory and the}} Trade-off theory. The two theories make some contradicting predictions and for example Fama and French conclude: [...] "In sum, we identify one scar on the tradeoff model (the <b>negative</b> <b>relation</b> between leverage and profitability), one deep wound on the pecking order (the large equity issues of small low-leverage growth firms)...". The capital structure substitution theory {{has the potential to}} close these gaps. It predicts a <b>negative</b> <b>relation</b> between leverage and valuation (=reverse of earnings yield) which in turn can be linked to profitability. But it also predicts that high valued small growth firms will avoid the use of debt as especially for these companies the cost of borrowing ('''') is higher than for large companies, which in turn has a negative effect on their EPS. This is consistent with the finding that [...] "…firms with higher current stock prices (relative to their past stock prices, book values or earnings) are more likely to issue equity rather than debt and repurchase debt rather than equity".|$|E

The aim of the study was to find out the correlations between self-esteem, personality traits and the environmental determinants (support factors and risk factors) among juveniles (boys and girls). The total of 481 juveniles staying in Youth Educational Centers participated in the study. Applied research tools: The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (SES), in the Polish adaptation by I.

5000|$|An {{equation}} {{like the}} expectations-augmented Phillips curve also appears in many recent New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models.

This relationship is often called the [...] "New Keynesian Phillips curve". Like the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, the New Keynesian Phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily, but cannot lower it permanently.

50|$|The {{coping style}} most {{commonly}} associated with hardiness is that of transformational coping, an optimistic style of coping that transforms stressful events into less stressful ones.

At the level of action, individuals high in hardiness are believed to react to stressful events by increasing their interaction with them, trying {{to turn them into}} an advantage and opportunity for growth, and in the process achieve some greater understanding. In support of this notion, two studies have demonstrated that the effects of hardiness on symptoms of illness were partly mediated through the positive relation of hardiness to presumed beneficial coping styles and the <b>negative</b> <b>relation</b> to presumed harmful styles of coping.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{examined}} {{differences in}} the nature of friendship between adolescents with diabetes and healthy adolescents. We also examined whether friend support and <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> with friends were related to health for both groups. METHOD: We interviewed 127 adolescents with diabetes and 129 healthy adolescents on two occasions, separated by one year. We measured aspects of friendship and psychological health among both groups as well as self-care behavior and metabolic control among adolescents with diabetes. We used logistic regression analysis to predict the presence of friends, repeated measures analysis of covariance to predict changes in friendship over time, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to examine the relations of friendship to psychological health, self-care behavior, and metabolic control. RESULTS: Both groups of adolescents were equally likely to have a best friend and boyfriend/girlfriend, but healthy adolescents {{were more likely to have}} an other-gender friend. Adolescents with diabetes and healthy adolescents reported similar levels of friend support, but support increased over the year for healthy girls only. Boys with diabetes had the lowest levels of friend support. <b>Negative</b> <b>relations</b> with friends were inversely related to psychological health and predicted a decline in psychological health over time. <b>Negative</b> <b>relations</b> also predicted poor metabolic control and a deterioration of metabolic control over time. CONCLUSION: There are similarities and {{differences in the}} nature of friendship for adolescents with diabetes compared with healthy adolescents. Friendship serves a protective function for psychological health for both groups and has implications for physical health among those with diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Coexistence is a {{state of}} mind shared by society members who {{recognize}} the rights of another group to exist peacefully as a legitimate, equal partner with whom disagreements have to be resolved in nonviolent ways. Achieving coexistence is a great challenge because of the <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> between the two groups. These <b>negative</b> <b>relations,</b> the result of ethnocentric beliefs or intractable conflict, are widely shared and their abolition requires deep societal change. Education for coexistence plays an important function in this change. The article suggests that when <b>negative</b> <b>relations</b> are based on ethnocentrism, education for coexis-tence {{plays a major role in}} changing the nature of the relations. But when nega-tive relations derive from intergroup conflict, education for coexistence has less influence. Within the realm of intergroup relations, different concepts were offered to describe positively valued relations between groups. Among them are concepts like tolerance, multiculturalism, peace, reconciliation, and coexistence. In essence, they have been mostly used for describing desired states to which societies, nations, or states should aspire. The underlying assumption in developing these concepts has been that the system of intergroup relations currently prevailing in many countries is far from being satisfactory and there is a need to change them completely, or at least to improve them. Therefore, the term education has often been attached to these concepts (i. e., peace education, education for multiculturalism or education for coexistence) to describe active attempts to educate people to value and aspire to these states as well as to learn to live accordingly by acquiring corresponding ∗Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Daniel Bar-Tal, School o...|$|R
