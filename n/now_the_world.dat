In 1965 in Twickenham, the Federation was formally recognised as the International Governing Body for the sport. In 1969, the first European Championship was held in Paris and Paul Luxon of London was the winner at the age of 18. The ladies winner was Ute Czech from Germany.

The national team made its international debut against Denmark in 1989, playing as West Germany. It has since played regularly in European Cricket Championship tournaments, as well as twice in the lower divisions of the World Cricket League.

25|$|In 1963, Nicklaus won two of {{the four}} major championships—the Masters and the PGA Championship. These {{victories}} made him the then-youngest winner of the Masters and third-youngest winner of the PGA Championship, and each win came in just his second year as a professional. Earlier in 1963, Nicklaus injured his left hip playing an approach shot from the rough—an injury that would manifest itself years later. Ironically, Nicklaus credits this injury with assisting him in altering his swing heading into the 1963 Masters, thus allowing him to play a draw more easily. Along with three other wins including the Tournament of Champions, he placed second to Arnold Palmer on the PGA Tour money list with just over $100,000. He also teamed with Palmer to win the Canada Cup (<b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup of Golf) in France, representing the United States (this event was shortened to 63 holes due to heavy fog). Nicklaus also finished as low individual scorer for that event.|$|E
25|$|The ICC Trophy (<b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup Qualifier) {{commenced}} in 1979 as {{the first}} World Cup qualifying tournament for ICC associate members. Bermuda made the semi-finals that year, and at 1982 edition made the final, losing to Zimbabwe. However, the side did not qualify for the World Cup, as it featured only one associate qualifier. By {{the time of the}} 2005 ICC Trophy, the number of associate qualifiers had been increased to six. By making the semi-finals that year, Bermuda qualified for the 2007 World Cup, becoming the smallest country to do so (both in terms of population and area). The team also received One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status until 2009. However, Bermuda performed poorly both at the World Cup and in subsequent ODI series, and after the 2009 World Cup Qualifier was relegated to the 2011 World Cricket League Division Two tournament. The team has since dropped two more divisions, with its next World Cricket League tournament being the 2018 Division Four event.|$|E
25|$|Lashkari studied {{chemical}} {{engineering at the}} University of Leeds in Yorkshire, England, before eventually relocating to the United States. He settled in Southern California, and played club cricket for the Pasadena Cricket Club. Lashkari made his international debut for the U.S. national team in September 1963, in an Auty Cup fixture against Canada in Toronto. In 1968, he was selected for an American tour of England, during which the U.S. played mostly against minor counties. After that tour, his matches for the United States mainly came against Canada, {{with the exception of}} a 1973 match against Ireland. At the age of 44, Lashkari was appointed captain of the U.S. for the 1979 ICC Trophy in England, the inaugural edition of what is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup Qualifier. In the three matches where play was possible (the match against the Netherlands being washed out), he scored three runs against Israel, 16 against Sri Lanka, and 73 against Wales. Lashkari's son, Neil Lashkari, played alongside his father at the 1979 ICC Trophy, and appeared in another three editions of the tournament.|$|E

[...] The court of law had become the scene of humor and frivolity; the learned judge had shown himself to be as fickle as the defendant, and the justice system turned out to be flawed by human frailty.

2500|$|SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, {{head of the}} Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA), convened {{what became}} known after the war as the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 at a villa, am Grossen Wannsee No. 56/58, in Berlin's Wannsee suburb. It had been {{scheduled}} for 9 December 1941, and invitations had been sent on 29 November, {{but it had been}} postponed. Christian Gerlach argues that Hitler announced his decision to annihilate the Jews on or around 12 December 1941, probably on 12 December during a speech to Nazi party leaders. This was one day after he declared war on the United States and five days after the attack on Pearl Harbour by Japan. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, noted of Hitler's speech: [...] "He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their destruction.... <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> war has come.

2500|$|In the 1950s {{there was}} a fuel {{shortage}} in the new Israeli state, and the government forbade heating water between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. As the situation worsened, engineer Levi Yissar proposed that instead {{of the construction of}} more electrical generation plants, homes should switch to solar water heaters. [...] He built a prototype in his home, and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters. [...] By 1967 around one in twenty households heated its water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. [...] However, cheap oil from Iran and from oil fields captured in the Six-Day War made Israeli electricity cheaper and the demand for solar heaters [...] dropped. [...] After the energy crisis in the 1970s, in 1980 the Israeli Knesset passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> leader in the use of solar energy per capita (3% of the primary national energy consumption).|$|E
