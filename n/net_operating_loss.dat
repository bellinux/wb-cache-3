25|$|Under the rules, {{investors who}} do not sue Madoff or other parties will be allowed a theft-loss {{deduction}} for the 2008 tax year, equal to 95 percent of their total investment, including all fictitious earnings credited to their accounts on which they were taxed, but less any withdrawals, or actual or potential recoveries from SIPC or their own insurance. Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they might have the possibility of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>loss,</b> which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years.

Finally, the Article will propose an amendment to section 382 that would increase the likelihood that corporations will be allowed to retain their <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>losses</b> following bankruptcy. This amendment would improve the success rate of Chapter 11 bankruptcies, effectuate the legislative policies underlying section 382, and reduce the devastating economic impact of corporate liquidations...|$|R
25|$|Conrail was {{incorporated}} in Pennsylvania on October 25, 1974, and operations began April 1, 1976. The government owned 85% with employees owning the remaining 15%. The {{theory was that}} if the service was improved through increased capital investment, the economic basis of the railroad would be improved. During its first seven years, Conrail proved to be highly unprofitable, despite receiving {{billions of dollars of}} assistance from Congress. The corporation declared enormous losses on its federal income tax returns from 1976 through 1982, resulting in an accumulated <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>loss</b> of $2.2 billion during that period. Congress once again reacted with support by passing the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 (NERSA), which amended portions of the 3R Act by exempting Conrail from liability for any state taxes and requiring the Secretary of Transportation to make arrangements for the sale of the government's interest in Conrail. After NERSA was implemented, Conrail, under the aggressive leadership of L. Stanley Crane began to improve and reported taxable income between $2 million and $314 million each year from 1983 through 1986.|$|E
