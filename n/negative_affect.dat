25|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> {{and substance use}} disorders {{has been the most}} widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a coping (psychology) mechanism. Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once physical dependence has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders (anxiety) most commonly report high levels of <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> associated with cravings. The {{relationship between}} <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> and addiction is not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation of substance use, the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.|$|E
25|$|N - Neuroticism/Stability: Neuroticism or emotionality is {{characterized}} by high levels of <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> such as depression and anxiety. Neuroticism, according to Eysenck's theory, is based on activation thresholds in the sympathetic nervous system or visceral brain. This {{is the part of}} the brain that is responsible for the fight-or-flight response in the face of danger. Activation can be measured by heart rate, blood pressure, cold hands, sweating and muscular tension (especially in the forehead). Neurotic people — who have low activation thresholds, and unable to inhibit or control their emotional reactions, experience <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> (fight-or-flight) in the face of very minor stressors — are easily nervous or upset. Emotionally stable people — who have high activation thresholds and good emotional control, experience <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> only in the face of very major stressors — are calm and collected under pressure.|$|E
25|$|COAs {{perceptions}} of their parents drinking habits influence their own future drinking patterns and are developed at an early age. Alcohol related expectancies are correlated with parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse among their offspring. Problem solving discussions in families with an alcoholic parent contained more negative family interactions than in families with non-alcoholics parents. Several factors related to parental alcoholism influence COA substance abuse including stress, <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> and decreased parental monitoring. Impaired parental monitoring and <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> correlate with COAs associating with peers that support drug use.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} the trajectories and within-person synergies of psychological processes during {{the final stages of}} matches. A process-oriented approach was used with nine women elite fencers during an international competition. Multiple assessments of perceived control, threat and challenge appraisals, problem-and emotion-focused coping, positive and <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> were completed after each touches using video recall method. Multilevel growth curve analyses (MGCAs) indicated that winning and losing matches were each characterised by distinct psychological processes. Specifically, perceived control, challenge appraisal, problem-and emotion-focused coping, and positive affects increased linearly and threat appraisal decreased linearly for wining matches, whereas <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> increased linearly for losing matches. Regarding the within-person synergies of psychological processes, MGCAs indicated that (1) perceived control and challenge appraisal were significantly associated with problem-and emotion-focused coping for losing matches, the strength of these associations remaining consistent across touches; (2) problem-focused coping was significantly associated with <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> whereas emotion-focused coping was significantly associated with positive affects for winning matches, the strength of these associations remaining consistent across touches; and (3) problem-and emotion-focused coping were significantly associated with <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> for losing matches, the linear trajectory of <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> accelerating at times when athletes had higher levels of emotion-focused coping. Overall, this study provided insights into transactional processes during competition...|$|R
50|$|Affect management: The {{onset of}} {{powerful}} emotions {{can cause a}} stronger affect, ranging from joy to sorrow or even to embarrassment. Some of the behaviors associated with <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> include decreased time of gaze and awkwardly long pauses during conversations. When this happens, {{it is common for}} the individuals to try and decrease any <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> and subsequently strengthen positive affects (Edelman & Iwawaki, 1987).|$|R

25|$|Both high RD and RI {{individuals}} {{are found to}} have difficulty in making decisions that have future consequences. Individuals high in RD experience greater reinforcement when initially engaging in the addictive behaviour, and experience stronger conditioned associations with continued use. Individuals high in RI experience greater difficulty resisting cravings {{even in the face}} of negative consequences. Some moderators of RD and RI on the severity of addiction are stress and <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> (such as feeling depressed). That is, individuals high in RD/RI who also experience high levels of <b>negative</b> <b>affect</b> or stress, present more severe addictive behaviours. For example, if an individual is experiencing emotional distress, the distress experienced may lessen impulse control if they believe that engaging in addictive behaviour will decrease <b>negative</b> <b>affect.</b> According to this model, adolescents who are high in RI are at greater risk for developing addictions. Interestingly, low RI has been shown to moderate some of the risk of addiction due to family history. High RI for individual without a family history of addiction has been related to poor decision-making.|$|E
25|$|There are two higher-order {{factors that}} both {{taxonomies}} clearly share: extraversion and neuroticism.

25|$|The Tripartite {{model of}} {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{is a theory}} developed by Diener which describes how people experience {{the quality of their}} lives and includes both emotional reactions and cognitive judgments. Psychologists have defined happiness as a combination of life satisfaction and the relative frequency of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>affect.</b> SWB therefore encompasses moods and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life. Concepts encompassed by SWB include positive and <b>negative</b> <b>affect,</b> happiness, and life satisfaction. Positive psychology is particularly concerned with the study of SWB. SWB tends to be stable over time and is strongly related to personality traits. There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness, and {{a number of studies have}} found that positive emotions and optimism can have a beneficial influence on health.|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients with {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} (BPD) suffer from instability of their relationships, their affectivity and their identity. The {{purpose of the}} study was to investigate <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> and identity disturbance in patients with BPD and in patients without personality disorder using questionnaire data and interview data. Sampling and Methods: Twelve patients with BPD and 12 patients with major depressive disorder without any personality disorder were assessed with the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO) and questionnaires (Inventory of Personality Organization, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). They were compared with respect to the frequency of negative affective verbal expressions using computerized content analysis methods. Results: BPD patients showed higher levels of anxiety, depression and identity diffusion in the questionnaires than major depressive disorder patients without personality disorder. However, they did not report more negative affective expressions in the interview. Patients with identity disturbance of both groups showed higher values of negative mood in the questionnaires, but less anger, less anxiety and less affective intensity in the interview. Conclusion: The preliminary findings indicate that patients with identity disturbance show high levels of <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> in questionnaires but only few <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> in the interview situation. More studies are needed to enhance the understanding of <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> and identity disturbance in BPD.

25|$|The nerve impulses of the {{nociception}} response may {{be conducted}} to the brain thereby registering the location, intensity, quality and unpleasantness of the stimulus.

40|$|Much {{research}} has focused on how the amygdala processes individual affects, yet little is known about how multiple types of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> are encoded relative to one another at the single-cell level. In particular, it is unclear whether different <b>negative</b> <b>affects,</b> such as fear and disgust, are encoded more similarly than <b>negative</b> and positive <b>affects,</b> such as fear and pleasure. Here we test the hypothesis that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), a region known to be important for learned fear and other affects, encodes affective valence by comparing neuronal activity in the BLA during a conditioned fear stimulus (fear CS) with activity during intraoral delivery of an aversive fluid that induces a disgust response and a rewarding fluid that induces a hedonic response. Consistent with the hypothesis, neuronal activity during the fear CS and aversive fluid infusion, but not during the fear CS and rewarding fluid infusion, was more similar than expected by chance. We also found that the greater similarity in activity during the fear- and disgust-eliciting stimuli was specific to a subpopulation of cells and a limited window of time. Our results suggest that a subpopulation of BLA neurons encodes affective valence during learned fear, and furthermore, within this subpopulation, different <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> ar...|$|R

When produced in normal levels, norepinephrine creates a sense of well-being, but low levels of norepinephrine cause symptoms of depression, lack of arousal and lack of motivation.

25|$|A general {{inability}} to control affective states may impair the conditioning of behaviour associated with rewards and punishment, may increase susceptibility to biasing by substance-related cues, and could tax self-regulatory capacity. Such conditions may render individuals unable to interrupt automatic drug-seeking behaviours.

For example, high positive affect may interact with low effortful control in increasing risk of addiction amongst vulnerable populations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} integrates three concepts (personality, family correlates {{and emotion}} regulation) in a predictive model of wellbeing. We measured {{the impact of}} the personality structure, the adult attachment style, the style for socializing internalizing and externalizing emotions and the emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) on general wellbeing. A set of eight self-administered scales were filled up by 516 subjects, aged between 14 and 34 (M = 18. 62; SD = 3. 32). The results show that emotional stability predicts wellbeing on all four dimensions: positive <b>affects,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>affects,</b> emotional distress and life satisfaction. Emotion regulation strategies are predictors for (positive and <b>negative)</b> <b>affects</b> only, and not for emotional distress or life satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the emotional triggers of comfort food consumption can reliably be predicted by factors tied to <b>affect</b> asymmetry whereby <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> dominate one’s experience, decision making and behaviors in some instances while positive emotions prevail in others. Specifically, we relate three of these factors (age, gender, and culture) to differences in the emotional triggers of comfort food consumption and we further explore {{the possibility that the}} type of food eaten during comfort-seeking episodes can also be tied to affect asymmetry. Two hundred and seventy-seven participants completed a web-based survey conducted to assess the emotional antecedents and consequences of comfort food consumption. Consistent with expectations, results indicate that men’s comfort food consumption was motivated by positive emotions whereas women’s consumption was triggered by <b>negative</b> <b>affects.</b> Consumption of comfort foods alleviated women’s negative emotions but also produced guilt. Positive affect was a particularly powerful trigger of comfort food consumption for older participants and for participants with French cultural background. Younger participants and participants with English background reported more intense negative emotions prior to consuming comfort foods. Foods high in sugar and fat content were more efficient in alleviating <b>negative</b> <b>affects</b> whereas low-calorie foods were more efficient in increasing positive emotions...|$|R
25|$|Longitudinal {{studies have}} {{suggested}} adverse working conditions {{can contribute to the}} development of psychological distress. Psychological distress refers to <b>negative</b> <b>affect,</b> without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and anxiety symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. Job satisfaction is also related to negative health outcomes.|$|E
