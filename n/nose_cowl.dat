50|$|The Sonerai I {{design and}} {{construction}} started in 1970 {{with the goal of}} a flying aircraft to be demonstrated at the 1971 EAA airshow. The aircraft was to meet the new Formula V rules. Inspired by the Spitfire, an elliptical tail profile was incorporated. Elliptical wingtips and a low-wing configuration was dropped, but a low-wing Sonerai II variant was released later. The Sonerai I was designed to use a direct drive 1,600cc VW engine and the Sonerai II was designed to use the 1700cc VW engine. The wings were designed to fold alongside the fuselage for towing without a trailer and compact storage. The Sonerai II was designed to be soloed from the rear seat. The aircraft is built around a fabric covered steel tube fuselage with all aluminum wings and a fiberglass <b>nose</b> <b>cowl.</b> The plans cost $50 and $57 in 1974.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Thermal anti-icing systems are commonly used to protect aircraft leading edges from a potentially hazardous build-up of ice. Such systems have proven reliable in service and are relatively cheap and efficient. Typically, hot air is tapped from the engine compressor and ducted (via a regulation and control system) to the surface to be protected. Ideally an optimisation process should be employed {{at the design stage}} in order to ensure adequate anti-icing capability with minimal use of engine bleed air, since the latter represents a performance penalty. Following submission by the author of an MSc thesis concerning thermal modelling of a hot air anti-icing system for a civil turbofan intake (Wade 67), it became clear that extension of the studies was necessary to enable systematic accounting of the factors which limit ice accretion. An experimental programme was therefore carried out to investigate primarily: various exhaust geometries (through which spent anti-icing air is emitted to join the main engine inlet airflow and provide heating of the downstream surface; various cowl internal configurations on a full-scale model section of a large civil turbofan <b>Nose</b> <b>Cowl.</b> The internal geometry affects the effectiveness of the cowl lipskin heating, and the spent anti-icing exhaust air limits the quantity of unevaporated water which runs back along the intake acoustic surface downstream of the directly heated area and freezes. The Computational Fluid Dynamics package PACE (Prediction of Aerodynamics and Combustor Emissions) was used to model the internal, freestream and exhaust airf lows to determine the program's potential and usefulness for predictive purposes in this type of application. PACE is capable of modelling two or three dimensional, recirculating or non-recirculating flows for simple rectangular or polar geometry. It encompasses a suite of sub-programs to generate meshes and to create and solve the set of coupled linear equations representing the fluid flow. Various parameters, including heat transfer coefficients, were predicted in two regions: downstream of the exhaust plane to model the mixing of the spent anti-icing air and the freestream main engine inlet flow; inside and outside the <b>Nose</b> <b>Cowl</b> highlight area to predict skin temperature distributions for the three internal geometry configurations tested. This thesis describes the experimental work and compares the results with the Computational Fluid Dynamics predictions. Agreement was generally found to be good, and it was concluded that PACE may provide a useful modelling (design) tool, albeit with some reservations...|$|E

25|$|The type {{had several}} {{teething}} troubles: the oleo undercarriage {{was unable to}} withstand rough use {{on the front line}} airfields, tail skids frequently broke and the original radiators blocked up quickly. Following instructions issued on 30 April 1917, some F.K.8s were refitted with simplified vee-undercarriages from Bristol F.2 Fighters. This soon led to a temporary shortage of these undercarriages and the practice had to be discontinued until May 1918, after which several F.K.8s were fitted with revised undercarriages. Most production F.K.8s had modifications to the wings, gunner's seat and the exhaust system. The tall inverted vee radiators incorporated improved tubes which reduced the blockages. On later aircraft the <b>nose</b> <b>cowling</b> was redesigned and smaller box radiators were standardised.|$|R

25|$|The maximum rpm of a {{propeller}} (at about 2800 {{depending on}} its diameter) {{is about half}} that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a drive reduction unit. Such units absorb about 20% of the engine power and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the Jabiru 5100. Recent developments of the Jabiru engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the <b>nose</b> <b>cowling</b> of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be {{in keeping with the}} original sleek design of the Spitfire.

50|$|For {{eleven years}} the design was not {{produced}} {{and then in}} the late 1980s a new company was formed to produce the Tiger. American General Aviation Corporation carried out further design improvements including introducing a new split <b>nose</b> <b>cowling</b> (engine cover) that could be removed without removing the propeller, a new instrument panel and improved exterior lighting, a new fuel quantity indication system, a 28 volt electrical system replacing the older 14 volt system, a new-style throttle quadrant and improvements to the heat and ventilation systems. Aerodynamic improvements raised the optimal altitude cruise speed from 139 kn true airspeed to 143 kn TAS. The redesigned aircraft was put into production under an amended type certificate as the American General AG-5B Tiger. The new company had considered producing AA-1s and AA-5A Cheetahs, but those plans were never fulfilled before it closed its doors in 1993. American General produced Tigers for model years 1990-93 and delivered 181 aircraft in that time.|$|R

50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Spitfire Mk 26 used an eight-cylinder 180 hp Jabiru 5100 horizontally opposed aero engine, but early installations suffered from inadequate cooling. The company now offers a converted General Motors Isuzu V6 engine. The normally aspirated version of this engine produces 226 hp (168 kW) with a supercharged version producing up to 310 hp (231 kW).The maximum rpm of a propeller (at about 2800 depending on its diameter) is about half that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a drive reduction unit.

50|$|On 17 January 1917 {{he began}} {{training}} as a fighter pilot. He was successful and was posted to a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 5. On 13 April, he put in his first claim for an aerial victory, over a British pusher fighter; the claim went unconfirmed because he only forced it to land. On 2 May, he was transferred to another fighter unit, the famed Jagdstaffel 2. He was confirmed as a leutnant on 28 June 1917; his commission granted him over two years seniority in rank, back to 18 June 1915. Photos taken of him at about this time show a slender man with an erect carriage standing next to or sitting on his Albatros D.III biplane fighter. This Albatros, as was the German custom, had been embellished beyond its factory finish of umber and two tones of green. As had all the Jasta 2 aircraft, its tail had been painted white. Its <b>nose,</b> <b>cowling,</b> struts, and wheel covers were painted gray.

50|$|To {{meet this}} requirement, Hawker Aircraft {{submitted}} two designs, one a monoplane {{and the other}} a biplane, but both were rejected by the Air Ministry when contracts were awarded for prototypes in 1932, orders going to Blackburn Aircraft (for its F.3 and Westland Aircraft (the Westland F.7/30). Despite this rejection, Hawker decided to construct a single example of its biplane design, the Hawker P.V.3 as a Private Venture without an Air Ministry order. The P.V.3, design of which was led by Hawker's Chief Designer Sidney Camm, was an enlarged development of Hawker's Fury fighter, powered by the preferred Goshawk. Like the Fury, it had an all-metal structure with fabric covered wings (which unlike the Fury were swept back), tail and aft fuselage, with a metal skinned forward fuselage. Steam condensers for the Goshawk engine were fitted in the upper wing, supplemented by a smaller retractable condenser under the fuselage. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with spats covering the mainwheels to reduce drag.

A [...] M-26 (KIM) 7-cylinder radial engine was mounted in the <b>nose,</b> <b>cowled</b> in a Townend ring and with its output shaft pointing downwards at an angle of 4.5°. Its small, low wings were rectangular plan, wooden structures, each built around a pair of spars and braced from above by a pair of parallel struts, one from each spar to the upper fuselage longeron. They had 5° of dihedral but their semicircular tips were inclined upwards by a further 35°. Conventional ailerons occupying almost 30% of the overall wing area provided roll control. [...] There were two open cockpits in tandem, the forward, passenger seat ahead of the wing trailing edge and close to the rotor axis. Dual control was fitted. At the rear the fin was long, rounded at the front but with a flat top. It mounted an unbalanced rudder, roughly rectangular though rounded at the rear corners, which extended to the keel. [...] Small like the wing, the tailplane was braced from below and had swept leading edges; its elevators were more generous, with rounded tips and a large cut-out for rudder movement.|$|R
