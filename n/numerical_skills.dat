Study design: Very preterm children (n = 200; mean age, 8. 2 ± 2. 5 years) born between 1996 and 2004 {{were compared with}} 230 term-born children (mean age, 8. 3 ± 2. 3). The Dutch National Pupil Monitoring System {{was used to measure}} preschool numerical reasoning and early linguistics, and primary school simple and complex word reading, reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematics/arithmetic. With univariate analyses of variance, we assessed the effects of preterm birth on performance across grades and on grade retention. Results: In preschool, very preterm children performed comparably with term-born children in early linguistics, but perform more poorly (0. 7 standard deviation [SD]) in <b>numerical</b> reasoning <b>skills.</b> In primary school, very preterm children scored 0. 3 SD lower in complex word reading and 0. 6 SD lower in mathematics/arithmetic, but performed comparably with peers in reading comprehension and spelling. They had a higher grade repeat rate (25. 5 %), although grade repeat did not improve their academic skills. Conclusions: Very preterm children do well in early linguistics, reading comprehension, and spelling, but have clinically significant deficits in <b>numerical</b> reasoning <b>skills</b> and mathematics/arithmetic, which persist with time. © 2011 Mosby Inc.

40|$|Although a {{critical}} issue {{in the debate over}} the existence of abstract numerical representation, it remains unclear whether and how perceptual variables affect numerosity judgment and how they change across development stages. In this research, we examine the effects of perceptual variables on approximate numerosity comparison in 5 - 6 -year-olds and adults using the identical experimental procedure. In the assessment of the effect of the perceptual variables, we measured precision (i. e., Weber fraction) and accuracy (i. e., point of subjective equality; PSE) of the numerosity comparison. In Study 1, we tested how the manipulation of the cumulative element area would affect approximate numerosity comparison. The results showed that Weber fractions increased and the size of bias enlarged in the large element condition in both adults and 5 - 6 -year-olds. In study 2, we tested how the manipulation of the array area would affect the precision and accuracy of approximate numerosity comparison. The results demonstrated that Weber fractions increased and the size of bias enlarged in the large array condition in both adults and 5 - 6 -year-olds. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of perceptual variables on 5 - 6 -year-olds is qualitatively similar to that on adults.
