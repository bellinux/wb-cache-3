5|$|Bayern is an {{exception}} in professional, international football, having generated profits in <b>nine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last ten seasons.

While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from broadcasting right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way. This is often accounted for by Bayern not marketing their broadcasting right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates broadcasting rights for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E

Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
