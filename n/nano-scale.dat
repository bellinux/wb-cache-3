40|$|International audienceA {{large number}} of {{outstanding}} physical properties observed in perovskite-type oxides, such as giant piezoelectricity, colossal magneto-resistance and high- T c superconductivity, are related to an intrinsic <b>nano-scaled</b> local structure. For instance, {{the presence of a}} <b>nano-scaled</b> structure is characteristic of so-called relaxor ferroelectrics (relaxors), which have attracted considerable attention since the recent discovery of ultra-high strain and giant piezoelectric properties. In this paper we review, through a case study of relaxors, how the combination of the external parameter high-pressure and Raman spectroscopy allows an instructive investigation of <b>nano-scaled</b> perovskites, which is often at best a difficult task for conventional ‘average-structure’ techniques such as diffraction. We show that perovskite-type relaxors present important pressure instabilities with respect to both cation sizes and we suggest that the latter instabilities might well be at the origin of the reduced dielectric performances that are observed for strained thin-film relaxors. Finally, we briefly illustrate how the approach might be used for <b>nano-scaled</b> manganite-type oxides...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the numerical investigation on the adsorption (Γ) of nanoparticles (NPs) scale inhibitor (SI) using Eulerian Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver ANSYS/FLUENT ® {{based on a}} scaled down flow model. The simulation were done to investigate the Γ of normal and <b>nano-scaled</b> Calcium-phosphonate. The phosphonate used was 1 -hydroxyethylidene- 1, 1 -disphosphonic acid (HEDP) SI {{in order to determine}} the enhancement in adsorption achieved by the <b>nano-scaled</b> SI. This was done by looking at the change in concentration of the SI particles throughout the simulation time. It was found that the two sizes (normal and nano structured) of the SI particles result in different change in concentration, hence indicates that the two yields different adsorption to the active sites. For the normal SI, the concentration distribution throughout the column remains almost the same as its initial concentration (oC) of 2000 ppm except for very narrow regions in the vicinity of the wall boundaries. This suggests that the rate of Γ process (of the SI onto the wall) is very slow. Consequently, it will take longer time for the SI to be adsorbed to the column wall, hence indicates that it is less efficient. Meanwhile, the <b>nano-scaled</b> Calcium-HEDP SI rapidly shows a significant change in concentration. At 200 s its concentration has distributed evenly in the range of 1960 ppm to 2000 ppm. This shows a really high Γ rate. The results from this study indicates that the <b>nano-scaled</b> Calcium-HEDP SI has better Γwhich shows that it is more efficient than normal-scaled Calcium-HEDP SI...|$|R
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to <b>nano-scale</b> dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} chitin {{and certain}} peptides {{have been recognized}} for their antimicrobial properties in the past. Today, these materials are engineered into nanoparticles {{in order to produce}} low-cost disinfection applications. Natural peptides form <b>nano-scale</b> channels in the bacterial cell membranes, which causes osmotic collapse. These peptides are now synthesized in order to tailor the antimicrobial nanostructures with respect to size, morphology, coatings, derivatization, and other properties allowing them to be used for specific antimicrobial properties as desired. Chitosan is a polymer obtained from chitin in arthropod shells, and has been used for its antibacterial properties for a while, but even more so since the polymer has been made into nanoparticles. Chitosan proves to be effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, however it is more effective against fungi and viruses than bacteria. The positively charged chitosan nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged cell membrane, which causes an increase in membrane permeability and eventually the intracellular components leak and rupture.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of transferring silica {{absorbed by the}} diatom to the cell wall is unknown, though research is still being undertaken. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from {{the search for the}} {{mechanism of}} silica uptake and deposition in <b>nano-scale</b> patterns in the frustule. The most success in this area has come from two species, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and Cylindrotheca fusiformis, in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered. Silaffins, sets of polycationic peptides, were found in C. fusiformis cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns1. When T. pseudonana underwent genome analysis it was found that it encoded a urea cycle, including a higher number of polyamines than most genomes, as well as three distinct silica transport genes. In a phylogenetic study on silica transport genes from 8 diverse groups of diatoms, silica transport was found to generally group with species. This study also found structural differences between the silica transporters of pennate (bilateral symmetry) and centric (radial symmetry) diatoms. The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.|$|E
