5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for <b>nesting</b> by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} <b>nesting</b> sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity <b>nesting</b> birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their <b>nesting</b> site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E

Each <b>nest</b> measurement had a large coefficient of variation, but we found trends in six of eight <b>nest</b> measurements related to date, <b>nest</b> number, female occupant, or <b>nest</b> success. Regression analyses showed that cup depth, <b>nest</b> wall width, and exterior <b>nest</b> height decreased during the season, while cup width increased (0. 14 3 ̆c R 2 3 ̆c 0. 24).

We also found evidence that nestlings in successful <b>nests</b> apparently enlarged the <b>nest</b> cup. Very little is known about short-term variation in <b>nest</b> size and shape, but our results indicate that female Wood Thrushes may change the size of their <b>nests</b> for various reasons during the breeding season...|$|R
40|$|Parent {{birds are}} often assumed to {{regulate}} the amount of their <b>nest</b> material during incubation in response to various costs and benefits. This assumption, however, is rarely tested. We investigated this assumption in a ground-nesting shorebird, the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) by experimentally manipulating the amount of <b>nest</b> material. Materials were removed from some <b>nests</b> (reduced <b>nests)</b> and added to other <b>nests</b> (increased <b>nests),</b> whereas in control <b>nests</b> the amount of <b>nest</b> material was not manipulated. In both reduced and increased <b>nests</b> the parents restored the original amount of <b>nest</b> material within 24 hours.

This suggests that the parents carefully balance the various costs and benefits of <b>nest</b> material use during incubation...|$|R
5|$|Also defined herewith: seabird colony; {{breeding}} colony; communal roost; heronries; rookery. A large {{congregation of}} individuals {{of one or}} more species of bird that nest or roost in proximity at a particular location. Many kinds of birds are known to congregate in groups of varying size; a congregation of <b>nesting</b> birds is called a breeding colony. A group of birds congregating for rest is called a communal roost. Approximately 13% of all bird species nest colonially. <b>Nesting</b> colonies are very common among seabirds on cliffs and islands. Nearly 95% of seabirds are colonial, leading to the usage, seabird colony, sometimes called a rookery. Many species of terns nest in colonies on the ground. Herons, egrets, storks and other large waterfowl also nest communally in what are called heronries.

50|$|Moist, shaded <b>nests</b> {{display a}} {{different}} daily temperature pattern than dry <b>nests</b> {{due to the}} different conditions.

Moist <b>nests</b> have high external surface temperatures during the night. Instead, they rely on another curious mechanism to warm the nest: microbial activity within the moist <b>nest</b> material. As the workers inside the <b>nest</b> during the evening raise the temperature of the surroundings, microbial activity increases which heats the <b>nest.</b> Indeed, microbial activity is much higher in <b>nest</b> material than in the surrounding forest floor.

Half of the groups had access to six identical rollaway group-nests, while the others had access to six <b>nests</b> of the same type differing in outer appearance. Three colours (red, green, yellow) and three black symbols (cross, circle, rectangle) were used to create three different <b>nest</b> curtain designs per pen. Nest position and the side of entrance to the pens were changed at 28 and 30 weeks of age, respectively, whereby the order of changes was counterbalanced across trials. Nest positions were numbered 1 – 6, with <b>nest</b> position 1 representing the <b>nest</b> closest to the pen entrance. Eggs were counted per <b>nest</b> daily from week of age 18 to 33. Nest visits were recorded individually with an RFID system for the first 5 h of light throughout weeks 24 – 33. Hens with access to <b>nests</b> differing in curtain appearance entered fewer <b>nests</b> daily than hens with identical <b>nests</b> throughout the study but both groups entered more <b>nests</b> with increasing age. We found no other evidence that curtain appearance affected <b>nest</b> choice and hens were inconsistent in their daily <b>nest</b> selection. A high proportion of eggs were laid in corner <b>nests</b> especially {{during the first three}} weeks of lay. The number of visits per egg depended upon <b>nest</b> position and age: it increased with age and was higher after the <b>nest</b> position change than before in <b>nest</b> position 1, whereas it stayed stable over time in <b>nest</b> position 6. At 24 weeks of age, gregarious <b>nest</b> visits (hens visiting an occupied <b>nest</b> when there was at least one unoccupied <b>nest)</b> and solitary <b>nest</b> visits (hens visiting an unoccupied <b>nest</b> when there was at least one occupied <b>nest)</b> accounted for a similar amount of <b>nest</b> visits, however, after the door switch, gregarious <b>nest</b> visits made up {{more than half of all}} <b>nest</b> visits, while the number of solitary <b>nest</b> visits had decreased.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>nest</b> location and the placement of nipple drinkers on <b>nest</b> use by laying hens in a commercial aviary was assessed. Twenty pens in a laying hen house were equipped with the same commercial aviary system, but the pens differed in the <b>nest</b> location and the placement of nipple drinkers. <b>Nests</b> were placed along the walls in 10 pens, and nipple drinkers were installed {{in front of the}} <b>nests</b> in 5 of these pens.

A total of 225 Lohmann Selected Leghorns were housed per pen. The hens were offered 4 <b>nests</b> per pen: 2 facing the service corridor of the laying hen house and 2 facing the outdoor area. The numbers of <b>nest</b> eggs and mislaid eggs were counted daily per pen. At 25, 36, and 43 wk of age, the <b>nest</b> platforms were videotaped and the behavior of laying hens in front of the <b>nests</b> was analyzed.

No difference in the number of <b>nest</b> eggs could be detected, but the integration of the <b>nests</b> inside the aviary led to a more even distribution of hens while <b>nest</b> searching. In the pens with wall-placed <b>nests,</b> significantly more hens laid eggs in the <b>nests</b> at the wall near the service corridor than at the wall near the outdoor area.
