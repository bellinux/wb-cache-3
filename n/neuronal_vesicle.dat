40|$|A central {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson's disease (PD) {{is the presence}} of proteinaceous depositions known as Lewy bodies, which consist largely of the protein Î±-synuclein (aSyn). Mutations, multiplications and polymorphisms in the gene encoding aSyn are associated with familial forms of PD and susceptibility to idiopathic PD. Alterations in aSyn impair <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicle</b> formation/transport, and likely contribute to PD pathogenesis by neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. aSyn is functionally associated with several Rab family GTPases, which perform various roles in vesicle trafficking. Here, we explore the role of the endosomal recycling factor Rab 11 in the pathogenesis of PD using Drosophila models of aSyn toxicity. We find that aSyn induces synaptic potentiation at the larval neuromuscular junction by increasing synaptic vesicle (SV) size, and that these alterations are reversed by Rab 11 overexpression. Furthermore, Rab 11 decreases aSyn aggregation and ameliorates several aSyn-dependent phenotypes in both larvae and adult fruit flies, including locomotor activity, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and shortened lifespan. This work emphasizes the importance of Rab 11 in the modulation of SV size and consequent enhancement of synaptic function. Our results suggest that targeting Rab 11 activity could have a therapeutic value in PD. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|E
40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social reciprocity, impaired communication and stereotypical behaviors. Despite strong {{evidence for a}} genetic basis, few susceptibility genes have been identified. Here, we describe the positional cloning of SCAMP 5, CLIC 4 and PPCDC as candidate genes for autism, starting from a person with idiopathic, sporadic autism carrying a de novo chromosomal translocation. One of these genes, SCAMP 5 is silenced on the derivative chromosome, and encodes a brain-enriched protein involved in membrane trafficking, similarly to the previously identified candidate genes NBEA and AMISYN. Gene silencing of Nbea, Amisyn and Scamp 5 in mouse beta-TC 3 cells resulted in a twofold increase in stimulated secretion of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), while overexpression suppressed secretion. Moreover, ultrastructural analysis of blood platelets from the patients with haploinsufficieny {{of one of the}} three candidate genes, showed morphological abnormalities of dense-core granules (DCGs), which closely resemble LDCVs. Taken together, this study shows that in three independent patients with autism three different negative regulators of LDCV secretion are affected, respectively, suggesting that in at least a subgroup of patients the regulation of <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicle</b> trafficking may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism. status: publishe...|$|E

Botulinum neurotoxin poses a major bioweapon threat because of its extreme potency and lethality; its ease of production, transport, and misuse; {{and the need for}} prolonged intensive care among affected persons. A single gram of crystalline toxin, evenly dispersed and inhaled, can kill more than one million people. The basis of the phenomenal potency of botulinum toxin is enzymatic; the toxin is a zinc proteinase that cleaves <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicle</b> associated proteins responsible for acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular junction.

40|$|Abstract Background Increases during {{aging in}} {{extracellular}} levels of glutamate (Glu), the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, {{may be linked}} to chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Little is known about the molecular responses of neurons to chronic, moderate increases in Glu levels. Genome-wide gene expression in brain hippocampus was examined in a unique transgenic (Tg) mouse model that exhibits moderate Glu hyperactivity throughout the lifespan, the neuronal Glutamate dehydrogenase (Glud 1) mouse, and littermate 9 month-old wild type mice. Results Integrated bioinformatic analyses on transcriptomic data were used to identify bio-functions, pathways and gene networks underlying neuronal responses to increased Glu synaptic release. Bio-functions and pathways up-regulated in Tg mice were those associated with oxidative stress, cell injury, inflammation, nervous system development, neuronal growth, and synaptic transmission. Increased gene expression in these functions and pathways indicated apparent compensatory responses offering protection against stress, promoting growth of neuronal processes (neurites) and re-establishment of synapses. The transcription of a key gene in the neurite growth network, the kinase Ptk 2 b, was significantly up-regulated in Tg mice as was the activated (phosphorylated) form of the protein. In addition to genes related to neurite growth and synaptic development, those associated with <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicle</b> trafficking in the Huntington's disease signalling pathway, were also up-regulated. Conclusions This is the first study attempting to define neuronal gene expression patterns in response to chronic, endogenous Glu hyperactivity at brain synapses. The patterns observed were characterized by a combination of responses to stress and stimulation of nerve growth, intracellular transport and recovery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Autism is {{a severe}} neurodevelopmental disorder. It {{belongs to a}} group of {{pervasive}} developmental disorders with a prevalence of 0, 7 %. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed purely on clinical grounds by impairment in social interactions and communication and repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour and interests. Twin and family studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to the aetiology of autism, although environmental causes are not excluded. Recently we have identified a novel candidate genes for autism by positional cloning, starting from an autistic patient with a de novo balanced translocation. Neurobeachin (NBEA) is predicted to be involved in <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicle</b> trafficking. Our functional studies show that this proteins is a negative regulator of secretion of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) in neuro-endocrine cell lines. LDCVs contain neuropeptides, monoamines and neurotrophins, which are implicated in important processes like synaptic plasticity and neural differentiation. On the basis of conserved structural motifs Neurobeachin {{is a member of the}} BEACH (beige and chediak-higashi) family, which seems to be implicated in vesicle biogenesis and trafficking. It is suggested that the BEACH-domain has a scaffolding function together with the pleckstrin homology domain and the WD 40 repeats. Defining interaction partners could give us more insights into the functional role of Nbea in regulated vesicle secretion. Nbea-null mice have been generated by random transgene-mediated gene disruption. This disruption resulted in lethal paralysis in homozygous newborns because of a complete block of evoked synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions. We are observing the viable heterozygous mice, which relate better to the haploinsufficient autistic patients. Behavioural studies showed comparable autistic traits (unpublished results). This infers that Nbea+/- mice are a good model to study the human disease. Hypothesis: Since Neurobeachin, a candidate gene for autism, is involved in the regulated secretory pathway of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), the hypothesis is that impaired LDCV secretion in neurons contributes to the pathogenesis of autism in a subgroup of patients. To clarify the role of NBEA and the involved molecular mechanisms in the regulated secretory pathway, the aims are to: 1. Perform ultrastructural studies of LDCVs (electron microscopy) 2. Study the effect of NBEA haploinsufficiency on biogenesis and secretion of LDCVs in neurons of the Nbea+/- mouse model 3.

40|$|By {{means of}} a {{multistage}} quantitative assay, we have identified {{a new kind of}} cell adhesion molecule (CAM) on neuronal cells of the chick embryo that is involved in their adhesion to glial cells. The assay used to identify the binding component (which we name neuron-glia CAM or Ng-CAM) was designed to distinguish between homotypic binding (e. g., neuron to neuron) and heterotypic binding (e. g., neuron to glia). This distinction was essential because a single neuron might simultaneously carry different CAMs separately mediating each of these interactions. The adhesion of neuronal cells to glial cells in vitro was previously found to be inhibited by Fab' fragments prepared from antisera against neuronal membranes but not by Fab' fragments against N-CAM, the neural cell adhesion molecule. This suggested that neuron-glia adhesion is mediated by specific cell surface molecules different from previously isolated CAMs. To verify that this was the case, neuronal membrane vesicles were labeled internally with 6 -carboxyfluorescein and externally with 125 I-labeled antibodies to N-CAM to block their homotypic binding. Labeled vesicles bound to glial cells but not to fibroblasts during a 30 -min incubation period. The specific binding of the neuronal vesicles to glial cells was measured by fluorescence microscopy and gamma spectroscopy of the 125 I label. Binding increased with increasing concentrations of both glial cells and neuronal vesicles. Fab' fragments prepared from anti-neuronal membrane sera that inhibited binding between neurons and glial cells were also found to inhibit <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicle</b> binding to glial cells. The inhibitory activity of the Fab' fragments was depleted by preincubation with neuronal cells but not with glial cells. Trypsin treatment of neuronal membrane vesicles released material that neutralized Fab' fragment inhibition; after chromatography, neutralizing activity was enriched 50 - fold. This fraction was injected into mice to produce monoclonal antibodies; an antibody was obtained that interacted with neurons, inhibited binding of neuronal membrane vesicles to glial cells, and recognized an Mr = 135, 000 band in immunoblots of embryonic chick brain membranes. These results suggest that this molecule is present on the surfaces of neurons and that it directly or indirectly mediates adhesion between neurons and glial cells. Because the monoclonal antibody as well as the original polyspecific antibodies that were active in the assay did not bind to glial cells, we infer that neuron- glial interaction is heterophilic, i. e., it occurs between Ng-CAM on neurons and an as yet unidentified CAM present on glial cells...|$|E

We performed experiments to determine whether Rab 3 A interacts with Myo 5 a and whether it is required for transport of <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicles.</b> In vitro motility assays performed with axoplasm from the squid giant axon showed a requirement for a Rab GTPase in Myo 5 a-dependent vesicle transport. Furthermore, mouse recombinant Myo 5 a tail revealed that it {{associated with}} Rab 3 A in rat brain synaptosomal preparations in vitro and the association was confirmed by immunofluorescence imaging of primary neurons isolated from the frontal cortex of mouse brains. Synaptosomal Rab 3 A was retained on recombinant GST-tagged Myo 5 a tail affinity columns in a GTP-dependent manner. Finally, the direct interaction of Myo 5 a and Rab 3 A was determined by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation using recombinant mouse Myo 5 a tail and human Rab 3 A. When both proteins were incubated in the presence of 1 mm GTPÎ³S, Myo 5 a tail and Rab 3 A formed a complex and a direct interaction was observed. Further analysis revealed that GTP-bound Rab 3 A interacts with both the monomeric and dimeric species of the Myo 5 a tail. However, the interaction between Myo 5 a tail and nucleotide-free Rab 3 A did not occur.

The release of endogenous noradrenaline and dihydroxyphenylglycol were determined by high-performance liquid chro-ma tography. The release of dihydroxyphenylglycol, the main neuronal noradrenaline metabo-lite, {{was used as an}} indicator of the free axoplasmic amine concentration. When storage function of <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicles</b> was disturbed by Ro 4 - 1284 or trimethyltin, high dihydroxyphenylglycol release was observed without concomitant overflow of noradrenaline. If, however, these agents were combined with inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase or with veratridine-induced entry of sodium into the neuron, both dihydroxyphenylglycol and noradrenaline were released. Noradrenaline release was independent of extracellular calcium and was suppressed by blockade of neuronal catecholamine uptake (uptake,), indicating nonexocytotic noradrenaline liberation from the sympathetic nerve ending. This release critically depended on two conditions: 1) increased cytoplasmic concentrations of noradrenaline within the sympathetic neuron and 2) intraneuro-nal sodium accumulation.

40|$|Complex {{forms of}} {{cellular}} motility, including cell division, organelle trafficking or signal amplification in the auditory system, require strong coordination of the myosin motors involved. The most basic mechanism of coordination is via direct mechanical interactions of individual motor heads leading to modification of their mechano-chemical cycles. Here we used an optical trap-based assay {{to investigate the}} reversibility of the force- generating conformational change (power stroke) of single myosin-V motor heads. By applying load to the head shortly after binding to actin, we found that at a certain load the power stroke could be reversed and the head fluctuated between an actin-bound pre- and a post-power stroke conformation. This load-dependent mechanical instability might be critical to coordinate the heads of processive, dimeric myosin-V. Non-linear response to load leading to coordination or oscillations amongst motors might be relevant for many cellular functions.

The adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons.

It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Lewy bodies). Cell death leads to a profound depletion of dopamine neurotransmitter involved mainly in the control of the movement. Mutations in LRRK 2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) gene (PARK 8; OMIM 609007) are responsible for one of the autosomal-dominant forms of Parkinsonâs disease. Up to date, the LRRK 2 biological function is largely unknown.

To test directly and rigorously the hypothesis that dynactin is required to attach dynein to membranes, we used both a Drosophila mutant and RNA interference to generate organisms and cells lacking the critical dynactin subunit, actin-related protein 1. Contrary to expectation, we found that apparently normal amounts of dynein associate with membrane compartments {{in the absence of a}} fully assembled dynactin complex. In addition, anterograde and retrograde organelle movement in dynactin deficient axons was completely disrupted, resulting in substantial changes in vesicle kinematic properties. Although effects on retrograde transport are predicted by the proposed function of dynactin as a regulator of dynein processivity, the additional effects we observed on anterograde transport also suggest potential roles for dynactin in mediating kinesin-driven transport and in coordinating the activity of opposing motors (King and Schroer, 2000) ...|$|R

However, experimental evidence highlights {{a critical}} role of LRRK 2 in the control of vesicle trafficking that in turn may regulate different aspects of neuronal physiology. We have analyzed the role of LRRK 2 in regulating dopamine receptor D 1 (DRD 1) and D 2 (DRD 2) trafficking. DRD 1 and DRD 2 are the most abundant dopamine receptors in the brain.

40|$|Adenosine is a prototypical neuromodulator, which mainly {{controls}} excitatory transmission {{through the}} activation of widespread inhibitory A 1 receptors and synaptically located A 2 A receptors. It was long {{thought that the}} predominant A 1 receptor-meditated modulation by endogenous adenosine was a homeostatic process intrinsic to the synapse. New studies indicate that endogenous extracellular adenosine is originated {{as a consequence of}} the release of gliotransmitters, namely ATP, which sets a global inhibitory tonus in brain circuits rather than in a single synapse. Thus, this neuron-glia long-range communication can be viewed as a form of non-synaptic transmission (a concept introduced by Professor Sylvester Vizi), designed to reduce noise in a circuit. This neuron-glia-induced adenosine release is also responsible for exacerbating salient information through A 1 receptor-mediated heterosynaptic depression, whereby the activation of a particular synapse recruits a neuron-glia network to generate extracellular adenosine that inhibits neighbouring non-tetanised synapses. In parallel, the local activation of facilitatory A 2 A receptors by adenosine, formed from ATP released only at high frequencies from <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicles,</b> down-regulates A 1 receptors and facilitates plasticity selectively in the tetanised synapse. Thus, upon high-frequency firing of a given pathway, the combined exacerbation of global A 1 receptor-mediated inhibition in the circuit (heterosynaptic depression) with the local synaptic activation of A 2 A receptors in the activated synapse, cooperate to maximise salience between the activated and non-tetanised synapses.

[123 I]Î²-CIT binds to both the striatal DAT and the serotonin transporter (SERT), and the non-selectivity of this tracer hampers the conclusions to be drawn from this study on the relative role of DAT compared to SERT in smoking. A recent study by Erritzoe et al. also failed to demonstrate significant differences in the binding of the PET tracer [11 C]DASB to SERT in smokers compared to non-smokers [34]. Our study does not replicate the findings of a decreased striatal DAT availability in smokers [28, 33] using [99 mTc]TRODAT- 1 SPECT. We believe that the discrepancies between the findings in the two [99 mTc]TRODAT- 1 SPECT studies and the results of our study and the study of Staley et al. [41] are related to the sample size (8 and 11 active smokers were included in the [99 mTc]TRODAT- 1 SPECT studies) and possibly the imaging properties of [99 mTc]TRODAT- 1 related to a small ratio between binding of tracer in striatum compared to the reference region leading to data being more susceptible to noise. In a [18 F]fluorodopa PET of the striatal presynaptic dopamine activity in active smokers (n = 9) compared to non-smokers (n = 10), a significantly higher uptake of striatal [18 F]fluorodopa was demonstrated in smokers compared to non-smokers [42].

40|$|SV 2 s family {{proteins}} are <b>neuronal</b> <b>vesicles</b> membrane glycoproteins {{that are}} highly conserved in evolution (Janz & SÃ¼dhof, 1999). It is known that SV 2 A isoform is the target to Levetiracetam (LEV), an effective anti-epileptic drug (B. Lynch et al., 2004). There are certain hypotheses {{about his role in}} epilepsy. However, his physiological function and its interaction with LEV remains unknown. Specifically, it is known that a specific type of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) presents a reduction of SV 2 A expression associated with an upregulation of SV 2 C isoform (CrÃ¨vecoeur et al., 2014). The aims of this study consist in validating the proper operation of SV 2 A lox/lox sequence in order to invalidate SV 2 A expression and, secondly, analysing the expression of SV 2 B and SV 2 C in the absence of SV 2 A. For this purpose, a mouse line allowing the conditional removal of SV 2 A in the hippocampal region (CA 3 and dentate gyrus (DG)) at postnatal stages 15 (P 15) (Grik 4 :SV 2 A-cKO) was engineered. Unexpectedly, Grik 4 : SV 2 A-cKO transgenic mice did not present an epileptic phenotype. To determine the reason of these phenomenon, the concentration of the three isoforms was analysed and quantified. Results have shown a significant reduction of the quantity of SV 2 A transcript and protein in Grik 4 :SV 2 A-cKO animals hippocampus compared to the wild-type mice (WT). Together, these results confirmed the efficiency of the invalidation of SV 2 A in our mouse model. Parallel to these values, no significant change in SV 2 B or SV 2 C protein and transcript expression was observed implying an absence of compensation phenomenon. Nevertheless, many other hypotheses should be tested to explain this unexpected phenotype in Grik 4 : SV 2 AcKO mice. Finally, in order to resolve the role of SV 2 A in synaptic plasticity, a new nucleofection protocol for embryonic cortical neurons at the embryonic stage 16 (E 16) in vitro was develope...|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} {{of the nervous system}} has been documented for various helminth parasites. However, the ultrastructure of the brain of the carcinogenic liver ï¬uke, Opisthorchis viverrini has not been described. This study therefore clarified the fine structure of the cerebral ganglia (brain) of this ï¬uke using transmission electron microscopy. The cerebral ganglia of O. viverrini are composed of ganglion cell bodies and the bilateral lobe of neuropile with a tight packing of unmyelinated axon processes. The two lobes of the brain are connected together by transverse commissure. The neuropiles were insinuated by groups or bundles of giant axons and mesenchymal processes. Cells and axon processes of the O. viverrini brain were rich in tight accumulations of abundant <b>neuronal</b> mediator <b>vesicles.</b> Numerous synaptic contacts were present in the neuropile of brain and scattered in transverse commissure. The {{organization of}} the brain of this liver fluke brain was comparable to other trematodes...|$|R
40|$|Cysteine string protein (CSP) is {{a member}} of the DnaJ/Hsp 40 {{chaperone}} family that localizes to <b>neuronal</b> synaptic <b>vesicles.</b> Impaired CSP function leads to neurodegeneration in humans and model organisms as a result of misfolding of client proteins involved in neurotransmission. Mammalian CSP is phosphorylated in vivo on Ser 10, and this modulates its protein interactions and effects on neurotransmitter release. However, there are no data on the structural consequences of CSP phosphorylation to explain these functional effects. We show that Ser 10 phosphorylation causes an order-to-disorder transition that disrupts CSP's extreme N-terminal ?? helix. This triggers the concomitant formation of a hairpin loop stabilized by ionic interactions between phosphoSer 10 and the highly conserved J-domain residue, Lys 58. These phosphorylation-induced effects result in significant changes to CSP conformation and surface charge distribution.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the organization, on the plasma membrane and in detergent-insoluble membrane <b>vesicles,</b> of two <b>neuronal</b> glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI) proteins: Thy- 1, a negative regulator of transmembrane signalling; and prion protein, whose rapid endocytosis and Cu(2 +) binding suggest that it functions in metal ion uptake. Prion protein occurred on the neuronal surface at high density in domains, located primarily at the cell body, which were relatively soluble in detergent. Thy- 1, although much more abundantly expressed on neurons, occurred at lower density {{over much of the}} surface of neurites (and in lower abundance at the cell body) in domains that were highly resistant to detergent solubilization. Detergent-insoluble membrane vesicles contained Thy- 1 at a density similar to that on the <b>neuronal</b> surface. <b>Vesicles</b> containing each protein could be separated by immunoaffinity isolation; lectin binding showed that they were enriched in different glycoproteins.

40|$|The {{gastric parietal cell}} secretes large {{quantities}} of HCl into the lumen of the gastric gland in response to secretagogues such as histamine. In the membrane recycling hypothesis, this secretory activity requires the trafficking of the gastric H+/K(+) -ATPase to the cell surface from intracellular tubulovesicles. The Rab subclass of small GTP-binding proteins is thought to confer specificity to vesicle transport throughout the secretory pathway, and previous investigations established that Rab 11 is highly expressed in gastric parietal cells. Recent discoveries in intra-Golgi transport and <b>neuronal</b> synaptic <b>vesicle</b> fusion have fortuitously converged on an evolutionarily conserved protein complex involved in vesicle docking and fusion. Recent results indicate that Rab 11 {{is involved in the}} apical targeting of vesicles in parietal cells and other epithelial cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract. In support of the membrane recycling hypothesis, Rab co-segregates with H+/K(+) -ATPase in parietal cells. The presence of Rab 11 on tubulovesicles supports a role for this Rab protein in recycling vesicle trafficking...|$|R

40|$|<b>Neuronal</b> dense-core <b>vesicles</b> {{provide a}} {{mechanism}} whereby peptide messengers are secreted in discrete quanta. Here {{we report on}} the capacity of rat hypophysiotrophic corticotropin releasing factor- 41 neurons to alter the peptide content as well as the size of dense-core vesicles after removal of glucocorticoid negative feedback by adrenalectomy. We demonstrate, using quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, that long-term adrenalectomy induces a progressive increase in the ratio of vasopressin to corticotropin releasing factor- 41 -immunoreactive sites in the dense-core vesicle compartment. The intravesicular concentration of vasopressin appeared to be the variable parameter while that of the corticotropin releasing factor- 41 remained stable at all survival times after adrenalectomy. Moreover, observations for up to 5 weeks indicate that adrenalectomy results in a progressive increase in the mean volume of dense-core vesicles to about three times normal. These results suggest that the quantal size and the composition of dense-core vesicles are subject to long-term modulation. The capacity of corticotropin releasing factor- 41 neurons to alter dense-core vesicles could enhance or diminish the efficacy of the hypothalamohypophyseal communication underlying physiological adaptation to stress, as well as pathological changes...|$|R
