40|$|The {{escalation}} of global terrorism, which reached its climax with the September 11 attack, produced an answer built around an aggressive rhetoric used by Washington, Tel Aviv and Moscow {{to respond to}} XXI century’s threats. My thesis is aimed at being an analysis {{of one of the}} most controversial methods of counterterrorism: the targeted killings. This method consists of the use of the lethal force by an international subject with the purpose, premeditation and deliberate decision of killing certain individuals because of their role in a terrorist group or their moral approval of terror tactics. For time reasons, I restricted my research to the use of this counterterrorism method by the three main actors involved in the fight against terrorism: Israel, the United States and Russia. In the first part, I gave a general outline of the norms that regulate the conduct of the hostilities in what is universally recognized as “the war on terror”. From the analysis of the doctrine and the factual situations in which States find themselves combating, the logical conclusion is that the war on terror does not always comply with the standards imposed by International Humanitarian Law for the qualification of a war. This does not mean that, as part of the doctrine claims, the fight against terrorism must be considered as a third genus with regard to the traditional division between armed conflicts of international or non-international character. In my opinion the fight against terrorism must be divided in its components, identifying which of these have the characteristics of an armed conflict (and among these which are or are not international in character) and which should be, on the other hand, regulated by the model of law enforcement and its own norms. The thesis is therefore constructed on the analysis of the legitimacy of the method of targeted killing in these two components of the fight against terrorism. As for the use of targeted killings in the situations which comply with the definition of armed conflict, be it international in character or not, I proceeded by verifying the consonance of this method with the fundamental principles of International Humanitarian Law which regulate the conduct of hostilities. From this verification one could draw to the conclusion that targeted killings are a legitimate method of conducting the hostilities only in the cases when (i) they are directed against legitimate military targets, that are combatants or civilians who take direct part in the hostilities and only for the duration of this direct participation; (ii) they respect the principles of proportionality and precaution trough preventive measures aimed at reducing the damages caused to the civilian population by the military effort and trough the comparison between the foreseeable direct military advantage and the foreseeable collateral damages; (iii) they have been planned after a careful evaluation of the military necessity of the attack with regard to the defeat of the enemy and not the enemy’s killing, keeping into consideration that the mere suspect does not constitute a legal basis for an action; (iv) they have been planned after carefully taking into consideration the possibility of using <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>methods</b> in order to reach the same goal. In situations that do not comply with the definition of armed conflict, targeted killings must be regulated by strict norms which mostly derive from human rights norm in general and the right to life in particular. One should keep in mind that in extreme situations a State could find itself in the position of having to use the lethal force, as ultima ratio, in order to protect the life of innocent individuals from an imminent threat. This might happen because, even in situations that are different from the conduct of hostilities, what is absolutely forbidden is the arbitrary privation of life, not the privation of life in itself. In the law enforcement model, targeted killings are therefore strictly limited by absolute necessity and procedural duties. For the use of lethal force by a State against an individual to be legitimate in situations that cannot be qualified as armed conflict, certain cumulative conditions must be met: (i) the respect of the State law and International Law according to the law enforcement paradigm. (ii) the duty to carefully planning and investigate before and after the killing; (iii) the lethal force must not be used in order to kill but in order to punish; (iv) the use of the lethal force must be exclusively aimed at protecting human life from severe threats; (v) the use of the lethal force must be absolutely necessary from a qualitative, quantitative and temporal point of view; (vi) the death must be the ultima ratio, inevitable but not desired and certainly not the explicit aim of the operation. In this moment when the adequateness of International Humanitarian Law is questioned and when self-evident violations of human rights are carried out, I also decided to strongly underline the complementarities of these sets of rules, which both aim at protecting the individuals involved in a situation of violence. Combating terrorism requires new strategies, but cannot happen without respecting International Humanitarian Law and human rights: the States involved in the fight against terrorism must recognize that this is the only adequate and legitimate way to walk in order to eradicate the menace of terror without falling in an unstoppable spiral of violence. mémoire de fin d'études MA en Sciences Internationales, spécialisation en Sciences Diplomatiques.

40|$|Abstract – A {{technique}} {{was developed for}} dissection and isolation of male germ cells in the oyster Crassostrea gigas. This procedure can provide cells for the exploration of processes involved in the reproductive physiology of bivalves. Spermatogonia were chosen because of their essential role in spermatogenesis {{and the impact of}} gonia proliferation on reproductive effort. A <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>method</b> for determining sex and reproductive cycle stage was first validated in oysters. This first step was essential in order to constitute a homogeneous pool of oysters at the same stages of gametogenesis. Germ cell fractions were then obtained from a density gradient, and enrichment of each fraction was ratified by electron microscopy and by means of a 2 -parameter flow cytometry procedure (DNA and mitochondrial staining). A significant enrichment in spermatogonia and spermatocytes was confirmed by the increased expression of markers of proliferative cells (proliferative cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) and early germ cells (oyster vasa-like gene). A preliminary cell sorting procedure is also reported, which was applied to fractions enriched in spermatogonia...|$|R
25|$|These {{vehicles}} {{could be}} divided into three sub-categories. Modified trucks equipped with water cannons, modified stock cars and modified APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers). Their function is to help control riots. Modified stock cars will have caged windows for protection against objects thrown at them and could include mini-buses, 4x4s or prisoner transport vans. APCs usually will not require any added protection but their modifications might include some sort of tear gas ejecting method or shields that unfold to create barriers. The water cannon vehicles are used either to break up riots or extinguish fires set by the rioters. Although plain water is usually used some variations might include tear gas or special dye (to mark {{the people that are}} present for later apprehension). Previously fire trucks were used as anti-riot vehicles of this type. As a <b>non</b> <b>lethal,</b> and effective <b>method</b> of clearing out protesters or rioters, the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) can be used. The LRAD is a device that can send announcements, warnings, and harmful pain-inducing tones.|$|R

40|$|These last {{decades have}} seen the {{development}} of a new type of weapons, the <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> weapons. Unlike the conventional weapons which may cause severe or fatal injuries and whose injury mechanisms are well documented, the <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> weapons are designed for temporary incapacitation with reversible consequences or minor damage to the human body. They try therefore to fill the gap wherever the use of excessive forces or conventional weapons is not necessary. There are various <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> technologies but here we will focus on <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> kinetic energy weapons (NLKEW). The non penetrating characteristics of <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> projectiles lead to different injury mechanisms to those related to conventional lethal projectiles. In order to better understand these effects and assess the injury severity, experiments are carried out on Post Mortem Human Surrogates (PMHS), animals and mechanical anthropomorphic systems. Nevertheless nowadays with the development of high performance computing systems, numerical simulations based on finite element method are increasingly used because of their cost-effectiveness, their predictive capabilities and their adaptability (for example the possibility of adapting the geometry to take into account various morphologies, …). Physical injury is a consequence of the interaction between the human body and the projectile. To assess the severity of injury, injury criteria are defined. The most used criterion on the assessment of the thorax injury is the maximum viscous criterion. Because of the human body complexity, reliable information on injury mechanisms and tolerance level to the impact of <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> projectiles is limited. The major challenge in the numerical simulations is the human tissue material model as human tissue responses to impacts are various and complex. As a consequence, models which are biofidelic to the human living tissues are a key issue. To investigate and predict the human thorax response to the impact of the usual <b>non</b> <b>lethal</b> kinetic projectiles (like the FN 303, the 40 mm COUGAR), a finite element thorax model has been developed from thorax CT-scan images and the projectile FN 303 was used. The model was validated by using results (force-time and deflection-time characteristics of the thorax) from experiments on PHMS published in the litterature. Two types of projectiles made of polyvinyl chloride cylinder with 37 mm diameter and respectively 28. 5 mm and 100 mm long were used and the human tissue material models were found in open litterature...|$|R

Our recent studies aimed to develop an ecotoxicological protocol based on non destructive biomarkers to investigate the health status of this species. In a first study 53 live stranded and/or hospitalized specimens were sampled from four sites along the Italian coasts.
