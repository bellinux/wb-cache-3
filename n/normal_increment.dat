40|$|Eight hypoxic male {{patients}} with stable chronic obstructive airways disease were submitted for combined anterior pituitary function testing. All subjects showed normal growth hormone and essentially normal cortisol responses to adequate hypoglycaemia, two subjects showed delayed responses of {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} to administered thyrotrophin releasing hormone and all had basal prolactin levels within normal limits. Basal levels of luteinising hormone were significantly lower than {{in the group of}} age-matched controls (p less than 0. 02) but there was a <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> after the injection of gonadotrophin releasing hormone. Basal levels of follicle stimulating hormone were significantly lower than in the controls (p less than 0. 01), and there was also a reduced response from the pituitary after injection of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (p less than 0. 01). Resting levels of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine were normal while the expected subnormal testosterone level was observed (p less than 0. 05). These results show that hypoxia can produce abnormalities of hypothalamic-pituitary function and that these are primarily located in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Heart failure and {{diabetes}} mellitus are frequently associated, and diabetes appears to potentiate {{the clinical presentation}} of heart failure related to other causes. The purpose of this review is to examine recent advances {{in the application of}} tissue Doppler imaging for the assessment of diabetic heart disease. Recent findings Recent studies have documented that both myocardial systolic and diastolic abnormalities can be identified in apparently healthy patients with diabetes and no overt cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, these are disturbances of longitudinal function, with compensatory increases of radial function-suggesting primary involvement of the subendocardium, which is a hallmark of myocardial ischemia. Despite this, there is limited evidence that diabetic microangiopathy is responsible-with reduced myocardial blood volume rather than reduced resting flow, and at least some evidence suggesting a <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> of tissue velocity with stress. Finally, a few correlative studies have shown association of diabetic myocardial disease with poor glycemic control, while angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be protective. Summary Tissue Doppler imaging (and the related technique of strain rate imaging) appears to be extremely effective for the identification of subclinical LV dysfunction in diabetic patients It is hoped that the recognition of this condition will prompt specific therapy to prevent the development of overt LV dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Sister {{chromatid}} exchanges, {{which may}} reflect chromosome repair {{in response to}} certain types of DNA damage, provide a means of investigating the increased chromosome fragility characteristic of Fanconi's anemia. By a recently developed technique using 33258 Hoechst and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine, {{it was observed that}} the baseline frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from four males with Fanconi's anemia differed little from that of normal lymphocytes. However, addition of the bifunctional alkylating agent mitomycin C (0. 01 or 0. 03 mug/ml) to the Fanconi's anemia cells during culture induces {{less than half of the}} increase in exchanges found in identically treated normal lymphocytes. This reduced increment in exchanges in accompanied by a partial suppression of mitosis and a marked increase in chromatid breaks and rearrangements. Many of these events occur at sites of incomplete chromatid interchange. The increase in sister chromatid exchanges induced in Fanconi's anemia lymphocytes by the monofunctional alkylating agent ethylmethane sulfonate (0. 25 mg/ml) was slightly less than that in normal cells. Lymphocytes from two sets of parents of the patients with Fanconi's anemia exhibited a normal response to alkylating agents, while dermal fibroblasts from two different patients with Fanconi's anemia reacted to mitomycin C with an increase in chromatid breaks, but a nearly <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> of sister chromatid exchanges. The results suggest that chromosomal breaks and rearrangements in Fanconi's anemia lymphocytes may result from a defect in a form of repair of DNA damage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Fault step-overs with linking dip-slip faults {{are common}} {{features}} on long strike-slip fault systems worldwide. It {{has been noted}} by various researchers that under some circumstances, earthquakes can jump across fault step-overs to cascade into large events, while under other circumstances rupture is arrested at stepovers. There is also evidence that fault step-overs may be preferential locations for earthquake nucleation. The present work uses the 3 D finite element method to model the dynamics of strike-slip fault systems with step-overs and linking dip-slip faults. I find {{that the presence of}} a linking normal or thrust fault greatly increases the ability of earthquake rupture to propagate across the step-over, leading to a larger event. Additionally, dilational step-overs with linking normal faults are more prone to through-going rupture than compressional step-overs with linking thrust faults. This difference is due to the sign of the <b>normal</b> stress <b>increment</b> on the dip-slip fault caused by slip on the strike-slip segments: Slip on the strike-slip segments causes a negative (unclamping) <b>normal</b> stress <b>increment</b> on the linking normal fault in a dilational step-over, whereas the opposite effect occurs on the linking thrust fault in...|$|R

Land use, because of its impact on mercury inputs, has been highlighted as {{a key player in}} the sources and eventual concentrations of the heavy metal. In order to evaluate the impact of watershed disturbances on Hg {{dynamics in}} frequently fished, large boreal lakes, we studied sediment cores retrieved at the focal point of eight large lakes of Qu√©bec (Canada), six with watersheds affected by land uses such as logging and/or mining, and two with pristine watersheds, considered as reference lakes. Using a Geographical Information System (GIS), we correlated the recent evolution of land uses (e. g., logging and mining activities) and morphological characteristics of the watershed (e. g., mean slope of the drainage area, vegetation cover) to total Hg concentrations (THg) in sedimentary records. In each core, THg gradually increased over recent years with maximum values between 70 and 370 ng/g, the lowest mercury concentrations corresponding to the pristine lake cores. The Hg Anthropogenic Sedimentary Enrichment Factor (ASEF) values range from 2 to 15. Surprisingly, we noticed that the presence of intense land uses in the watershed does not necessarily correspond to noticeable increases of THg in lake sediments, beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> that can be attributed to Hg atmospheric deposition {{since the beginning of the}} industrial era. Rather, the terrestrial Hg inputs of boreal lakes appear to be influenced by watershed characteristics such as mean slopes and vegetation cover...|$|E

The increment in plasma renin activity (PRA) between supine and upright positions {{was used as an}} estimate of the acute stimulation of the adrenal gland by endogenous AII; the <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> in plasma aldosterone divided by the increment in PRA was > 3. 8. 7 of 19 had abnormal upright posture responses with significantly greater mean PRA increments (24 ¬± 6 ng/ml per h) and significantly smaller plasma aldosterone increments 47 ¬± 16 ng/dl) (P < 0. 036) compared to the increments observed in HREH patients with normal adrenal responsiveness (PRA = 15 ¬± 1 ng/ml per h; plasma aldosterone = 87 ¬± 17 ng/dl). When AII was infused at doses of 0. 1 - 3 ng/kg per min, only patients with normal posture responses had normal plasma aldosterone increments; plasma aldosterone levels failed to significantly increase even at the highest infusion rate in the patients with the abnormal upright posture responses. The AII competitive inhibitor, saralasin (0. 3 - 30 Œºg/kg per min) was then infused to study the occurrence of angiotensinogenic hypertension in both HREH subgroups. The mean decline in diastolic blood pressure to saralasin in the subnormal adrenal responsive patients (‚àí 15 ¬± 3 mm Hg) was significantly greater than in the normal adrenal responsive group (‚àí 3 ¬± 2 mm Hg) (P < 0. 02) ...|$|E
40|$|Natural killer cells {{capable of}} lysing {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV-Ij-infected fibro-blasts were studied in three groups of {{patients}} unusually susceptible to severe herpes-virus infections. Cord blood was evaluated because of the known susceptibility of neo-nates to disseminated infections due to herpes simplex virus type 2 at birth. Only 30 % of the cord blood specimens tested demonstrated normal lysis of HSV-l-Infected fibro-blasts and a <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> in the lysis of infected over uninfected cells. Five out of six patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) also {{were found to have}} abnor-mally low responses by these criteria. The one WAS patient with normal responses had had little difficulty with infections and had survived much longer than usual. Five pa-tients with severe herpesvirus infections and no known primary cellular immunode-ficiency had natural killer cell function significantly below normal (P < 0. 001). These data suggest that natural killer cells probably {{play an important role in}} human resis-tance to herpesvirus infection and that deficiencies of this system may result in unusual susceptibility to herpesvirus infections. Natural killer (NK) cells have been defined as non-T, non-B, nonmacrophage effector cells capable of lysing susceptible tumor targets without prior sensitization of the host [1]. NK cells have also been shown to lyse virus-infected normal [2, 3] and tumor [4] target cells as well as some appar-ently normal cells [I].

Approximately 50 % of the patients with idiopathic disease had isolated hGH deficiency; during therapy thyroid deficiency developed in five patients and cortisol deficiency in three. A similar increase in mean height velocity occurred in the first treatment phase for patients less than 12 years old (0. 93 plus or minus 0. 30 cm/mo) and those 12 years and older (0. 86 plus or minus 0. 29 cm/mo). Although subsequent courses of hGH therapy yielded significantly diminished response in both age groups, this diminution was not progressive: the height velocity of the younger patients returned to 0. 82 plus or minus 0. 26 cm/ml in the fifth therapy phase. The mean height velocity attained at the optimal dosage (0. 20 to 0. 29 units/kg three times per week) for each age group did not differ significantly. Despite therapy being carried out for only 6 months of the year, <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> ratios for height age and bone age against chronologic age were observed in the patients with idiopathic disease. In only four patients did treatment failure occur, and three of these were more than 20 years old. The addition of fluoxymesterone (10 mg/d) to the hGH therapeutic regimen (15 units/wk), when diminished response to hGH alone became evident, promoted an enhanced growth response in 9 of 11 older patients.

40|$|At present, the {{impairment}} of linear growth {{remains one of}} the major obstacles to successful social adaptation of children and adolescents with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), being the recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) a therapeutic option. We evaluated growth and body composition (BC) in 11 prepubertal patients (9 M/ 2 F; 3. 5 - 12. 8 y) with CRI and short stature and/or slow growth velocity treated with rhGh (0. 7 - 1. 0 IU/Kg/week) for 18 months. Anthropometry and BC, examined by a tetrapolar bioeletrical impedance, were evaluated before, 6, 12 and 18 months after rhGH treatment; biochemical examinations and bone age were assessed before, and after 6 and 12 months. Six months after the onset of rhGH, there was a significant increment of weight, height, growth velocity and lean mass, with a significant decrease of fat mass; 12 months after, there was only a significant increment of height. Between 6 and 12 months, an inversion of BC was observed, with significant increment of fat mass and decrease of lean mass. Between 12 and 18 months, BC recovered, with a significant increment of lean mass and correspondent decrease of fat mass. The residual renal function was preserved, as well as the <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> of bone age. In conclusion, rhGH administration for 18 months to children with CRI improved growth significantly and changed the BC, particularly in the first 12 months, with no side effects.

40|$|Most {{dicotyledonous}} {{species with}} secondary growth possess a single cylindrical vascular cambium. However, anomalous types are not uncommon. The various classification systems for anomalous patterns of secondary thickening are compared {{and the distribution}} of successive cambria in about 20 families of 13 orders is summarized. The distribution of this feature within the Phytolaccaceae is detailed including new observations showing successive cambia in Stegnosperma. Serial sections of different developmental stages of plant axes permitted precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular system. Macerations of increments adjacent to the plant of transverse sectioning allowed comparison of xylem-cell dimensions between successive increments, different parts of individual plants, and all three species. Comparisons between species reveal that S. cubense has secondary xylem with the largest diameter pores, longest vessel elements, longest fiber-tracheids, and largest diameter fiber-tracheid pits. S. watsonii has the greatest number of pores per square mm, smallest fiber-tracheid diameter, and the largest ratio of fiber-tracheid to vessel-element length. Pore diameter, fiber-tracheid length, and the ratio of fiber tracheid to vessel-element length were less in small stems than in large stems and less in large stems than in roots. Pores per square mm, fiber-tracheid diameter, and vessel-element length were more or less constant between small stems and roots. Most xylary cell dimensions remain constant between successive increments of wood at a given level. The anomalous cambia arise in the conjunctive tissue and function bidirectionally. They are first evident as dedifferentiated parenchyma and then as small fascicular areas. Tangential expansion of existing regions produces larger arcs and rings of vascular tissue. Radial and tangential interconnections between vascular bundles are common in Stegnosperma. Dye movement traced through the axis confirms the presence of a complex network. At the upper and lower limits of a given ring or arc of anomalous vascular tissue, a radial connection occurs with the adjacent inner increment. The resulting pattern is a series of concentric cylinders of cambial zones, which anastomose with inner layers at their top and bottom. The <b>normal</b> <b>increment</b> of secondary thickening is the innermost cylinder and each successive layer forms a shorter but wider sheath around the previous layers. The apical organization of Stegnosperma consists of four zones: tunica, central mother cells, peripheral, and pith-rib meristem. A cambium-like or transition zone was not observed. The primary shoot vasculature is described as open, lacking direct vascular connections between sympodia, and followed a 2 / 5 phyllotaxy. Patterns of differentiation in shoot apices are detailed. The organization of the root apex as determined from seedling studies is analyzed by the constituent histogens. The vasculature of seedlings was found to follow the common dicotyledonous pattern. The initiation of secondary growth in the hypocotyl and its acropetal development is also typical of other dicotyledons. Secondary growth ascends the shoot helically according to phyllotaxy. The vascular cambium descends in the root, first appearing opposite the phloem and then in the pericycle. These observations are discussed in light of their differences with earlier studies, compared with other Phytolaccaceae, and examined with regard to the physiological function of the anomaly.

There {{were no significant differences between}} the three metabolite-treated groups in length, periosteal or endosteal diameter, cortical cross-sectional area, cortical porosity, osteoid thickness and volume, appositional rate and bone formation rate in the femur, or in qualitative and quantitative indices of endochondral ossification in the tail vertebra. All three groups differed markedly from the untreated controls with respect to all measurements. Collectively, the data indicate that neither calcidiol nor any 24 -hydroxylated metabolite of calcidiol is needed in the rat (other than as a precursor) for longitudinal or transverse bone growth, for normal endochondral ossification, or for normal periosteal and endosteal formation, mineralization, and resorption of bone. Calcitriol was fully active with respect to each of the indices listed when given in a manner resembling its continuous endogenous production by the kidney, suggesting that previous reports of incomplete skeletal response to calcitriol result from its rapid clearance and infrequent oral administration. We demonstrated that calcitriol is the only metabolite that is both necessary and sufficient for normal bone growth and development in the rat, but our data do not indicate the extent to which its beneficial skeletal effects were mediated by direct action on bone, either of calcitriol itself or of some metabolite thereof, or by restoration of normal plasma levels of calcium and phosphate...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} impact of obesity on {{sympathetic}} nervous regulation of nutrient mobilization, obese rats and lean controls were subjected to physical exercise. Male Wistar rats, rendered obese by bilateral electrolytic lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) were subjected to 15 min swimming. Permanent cardiac catheters allowed frequent blood sampling. At rest, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), and insulin concentrations were elevated in the obese animals, whereas catecholamine levels were similar in both groups. During exercise, glucose concentrations reached higher values in the lesioned rats, whereas these animals did not display the <b>normal</b> FFA <b>increment.</b> Plasma insulin concentrations were suppressed in both groups, {{and the rate of}} suppression was very similar when expressed as percentage change from resting levels. There was no difference in plasma epinephrine responses during swimming, but the increase in norepinephrine was diminished in the obese animals. The results suggest that obesity after VMH lesion leads to reduced stimulation of lipolysis by norepinephrine and a predominant mobilization of glucose during exercise, both favoring glucose utilization and the accumulation of fat. ...|$|R

Retrospective study involved 436 singleton pregnancy women who delivered in Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) from 1 st January to 31 st December 2010. The subjects were stratified into four BMI group according to World Health Organization (WHO) (underweight - 2, normal: 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg m - 2, overweight: 25 - 30 kg m - 2 and obese: 30 kg m - 2). Each of BMI group then, classified into 3 categories of Gestational Weight Gain (GWG) (lower <b>increment,</b> <b>normal</b> and high <b>increment).</b> This classifying of GWG group was done according to the US Institute of Medicine (IOM), 2009 guidelines. Pregnancy outcome been analyzed according to the GWG during pregnancy for each BMI group and calculated the crude OR from simple logistic regression modules. 15. 1, 40. 1, 28. 7 and 16. 1 % of the subjects were underweight, normal BMI, overweight and obese, respectively. In normal BMI women, gestational age outcome and neonatal outcome {{were significantly associated with}} inadequate weight gain during pregnancy (p = 0. 046 and p = 0. 002). Among low GWG of normal BMI women, the crude OR for premature birth and low birth weight were 2. 872 and 4. 976 (95 % CI = 1. 009 - 8. 170 and 1. 316 - 18. 815), respectively compared with normal GWG. This study shows that normal BMI with lower GWG may result in adverse outcome. In addition, inadequate weight gain during pregnancy can result in significant complication...|$|R
40|$|The {{heart rate}} {{variability}} (HRV) of healthy subjects practicing relaxing visualization is studied by use of three multiscale analysis techniques: the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), the entropy in natural time (ENT) and the average wavelet (AWC) coefficient. The scaling exponent of <b>normal</b> interbeat interval <b>increments</b> exhibits characteristics {{of the presence of}} long-range correlations. During relaxing visualization the HRV dynamics change in the sense that two new features emerge independent of each other: a respiration-induced periodicity that often dominates the HRV at short scales (< 40 interbeat intervals) and the decrease of the scaling exponent at longer scales (40 - 512 interbeat intervals). In certain cases, the scaling exponent during relaxing visualization indicates the breakdown of long-range correlations. These characteristics have been previously seen in the HRV dynamics during non-REM sleep...|$|R
30|$|In 2008, Liu [16] {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} uncertain process for describing dynamic uncertain systems. Moreover, Liu [17] designed a Lipschitz continuous uncertain process with stationary and independent <b>normal</b> uncertain <b>increments,</b> which is called the canonical Liu process now. Chen and Ralescu [18] defined and discussed the Liu process and uncertain calculus. When the noise of system state evolution can be described by the Liu process, Liu [16] introduced uncertain differential equation. Chen and Liu [19] gave an existence and uniqueness theorem for an uncertain differential equation under linear growth and Lipschitz continuous condition. Yao and Chen [20] proposed a numerical method to solve uncertain differential equation. Besides, Yao [21] studied the integral of solution to uncertain differential equation. As an application of uncertain differential equation, Liu [22] presented a paradox of stochastic finance theory which showed that the real stock price was impossible to follow any Ito‚Äôs stochastic differential equation, and suggested a new uncertain finance theory which was described by an uncertain differential equation. Based on uncertainty theory and uncertain differential equation, Zhu [23] introduced uncertain optimal control and gave Zhu‚Äôs equation of optimality by means of uncertain differential equation. Due to his pioneering work, this paper aims to initialize a spectrum of uncertain differential game when the system dynamics of game is described by an uncertain differential equation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present paper aims at {{investigating}} numerically {{the control}} of a 155 mm spin-stabilized projectile using the Coanda effect. The flight Mach number ranges from M‚àû= 0. 7 to M‚àû= 2. 0. A tangentially blowing jet exits over a convex surface {{at the base of}} the projectile and creates flow asymmetry, which generates significant aerodynamic loads. First,Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes simulations are performed without projectile rotation. The jet extends 18 deg azimuthally, and numerous continuous blowing conditions are assessed. The variation of the normal force coefficient with respect to the jet momentum coefficient is presented for different freestream Mach numbers. The efficiency loss of the Coanda effect with supersonic jets is specifically discussed. Additionally, comparisons between overexpanded, adapted, and underexpanded supersonic jets are presented. In the second part, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, accounting for a 400 Hz projectile rotation, are performed. Both continuous and periodic blowing are assessed. A pulsed jet is used in phase with the rotation to always act in a 90 deg sector centered in the lift plane. The resulting normal force benefits are more important than in the non spinning case, and spin-averaged values lead to a non zero <b>normal</b> force <b>increment.</b> Then, four pulsed jets equally distributed along the circumference of the projectile are simulated to further improve the control efficiency. The jet separation process is also investigated to determine the influence of the jet on the base pressure distribution...|$|R
40|$|A time-variant autoregressive {{approach}} {{was used in}} order to evaluate the spectral parameters of the heart rate variability (HRV), through the all sleep stages, in both normal subjects and patients with severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Recordings coming from five normal and five pathologic subjects were analyzed in the study. The parameters of the autoregressive model were fixed for the entire night recordings: model order = 8 and forgetting factor = 0. 98. The classical spectral indexes of the Heart Rate Variability were normalized respect to the total power. The results in this study showed, in <b>normal</b> subjects, an <b>increment</b> in the HFn components in NREM, while pathologic subjects presented a reduced activity in this component in all the time, which suggest a low activation of the vagal nerve. Furthermore, in both groups of subjects, VLFn reached high levels during REM and wake than NREM. In conclusion, this method could offer an alternative approach, with high resolution and efficient computation in the spectral decompotition, {{in order to develop}} a classification of sleep stage and apnoea detectors from the HRV. 1...|$|R
40|$|Property and {{behaviour}} of sand-pile interface {{are crucial to}} shaft resistance of piles. Dilation or contraction of the interface soil induces change in normal stress, which in turn influences the shear stress mobilised at the interface. Although previous studies have demonstrated this mechanism by laboratory tests and numerical simulations, the interface responses are not analysed systematically in terms of soil state (i. e. density and stress level). The objective {{of this study is}} to understand and quantify any increase in normal stress of different pile-soil interfaces when they are subjected to loading and stress relief. Distinct element modelling was carried out. Input parameters and modelling procedure were verified by experimental data from laboratory element tests. Parametric simulations of shearbox tests were conducted under the constant normal stiffness, constant normal load and constant volume boundary conditions. Key parameters including initial normal stress (sigma'(n 0)), initial void ratio (e(0)), normal stiffness constraining the interface and loading-unloading stress history were investigated. It is shown that mobilised stress ratio (tau/sigma'(n)) and <b>normal</b> stress <b>increment</b> (Delta sigma'(n)) on a given interface are governed by sigma'(n 0) and e(0). An increase in sigma'(n 0) from 100 to 400 kPa leads to a 30 % reduction in Delta sigma'(n). An increase in e(0) from 0. 18 to 0. 30 reduces Delta sigma'(n) by more than 90 %, and therefore, shaft resistance is much lower for piles in loose sands. A unique relationship between Delta sigma'(n) and normal stiffness is established for different soil states. It can be applied to assess the shaft resistance of piles in soils with different densities and subjected to loading and stress relief. Fairly good agreement is obtained between the calculated shaft resistance based on the proposed relationship and the measured results in centrifuge model tests...|$|R

At admission he was pyretic and disoriented, no neurological signs were present and laboratory examination showed mild hyperammonemia with normal inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray demonstrated a probable pneumonia and urinary infection was found, therefore systemic antibiotic therapy was initiated. After one week of antibiotic therapy, despite hyperammonemia resolution, the patient remained pyretic with progressive worsening of his mental state. Head CT scan was performed, demonstrating a large hypodense area in temporal lobe confirmed by brain MRI. Lumbar puncture was immediately performed and CSF PCR revealed HSV 1 -DNA positivity. Antiviral therapy with acyclovir at dosage of 10 mg/kg daily was initiated and continued for three weeks with complete defervescence, partial improvement of the state of consciousness and negativity of HSV 1 -DNA on CSF control. Two months later the patient was hospitalized again for urinary sepsis and developed a fatal frontal-parietal-temporal cerebral empyema.

We find distinct differences between the statistics and scaling behaviors of data measured on faces parallel and normal to bedding, and of incremental measurements in three orthogonal directions along these faces. Whereas the distribution on of data and their increments parallel to bedding are heavy tailed, those of <b>increments</b> <b>normal</b> to bedding are Gaussian. Order q sample structure functions of increments parallel to bedding scale as powers xi(q) of directional lag, s(d), over limited ranges of s(d). Using moment and extended self-similarity methods of analysis we find xi(q) to be generally nonlinear in q, tending to be concave in q on faces normal to bedding and convex on faces parallel to bedding. Whereas the literature attributes nonlinear scaling of xi(q) with q to multifractals or fractional Laplace motions, we find the data to be consistent with sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated (monofractal, self-affine) fractional Gaussian noise. The increments exhibit negative statistical dependence (antipersistence) that varies with direction parallel to bedding and is more pronounced on faces parallel than normal to bedding...|$|R
