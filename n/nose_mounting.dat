50|$|He 162 A-3 — {{proposed}} upgrade with reinforced <b>nose</b> <b>mounting</b> twin 30 mm MK 108 cannons.|$|E
5000|$|Definitive Coastal Command {{variant of}} the GR.II with glazed <b>nose</b> <b>mounting</b> [...]50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun, Merlin XX or 22 engines, B-P A-type dorsal turret and extra {{long-range}} fuel tanks in fuselage. A ventral turret holding a single [...]50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun was mounted on most aircraft although some employed the ASV.Mk 3 radar in its place.|$|E
50|$|The APS-4 was {{originally}} developed as the ASH, a forward-aimed surface-search system. It was packaged into an underwing pod {{so it did}} not require room in the nose, and could be used on single engine aircraft like the TBM Avenger. It proved to have a useful interception function, and was modified {{to be able to}} scan up and down as well as just side to side. The Fleet Air Arm mounted it on the Fairey Firefly, which had the size to carry a radar operator and the performance to operate as a fighter. Some were also used on the Mosquito. Considerably later, a single Meteor, EE348, was fit with an APS-4 in a <b>nose</b> <b>mounting</b> as a test vehicle.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation (SA 14 FA, TWT 620) {{was conducted}} in the MSFC 14 -inch Trisonic Wind Tunnel (TWT) to determine the entry static stability of a 0. 00563 scale shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB). The primary objective {{was to determine the}} effects of four side mounted sting configurations and to improve the definition of the aerodynamic characteristics in the vicinity of the SRB entry trim point. Data were obtained for two 60 and two 90 degree side mounted stings and a straight <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> sting. The angle of attack range for the side-mounted stings was 100 to 170 degrees while that for the <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> sting was 150 to 170 degrees. The Mach number range consisted of 0. 6 to 3. 48. Except for the aft attach ring, no protuberances were considered and the side slip and roll angles were zero. The test model was scaled from the 142 -inch diameter SRB known as configuration 139 which was used during test TWT 572 (SA 5 F) ...|$|R
25|$|The F.9 Sparviero was a single-engined {{version of}} the earlier, twin-engined F.6 Airone, both Stelio Frati designs. The two {{aircraft}} shared many constructional details and had almost the same dimensions and weights, though the Sparviero's <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> engine extended the fuselage. Engine layout apart, the two were very similar in appearance; they also both failed to reach production and only one Airone and one Sparviero were built.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the MG-1 was steel {{framed and}} fabric {{covered with the}} exception of a glass fibre engine cowling. This housed a conventionally <b>nose</b> <b>mounted,</b> 74.5 kW (100 hp) flat four Continental O-200 piston engine driving a non-retractable propeller. Its cockpit seated two side by side under a rearward sliding canopy. The conventional undercarriage had main wheels with rubber cord shock absorbers and brakes, assisted by a steerable tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The Hughes AN/ASB-19 Angle Rate Bombing System (ARBS) is an {{avionics}} system originally designed for US Marine Corps attack aircraft to improve {{day and night}} bombing accuracy when operating in the close support role using unguided weapons. Externally or <b>nose</b> <b>mounted,</b> ARBS is a target designator which weighs less than 63 kg (140 lb) and includes an automatic scan laser and a pilot-controlled tracking television, both using a common optical system.|$|R
2500|$|In 1940, the British Direct Purchase Commission in the U.S. {{was looking}} for combat aircraft; they ordered 675 of the export version Bell Model 14 as the [...] "Caribou" [...] on the {{strength}} of the company's representations on 13 April 1940. The British armament was two <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> 0.50in (12.7mm) machine guns, and four 0.303in (7.7mm) Browning machine guns in the wings; the 37mm gun was replaced by a 20mm (.79in) Hispano-Suiza cannon.|$|R
25|$|The USAAF later ordered 310 P-51As, {{which were}} {{essentially}} A-36s without the dive-brakes and <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> weapons, leaving an armament of four wing-mounted 0.50in (12.7mm) Browning machine guns. An Allison V-1710-81 1,200hp (895kW) was fitted {{and used the}} same radiator and air intake as the A-36A. The P-51A was still fitted with bomb racks {{although it was not}} intended to be used primarily as a fighter-bomber and the racks were mainly used to carry drop tanks.|$|R
25|$|At Hunter Field, the {{squadron}} converted to the Douglas A-20A Havoc. The 8th {{was the first}} USAAF squadron to receive the new aircraft, which was a low- and medium-altitude attack bomber designed to provide close air support to infantry forces. The A-20, which the group would fly during World War II, represented a considerable technological advance. The A-20A carried 1,100 pounds of bombs and was armed with four 30-caliber <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> machine guns and another five in turrets.|$|R
50|$|The Fernic T-9 {{can be seen}} as a {{conventional}} twin engined monoplane with the addition of a 22 ft long <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> canard foreplane to provide two lifting surfaces in tandem. The canard was designed to stall ahead of the main wing, reducing the risk of stalling or spinning the entire aircraft. The plywood covered aircraft also featured tricycle landing gear with a castering nose wheel. A spring steel tail skid was added to protect the tail.|$|R
50|$|Only one {{production}} variant was built, {{the standard}} An-22. Prototypes, {{such as the}} one first featured at the 1965 Paris Air Show had fully glazed noses that lacked the <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> radar of production models. Those aircraft had the radar mounted below the right wheel well fairing, forward of the wheels. Antonov designated a variant with a modified electrical system and an additional augmented flight control system the An-22A but the designation was not used by the military.|$|R
50|$|The USAAF later ordered 310 P-51As, {{which were}} {{essentially}} A-36s without the dive-brakes and <b>nose</b> <b>mounted</b> weapons, leaving an armament of four wing-mounted 0.50 in (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns. An Allison V-1710-81 1,200 hp (895 kW) was fitted {{and used the}} same radiator and air intake as the A-36A.
