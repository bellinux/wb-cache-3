60|$|In a large {{majority}} of these twenty cases, a varying degree of inflection was slowly caused by the phosphate. In four cases, however, the inflection was rapid, occurring in less than half an hour or at most in 50 m. In three cases the phosphate did not produce the least effect. Now what are we to infer from these facts? We know from ten trials that immersion in distilled water for 24 hrs. prevents the subsequent action of the phosphate solution. It would, therefore, appear as if the solutions of chloride of manganese, tannic and tartaric acids, which are not poisonous, acted exactly like water, for the phosphate produced no effect on the leaves which had been previously immersed in these three solutions. The majority of the other solutions behaved to a certain extent like water, for the phosphate produced, after a considerable interval of time, only a slight effect. On the other hand, the leaves which had been immersed in the solutions of the chloride of rubidium and magnesium, of acetate of strontium, nitrate of barium, and citric acid, were quickly acted on by the phosphate. Now was water absorbed from these five weak solutions, and yet, owing to the presence of the salts, did not prevent the subsequent action of the phosphate? Or [page 216] may we not suppose* that the interstices of the walls of the glands were blocked up with the molecules of these five substances, so that they were rendered impermeable to water; for had water entered, we know from the ten trials that the phosphate would not afterwards have produced any effect? It further appears that the molecules of the carbonate of ammonia can quickly pass into glands which, from having been immersed for 20 m. in a weak solution of sugar, either absorb the phosphate very slowly or are acted on by it very slowly. On the other hand, glands, however they may have been treated, seem easily to permit the subsequent entrance of the molecules of carbonate of ammonia. Thus leaves which had been immersed in a solution (of one part to 437 of water) of <b>nitrate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> for 48 hrs.--of sulphate of potassium for 24 hrs.--and of the chloride of potassium for 25 hrs.--on being placed in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, had their glands immediately blackened, and after 1 hr. their tentacles somewhat inflected, and the protoplasm aggregated. But it would be an endless task to endeavour to ascertain the wonderfully diversified effects of various solutions on Drosera.|$|E
5000|$|The storm {{glass or}} {{chemical}} weather glass was an instrument which was proposed {{as a method}} for predicting weather.

40|$|The {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> chloride (KCl) as {{a temporary}} clay stabilizing additive in water-based drilling fluids is problematic in chloride-sensitive formations. However, failure to utilize clay stabilization leads to additional costs to drilling operations due to wellbore stability and drilling fluid residual problems.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a new, high performance water-based fluid system using <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> chloride as the clay stabilizing additive for drilling applications. Water-based drilling fluids using potassium nitrate and potassium chloride, respectively, were prepared with a density of 1. 3 S. G. using various weighting materials. Capillary suction time (CST) test was used to optimize the potassium salt concentration in drilling fluids for effective clay swelling inhibition. HPHT filtration tests under static and dynamic conditions were conducted at 250 ?F and 300 psi. Berea sandstone cores with an average porosity of 23 vol% and an average permeability of 50 md were used in the filtration tests. The rheological properties, the volume of filtrate, and the filter cake thickness of the water-based drilling fluids were determined and compared. The CST tests show that potassium nitrate performs comparably to potassium chloride as a clay stabilizer. However, the water-based drilling fluid containing potassium nitrate has better rheological properties than that containing potassium chloride. The HPHT filtration press tests show that water-based drilling fluid with potassium nitrate has a low filtration volume, less than 1 mL out of a total solution of 200 - 250 mL, when using barite as the weighting material. This paper not only highlights the successful replacement of KCl by KNO 3 to achieve good rheological properties in water-based drilling fluids, but also shows that KNO 3 -based drilling fluids are more economical as well as environmentally friendly than KCl-based drilling fluids in drilling waste management...|$|R

Application was every 20 days, using a localised irrigation system with emitters having a nominal flow rate of 4 L h- 1 and spaced 0. 40 m apart.

The solution was collected by means of porous capsule extractors at 30, 120 and 210 days from the start of vinasse application.

40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{has been}} used to analyze root surface changes when Dayton barley (Hordeum vulgare) (Al tolerant) and Kearney barley (Al sensitive) seedlings were grown in nutrient solution in the presence and absence of 37. 0 micromolar Al. The electron spectra from root surfaces contained strong lines in order of decreasing intensity from organic forms of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen and weak lines due to inorganic elements in the form of anions and cations on the surface. The surface composition of root tips from Kearney was C, 65. 6 %; 0, 26. 8 %; N, 4. 4 % and tips from Dayton was C, 72. 7 %; O, 23. 6 %; N, 1. 9 %, grown in the absence of aluminum. Electron lines characteristic <b>of</b> <b>nitrate,</b> <b>potassium,</b> chloride, phosphate were also present in the spectra from those roots. Dayton roots grown in the presence of 37. 0 micromolar aluminum contained 2. 1 % aluminum while Kearney contained 1. 3 % aluminum. The ratio of aluminum to phosphate was close to 1. 0. Dayton roots usually contained twice as much aluminum phosphate in the surface region as Kearney. Dayton may be less susceptible to Al toxic effects by accumulation of aluminum phosphate on the root surface which then acts as a barrier to the transport of aluminum into the interior of the roots...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{quality was}} {{monitored}} in four Spanish caves using concentrations <b>of</b> <b>nitrate,</b> <b>potassium,</b> phosphorus {{and in some}} cases total organic carbon. Three of the caves are located in NW Spain and contain prehistoric cave paintings and hence have special conservation interest. Of these, two are open show caves (Tito Bustillo and Pindal Caves), while the other one (Herrerías Cave) is not managed for tours and is partially closed off to public access. The fourth cave (Las Maravillas Cave) is located in SW Spain and is opened to the public because of its geological features and natural beauty. In this paper, we compare two sampling methodologies used in the four caves. In Pindal and Herrerias Cave high temporal resolution is achieved with a dripwater collector that collects discrete samples every 48 hours. In Tito Bustillo and Las Maravillas Caves a higher spatial resolution is achieved (16 sampling points in each one), but with a frequency of sampling ranging from 15 days to 6 months. Wastewater and livestock waste appear to be the principal sources of contamination to cave waters. Caves with concentrated livestock (stables) or urban and residential wastewater systems directly situated above the cave exhibit the highest level of contamination detected in elevated concentrations of nitrogen species {{and in some cases}} depressed oxygen availability in waters...|$|R
40|$|The work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> rates on the yield of yam (Dioscorea cayennensis) and determine your rate for the productivity of commercial tubers. The experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Paraíba, in Areia-PB, in the period from February to December 2010. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks with six treatments comprise the doses of 0; 50; 100; 150; 200 and 250 kg ha- 1 <b>of</b> <b>potassium,</b> in four repetitions. Were evaluated the average mass of commercial tubers, productivity of commercial tubers, percentage of tubers classified as first, the leaf content <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> in the leaves and the maximum rate of economic efficiency. The maximum average mass of commercial tubers was 2. 60 kg, obtained at rate of 126 kg ha- 1 <b>of</b> <b>potassium.</b> The rate <b>of</b> 189 kg ha- 1 <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> was responsible for maximum productivity commercial of 17. 7 ha- 1 t of tubers.
