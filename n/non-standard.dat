5|$|Aspartate, glycine, and {{glutamine}} are precursors of nucleotides. However, {{not all of}} {{the functions}} of other abundant <b>non-standard</b> amino acids are known.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s {{other ideas}} were {{proposed}} as <b>non-standard</b> cosmologies to explain Hubble's observations, including the Milne model, the oscillatory universe (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and Richard Tolman) and Fritz Zwicky's tired light hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a <b>non-standard</b> or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a <b>non-standard</b> feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although {{it is widely believed}} that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker.|$|E
5|$|Restaurants in Israel {{have come}} up with {{creative}} alternatives to ḥametz ingredients to create pasta, hamburger buns, pizza, and other fast foods in kosher-for-Passover versions by using potato starch and other <b>non-standard</b> ingredients.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called <b>non-standard</b> or non-canonical. Most of the <b>non-standard</b> amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>non-standard</b> proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are selenocysteine (present in many non-eukaryotes {{as well as}} most eukaryotes, but not coded {{directly}} by DNA) and pyrrolysine (found only in some archaea and one bacterium). The incorporation of these <b>non-standard</b> amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element.|$|E
5|$|There are cables with A plugs on both ends, {{which may}} be valid if the cable includes, for example, a USB host-to-host {{transfer}} device with 2 ports, but they could also be <b>non-standard</b> and erroneous and should be used carefully.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and <b>non-standard</b> body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{in order}} to correct {{pigmentation}} often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, {{some of which are}} recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation <b>non-standard</b> yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.|$|E
5|$|In addition, many <b>non-standard</b> {{amino acids}} have a {{specific}} code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as Bortezomib and MG132, are artificially synthesized and retain their protecting groups, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is Pyz-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid {{in the analysis of}} protein structure, photo-reactive amino acid analogs are available. These include photoleucine (pLeu) and photomethionine (pMet).|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", <b>non-standard</b> gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E
5|$|Middleton died in Baton Rouge on 9 October 1976, {{three days}} before his 87th birthday. His wife, Jerusha, died on 16 March 1980, aged 89, and both were interred in the Baton Rouge National Cemetery, sharing a tall granite marker, {{one of the few}} <b>non-standard</b> markers in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|One {{specific}} type of <b>non-standard</b> Type Ia supernova develops hydrogen, and other, emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal Type Ia and a Type IIn supernova. Examples are SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj. These supernova have been dubbed Type Ia/IIn, Type Ian, Type IIa and Type IIan.|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} ain't is a {{continuing}} subject of controversy in English. Ain't is commonly used by many speakers in oral and informal settings, especially in certain regions and dialects. Its usage is often highly stigmatized, {{and it can be}} used by the general public as a marker of low socio-economic or regional status or education level. Its use is generally considered <b>non-standard</b> by dictionaries and style guides except when used for rhetorical effect.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no formal}} {{sub-classification}} for the <b>non-standard</b> Type Ia supernovae. It {{has been proposed}} {{that a group of}} sub-luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as Type Iax. This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star.|$|E
5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, <b>non-standard</b> or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These <b>non-standard</b> design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced as commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called <b>non-standard</b> models); the {{compactness}} theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|English {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the National Language Act of 1967. In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside Malaysian. Historically, English was {{the de facto}} administrative language, with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English, {{is a form of}} English derived from British English. Malaysian English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of <b>non-standard</b> Malay but has no power to issue compounds or fines to those who use improper Malay on their advertisements.|$|E
5|$|On Dell and Toshiba laptops, {{the port}} is {{marked with the}} {{standard}} USB symbol with an added lightning bolt icon on the right side. Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a <b>non-standard</b> symbol (the letters USB over a drawing of a battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (putting it into sleep mode) and have the device continue to charge.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a <b>non-standard</b> USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>non-standard</b> {{amino acids}} {{are used as}} {{defenses}} against herbivores in plants. For example, canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes, and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia gladiata (sword bean). This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing. The non-protein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of legume, in particular Leucaena leucocephala. This compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants.|$|E
5|$|The organization's poultry {{conservation}} {{list includes}} chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys. As of 2011 there are 54 chicken breeds on the CPL: 12 {{in the critical}} category, 12 in the threatened, 18 in the watch, 7 in the recovering and 5 in the study. For ducks there were fourteen breeds, of which six were considered critical, two threatened, four watch and two study. There were 12 breeds of geese: six in the critical category, one in threatened, three in watch and two study. For turkeys there were 13 breeds, including five considered critical, two threatened, five watch and one study. Any naturally mating, <b>non-standard</b> turkey breed is also {{of interest to the}} organization.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. <b>Non-standard</b> computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem {{was the subject of}} an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992–1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge is publicly available.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was {{very similar to that}} in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other <b>non-standard</b> variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ship}} unable to {{decrease}} speed below warp 5, and the warp core reaching dangerous levels, Columbia and Commander Tucker rendezvous to provide assistance. However the crew realise that the transporter {{cannot be used}} at warp, so the ships will need to maneuver in close proximity in order for Tucker to be transferred. Captain Archer releases Lieutenant Reed from the brig to perform the transfer. Once on Enterprise, Tucker successfully performs a rapid <b>non-standard</b> cold boot on the warp engine, which purges the Klingon subroutines.|$|E
5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a <b>non-standard</b> dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the <b>non-standard</b> value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a <b>non-standard</b> feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>non-standard</b> USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating}} in a proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
5|$|The divisional {{insignia}} was a {{sun with}} 16 rays, the ancient {{symbol of the}} Macedonian king Alexander the Great. A divisional collar patch bearing the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the Bácska region {{during the summer of}} 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear of the division was the SS M43 fez: a field gray model to be worn with service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members of the division that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. These <b>non-standard</b> uniform items continued to be worn by members of the division after they became part of the 31st SS Division in October 1944.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{heads-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus' helmet, and {{features}} a radar, map, ammunition gauge and health meter. The player can change visors to enable new abilities such as X-ray vision, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Corruption also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has {{the addition of the}} Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After a certain amount of time, the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a <b>non-standard</b> game over due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} language is Modern Standard Arabic, a literary language {{taught in the}} schools. Most Jordanians natively speak one of the <b>non-standard</b> Arabic dialects known as Jordanian Arabic. Jordanian Sign Language {{is the language of}} the deaf community. English, though without official status, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the de facto language of commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education sector; almost all university-level classes are held in English and almost all public schools teach English along with Standard Arabic. Chechen, Circassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are popular among their communities. French is offered as an elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector. German is an increasingly popular language; it has been introduced at a larger scale since the establishment of the German-Jordanian University in 2005.|$|E
5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the <b>non-standard</b> accounting practice of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from the financial aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E
5|$|When {{taken up}} into the human body from the diet, the 20 {{standard}} amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the <b>non-standard</b> amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the standard BBN scenario there are numerous <b>non-standard</b> BBN scenarios. These {{should not be confused}} with <b>non-standard</b> cosmology: a <b>non-standard</b> BBN scenario assumes that the Big Bang occurred, but inserts additional physics in order to see how this affects elemental abundances. These pieces of additional physics include relaxing or removing the assumption of homogeneity, or inserting new particles such as massive neutrinos.|$|E
