2500|$|During {{embryonic}} development these {{inner cell mass}} cells continuously {{divide and}} become more specialized. [...] For example, {{a portion of the}} ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as 'neurectoderm', which will become the future central nervous system. [...] Later in development, neurulation causes the neurectoderm to form the neural tube. [...] At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes encephalization to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain. [...] At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell.</b> [...] These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics. [...] The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called neurogenesis. [...] One prominent example of a <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> is the radial glial cell, so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some glial characteristics, most notably the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). [...] The radial glial cell is the primary <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> of the developing vertebrate CNS, and its cell body resides in the ventricular zone, adjacent to the developing ventricular system. [...] Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), and thus their potency is restricted.|$|E
2500|$|Electrospinning {{provides}} a robust platform {{for development of}} synthetic nerve guidance conduits. Electrospinning can serve to create scaffolds at controlled dimensions with varying chemistry and topography. Furthermore, different materials can be encapsulated within fibers including particles, growth factors, and even cells. [...] Electrospinning creates fibers by electrically charging a droplet of polymer melt or solution and suspending it from a capillary. Then, an electric field is applied {{at one end of}} the capillary until the charge exceeds the surface tension, creating a polymer jet that elongates and thins. This polymer jet discharges as a Taylor cone, leaving behind electrically charged polymers, which are collected on a grounded surface as the solvent as the solvent evaporates from the jets. [...] Fibers have been spun with diameters ranging from less than 3nm to over 1µm. The process is affected by system parameters such as polymer type, polymer molecular weight, and solution properties and by process parameters such as flow rate, voltage, capillary diameter, distance between the collector and the capillary, and motion of the collector. The fibrous network created is unordered and contains a high surface-to-volume ratio as a result of a high porosity; a large network surface area is ideal for growth and transport of wastes and nutrients in neural tissue engineering. The two features of electrospun scaffolds that are advantageous for neural tissue engineering are the morphology and architecture, which closely mimics the ECM, and the pores, which are the correct range of sizes that allows nutrient exchange but prevents in growth of glial scar tissue (around 10µm). Random electrospun PLLA scaffolds have been demonstrated to have increased cell adhesion, which may be due to an increased surface roughness. [...] Chemically modified electrospun fiber mats have also been shown to influence <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and increase cell proliferation. In the past decade, scientists have also developed numerous methods for production of aligned nanofiber scaffolds, which serve to provide additional topographic cues to cells. This is advantageous because large scale three-dimensional aligned scaffolds cannot be created easily using traditional fabrication techniques. In a study conducted by Yang et al. (2005), aligned and random electrospun poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microfibrous and nanofibrous scaffolds were created, characterized, and compared. Fiber diameters were directly proportional to the initial polymer concentration used for electrospinning; the average diameter of aligned fibers was smaller than that of random fibers under identical processing conditions. It was shown that neural stem cells elongated parallel to the aligned electrospun fibers. The aligned nanofibers had a longer average neurite length compared to aligned microfibers, random microfibers, and random nanofibers. In addition, more cells differentiated on aligned nanofibers than aligned microfibers. Thus, the results of this study demonstrated that aligned nanofibers may be more beneficial than nonaligned fibers or microfibers for promoting nerve regeneration.|$|E

40|$|Preferential {{migration}} of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> toward {{the site of}} a lesion is a highly desirable property of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that allows flexibility in the site of graft implantation in the damaged brain.

In this study, we demonstrate that by pre-labelling <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> with the bimodal contrast agent Gadolinium-RhodamIne Dextran [GRID, detectable by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescent microscopy], the transhemispheric migration of transplanted <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> contralateral to a stroke lesion can be followed in vivo by serial MRI and corroborated by subsequent histological analyses.

In contrast, <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> transplanted into sham controls did not show any substantial migration outside of the injection tract, suggesting that the transcallosal migration observed in the stroke-lesioned animals is due to <b>neural</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> being attracted by the lesion site.
