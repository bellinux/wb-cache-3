However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] I assume because I sound like a man sometimes?

500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. <b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about it. I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E
500|$|No.30 Communications Unit was {{headquartered}} at Iwakuni, {{along with}} the rest of No.91 Wing's components except No.77 Squadron, which was based on the Korean peninsula. It was initially commanded, unofficially, by Flight Lieutenant (later Air Commodore) Dave Hitchens. According to Hitchens, [...] "Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron, I assumed control but had no formal authority to do so, but <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to stop." [...] The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, operating under his direction. [...] During November 1950, the unit received another four Dakotas from No.38 Squadron (of No.90 (Composite) Wing in Malaya), giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers. It supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs. Unlike No.77 Squadron, it was not tasked by the US Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan. In December 1950 the unit undertook [...] "Operation Haggis", the delivery of [...] of haggis to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders based in Suwon, Korea. The same month, a United States Air Force Mustang taking off from Suwon smashed into the cockpit of one of the Dakotas; none of the Australian crew was injured but the aircraft had to be written off and stripped for components by No.491 Squadron.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, <b>nobody</b> ever <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, {{there was}} {{a plan for a}} {{significant}} number of public ceremonies where Tuareg slaveholders would formally free their slaves. The government initially co-sponsored a prominent event in which Arissal Ag Amdagu, a Tuareg chief in Inates, Tillabéri Department would free 7,000 of his slaves. However, apparently fearing bad publicity, right before the event happened, the government sent a delegation through the Tuareg areas threatening punishment for any public manumissions. The government claimed that the public ceremony was changed because no one is enslaved in the country anymore so it was not necessary. Although Ag Amagdagu had signed a pledge with Timidria that he would free these 7,000 slaves, he instead said at the event that [...] "Slavery doesn’t exist in Inates ... <b>Nobody</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they have seen slaves.

It is still not clear whether PBHs formed but, if they did, they could provide a unique probe of the early Universe, gravitational collapse, high energy physics and quantum gravity. Indeed their study may place interesting constraints on the physics relevant to these areas even if they never existed.

At {{the time he was a}} guest professor at NORDITA and I was a research fellow at the Institute of Astronomy. It was a particularly important period for Katsu because he had just written his famous paper on inflation (arguably the first paper on the topic, although its publication was delayed). I remember our first meeting very vividly: he came to my office and asked to take my photograph because he said I was famous. <b>Nobody</b> had ever <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was famous before, so I was quite chuffed!

I tried to emulate them. I watched them, tried to do everything that they did, and failed utterly. The breaker swept past, and I was not on it. I tried again and again.

Did not I secretly tell thee at such a time, in such a place, when thou wast doing of such a thing, with such an one, or when thou was all alone, that this was a sin, and that God did forbid it, therefore if thou didst commit it, God would be displeased with thee for it: and when thou was thinking to do such a thing at such a time, did not I say, Forbear, do not so? God will smite thee, and punish thee for it if thou dost do it. And besides, God did so order it that you had me in your houses, in your Bibles, and also you could speak and talk of me; thus pleading the truth, thou shalt be forced to confess it is so; nay, it shall be so in some sort with the very Gentiles and barbarous people that fall far short of that light we have in these parts of the world; for, saith the Apostle, [...] "The Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law," [...] that is, not written as we have, yet they [...] "are a law unto themselves: which show the works of the law written in their hearts" [...] (Rom 2:14,15).

[...] Ay, but when? Why, [...] "in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel" [...] (Rom 2:15,16).
