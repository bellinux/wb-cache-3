5000|$|A further problem occurs when, {{after hearing}} his partner's response, {{the player who}} bid 4NT wants to stop in 5NT — as this is a forcing bid asking for Kings. A common {{agreement}} {{is that the first}} <b>non-suit</b> asks responder to bid 5NT. Whenever the first <b>non-suit</b> is a [...] "queen ask", then the next <b>non-suit</b> asks to bid 5NT. This has to be planned in advance as if there is no such space partners have to bid a usually unmakeable slam contract.|$|E

50|$|If you {{can make}} a couple of spaces you can sort many <b>non-suit</b> {{sequences}} into suit sequences. Making four spaces pretty much guarantees a win. Finding columns all of whose cards can be built on others is therefore a good tactic.|$|E
50|$|For felonies or {{when the}} {{plaintiff}} has insufficient evidence, he may refer to an investigating judge (juge d'instruction) who will investigate the case, and refer it to the trial court (in which he does not sit) if he discovers sufficient evidence of guilt. The investigating judge is independent from the public prosecutor's office, and may refer {{the case to the}} trial court even if the public prosecutor requested <b>non-suit.</b>|$|E
50|$|If the {{defendant}} is convicted, the criminal court can sentence him to pay damages to the plaintiff for the criminal offence, and to reimburse his legal costs, {{in addition to the}} criminal punishment. But if the private prosecution or the referral to the investigating judge is regarded as abusive, the plaintiff may be sentenced to pay damages to the accused and a civil fine to the state by the criminal court. The civil fine may even be inflicted by the investigating judge ordering the <b>non-suit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scoring for the {{additional}} <b>non-suit</b> contracts is {{fundamentally different from}} that for suit contracts, as the pot is not touched. The value of a contract is 10 units for misère, 20 units for slam, 30 units for open misère and 40 units for open slam. In contrast to ordinary suit contracts, these values are doubled if the hand version is played. The resulting value is paid by the declarer to each defender, or by each defender to the declarer, depending on whether declarer made it or not.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ajaxo raised five matters on appeal. In the first case, Ajaxo {{claims that the}} court {{committed}} a mistake by allowing the defendants' motion for nonsuit on damages resulting from their misappropriation of Ajaxo's trade secret technology. In the second case, the court committed a mistake by allowing the defendants' motion for nonsuit on Ajaxo's claim for a fair royalty due to wrongful enrichment. In the third case, Ajaxo was denied extra compensation due to damages because of a mistake committed by the court in allowing the defendants' <b>non-suit</b> on damages. In the fourth case, there was an error committed by the trial court in rejecting injunctive relief to Ajaxo. In the last case, Ajaxo claimed that the court had committed an error by not asking the defendants {{to compensate for the}} attorney fees involved in pre-trial work.|$|E

40|$|Reported herein are {{results from}} the Eril Research, Inc. (ERI) {{participation}} in the JSC-sponsored study characterizing the radiation shielding properties of {{the two types of}} space suit that astronauts are wearing during the EVA on-orbit assembly of ISS. Measurements using passive detectors were carried out to assess the shielding properties of the U. S. EMU Suit and the Russian Orlan-M suit during irradiations of the suits and a tissue-equivalent phantom to monoenergetic proton and electron beams at LLUMC. During irradiations of 6 MeV electrons and 60 MeV protons, absorbed dose as a function of depth was measured using TLDs exposed behind swatches of the two suit materials and inside the two EVA helmets. Considerable reduction in electron dose was measured behind all suit materials in exposures to 6 MeV electrons. Slowing of the proton beam in the suit materials led to an increase in dose measured in exposures to 60 MeV protons. During 232 MeV proton irradiations, measurements were made with TLDs and CR- 39 PNTDs at five organ locations inside a tissue-equivalent phantom, exposed both with and without the two EVA suits. The EVA helmets produce a 13 % to 27 % reduction in total dose and a 0 % to 25 % reduction in dose equivalent when compared to measurements made in the phantom head alone. Differences in dose and dose equivalent between the suit and <b>non-suit</b> irradiations for the lower portions of the two EVA suits tended to be smaller. Proton-induced target fragmentation was found to be a significant source of increased dose equivalent, especially within the two EVA helmets, and average quality factor inside the EMU and Orlan-M helmets was 2 % to 14 % greater than that measured in the bare phantom head...|$|E
