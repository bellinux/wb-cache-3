40|$|The {{diabatic}} {{approach to}} collective nuclear motion is reformulated in the local-density approximation {{in order to}} treat the normal modes of a spherical <b>nuclear</b> <b>droplet</b> analytically. In a first application the adiabatic isoscalar modes are studied and results for the eigenvalues of compressional (bulk) and pure surface modes are presented as function of density and temperature inside the droplet, {{as well as for}} different mass numbers and for soft and stiff equations of state. We find that the region of bulk instabilities (spinodal regime) is substantially smaller for nuclear droplets than for infinite nuclear matter. For small densities below 30 % of normal nuclear matter density and for temperatures below 5 MeV all relevant bulk modes become unstable with the same growth rates. The surface modes have a larger spinodal region, reaching out to densities and temperatures way beyond the spinodal line for bulk instabilities. Essential experimental features of multifragmentation, like fragmentation temperatures and fragment-mass distributions (in particular the power-law behavior) are consistent with the instability properties of an expanding <b>nuclear</b> <b>droplet,</b> and hence with a dynamical fragmentation process within the spinodal regime of bulk and surface modes (spinodal decomposition).

40|$|Results on {{dissipative}} isoscalar {{modes of}} a hot and dilute <b>nuclear</b> <b>droplet</b> are presented. As compared to the adiabatic limit (part I), realistic dissipation yields a substantial reduction of the growth rates for all unstable modes, while the area of spinodal instability in the (q, T) -plane remains unchanged. The qualitative features of multifragmentation through spinodal decomposition as obtained in the adiabatic limit are not significantly affected affected by dissipation. (orig.)

40|$|We {{systematically}} {{investigate the}} neutron-skin thickness of neutron-rich nuclei within a compressible droplet model, which includes several parameters characterizing the surface tension and {{the equation of}} state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as corrections due to the surface diffuseness. Such a systematic analysis helps towards constraining the EOS parameters of asymmetric nuclear matter and the poorly known density dependence of the surface tension; the latter is estimated with help of available experimental data for the neutron and proton density distributions and the nuclear masses. Validity of the present approach is confirmed by calculating realistic density distributions of Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn, Yb, and Pb isotopes within a microscopic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS method for various sets of the effective nuclear force. Our macroscopic model accompanied by the diffuseness corrections works well {{in the sense that}} it well reproduces the evolution of the microscopically deduced neutron-skin thickness with respect to the neutron number for selected sets of the effective nuclear force. We find that the surface tension of the compressible <b>nuclear</b> <b>droplet</b> is a key to bridging a gap between microscopic and macroscopic approaches. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|We use the HIPSE (Heavy-Ion Phase-Space Exploration) Model {{to discuss}} {{the origin of the}} bimodality in charge {{asymmetry}} observed in nuclear reactions around the Fermi energy. We show that it {{may be related to the}} important angular momentum (spin) transferred into the quasi-projectile before secondary decay. As the spin overcomes the critical value, a sudden opening of decay channels is induced and leads to a bimodal distribution for the charge asymmetry. In the model, it is not assigned to a liquid-gas phase transition but to specific instabilities in nuclei with high spin. Therefore, we propose to use these reactions to study instabilities in rotating <b>nuclear</b> <b>droplets.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures Accepted to PR...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{theoretical}} {{prediction of}} a breaking of axial symmetry in quasi all heavy nuclei is confronted {{to a new}} critical analysis of photon strength functions of nuclei in the valley of stability. For the photon strength in the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) regime a parameterization of GDR shapes by the sum of three Lorentzians (TLO) is extrapolated to energies below and above the IVGDR. The impact of non-GDR modes adding to the low energy slope of photon strength is discussed including recent data on photon scattering and other radiative processes. These are shown to be concentrated in energy regions where various model calculations predict intermediate collective strength; thus they are obviously separate from the IVGDR tail. The triple Lorentzian (TLO) ansatz for giant dipole resonances is normalized in accordance to the dipole sum rule. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>droplet</b> model with surface dissipation accounts well for positions and widths without local, nuclide specific, parameters. Very few and only global parameters are needed when a breaking of axial symmetry already in the valley of stability is admitted and hence a reliable prediction for electric dipole strength functions also outside of it is expected.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>nuclear</b> lipid <b>droplets</b> (LDs) are organized into domains similar to those of cytoplasmic LDs. As cytoplasmic LDs are formed at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which is structurally continuous with the nuclear envelope, it could be suggested however that nuclear LDs are cytoplamic LDs trapped within an invagination of the nuclear envelope. The resolution of fluorescence confocal microscopy is not sufficiently high to exclude this hypothesis. Findings: We therefore addressed this question by electron microscopy (EM) of serial sections. In human liver tissue, we observed some cytoplamic LDs partly surrounded by the nuclear compartment, but we were also able to identify LDs residing in the nuclear compartment that were not connected to the nuclear envelope. Conclusion: These findings indicate that nuclear LDs constitute specific subdomains of the nuclear compartment probably involved in nuclear lipid homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the nuclear}} {{equation}} of state in supernovae and in neutron star cooling is elaborated. The equation of state is derived from a <b>nuclear</b> liquid <b>droplet</b> model using a parametrized, phenomenological nuclear force. The parameters are adjustable to fit the as yet poorly determined properties of bulk nuclear and neutron matter. While some nuclear force parameters are well-constrained by nuclear energies and other experiments, other parameters, like the nuclear incompressibility and symmetry energy parameters are not. However, experiments can determine interesting correlations between these parameters, and the equation of state should include these correlations. The results of the early phases of supernova evolution with this adjustable nuclear equation of state are described. They show that the "bounce-shock" mechanism for supernovae cannot succeed, and that some other, "long-term" mechanism must be involved. The parameters of the nuclear force affect the light curve [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Reaction rates, kinetics, {{inhibition}} {{and cellular}} sites of nonspecific esterases in de-veloping rat lung were studied using biochemical and cytochemical techniques. The rates of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylthiol acetate (PNTA) and p-nitrophenylthiol butyrate (PNTB) in homogenates {{were correlated with}} ultrastructural localization of the esteratic activity. The effects {{of a number of}} esterase inhibitors such as diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate were examined in both systems. Throughout lung development there is an increase in the rates of hydrolysis of thiol esters by lung homogenates. Fetal PNTA hydrolases are most abundant in the mesoderm and are widely distributed on membranes (i. e., Golgi complexes, <b>nuclear</b> envelopes, lipid <b>droplets).</b> The major sites of endodermal PNTA hydrolysis are lamellar bodies and their proposed precursors. PNTB hydrolases are more limited in distribution. Regardless of substrate used, adult esteratic activity is most prominent in lamellar bodies of type II epithelial cells.

40|$|Lipid {{droplets}} are the intracellular {{sites for}} neutral lipid storage. They {{are critical for}} lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction {{has been linked to}} many diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that the roles lipid droplets play in biology are significantly broader than previously anticipated. Lipid droplets are the source of molecules important in the nucleus: they can sequester transcription factors and chromatin components and generate the lipid ligands for certain <b>nuclear</b> receptors. Lipid <b>droplets</b> have also emerged as important nodes for fatty acid trafficking, both inside the cell and between cells. In immunity, new roles for droplets, not directly linked to lipid metabolism, have been uncovered, with evidence that they act as assembly platforms for specific viruses and as reservoirs for proteins that fight intracellular pathogens. Until recently, knowledge about droplets in the nervous system has been minimal, but now there are multiple links between lipid droplets and neurodegeneration: many candidate genes for hereditary spastic paraplegia also have central roles in lipid-droplet formation and maintenance, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons can lead to transient accumulation of lipid droplets in neighboring glial cells, an event that may, in turn, contribute to neuronal damage. As the cell biology and biochemistry of lipid droplets become increasingly well understood, the next few years should yield many new mechanistic insights into these novel functions of lipid droplets...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} {{processes are}} {{often found in}} industrial applications when a bulk phase needs to be purified from dissolved components. The strategy of extraction consists of dissolving the impurities into a second, carrier phase, with optimal extraction performance being guaranteed by maximizing both contact interface area and mass transfer rate. Providing the carrier phase {{in the shape of}} a swarm of dispersed droplets serves the purpose of generating a large interface between both fluids; at the same time, the buoyancy-driven flow of the droplets within the continuous medium induces internal fluid motion driven by momentum transfer at the drop surface. This convective transport greatly enhances mass transfer and increases the efficiency of an extraction column dramatically, compared to fluid motion solely governed by diffusion. However, understanding mass transfer vitally depends on a proper description of the precise flow field inside and outside of the <b>droplets.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> magnetic resonance (NMR) velocity imaging can give quantitative information about drop shape and velocities and is able to distinguish between different chemical compounds that will become relevant for the direct investigation of mass transfer. The potential of pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR for the investigation of flow processes has been demonstrated by application to fluid motion subject to vastly different geometries and therefore is an exceptionally suitable technique for non-invasively monitoring the drop’s internal fluid dynamics and its change with time. In this thesis, fast NMR imaging techniques are combined with velocity encoding in order to generate statistical and imaging information about the oscillation and internal vortex patterns of ‘levitated’ drops. It is a well-known fact that the efficiency of mass transfer between the two phases is determined by convective transport made possible through circulation occurring both inside and outside of the droplets. The internal dynamics of the drops can generally be divided into different regimes. While small droplets behave like rigid spheres, larger droplets feature pronounced internal dynamics. The rigidity of the interface and therefore the internal behaviour of the drops are mostly characterized by the drop size, composition and purity of the system. In the present work, the two limit cases were studied: silicone oil (rigid interface) and toluene (mobile interface) drops are generated with a special pipette (that guarantees the reproducibility of the experiment and also allows to control the drop size) at the bottom of a glass tube filled with D 2 O. When the drop rises to the centre of the NMR resonator, it is ‘stopped’ by the counter flow of the continuous D 2 O phase. Velocity patterns in this free scheme can be studied. 1 D, 2 D, 3 D NMR images and flow measurements of 3 - 4 mm diameter silicone oil drops and 4 - 5 mm equivalent diameter toluene drops in 4. 7 T and 11. 7 T magnets were performed and the velocity distributions analysed. In all cases, where experiments were performed in a controlled way and under strict purity conditions, a stable pattern was revealed for times of hours and even days, these patterns being characterized by the inherent impurities of the system. The latter was particularly well observed by the occurrence of a rigid cap next to a vortex region inside toluene drops with an overall mobile interface. It could also be shown that given a sufficient concentration of organic impurities during the experiment, the size if the rigid cap will grow with respect to the mobile surface as expected from the theory. Silicone oil drops, on the other hand, revealed a similar internal circulation pattern but with a much reduced velocity range. Interesting results are obtained when the glass measurement cell is not perfectly symmetric or when its orientation is not perfectly vertical. In this situation, axially symmetric results are no longer observed. In conclusion, the feasibility of applying PFG-NMR techniques for the non-invasive investigation of internal fluid dynamics in levitated drops was demonstrated. The technique is both reasonably fast and allows the visualization of three-dimensional velocity fields for providing input data to interface models and to allow a comparison with numerical simulations...|$|R
