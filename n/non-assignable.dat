60|$|This {{constitutes}} the only uncertainty of Political Economy; {{and not of}} it alone, but of the moral sciences in general. When the disturbing causes are known, the allowance necessary {{to be made for}} them detracts in no way from scientific precision, nor constitutes any deviation from the à priori method. The disturbing causes are not handed over to be dealt with by mere conjecture. Like friction in mechanics, to which they have been often compared, they may at first have been considered merely as a <b>non-assignable</b> deduction to be made by guess from the result given by the general principles of science; but in time many of them are brought within the pale of the abstract science itself, and their effect is found to admit of as accurate an estimation as those more striking effects which they modify. The disturbing causes have their laws, as the causes which are thereby disturbed have theirs; and from the laws of the disturbing causes, the nature and amount of the disturbance may be predicted à priori, like the operation of the more general laws which they are said to modify or disturb, but with which they might more properly be said to be concurrent. The effect of the special causes is then to be added to, or subtracted from, the effect of the general ones.|$|E
60|$|An {{argument}} from analogy, is an inference {{that what is}} true in a certain case is true in a case known to be somewhat similar, but not known to be exactly parallel, that is, to be similar in all the material circumstances. An object has the property B: another object is not known to have that property, but resembles {{the first in a}} property A, not known to be connected with B; and the conclusion to which the analogy points, is that this object has the property B also. As, for example, that the planets are inhabited, because the earth is so. The planets resemble the earth in describing elliptical orbits round the sun, in being attracted by it and by one another, in being nearly spherical, revolving on their axes, etc.; and, as we have now reason to believe from the revelations of the spectroscope, are composed, in great part at least, of similar materials; but it is not known that any of these properties, or all of them together, are the conditions on which the possession of inhabitants is dependent, or are marks of those conditions. Nevertheless, so long as {{we do not know what}} the conditions are, they may be connected by some law of nature with those common properties; and to the extent of that possibility the planets are more likely to be inhabited than if they did not resemble the earth at all. This <b>non-assignable</b> and generally small increase of probability, beyond what would otherwise exist, is all the evidence which a conclusion can derive from analogy. For if we have the slightest reason to suppose any real connection between the two properties A and B, the argument is no longer one of analogy. If it had been ascertained (I purposely put an absurd supposition) that there was a connection by causation between the fact of revolving on an axis and the existence of animated beings, or if there were any reasonable ground for even suspecting such a connection, a probability would arise of the existence of inhabitants in the planets, which might be of any degree of strength, up to a complete induction; but we should then infer the fact from the ascertained or presumed law of causation, and not from the analogy of the earth.|$|E

The main {{problem with the}} Trinity and digital linking at the time, was that Korg chose to design the synth using a 48 kHz, which is very common for post {{production}} and television work, but not the 44.1 kHz CD standard that most studios pro and consumer alike utilized. Therefore, {{it was difficult to}} clock unless an outboard box calculated a real-time conversion. Only the first four channels of the ADAT spec were used, and they were assigned to the classic Korg Output layout: 1/L, 2/R, out 3, out 4. These were fixed and <b>non-assignable.</b>|$|E
40|$|This is {{our third}} report on {{real-time}} Java. Our previous work {{to develop and}} evaluate the Shadow Design Pattern was couched {{in the context of}} real-time garbage collection with assignable priorities as implemented for example in the Sun Java Real-Time System. In this report, we present our investigation of the pattern from the perspective of <b>non-assignable</b> priorities. Our experiment consisted of running the real-time application we used in our previous study on IBM WebSphere Real Time. IBM WebSphere Real Time automatically sets Metronome, its incremental real-time garbage collector, to a priority higher than the highest priority of the real-time threads that use the heap. The results from the experiment show that the modified code for the Shadow Design Pattern runs well under Metronome. Funding number: MD 7080101 P 0630...|$|E
40|$|In the {{industrial}} community {{it is well}} known that the failure rate of the manufactured units vary with time due to a variety of causes, namely, engineering design, manufacturing process, maintenance and quality inspection procedures and various assignable and <b>non-assignable</b> factors. Such failure rates invariably exhibit changes in both level and slope and at times exhibit periodic patterns as well. Therefore it would be quite inappropriate and erroneous to analyze such stochastic series of observations using the usual failure distribution approach. Since such data can be construed as time series, we suggest in this paper the time series techniques including the Kalman filter for their analysis. Other advantages of using the latter techniques are that the periodicities, if any, can be taken into account and short-term forecasts can be made which otherwise would not have been possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} what type of firm chooses long-term loans when the manager maximizes his expected payoff. Our theoretical model extends previous models in the following four respects. First, we allow the case where firms have internal funds. Second, we explicitly solve the conditions under which firms choose long-term debt. Third, we allow no information arrival for some lenders because it makes a pooling equilibrium more natural outcome. Fourth, we explicitly consider the case where there exists a chance of renegotiation for defaulted short-term debt. Our theoretical result shows that if a liquidation risk is present, the firm tends to choose long-term debt when it has large amount of external debt, when its average revenue is large, and when the manager has his own <b>non-assignable</b> control rent. It also shows that if there exists a chance of renegotiation, the firm tends to choose long-term debt when it has large amount of external debt and when its average revenue is small. We empirically investigate these hypotheses by using Japan's panel data for five industries. Except for the electric and electronic equipment industry, the results support our hypotheses for the case where a liquidation risk is present. However, in electric and electronic equipment industry, empirical results support our hypotheses for the case where there exists a chance of renegotiation. In addition, we support our hypotheses more significantly for the data of smaller companies and the data after financial liberalization. ...|$|E
40|$|Intra-household {{allocations}} {{appear to}} be quite important in the determination of time use, human resource investments, and intra- and inter-generational transfers in developing countries. The nature of such allocations {{has important implications for}} the efficiency, equity, and efficacy of the micro and macro-economic policies. In the past decade and a half, there has been substantial progress in modelling intra-household allocations in ways that lead to testable propositions despite enormous data limitations regarding the nature of the allocation of unobserved variables and the impact of unobserved heterogeneous endowments. The parent-child exchange literature is a subset of these studies that advances in two dimensions by allowing children to have different preferences from their parents' and by incorporating a broader notion of interactions, including the attention provided by the children to their parents. Yet this literature has most of the problems that are indicated with regard to the unified household preference models. The exchange literature to date has assumed away heterogeneity in endowments which plays such a critical role in the studies that assume the unified household preferences. It is also silent on how human resource investments enter into the relations between parents and children. The collective models of household behaviour emphasise that different household members. usually husband and wife, may have different preferences and a different command over resources. Interesting theoretical results have been derived concerning the conditions under which the income-sharing rules and the allocation of <b>non-assignable</b> goods can be derived. But there are many limitations in this literature. The literature on the collective models of household behaviours is static and gives little consideration to the dynamic processes and learning. ...|$|E
