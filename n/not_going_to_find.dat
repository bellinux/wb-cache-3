500|$|When Cobb died in 1961, stories {{written about}} him {{mentioned}} the attempted trade between Cleveland and Detroit, which revived interest in Flick. Flick {{was inducted into}} the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 after being unanimously elected by the Veterans Committee (VC). When he received the call from Branch Rickey that he had been selected, Flick did not believe Rickey at first. He said that he did not even realize that he was being considered for election at the time. Flick's family had to convince him that the call was real. He was the oldest living inductee in Hall of Fame history. At his induction, the 87-year-old Flick said, [...] "This is a bigger day than I've ever had before. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the words to explain how I feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s {{precisely because of the}} terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{developed}} a reputation as an agitator for his aggressive play and verbal instigation while playing for the Chicago Blackhawks. He compared his playstyle to Boston Bruins player Brad Marchand, saying [...] "We're both agitators. We both play physical and we're always chirping." [...] Joel Quenneville, who coached Shaw in Chicago, praised Shaw by stating, [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the same ingredient that [...] provides, whether it's the game-to-game consistency of being an agitator, net-front presence on your power play, good in the room, good on the bench, good on the ice, smart hockey player, makes plays, brings that nastiness you appreciate and comes ready to play every game." [...] Shaw has also gained the nickname [...] "Mutt" [...] from some of his teammates and fans regarding his rough style of play.|$|E

6000|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the Governor of New York and myself last summer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments {{in several of the}} districts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made; and in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they seemed too large, and said: [...] "After this drawing, these four districts, and also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled, and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the process." [...] In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were put into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My idea was to do the work over according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss. The commission, whose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea. <b>Not</b> <b>going</b> forth <b>to</b> <b>find</b> men at all, they have proceeded altogether upon paper examinations and mental processes. One of their conclusions, as I understand, is that, as the law stands, and attempting to follow it, the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments much more accurately than they did. The report on this point might be useful to Congress. The commission conclude that the quotas for the draft should be based upon entire population, and they proceed upon this basis to give a table for the State of New York, in which some districts are reduced and some increased. For the now ensuing draft, let the quotas stand as made by the enrolling officers, in the districts wherein this table requires them to be increased; and let them be reduced according to the table in the others: this to be no precedent for subsequent action. But, as I think this report may, on full consideration, be shown to have much that is valuable in it, I suggest that such consideration be given it, and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be conformed to without an alteration of the law.|$|R
60|$|First, I {{look to the}} {{elementary}} schools now happily established all over the country. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> criticise or <b>find</b> fault with them; on the contrary, their establishment {{seems to me to}} be the most important and the most beneficial result of the corporate action of the people in our day. A great deal is said of British interests just now, but, depend upon it, that no Eastern difficulty needs our intervention as a nation so seriously, as the putting down both the Bashi-Bazouks of ignorance and the Cossacks of sectarianism at home. What has already been achieved in these directions is a great thing; you must have lived some time to know how great. An education, better in its processes, better in its substance, than that which was accessible to the great majority of well-to-do Britons a quarter of a century ago, is now obtainable by every child in the land. Let any man of my age go into an ordinary elementary school, and unless he was unusually fortunate in his youth, he will tell you that the educational method, the intelligence, patience, and good temper on the teacher's part, which are now at the disposal of the veriest waifs and wastrels of society, are things of which he had no experience in those costly, middle-class schools, which were so ingeniously contrived as to combine all the evils and shortcomings of the great public schools with none of their advantages. Many a man, whose so-called education cost a good deal of valuable money and occupied many a year of invaluable time, leaves the inspection of a well-ordered elementary school devoutly wishing that, in his young days, he had had the chance of being as well taught as these boys and girls are.|$|R
2500|$|Buckley was an {{advocate}} for the legalization of marijuana and some drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of New York City. He wrote a pointed pro-marijuana legalization piece for National Review in 2004 where he calls for conservatives to change their views on legalization, stating, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws. What is required is a genuine republican groundswell. It is happening, but ever so gradually. Two of every five Americans [...] believe 'the government should treat marijuana {{more or less the}} same way it treats alcohol: It should regulate it, control it, tax it, and make it illegal only for children.'" [...] In his December 3, 2007 column, shortly after his wife's death, which he attributed, at least in part, to her smoking, Buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in America.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} Eiseley conveys {{his sense of}} wonder at the depth {{of time and the}} vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, {{reactions}} to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In The Immense Journey, Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. Marston Bates writes, [...] "It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations." ...|$|E

30|$|Why this {{happened}} {{all at once}} is still mysterious, though in large part we may attribute it to b-schools being slow {{to adapt to a}} new and vastly different business environment.
