5|$|On the December 27 {{episode of}} Raw, The <b>Nexus,</b> minus Barrett, {{announced}} {{they were under}} new management and offered to bury the hatchet with Cena, to which he refused. The <b>Nexus</b> attacked Cena, leaving a <b>Nexus</b> armband in the ring during the process. As the group retreated, CM Punk, who had attacked Cena with a steel chair twice the week before, came to the ring to apparently attack Cena, but instead put on the armband left behind to symbolically announce his allegiance with The <b>Nexus,</b> becoming leader the following week by manipulating Barrett's banishment from the group. On the January 17 episode of Raw, Cena returned and faced Punk in a match, which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined The <b>Nexus.</b> Cena competed in the 2011 Royal Rumble match at the pay-per-view, which saw Cena eliminate most of the <b>Nexus</b> members, ending his feud with the stable.|$|E
5|$|On the June 7, 2010 {{episode of}} Raw, Cena was {{suddenly}} thrust {{into a new}} storyline when during his main event match against CM Punk, he was attacked by all eight former contestants of the first season of NXT, with Wade Barrett as their leader. Punk, his follower Luke Gallows, and other personnel around the ring were attacked as well, but Cena took {{the worst of the}} attack and was carried out on a stretcher. This group later referred to itself as The <b>Nexus.</b> At Fatal 4-Way, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Sheamus, in a fatal four-way match involving Edge and Randy Orton, after The <b>Nexus</b> interfered. Cena again lost to Sheamus in a steel cage match at Money in the Bank, after The <b>Nexus</b> again interfered. Cena, in retaliation to The <b>Nexus,</b> formed an alliance with Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali, and Bret Hart. They defeated The <b>Nexus</b> at SummerSlam, with help from the returning Daniel Bryan, a former member of <b>Nexus,</b> who replaced Khali after he was injured.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2012 holiday season, {{analytics}} company Localytics {{reported that}} the Nexus7 accounted for 8% of the global Android tablet market share, based on estimates of app installations. This places it fourth among Android tablets, trailing the Kindle Fire (33%), Nook (10%), and Samsung Galaxy (9%) lines. A survey conducted by market research firm BCN in December 2012 found that the <b>Nexus</b> 7 had the largest tablet market share in Japan at 44.4% versus the iPads' combined market share of 40.1%. The survey cited factors such as price and consumer savvy. In July 2013, during {{the announcement of the}} second generation <b>Nexus</b> 7, Google executive Sundar Pichai said that over 70million Android tablets had been activated and that the first-generation <b>Nexus</b> 7 comprised about 10 percent of those devices (7million units).|$|E

5|$|The {{rational}} <b>nexus</b> test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational <b>nexus</b> test is used, which requires a court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable <b>nexus</b> between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a <b>nexus</b> will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|A brood {{depended}} on a <b>nexus</b> creature to direct it. In the pre-conflict Swarm, this position was filled by cerebrates. However, supplanting the cerebrate with another entity could allow broods, or other {{large groups of}} zerg, {{to be controlled by}} non-Swarm agents.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational <b>nexus</b> test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational <b>nexus</b> test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|In other jurisdictions, {{courts have}} applied {{standards}} {{of judicial review}} more exacting than the rational <b>nexus</b> test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional. It {{remains to be seen}} whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered scrutiny approach. The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational <b>nexus</b> test.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The <b>Nexus</b> cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking {{out all of the}} New <b>Nexus</b> members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{was traded}} {{back to the}} Raw brand on October 11, 2010, after being swapped with Edge. He {{took part in the}} interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after {{injuring}} Evan Bourne to win a place, but the team lost. It was reported later that he was suffering with a hip injury that would stop him from competing. To keep a presence on television, he began commentating on Raw from November 22, having already commentated one NXT. During his commentary, he criticized John Cena for his actions against The <b>Nexus.</b> Sometimes he favored heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on Raw and SmackDown with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of The <b>Nexus.</b> Punk then made each member of the group prove themselves worthy of a spot, with some choosing to join The Corre, which had been started by former <b>Nexus</b> leader Wade Barrett on SmackDown, instead.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Court of Malaysia later {{adapted the}} {{rational}} <b>nexus</b> test by including an additional preceding stage, namely, whether {{the law was}} discriminatory. This three-stage inquiry was accepted in Singapore in the case Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor (1996).|$|E
5|$|The {{next month}} at Elimination Chamber, Orton {{failed to win}} a WWE Championship number-one-contender Elimination Chamber match after being the first man {{eliminated}} by Punk. Over the next three weeks, Orton punted and injured all members of The New <b>Nexus,</b> Michael McGillicutty, David Otunga and Mason Ryan. At WrestleMania XXVII, Orton defeated Punk after a mid-air RKO. On the April 11 Raw, McGillicutty, Otunga and Ryan returned and cost Orton a number one contender's gauntlet match for the WWE Championship. Two weeks later, in the 2011 WWE draft, Orton was drafted to SmackDown and beat Punk in a Last Man Standing Match at Extreme Rules, ending his feud with The New <b>Nexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill is {{on a bus}} route into Gateshead and Newcastle upon Tyne {{served by}} two bus services: the Orbit 51, which travels to Heworth Interchange and terminates at Gateshead, and the 68. All buses serving Carr Hill are {{operated}} by Go North East under the administration of <b>Nexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Edge {{participated in}} the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, but failed to win the briefcase. Edge {{then went on to}} participate in the main event of SummerSlam in which he and six teammates were victorious in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match against The <b>Nexus.</b> On the 900th episode of Raw, he disqualified himself, in the main event in a five-on-five elimination match against The <b>Nexus.</b> This saw him enter into a feud with the anonymous Raw General Manager, during which the general manager cost him several matches. At Night of Champions, Edge participated in a six-pack elimination challenge for Sheamus' WWE Championship, but once again failed to win the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{statutes}} {{differ in}} their jurisdictional elements, the mens rea that they require (for example, {{a quid pro quo}} or a <b>nexus),</b> the species of official actions that are cognizable, whether or not non-public official defendants can be prosecuted, and in the authorized sentence. The statutes most often used to prosecute public corruption are the Hobbs Act, Travel Act, RICO, the program bribery statute, and mail and wire fraud statutes.|$|E
5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational <b>nexus</b> test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the launch}} of the fourth {{generation}} hardware, Apple announced the iPad Mini. With a screen measuring 7.9 inches, it is aimed at the emerging sector of smaller tablets such as the Kindle Fire and <b>Nexus</b> 7. The hardware of the new iPad Mini is similar to the iPad 2, with a 1024 by 768 pixel resolution screen and a dual core A5 processor, but is 53% lighter and 7.2mm thick. It was released on November 2, 2012, in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB capacities and WiFi or Wi‑Fi + Cellular versions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} event, Barra {{announced}} that the tablet would initially be shipped to Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. On July13, 2012, Google began shipping the Nexus7 to customers in Australia and the US who had pre-ordered the tablet. The company released the Nexus7 to Canada and the UK four days later on July17. The tablet was released in France, Germany, and Spain on August 27, 2012, and in Japan on September 25, 2012. Two days later the tablet was released in South Korea. The <b>Nexus</b> 7 was progressively released to selected markets, such as Portugal and India, in the following months.|$|E
5|$|Gravity was {{released}} on digital download on February 11, 2014, and {{was released}} on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on February 25, 2014, in the United States and on March 3, 2014, in the United Kingdom. As of March 16, 2014, Gravity has sold 908,756 DVDs along with 957,355 Blu-ray discs for $16,465,600 and $22,183,843, respectively, {{for a total of}} $38,649,443. Gravity was also offered for free in HD on Google Play and <b>Nexus</b> devices from late October 2014 to early November 2014.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational <b>nexus</b> standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} in December 2011, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt announced that a Google-designed tablet computer would arrive in six months. During the interview for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not {{refer to it as}} such, the device was inferred {{to be part of the}} Google <b>Nexus</b> series of consumer devices using the Android operating system and built by a partnering original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 2013, HTC {{announced}} that Google Play would sell {{a variant of}} the HTC One with a stock Android operating system as a Google Experience device (similarly to <b>Nexus</b> devices). It was released in the United States on 26 June 2013 alongside a similar version of the Galaxy S4. While still carrying Beats Audio support, infrared functionality was not initially available, but was enabled by the update to Android 4.3.|$|E
5|$|Orton {{defeated}} Sheamus, Wade Barrett, John Cena, Edge and Chris Jericho in {{a six-pack}} challenge elimination match to become WWE Champion {{for the sixth}} time at Night of Champions. After successfully defending the title against Sheamus at Hell in a Cell, Orton feuded with Wade Barrett, who was blackmailing Cena to help him capture the title. Orton lost to Barrett via disqualification at Bragging Rights, but retained the title. He defeated Barrett in a rematch at Survivor Series after Cena, who was the special guest referee, turned on Barrett. After one final match on the November 22 episode of Raw, The Miz immediately cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and quickly beat Orton to win the title. Orton received his rematch against The Miz in a tables match at , but lost after repeated interference from The Miz's protegé Alex Riley. On the January 3, 2011 episode of Raw, Orton defeated Sheamus and Wade Barrett in a steel cage match to earn another title match against The Miz at the Royal Rumble, but lost again at the event after The New <b>Nexus</b> interfered, starting a feud between Orton and New <b>Nexus</b> leader CM Punk.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} transport executive (PTE) {{has become a}} major player in the organisation of public transport within Northern city regions; of the six PTEs in England, five (Transport for Greater Manchester, Merseytravel, Travel South Yorkshire, <b>Nexus</b> Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire Metro) are located in the North. These coordinate bus services, local trains and light rail in their regions. Following the passage of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016, Transport for the North is expected to become a statutory body in 2017, and will be given powers to coordinate services and offer integrated ticketing throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational <b>nexus</b> test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|This culminated on the November 15 {{episode of}} Raw, when Kidd refused to tag in and {{attacked}} Smith during {{a match for}} the WWE Tag Team Championship against The <b>Nexus</b> (Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater), resulting in Kidd became a heel once again. Smith defeated Kidd in a singles match on the November 25 episode of WWE Superstars. Afterward, Smith offered to shake Kidd's hand, but Kidd refused and instead slapped him across the face. On the following episode of Raw, Kidd defeated Smith in a rematch, with this officially ending the alliance as a team.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook is {{on a bus}} route into Gateshead and Newcastle upon Tyne and {{is served}} by several bus services, such as the Orbit 51 which travels to Heworth Interchange and terminates at Gateshead, the CityLink 58 which terminates in Hardrian Park, the Pulse 69 which terminates at Winlaton and the 93/4 Loop which travels to the Team Valley. All buses serving Windy Nook are {{operated}} by Go North East under the administration of <b>Nexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} fast as that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, <b>Nexus</b> 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Nexus7 {{began in}} January 2012 after a meeting between Google and Asus {{executives}} at International CES. The device's design was based on Asus' Eee Pad MeMO ME370T tablet that had been showcased at the conference. Following a hectic four-month development period during which the device was modified to reach a US$199 price point, mass production started in May. It was unveiled at the Google I/O annual developer conference on June27, when it also became available for pre-order through Google Play. Shipping commenced in mid-July 2012 to Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, before the tablet was progressively released in other regions. Google expanded the <b>Nexus</b> 7 lineup in October 2012 {{with the introduction of}} 32 GB versions, available in Wi-Fi–only and HSPA+ cellular-ready varieties.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, {{he began}} a romantic storyline with Vickie Guerrero, who began {{accompanying}} him to the ring. On the July 9 episode of SmackDown, Ziggler defeated Chavo Guerrero and Montel Vontavious Porter in a triple threat match {{to qualify for the}} SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, where he once again failed to win the match. On July 28 at the tapings of the August 6 episode of SmackDown Ziggler defeated Kofi Kingston to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship for the first time. In his first title defense at SummerSlam, he retained the championship against Kingston when the match ended in a no contest due to interference from The <b>Nexus.</b> Ziggler was able to make a successful title defense against Kingston at the Night of Champions pay-per-view, and against Kaval at Survivor Series.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, after pinning WWE Champion John Cena on Raw, Rey Mysterio at Capitol Punishment {{and finally}} Alberto Del Rio {{again in a}} contendership match (which also {{included}} Mysterio) all within one week, Punk revealed his contract would expire at Money in the Bank and vowed to leave the company with the WWE Championship. After making a scathing yet highly acclaimed on-air speech concerning {{the way in which}} WWE is run and its owner Vince McMahon, he was given a storyline suspension from televised WWE events but was reinstated the following week on Cena's insistence. Upon his return, Punk ceased to appear with the remaining members of <b>Nexus</b> and the group quietly dissolved that month. This helped transition him from a villainous character back to being a fan-favorite. Two weeks later, at Money in the Bank, Punk defeated John Cena to become the WWE Champion on his final night under contract with WWE.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Kerrigan briefly {{appears in}} Gabriel Mesta's Shadow of the Xel'naga, set between StarCraft and Brood War, {{in which she}} {{attempts}} to secure a Xel'naga artifact on the independent colony world Bhekar Ro, but fails when it eradicates her forces. Kerrigan is also observed in Shadow Hunters, the second novel in The Dark Templar Saga, a trilogy {{that acts as a}} precursor to StarCraft II. After sensing a <b>nexus</b> of joined human minds caused by protagonist Jake Ramsey {{at the end of the}} first novel, Kerrigan sends Zerg forces to its location, infesting the half-dead body of a Dominion-funded black marketeer, Ethan Stewart. As the attack is the first Zerg activity for years, it inadvertently raises the suspicions of Arcturus Mengsk, who wonders what could have motivated it.|$|E
5|$|On April 26, Morrison {{was drafted}} to the Raw brand {{as part of}} the 2010 WWE Draft, and lost his first match back for the brand later that night to Jack Swagger. Later that week, in his final match on SmackDown, he lost to Cody Rhodes. On June 1, Morrison {{announced}} that he would be mentoring Eli Cottonwood in the second season of WWE NXT. Cottonwood, however, was the second person eliminated from the competition, and was eliminated on July 27 episode of NXT. Morrison then went on to participate in the main event of SummerSlam in which he and six teammates (John Cena, Edge, Chris Jericho, R-Truth, Daniel Bryan, and Bret Hart) were victorious in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match against The <b>Nexus.</b>|$|E
