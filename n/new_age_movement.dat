5|$|The {{counterculture}} of the 1960s had rapidly {{declined by}} {{the start of}} the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>movement,</b> and American popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>movement</b> as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E

25|$|Challenges to the {{secularization}} hypothesis led {{to significant}} revisions, {{resulting in the}} religious transformation hypothesis. This perspective holds that general trends towards individualism and social disintegration will produce changes in religion, making religious practice more individualized and spiritually focused. This in turn is expected to produce more spiritual seeking, although not exclusive to religious institutions. Eclecticism, which draws from multiple religious/spiritual systems and <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>movements</b> are also predicted to result.|$|R

50|$|Some tendencies {{that define}} modern Western {{societies}} are {{the existence of}} political pluralism, laicism, generalization of middle class, prominent subcultures or countercultures (such as <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>movements),</b> increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration. The modern shape of these societies is strongly based upon the Industrial Revolution and the societies' associated social and environmental problems, such as class and pollution, as well as reactions to them, such as syndicalism and environmentalism.|$|R

25|$|The {{notion of}} the {{survival}} of Wiccan traditions and rituals from ancient sources is contested by most recent researchers, who suggest that Wicca is a 20th-century creation which combines elements of freemasonry and 19th-century occultism.

Froud also collaborated with Henson and Oz for their next project, the 1986 film Labyrinth.|$|E
