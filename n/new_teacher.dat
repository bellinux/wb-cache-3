She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells Precious that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E

40|$|Much {{research}} has shown that <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> often come into the profession ill-prepared for the realities and challenges of teaching. This 2 ̆ 2 reality shock 2 ̆ 2 is often the result of the attitudes with which these <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> come into the profession and their socialization into the organization. This study looked at whether or not formal induction programs are effective in improving the skills, including the classroom performance, of <b>new</b> <b>teachers.</b> This study also sought to determine which areas of need for <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> are addressed in current teacher induction programs, which areas are not as effectively addressed, and how the needs are best addressed. The sample group for this study included ninety <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in ten Wisconsin public school districts. School districts rated components of their induction programs in the areas of communication, management and socialization, and some of the various administrators and <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in the districts participated in phone or face-to-face interviews. <b>New</b> <b>teachers</b> in the districts that {{agreed to participate in the}} study completed a pre-assessment in September and a post-assessment in January in order to evaluate the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 abilities and attitudes in the areas of communication, management and socialization. They also completed questionnaires regarding their experiences. The <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 principals also completed pre- and post-assessments and conducted classroom observations of the <b>new</b> <b>teachers.</b> The teacher induction programs of the ten school districts in the study were classified as 2 ̆ 2 formal 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 informal. 2 ̆ 2 Scores were then computed and narrative data was grouped in order to compare the results of the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in formal programs with the results of <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in informal programs. The data indicates there is some difference in the skills, performance and attitudes of <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in formal programs and those in informal programs. Comparisons of pre- and post-classroom observation records completed by administrators showed greater improvement in <b>teacher</b> performance by <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in formal programs. In addition, the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 pre- and post-assessments showed a significant decrease for <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in informal programs in their evaluation of their management skills.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a practitioner}} research study that explores {{the experiences of}} four beginning teachers {{who are members of}} the Philadelphia Teachers Learning Cooperative, an urban professional development network. Although support for <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> and teacher retention are paid much attention in research and policy literature, the focus is typically on large scale programs with mandated participation, such as induction programs or mentoring. Teacher networks—such as the network that I studied which has a more than twenty-five year history of weekly meetings—are able to offer professional development that is flexible and based on the needs of participants. Through participation in this voluntary teacher network that uses formalized oral inquiry processes, the four <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> were encouraged to develop an inquiry stance toward classroom practice as one dimension of support. The <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> also began to turn that stance onto their practice within the network, a process facilitated by this dissertation research. Working dialectically within and against the traditions and processes of the network, the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> pushed for a more active, equal role in the network and in their own professional development. This engagement led the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> to the creation of an event that embodied a new vision of social justice that was grounded in shared generational experiences with service learning during the 1990 s. ^ Through a practitioner research design grounded in feminist research and social justice literature, this study is posed to expand current ideas of professional development, supporting <b>new</b> <b>teachers,</b> {{and the development of a}} professional identity. In this study, I made use of qualitative research methods, including participant observation and structured conversations, over the course of one school year to look closely at the participation of the three other <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> and myself in this professional development network. The findings of this study center on the ways in which the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> and the network shaped and were shaped by each other, including in the ways the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> experienced support and silencing within the network. During a year of unprecedented school reform in this urban district, the <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 personal beliefs and participation in this research project which encouraged inquiry into their practice within the network complicated their experiences, further troubling the ‘one size fits all’ conceptualization of support for <b>new</b> <b>teachers.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Management of the {{boarding}} school was an ongoing source of contention in Stockbridge. Martin Kellogg had been leading the school, to which Edwards and Woodbridge objected. They requested that a <b>new</b> <b>teacher</b> be sent, and Gideon Hawley arrived in February 1752 {{to teach the}} Mohawks and Oneidas (the resident Mahicans were still taught at Woodbridge's school). However, Kellogg {{was supported by the}} Williamses and Joseph Dwight, and so refused to abandon his post, resulting in a battle for control. In April, Timothy and other supporters of Edwards met to encourage the few remaining students' families that they should remove their children from Kellogg's classes. In response, Dwight presented a report to the General Court, stating that Kellogg's methods had been working well, until Edwards and Woodbridge interfered, and tried to get Edwards removed as minister. A rare point of agreement between the two camps was that the ginseng craze was drawing many of the Mohawks away. Timothy had been elected to the General Court, and so was able to refute this testimony, as well as to inform Edwards of the proceedings. This feud continued through Edwards' stay in Stockbridge. In addition to being elected as a representative, Timothy, by then known to the Native Americans as Solohkuwauneh, was made a Justice of the Peace in 1752, at the recommendation of Edwards. Timothy later made a judge of both probate and of Common Pleas, in 1761. Unfortunately, his historic docket was later destroyed by a fire in 1846.|$|E

40|$|Policy {{makers are}} {{concerned}} about reports of teacher shortages and {{the high rate of}} attrition among <b>new</b> <b>teachers.</b> Prior studies indicate that mentor-based induction can reduce the numbers of <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> leaving schools or the profession.

For <b>new</b> <b>teachers,</b> though, staying in the profession may not be enough. Work done in California indicates that <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> are likely to be hired in low-achieving schools. The question then becomes whether <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> are effective in helping students learn. Three districts with mentor-based induction programs agreed to share the achievement data of students in grades two through six who were taught by first- and second-year teachers.
