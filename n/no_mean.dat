25|$|Angles, {{times of}} day, and other {{cyclical}} quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, {{there will not}} be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E

5000|$|Joe Biden's goal {{from the}} {{campaign}} is to prevent sexual assault. He also strives to create less discrepancies with sexual assault, calling for {{a future in which}} a victim of sexual assault does not need to question his or her doing. Biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that, [...] "No <b>means</b> <b>no,</b> if you're drunk or you're sober. <b>No</b> <b>means</b> <b>no</b> if you're in bed, in a dorm or on the street. <b>No</b> <b>means</b> <b>no</b> even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind. <b>No</b> <b>means</b> no." ...|$|R

That is why the law is unjust. With every independent pound a year, this equal law of yours--varies!" ...|$|R
25|$|Given Astaire's obsessive {{rehearsal}} habits, {{this was}} <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> task. Pan also performed the essential function of rehearsing Ginger Rogers, whose many other commitments {{during the filming}} of the Astaire-Rogers musicals often conflicted with Astaire's rehearsal schedule. In addition, he recorded Ginger's taps in post production in some numbers.|$|E
25|$|Ellerslie {{also played}} in the Premiership final against Grafton in a 3-day match at Eden Park but were outclassed on this {{occasion}} but finishing 2nd was <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat. Sadly a number of Ellerslie's premier players retired in the early nineties leaving a big gap to fill but it has had many fine performances since, with still many more to come.|$|E
25|$|The teenage Rivers, whilst {{obviously}} scholarly, {{was also}} involved in other aspects of school life. As the programme for the Tonbridge School sports day notes, on 12 March 1880 – Rivers's sixteenth birthday – he ran in the mile race. The year before this he had been elected {{as a member of}} the school debating society, <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat for a boy who at this time suffered from a speech impediment which was almost paralytic.|$|E

Leverock claimed one of Canada's wickets as Bermuda won the game by three wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method. He has since gone onto play for Bermuda in 11 ODIs, {{and picked up the}} first five wicket haul by a Bermudian bowler in ODIs, when he took 5/53 against Kenya which he {{achieved}} by opening the bowling, <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat for a spin bowler.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of Harding Lemay, Another World would {{consolidate}} its place as not only {{the most popular and}} critically acclaimed soap opera on NBC, but one of the highest-rated soap opera of the decade. Between 1973 and 1978, it consistently attained second place in the ratings chart and tied with As the World Turns (its Procter and Gamble sister) for first place twice—in the 1973–1974 and 1977–1978 television seasons. The earlier triumph was <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat when one considers that CBS put up its star game The Price Is Right against it for two years.|$|E
25|$|Calcutta's {{intellectual}} life received a great boost in 1784 with {{the foundation of}} the Asiatic Society of Bengal by Sir William Jones, with the encouragement of Warren Hastings, himself <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> Oriental scholar. Jones worked closely with the pandits of the Kalighat Temple, together with the local ulema, in translating and producing new editions of rare and forgotten texts. His study of Sanskrit with Pandit Ramlochan at Nadiya led him to posit the existence of the Indo-European family of languages. Many distinguished scholars, English and Bengali, such as Henry Thomas Colebrooke, James Prinsep and Pandit Radhakanta Sarman would grace the Society's meetings and publications over the following century, vastly enriching knowledge of India's culture and past.|$|E

25|$|Most of the United Irish {{leadership}} and ideologues were born into Presbyterian families. While the United Irish had declared {{themselves to be}} non-sectarian from 1791, there were other liberal Protestants in the Irish Parliament who were also anti-sectarian and sought a more democratic franchise, such as Henry Grattan and John Philpot Curran. Although the United Irishmen was a staunchly non-sectarian body which sought to unite all Irishmen, regardless of religion or descent many among their ranks were former Defenders, a term applied to many loosely connected, exclusively Catholic, agrarian resistance groups. Many of these men, {{as well as their}} Presbyterian counterparts in Ulster, had been shaped by the sectarianism that was prevalent in eighteenth century Ireland and it was <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat to persuade Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter to put aside their differences and view each other simply as fellow Irishmen. Although the project met with remarkable success, it was quickly recognised by the establishment that sectarianism was a useful ally in the fight against the United Irishmen.|$|E
500|$|His {{obituary}} in The Sun {{described him}} as [...] "one of the best forwards in the New Zealand team which visited California... he was fast and very clever, and always gave of his best. He was a good all-round athlete — an excellent boxer and <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> cricketer." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Nicol, the {{achievement}} of the [...] "accomplished sinner" [...] Paul was without parallel: [...] "No-one ever made such a profitable business out of changing sides, first in the schism between the Greek and Latin Churches, and then in the schism between the pope in Rome and the pope in Avignon. It is <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat to arrive in Rome as Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem and then to be received in Avignon as Catholic patriarch of Constantinople." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite these hardships a [...] {{diameter}} {{foundation pit}} was excavated and by 1869 a solid portion of tower rising [...] above foundation level had been completed. This was <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat. On one occasion eleven two-ton stones were dislodged {{from the third}} course of stonework and carried off the rock, never to be seen again. Robert Stevenson noted that this destruction occurred {{at the same height}} [...] "above the sea as the glass panes in the lantern of Smeaton's lighthouse" [...] at Eddystone.|$|E
500|$|Contemporaneous reviews were favorable. The {{album was}} awarded the Grand Prix of the Jazz Magazine of France. In a five-star review, Down Beat magazine's Don DeMicheal called Money Jungle [...] "astonishing" [...] and {{described}} Roach and Mingus as [...] "some of the fastest company around." [...] He repeatedly praised Mingus for pushing Ellington into new musical territory: [...] "I've never heard Ellington play as he does on this album; Mingus and Roach, especially Mingus, push him so strongly that one can almost hear Ellington show them who's boss – and he dominates both of them, which is <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> accomplishment." [...] Billboard was also positive, describing it as [...] "memorable" [...] for its content as well as [...] "the historical importance of the three playing together".|$|E
500|$|That Mary {{was well}} educated is {{apparent}} from letters that she wrote. [...] Quaker chronicler George Bishop described {{her as a}} [...] "Comely Grave Woman, and of a goodly Personage, and one of a good Report, having a husband of an Estate, fearing the Lord, and a Mother of Children." [...] The Dutch writer Gerard Croese wrote that she was reputed to be a [...] "person of <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> extract and parentage, of an estate pretty plentiful, of a comely stature and countenance, of a piercing knowledge in many things, of a wonderful sweet and pleasant discourse, so fit for great affairs..." [...] Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop described her as being [...] "a very proper and fair woman...of a very proud spirit, and much addicted to revelations".|$|E

[...] She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson, <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat for a woman writer in the eighteenth century. By 1925 she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism within the academy in the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.|$|E
500|$|In the Test series, Verity totalled 11wickets at {{an average}} of 24.65, second in the bowling averages to Larwood. Verity took three more wickets in his last matches of the tour, which {{included}} his appearance in one of the two Tests against New Zealand {{at the end of the}} tour. In all first-class games in Australia, he took 44wickets at 15.86, leading the first-class bowling averages for the tourists; he took one further wicket in New Zealand. Wisden's tour report noted Verity's [...] "fine bowling record" [...] and that he performed well. Jardine, in a letter to Verity's father, wrote: [...] "Hedley has come through his first tour triumphantly, <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat to start with the stiffest tour, but particularly for a slow left-hander. On and off the field, Hedley has been a real friend and a grand help to me".|$|E
500|$|Chevelle toured {{as support}} to bands such as Sevendust, Machine Head, Filter, and Powerman 5000 in this period. Squint Entertainment closed down in 2001 {{and the band}} signed with Epic Records in 2002. In 2002 Chevelle {{released}} its second studio album Wonder What's Next on Epic Records. The band released the single [...] "The Red", which reached No.3 on the Mainstream rock charts, and the video was played in regular rotation on MTV. Wonder What's Next soon peaked at No.14 on the United States Billboard 200 album chart. Brian O'Neil of Allmusic stated the album [...] "offers uniqueness not often heard in more commercial fare, <b>no</b> <b>mean</b> feat." [...] Chevelle released two more singles from the album, [...] "Closure", and [...] "Send the Pain Below", the latter of which reached the No.1 position on both of the mainstream rock and modern rock charts. Wonder What's Next was certified platinum by the RIAA with excess sales of one million copies sold in the United States alone in 2003.|$|E
