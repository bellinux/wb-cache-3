40|$|BACKGROUND: Successful {{recovery}} from total hip replacement requires not only proper surgical technique but also appropriate nursing care during the immediate recovery period. PURPOSE: The {{study focused on}} (1) describing <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> for inpatients who underwent total hip replacement; (2) depicting the patterns of <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> over the hospital stay; and (3) examining relationships among patient characteristics, <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions,</b> and complication rates. METHODS: With retrospective data, the types, numbers, and time required for <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> were identified by descriptive statistics. Using a cross-tabulation table and a graph, the patterns of <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> were depicted by day. A correlation analysis was conducted to examine relationships among variables. RESULTS: On {{the first day of}} admission, the 5 most frequent <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> were intravascular administration, care plan, orthotics management, teaching/emotional support, and elimination care. However, when frequencies and time required for <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> were considered together, the rank order was different. Furthermore, complications had significant relationships with age, comorbidity, severity of illness, length of stay, and some <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> at the significant level (p ≤. 05). CONCLUSION: The description and review of <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> being provided in a hospital are necessary to delineate nursing work and improve nursing practice. The significant relationships among <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions,</b> comorbidities, and complications found in this study suggest that nurses should consider comorbidities in their care planning, monitoring, and documenting of <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> and outcomes along with the onset of complications...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <b>Nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> are any care {{based on}} nurses' {{judgment}} and clinical knowledge, {{based on a}} scientifically supported action, carried out and planned for patients' benefit. These {{are very important to}} control pain since pain, when inadequately treated, affects {{the quality of life of}} patients and caregivers in physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions. So, this study aimed at identifying <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> to handle pain and whether they relate to those proposed by the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> Classification.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and test a <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> model for {{promoting}} the prevention of dehydration in elderly patients who have undergone cardiac surgeries. The study was conducted using a case study method with due ethical considerations by obtaining approval from the institutional review boards at the centers participating in the study. A <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> model was developed based on the literature and researchers' <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> for elderly patients who underwent cardiac surgery. The goal of intervention was that these patients can understand the necessity of preventing dehydration, take actions to prevent it, and be aware of any abnormalities such as dehydration and heart failure. The timing of intervention was prior to hospital discharge and at the first visit to an outpatient department. The intervention focused on the abilities of these patients to: 1) understand the necessity of preventing dehydration, 2) drink more than 1, 000 ml of water per day, and 3) identify any abnormalities related to the symptoms of dehydration and cardiac failure. The <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> model was tested by applying it to one male patient in his 70 s who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting; this patient achieved the goal of intervention, suggesting the usefulness of the <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> model. 本研究の目的は，心臓手術を受けた高齢患者の脱水症予防を促すための看護介入モデルを作成し，検証する ことである。研究方法は，事例研究とし，倫理的配慮は，研究協力施設の倫理委員会の承認を得て実施した。看護介入モデルは，文献および研究者の心臓手術を受けた高齢患者の看護実践に基づいて作成した。介入の目標は，心臓手術を受けた高齢患者が脱水症予防の必要性を理解し，脱水症予防や脱水症，心不全の異常の発見行動ができるとした。介入の時期は退院前を第 1 回目，初回外来受診時を第 2 回目とし，介入の焦点は①脱水症予防の必要性を理解することができる② 1000 ml/日以上飲水することができる③脱水症，心不全症状の異常の発見ができるとした。看護介入モデルの検証は，作成した看護介入モデルに沿って，冠状動脈バイパス術を受けた 70 歳代の男性 1 名に適応し，介入の目標を達成することができたことから，看護介入モデルの有用性が示唆された。症例報告Case Report...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying nursing {{workload}} in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) {{can help}} optimize nursing resources, allowing allocation of nurses according to patient demand. This can benefit the ICU patients and nurses through {{the provision of}} adequate nursing care, prevention of nurse burnout, and reducing of ICU fixed costs. However, quantifying nursing workload is extremely challenging. Current nursing workload assessment tools, such as the therapeutic interventions scoring system (TISS) and nursing activities score (NAS), are subjective and laborious, requiring experienced nurses and researchers to fill out forms. Therefore, an automatic system that can objectively quantify nursing workload is required. The development of computer imaging and tracking technology offer possible solutions to track nursing activities. This research focuses on developing a novel tracking system that can continuously track bedside nursing interventions and quantify nursing workload. Nursing workload is then compared with patient clinical data to analyse which factors strongly influence patient nursing demands. The {{first part of this}} thesis discusses the development of a tracking system, and the second part discusses the correlation between quantified nursing workload and patient clinical conditions. Facial detection, color detection, infrared detection, and local position measurement (LPM) are the 4 possible approaches to continuously track nurse bedside interventions. These 4 approaches are evaluated, and infrared detection was the optimal non-invasive approach that most suited implementation in the Christchurch Hospital ICU environment. A clinical activities tracking system (CATS) was developed to track bedside nursing interventions continuously. The CATS hardware contains a Microsoft Kinect with image and infrared depth sensors, controlled by a portable laptop. The CATS software was designed under Microsoft Express C++ environment, implementing OpenNI and OpenCV libraries. The Kinect sensor is placed onto the ceiling to monitor a defined detection area. When an object enters the detection area, it is converted into an unidentifiable unrecognizable blob to protect privacy, and its location over time is recorded. CATS was tested in an experimental environment using two metrics, distance and dwell time to quantify nurse-patient interaction. CATS was then implemented in the Christchurch Hospital ICU. A trained ICU researcher performed manual observations on nursing workload at the bedside and compared with data collected using CATS. The researcher calculated the direct <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> time for each observed hour for 30 hours. The observed direct <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> time was then compared to CATS recorded <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> time. It was found that the CATS recorded <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> is highly correlated with manual observed intervention, and thus CATS was able to record <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> objectively. A preliminary study shows that <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> density is higher during the day compared to night time. Clinical trials include all patients admitted and allocated to a monitored bed between 04 / 08 / 2014 to 03 / 05 / 2015. 23 patients, with a total of 104 patient days, were recorded. Patient demographics, various patient acuity assessment scores, and workload assessment scores, including APACHE-II, APACHE-III, SAPS-II, SOFA, TISS- 28, and NEMS, were calculated and compared with <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> recorded by CATS. The patient’s sedation level, as quantified by GCS, RASS, and sedation drug dose, were also assessed and compared with the <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> recorded by CATS. In this study, APACHE-III and SAPS-II were found to have better resolution in describing patient acuity compared to APACHE-II and SOFA. Both TISS- 28 and NEMS display poor sensitivity to different patient specific nursing demands because only 36 % of TISS- 28 score varies from patient to patient. Equally, no significant trend was found between <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> and sedative dose or sedation level assessed by GCS or RASS. Results showed that the <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> is highly patient-specific and conventional generalised approaches were not able to capture the specificity. CATS was able to capture specificity automatically and objectively. Overall, the objective <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> tracking system provides an objective approach to automatically quantify <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention.</b> This system is validated in clinical trials, indicating its high accuracy and robustness. <b>Nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> captured by CATS shows that during the day nursing intensity is higher than at night time. In addition, none of patient sedation level, acuity level, TISS- 28, NEMS, age, length of stay, admission type, or intubation condition shows a strong clinical correlation with nursing time. The difficulty of quantifying <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> using conventional scores revealed a need for an objective system to evaluate nursing workload. At this stage, {{it is almost impossible to}} link nursing invention assessed directly by CATS to any existing assessment system based on tasks, patient severity or similar clinical data. As a result, CATS has the potential to standardise nursing workload quantification objectively, and is much less invasive and labor intensive than current assessment systems and scoring based approaches...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{increasing}} awareness {{related to}} sexual health for cervical cancer survivors, {{health care providers}} are passive in addressing their sexual issues. The objectives were to develop and investigate {{the effect of a}} sexual <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> packet to mitigate sexual dysfunction among cervical cancer survivors. Method: A sample of 104 survivors were participated consecutively based on required inclusive criteria in this quasi-experimental study. The sexual <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> packet focused on the physical, psychological, and care of relational aspects of sexual health elements. The packet consisted of 6 weekly 2 -hour sessions. Results: The participants reported poor sexual satisfaction and sexual function. There were no statistically signi fi cant differences in sexual interest, sexual arousal, orgasm, and vaginal lubrication improvement following the intervention, although all the variables in the intervention group were improved clinically. The sexual <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> packet was effective in increasing sexual satisfaction and decreasing dispareunia among cervical cancer survivors. Discussion: This study suggests that {{the quality of life in}} cervical cancer survivors could be improved with the sexual <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> packet provided as part of supportive group care. This program may be more effective if delivered earlier and for a longer period. Implications for Practice: The sexual <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> packet offers an opportunity to facilitate small-group dynamics that lay the ground for further contacts leading to earlier recognition of sexual problems and active involvement for sexual health improvement for cervical cancer survivors and nurses. It could be utilized for survivor education or support groups to increase sexual satisfaction following cancer treatment...|$|E
