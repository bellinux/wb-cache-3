5|$|Some <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> {{require that}} the {{cylinder}} valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E

5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science. The change to SI {{had little effect on}} everyday life in countries that used the metric system – the metre, kilogram, litre and second remained unchanged as did {{the way in which they}} were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace. The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E
5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or <b>national</b> <b>standards.</b> Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

40|$|STATUS OF <b>NATIONAL</b> <b>STANDARD</b> METHODS <b>National</b> <b>Standard</b> Methods, {{which include}} {{standard}} operating procedures (SOPs), algorithms and guidance notes, promote high quality practices and help to assure the comparability of diagnostic information obtained in different laboratories. This in turn facilitates standardisation of surveillance underpinned by research, development and audit and promotes public health and patient confidence in their healthcare services. The methods are well referenced and represent a good minimum standard for clinical and public health microbiology. However, in using <b>National</b> <b>Standard</b> Methods, laboratories should take account of local requirements and may need to undertake additional investigations. The methods also provide a reference point for method development. <b>National</b> <b>Standard</b> Methods are developed, reviewed and updated through an open and wide consultation process where the views of all participants are considered and the resulting documents reflect the majority agreement of contributors.
