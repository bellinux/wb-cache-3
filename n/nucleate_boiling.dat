2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling.</b> As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This departure from <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased {{much more quickly than}} coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E

One case of saturated, and three cases of subcooled boiling at different subcooling levels are simulated. Grid refinement study is also reported. Both boiling and condensation phenomena can be computed simultaneously {{in the proposed}} numerical framework. Computed bubble detachment diameters of the saturated <b>nucleate</b> pool <b>boiling</b> cases agree well with the experiment. The flow structures around the growing bubble are presented and the accompanying physics is described.

40|$|The present {{research}} focuses {{on the study of}} the effect of mass transfer resistance on the rate of heat transfer in pool <b>boiling.</b> The <b>nucleate</b> pool <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficients for binary mixtures (ethanol-n-butanol, acetone-n-butanol, acetone-ethanol, hexane-benzene, hexane-heptane, and methanol-water) were measured at different concentrations of the more volatile components. The systems chosen covered a wide range of mixture behaviors. The experimental set up for the present investigation includes electric heating element submerged in the test liquid mounted vertically. Thermocouple and a digital indictor measured the temperature of the heater surface. The actual heat transfer rate being obtained by multiplying the voltmeter and ammeter readings. A water cooled coil condenses the vapor produced by the heat input and the liquid formed returns to the cylinder for re-evaporation. The boiling results show that the <b>nucleate</b> pool <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficients of binary mixtures were always lower than the pure components <b>nucleate</b> pool <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficients. This confirmed that the mass transfer resistance to the movement of the more volatile component was responsible for decrease in heat transfer and that the maximum deterioration that was observed at a point was the absolute concentration differences between vapor and liquid phases at their maximum.

The latent heat contribution varied proportional with the density of nucleation sites when heat flux and/or electrode voltage varied.
