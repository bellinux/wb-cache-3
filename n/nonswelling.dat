40|$|Studies on the {{swelling}} behaviour of mixtures of bentonite clay and <b>nonswelling</b> coarser fractions {{of different sizes}} and shapes reveal that observed swelling occurs only after the voids of the <b>nonswelling</b> particles are filled up with swollen clay particles. The magnitude of the swell within the voids, called intervoid swelling is large when the size and percentage of the <b>nonswelling</b> coarser fraction is large. The observable swell, after intervoid swelling, is called primary swelling and follows a rectangular hyperbolic relationship with time. The total swell per gram of the clay decreases {{with an increase in}} the size of the <b>nonswelling</b> fraction and with a decrease in the percentage of swelling clay. Time-swell relationships show that swelling continues to occur for a long time after the primary swelling, and this is called secondary swelling...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the changes in interparticle forces brought about on prolonged contact (1 year period) of a bentonite clay with artificial seawater. The study is undertaken {{with the purpose of}} identifying the physico-chemical factors that impart a <b>nonswelling</b> character to smectite clays deposited in marine environments. Results show that equilibration of the bentonite clay with artificial seawater (total pore salinity approximately 42 gL- 1) for a 1 year period does not lead to any mineralogical changes in the clay specimens; however, their exchangeable cation positions become prominently dominated by magnesium ions. The consistency limits of the seawater-equilibrated bentonite was determined on stepwise leaching to lower salinities. The predominance of diffuse double-layer repulsion forces in the pore salt concentration range of 42 gL- 1 to 1. 1 gL- 1 caused an increase in the liquid limits of the seawater-equilibrated bentonite specimens on reducing the salinity in the corresponding range (42 gL- 1 to 1. 1 gL- 1). The attraction forces, however, prevail over the repulsion forces at salt concentrations < 1. 1 gL- 1 and cause a decrease in liquid limit of the clay specimens with reduction in pore salinity, which is typical of <b>nonswelling</b> clays. The attraction forces cause aggregation of the clay unit layers into domains that break down on sodium saturation of the clay specimens. It is inferred that the physico-chemical factors responsible for the <b>nonswelling</b> character of the seawater-equilibrated bentonite specimens at pore salt concentrations below 1. 1 gL- 1 are inadequate to explain the <b>nonswelling</b> character of smectite-rich Ariake marine clays. The lower consistency limits of the Ariake marine clays in comparison to the <b>nonswelling</b> character, seawater-equilibrated bentonite specimens is attributed to a relative deficiency of interparticle forces in the Ariake marine clay...|$|E

Volumetric specific heat is linearly related to the inverse of the temperature rise.

The device was constructed from two hypodermic needles, 0. 813 mm in diam. and 28 mm long, and spaced 6 mm apart. One needle contained a heater and the other a thermocouple. The temperature rise from heat pulses given to the heater were measured with the thermocouple. The coefficientof variation (CV) of specific heat on replicate samples was around 1 %.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{presence in}} marine clays and the recognized role of polysaccharide as a bonding agent provided {{the motivation to}} examine the role of starch polysaccharide in the remoulded properties of <b>nonswelling</b> (kaolinite) and swelling (bentonite) groups of clays. The starch polysaccharide belongs {{to a group of}} naturally occurring, large-sized organic molecules (termed polymers) and is built up by extensive repetition of simple chemical units called repeat units. The results of the study indicate that the impact of the starch polysaccharide on the remoulded properties of clays is dependent on the mineralogy of the clays. On addition to bentonite clay, the immensely large number of segments (repeat units) of the starch polysaccharide create several polymer segment - clay surface bonds that cause extensive aggregation of the bentonite units layers. The aggregation of the bentonite unit layers greatly curtails the available surface area of the clay mineral for diffuse ion layer formation. The reduction in diffuse ion layer thickness markedly lowers the consistency limits and vane shear strength of the bentonite clay. On addition to kaolinite, the numerous polymer segment - clay surface bonds enhance the tendency of the kaolinite particles to flocculate. The enhanced particle flocculation is responsible apparently for a small to moderate increase in the liquid limit and remoulded undrained strength of the <b>nonswelling</b> clay...|$|E

Devolatilization kinetics measured for two American lignites are used to give generation rates and the model output is compared to experimental results for these coals. The transfer processes modeled include pressure-driven Poiseuille (bulk) flow and Fickian diffusion, as Knudsen diffusion does not apply. The internal overpressures generated are not great so that external pressure strongly influences the transport mode. Both bulk flow and diffusion are found to be active and are of the same order of magnitude at 10 atm. Above 1 atm external pressure, the ratio of mass transfer by bulk flow to diffusion increases.

Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction have been employed {{to characterize the}} physical properties of these neat lipids. Polarizing optical microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy techniques {{have been used to}} investigate the phase behavior in aqueous systems. Both oleoyl-based nucleoside lipids adopted a lamellar crystalline phase in the neat form at room temperature, and the phytanoyl derivative exhibited a fluid isotropic phase. Under excess water conditions, the presence of one branched (phytanoyl) or one unsaturated (oleoyl) chain promoted the formation of a liquid-crystalline lamellar phase at physiological temperatures. In contrast, the 30, 50 -dioleoylthymidine derivative is <b>nonswelling</b> and does not exhibit lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase behavior. The nucleolipids&# 039; propensity for DNA-type binding and recognition has been evaluated by using a monolayer system to measure surface pressure-area isotherms in a Langmuir trough and indicates that the nucleoside base is available for nonspecific hydrogen bonding in the monolayer liquid expanded state for the single-chain nucleolipids but not for the dual-chain amphiphile...|$|E
40|$|Badlands are {{pervasive}} {{in a wide}} range of environmental conditions across the Mediterranean region, including arid, semiarid, and humid environments. On montane (cold subhumid and humid) Mediterranean landscapes, harsh thermal conditions on north-facing hillslopes favour intense bedrock weathering by freezing and impose serious constraints on plant colonization. The above are the customary arguments to explain the high abundance of montane badlands on north-exposed shady aspects. We studied the distribution and morphological diversity of badlands in the upper Llobregat basin (Catalan Pyrenees, NE Spain), using remote sensing information (high-resolution orthophotos and complementary Landsat 8 imagery), digital elevation data, and regional information on lithology. Badlands extend over about 200 ha in the upper Llobregat basin and occur on two different parent materials, swelling (smectite-rich) continental Garumnian lutites of late Cretaceous age, and <b>nonswelling</b> (illitic) marine Eocene marls. Vegetation, assessed by remote-sensed vegetation greenness, is less developed on north-facing badland slopes. However, badland slope-aspect distribution varies considerably with lithology. While badlands on Eocene marls show preferential distribution on north-facing shady slopes, badland occurrence on Garumnian lutites does not reveal clear slope-aspect anisotropy patterns. Lithology also affects slope gradient, with badlands on Eocene marls showing rougher topography (30 – 40 ° average slope angle) than on Garumnian lutites (20 – 30 °). Badland morphological differences induced by lithology are discussed in terms of the greater weathering susceptibility and slope instability of the swelling, smectite-rich Garumnian lutites than of the <b>nonswelling</b> Eocene marls. Elevation, which broadly controls annual precipitation and winter air temperature within the region, shows no clear influence on badland distribution. Overall, our results reveal lithology as the main factor controlling badland distribution and morphological diversity under the montane Mediterranean conditions of the upper Llobregat basin. © 2016 Elsevier B.

H- 2 production measurements evidenced that the H- 2 yield in synthetic talc {{was of the}} same order of magnitude as in water, implying a very efficient production, and then recombination, of hydrogen atoms arising from the lysis of structural -OH groups.

The produced defects in irradiated synthetic talc were investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which enabled proposing reaction mechanisms. Lastly, the EPR spectra evidenced the presence, at 298 K, of hydrogen atoms, which were detected few days after irradiation in both types of talc. This surprisingly high stability was mainly attributed to the absence of water molecules. It is proposed that the hydrogen atoms are stabilized in octahedra between two tetraedra sheets...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of thermal treating on the release rate of diclofenac sodium from Eudragit RS and Eudragit RL matrices. Eudragit RS and RL are <b>nonswelling</b> polymers that have a low glass transition (Tg) temperature. The matrices were thermally treated at different temperatures (40, 50, 60, and 70 degrees C) for different periods of times (2, 5, and 24 h). The results showed that thermal treating at temperatures less than the Tg of the polymer has no effect on the release of the drug, whereas heat-treating at temperatures higher than the Tg decreases the release rate of diclofenac sodium from matrices. It was shown that the duration of heat treatment was also an important factor in controlling the release rate of diclofenac sodium from Eudragit matrices. The results showed that an increase in the duration of heat treatment from 2 h to 24 h resulted in a reduction in the release rate of the drug. Scanning electron microscopy of the cross section of the tablet before and after heat treating showed that the tablets were deformed and fused into a continuous and homogeneous structure after heat treating. Thermally treated tablets demonstrated fewer surface defects than did nonthermally treated tablets.

40|$|The {{effects of}} auranofin, chloro(triethylphosphine) gold(l) (TEPAu), and aurothiomalate on {{mitochondrial}} respiration, pyridine nucleotide redox state, membrane permeability properties, and redox enzymes activities were compared. The three gold(l) derivatives, in the submicromolar range, were extremely potent inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase and stimulators of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT). Auranofin appeared {{as the most}} effective one. In the micromolar range, it inhibited respiratory chain and glutathione peroxidase activity only slightly if not at all. TEPAu and aurothiomalate exhibited effects similar to auranofin, although TEPAu showed a moderate inhibition on respiration. Aurothiomalate inhibited glutathione peroxidase at concentrations where auranofin and TEPAu were without effect. Under <b>nonswelling</b> conditions, the presence of auranofin and aurothiomalate did not alter the redox properties of the mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides indicating that membrane permeability transition occurred independently of the preliminary oxidation of pyridine nucleotides. Under the same experimental conditions, TEPAu showed a moderate stimulation of pyridine nucleotides oxidation. Mitochondrial total thiol groups, {{in the presence of}} the gold(I) derivatives, slightly decreased, indicating the occurrence of an oxidative trend. Concomitantly with MPT, gold(l) compounds determined the release of cytochrome c that, however, occurred also in the presence of cyclosporin A and, partially, of EGTA, indicating its independence of MPT.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} new approach for the direct liquefaction of coal to produce an all-distillate product slate at a sizable cost reduction over current technology. The approach integrated coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst impregnation, liquefaction, product recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. Heterofunctional solvents were the most effective in swelling coals. Also solvent blends such as isopropanol/water were more effective than pure solvents alone. Impregnating slurry catalysts simultaneously during coal swelling showed that better uptake was achieved with <b>nonswelling</b> solvent and higher impregnation temperature. Some enhancement in initial coal conversion was seen liquefying SO{sub 2 }-treated Black Thunder coal with slurry catalysts, and also when hydrogen donor liquefaction solvents were used. Noncatalytic reactions showed no benefit from SO{sub 2 } treatment. Coupling coal swelling and SO{sub 2 } treatment with slurry catalysts was also not beneficial, although high conversion was seen with continuous operation and long residence time, however, similar high conversion was observed with untreated coal.

The chelation and self-assembly structures of these rare-earth oleates have been studied by elemental analysis, Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. Elemental analysis and FTIR results indicate that three oleate anions are complexed with one lanthanide cation and, {{with the exception of}} anhydrous cerium(III) oleate, form either a mono- or a hemihydrate. The X-ray analysis showed that the neat lanthanide soaps have a lamellar bilayer structure at room temperature. The thermal behavior has been investigated by cross-polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). POM scans showed that all the lanthanide oleates form a lamellar phase in the presence of excess water. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and XRD were used to investigate the internal structure of the bulk lanthanide oleates in excess water, and these X-ray results conﬁrmed that the lanthanide oleates do not swell in water. Select lanthanide oleates were dispersed in water to form <b>nonswelling</b> lamellar submicrometer particles, conﬁrmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and synchrotron SAXS measurements. NMR results indicated that colloidal dispersions of lanthanide oleates containing paramagnetic ions, such as gadolinium(III), terbium(III), and dysprosium(III), have a signiﬁcant effect on the longitudinal (T 1) and transverse (T 2) relaxation times of protons in water.

40|$|Tablets of {{different}} composition of microcrystalline cellulose/a-monohydrate lactose and fixed drug (Acetaminophen) concentration are compressed in a {{rotary tablet press}} replicator at different compaction forces. Tablets are formulated to act as immediate release (IR) drug delivery system. Performance of IR tablets is usually controlled by the dynamics of solvent penetration into the tablet through competing mechanisms: capillarity, diffusion, and swelling/diffusion sometimes called case 2 diffusion, inducing matrix swelling. We design a device to measure tablet deformation dynamics and mass of liquid uptake simultaneously when a tablet is put in contact with a liquid through its bottom surface. On the other hand, dissolution profiles are measured in a standard USP II apparatus. Dissolution profiles present a nonmonotonic behavior with compression: the active dissolves relatively slowly when tablets are compressed below a certain threshold. Above the threshold, the dissolution rate decreases as expected due to decrease in porosity. Swelling and water uptake rates present the same nonmonotonic behavior with compression than dissolution profiles, indicating a very good correlation between them. This implies that the methodology may be used {{not only as a}} research tool and for quality by design development of tablets, but also for fast assessments in quality control environment. We finally demonstrate that a different mechanism for water penetration in the tablet is in place for differently compressed tablets: interparticle pore capillarity and swelling assisted uptake, respectively. We decoupled the two mechanisms by comparing dynamics of water versus a <b>nonswelling</b> liquid uptake. We postulate that the different mechanism for water uptake is responsible for the nonmonotonic behavior and the optimum dissolution rate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{key feature}} of {{swelling}} clays such as montmorillonite, {{in contrast with}} the <b>nonswelling</b> clays, is their ability to adsorb water in the interlayer space. This interlayer water interacts with the interlayer cations or with the silicate layer surface inside the interlayer space, or with both. However, no direct experimental technique offers the possibility to determine separately these two contributions. In order to determine the hydration energy for interlayer alkali cations, we use a combination of electrostatic calculations of the surface energy and measurements of immersion heats in clays. The results show that Li+ and Na+ cations are characterized by a strongly exothermic hydration energy in the interlayer space, in contrast with K+, Rb+, and Cs+ which have a much lower hydration energy in the interlayer space. The extreme situation is that of Cs+, for which an endothermic hydration energy value is obtained. These trends are in good agreement with results from molecular modeling calculations and consistent with the evolution observed in the water adsorption isotherms. The hydration energy of the silicate layers was also calculated, and the total driving force for hydration in swelling clays could therefore be determined. For Li+- and Na+-montmorillonite, the hydration of cations is clearly the main contribution to the overall driving force for the hydration of clay. On the contrary, hydration of the silicate layers plays the most important role in the hydration of montmorillonite exchanged with the larger cations such as K+, Rb+, and Cs+. These results provide a physical basis for the differences observed in macroscopic swelling behavior between Li+- and Na+-montmorillonite, on one hand, and K+-, Rb+- and Cs+-montmorillonite, on the other hand...|$|E
40|$|Gadolinium oleate {{has been}} added at various {{concentrations}} to a Myverol inverse bicontinuous cubic phase forming system, and the potential of these systems as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents has been investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) measurements on the Gd oleate/Myverol systems indicate that Gd oleate is at least partially incorporated within the cubic phase of Myverol. However, at Gd oleate concentrations greater than 1 wt %, partial phase separation of the system may occur {{with the formation of}} a Gd-oleate-rich lamellar phase as well as the cubic phase. Bulk Gd oleate/Myverol mixtures can be dispersed into stable colloidal dispersions. SAXS and cryo-TEM measurements on these dispersions indicate that the presence of Gd oleate in the Myverol system prevents the formation of cubosomes from the bulk cubic phase. Instead, the dispersion consists of putative Gd-oleate-rich <b>nonswelling</b> lamellar nanoparticles as well as colloidal particles lacking ordered internal structure. In vitro studies on these dispersions demonstrated that the relaxivity of select Gd oleate/Myverol systems is much higher than that of pure Gd oleate, exemplifying the promise of this system type for magnetic resonance imaging. The highest water proton relaxivities (r 1 = 34. 2 mM- 1 s- 1 and r 2 = 27. 3 mM- 1 s- 1 at 20 MHz and room temperature) were obtained at a Gd oleate loading concentration of 1 wt %, with a subsequent decrease in relaxivity with increasing Gd oleate concentration. These maximum relaxivities compare favorably with the relaxivities for the commercial contrast agent, Magnevist (r 1 = 4. 91 mM- 1 s- 1 and r 2 = 6. 26 mM- 1 s- 1 at 20 MHz and room temperature) ...|$|E

It is proposed that the hydrogen atoms are stabilized in octahedra between two tetraedra sheets. ■ INTRODUCTION The radiolytic decomposition of water or of −OH groups has a significant impact on processes relevant for the nuclear industry. 1 − 7 Thus, the radiolytically H 2 formed by this decomposition might lead to explosion and overpressure hazards inside the reactor or in waste packages. In some countries, natural and engineered clay barriers are considered as possible protections for the disposal of high activity and long life-medium activity radioactive wastes. 8 − 10 It is therefore of paramount importance to understand how ionizing radiation affects clay minerals, and their corresponding reactivity, which is scarcely done in the literature. 3, 11 − 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we used whole-cell patch clamp {{recordings}} to investigate swelling-activated Cl-currents (ICl-swell) in M- 1 mouse cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells. Hypotonic cell swelling reversibly increased the whole-cell Cl- conductance by about 30 -fold. The I-V relationship was outwardly-rectifying and ICl-swell displayed a characteristic voltage-dependence with relatively fast inactivation upon large depolarizing and slow activation upon hyperpolarizing voltage steps. Reversal potential measurements revealed a selectivity sequence SCN- > I- > Br- > Cl- > > gluconate. ICl-swell was inhibited by tamoxifen, NPPB (5 -nitro- 2 (3 -phenylpropylamino) -benzoate), DIDS (4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid), flufenamic acid, niflumic acid, and glibenclamide, in descending order of potency. Extracellular cAMP had no significant effect. ICl-swell was Ca 2 + independent, but current activation depended {{on the presence of}} a high- energy gamma-phosphate group from intracellular ATP or ATP gamma S. Moreover, it depended on the presence of intracellular Mg 2 + and was inhibited by staurosporine, which indicates that a phosphorylation step is involved in channel activation. Increasing the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration by using ionomycin stimulated Cl- currents with a voltage dependence different from that of ICl-swell. Analysis of whole-cell current records during early onset of ICl-swell and during final recovery revealed discontinuous step-like changes of the whole-cell current level which were not observed under <b>nonswelling</b> conditions. A single-channel I-V curve constructed using the smallest resolvable current transitions detected at various holding potentials and revealed a slope conductance of 55, 15, and 8 pS at + 120, 0, and - 120 mV, respectively. The larger current steps observed in these recordings had about 2, 3, or 4 {{times the size of the}} putative single-channel current amplitude, suggesting a coordinated gating of several individual channels or channel subunits. In conclusion we have functionally characterized ICl-swell in M- 1 CCD cells and have identified the underlying single channels in whole-cell current recordings...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} works, it was {{demonstrated that the}} combined use of quantitative energy-dispersive electron probe X-ray microanalysis (ED-EPMA), which {{is also known as}} low- Z particle EPMA, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) imaging has great potential for a detailed characterization of individual aerosol particles. In this study, extensively chemically modified (aged) individual Asian dust particles collected during an Asian dust storm event on 11 November 2002 in Korea were characterized by the combined use of low- Z particle EPMA and ATR-FTIR imaging. Overall, 109 individual particles were classified into four particle types based on their morphology, elemental concentrations, and molecular species and/or functional groups of individual particles available from the two analytical techniques: Ca-containing (38 %), NaNO 3 -containing (30 %), silicate (22 %), and miscellaneous particles (10 %). Among the 41 Ca-containing particles, 10, 8, and 14 particles contained nitrate, sulfate, and both, respectively, whereas only two particles contained unreacted CaCO 3. Airborne amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) particles were observed in this Asian dust sample for the first time, where their IR peaks for the insufficient symmetric environment of CO 3 2 − ions of ACC were clearly differentiated from those of crystalline CaCO 3. This paper also reports the first inland field observation of CaCl 2 particles probably converted from CaCO 3 through the reaction with HCl(g). HCl(g) was likely released from the reaction of sea salt with NO x /HNO 3, as all 33 particles of marine origin contained NaNO 3 (no genuine sea salt particle was encountered). Some silicate particles with minor amounts of calcium were observed to be mixed with nitrate, sulfate, and water. Among 24 silicate particles, 10 particles are mixed with water, the presence of which could facilitate atmospheric heterogeneous reactions of silicate particles including swelling minerals, such as montmorillonite and vermiculite, and <b>nonswelling</b> ones, such as feldspar and quartz. This paper provides detailed information on the physicochemical characteristics of these aged individual Asia dust particles through the combined use of the two single-particle analytical techniques, and using this analytical methodology it is clearly shown that internal mixing states of the aged particles are highly complicated...|$|E
