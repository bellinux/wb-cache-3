50|$|Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii or Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> is {{a fungus}} that infects Douglas fir and causes {{yellowing}} of foliage and reduction in growth. It is endemic in western North American stands of Douglas fir, but was first discovered in trees planted Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|Rhizosphaera infects white spruce, {{blue spruce}} (Picea pungens), and Norway spruces {{throughout}} Ontario, causing severe defoliation and sometimes killing small, stressed trees. White spruce is intermediately susceptible. Dead needles show rows of black fruiting bodies. Infection usually begins on lower branches. On white spruce, infected needles are usually retained {{on the tree}} into the following summer. The fungicide Chlorthalonil is registered for controlling this <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> (Davis 1997).|$|E
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>cast</b> {{diseases}} {{in general are}} somewhat difficult to diagnose simply because their symptoms are similar to low pH, poor nutrition, fertilizer or chemical burn, and even root rots. Correct diagnosis requires microscopic examination of {{the size and shape}} of the fungal producing ascospores. Unfortunately these fungal spores are produced quite infrequently; after the disease infects needles, it will not produce symptoms or additional spores until the following year. In addition, Cyclaneusma may not be the only fungus present on the diseased needles. Saprophytic fungi live on dead tissue and may therefore continue to worsen the infection on needles after they have fallen. Saprophytes will also be present if the needles were killed by fertilizer burn or root rots. Due to these obstacles, it is important to examine the spores directly after infection (while spores are being produced) in order to ensure that Cyclaneusma is indeed the pine’s cause of death.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} Fair Isle pattern uses circular or double pointed <b>needles,</b> <b>cast</b> on {{any number}} of stitches. Knitting then continues round and round, with the colours alternated every stitch. If the pattern is started with an even number of stitches, a vertically striped tube of fabric will be formed, while an odd number will create a diagonal grid that appears to mix the two colours.|$|R

50|$|The {{blue spruce}} is {{susceptible}} to several <b>needle</b> <b>casting</b> diseases which cause the needles to turn yellow, mottled or brown before they fall off. Various rust diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as needle fall. Canker caused by Cytospora attacks one of the lower branches first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white resin appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.|$|R
50|$|Cyclaneusma (<b>Needle</b> <b>cast)</b> {{primarily}} attacks Scots Pines. Austrian white, Eastern white, and Ponderosa pines {{are also}} among the infected. Young Scots Pines have been infected in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas in the US. There have also been many incidents in New Zealand. Cyclaneusma has been seen on Ponderosa pines in North Dakota and Nebraska. During early autumn, needles within {{the interior of the}} infected tree begin to develop yellow spots. As the fall progresses and the temperature drops, the infected needles become darker while brown horizontal bands appear on the needles’ surface. From October until about May, off-white fruiting bodies called pseudothecia appear on the yellow needles. This is a macroscopic sign as the fruiting bodies swell with moisture making them visible to the naked eye. The yellowing of needles that occurs in early September actually leads to premature - or the first detection of - needle-cast which causes a stunted growth. In fact, the most infected needles prematurely shed by December. Because the infected needles are within the interior of the tree, the newer needles on the outer surface of the pines are flushed green and resistant to the disease. However, the premature shedding of needles in the interior can extend outwards leading to a loss in overall growth. The distribution of Cyclaneusma is not uniform but scattered with symptomatic and unaffected trees in close proximity with one another.|$|E

50|$|Adults {{emerge in}} late spring, and after mating, the female lays eggs on the {{previous}} year's needles. The eggs hatch in about two weeks and the larvae move {{to the base of}} the old needles and start to feed, only moving on to new needles if they exhaust the supply of old ones. The larvae construct silken webbing inside which they live in tubes, chewing off needles and pulling them inside the tubes for consumption; the tubes soon fill up with bits of <b>needles,</b> <b>cast</b> skins and frass. Older larvae construct their own individual tubes. By the end of June the larvae are fully developed and fall to the ground where they create earthen cells in which they spend the winter.|$|R

In this contribution, we discuss the effects of silvicultural operations on Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> and recommend specific actions to reduce the severity of the disease. We also suggest a method of assessing the severity of Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> damage to a stand based on years of needle retention. Our recommendations are based on disease severity and are designed to discriminate against Douglas-fir when planting, thinning, and harvesting stands suffering low, medium, and high Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> severity.

40|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>cast</b> {{caused by}} fungi {{of the genus}} Lophodermium Chevall. is a common disease in pine trees in Siberia.

30|$|Phytophthora pluvialis is {{the most}} {{consistently}} isolated pathogen associated with red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> of Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Controlled inoculation studies, including the reproduction of needle lesions, <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> and fulfilment of Koch’s postulates have provided further evidence {{that it is the}} primary cause of red <b>needle</b> <b>cast.</b> Phytophthora kernoviae was also recovered from symptomatic needles sourced from field sites relatively rarely. The extended history of Phytophthora kernoviae in New Zealand with no recognised association to red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> symptoms indicates this is not the primary cause of the disease. Recovery of both species from needle lesions along with reports of Phytophthora pinifolia in Chile indicate a consistent response to Phytophthora spp. infection within Pinus radiata. Furthermore, that given the right environmental conditions, Pinus radiata needles may be susceptible to infection by a broad range of Phytophthora species.|$|E
30|$|The {{association}} of Phytophthora pluvialis with red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> reflects the aetiology of the disease. The onset of red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> is observed during late autumn or winter in areas exposed to prolonged periods of wet conditions. This {{is consistent with}} reports for other forest Phytophthora species affecting leaves and needles including Phytophthora pinifolia on Pinus radiata and Phytophthora ramorum (Durán et al. [2008]; Werres et al. [2001]). Each of these diseases {{has been associated with}} needle wetness with observations made in areas favouring prolonged periods of canopy wetness. Climatic associations with red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> are under investigation and will be reported in due course.|$|E

In this trial <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> damage was assessed in three consecutive years using a fivegrade scale, dependent on the level of damages on current year needles. At the end of each growing season a tree height was measured. Plantation was significantly affected by infection average more than 66 % of current year damaged by the disease. Significant (p< 0. 001) correlation was detected between the degree of <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> damage and tree height increment as well as the tree height. Significant (p< 0. 001) differences in <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> infection level as well as tree height and height increment were found also between open-pollinated families. The results suggest a potentially increasing <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> infection due to predicted increase of temperature and precipitation, as well as the potential to select more resistant families against damages of this disease in tree breeding process...|$|E

30|$|A new needle {{disease was}} {{reported}} in Pinus radiata D. Don stands {{on the east coast}} of New Zealand during routine forest surveillance in late April 2008. Observations of the symptoms, their development and the apparent spread of the disease, known locally as red <b>needle</b> <b>cast,</b> all gave a strong indication of a likely biotic cause, which led to further investigations. Isolations made from symptomatic needles yielded an undescribed species of Phytophthora as the likely causal pathogen (Dick et al. [2014]). The causal pathogen has recently been described as Phytophthora pluvialis which is considered to be endemic to Oregon, USA (Reeser et al. [2013]). Subsequently, a second species Phytophthora kernoviae Brasier, Beales & Kirk, was also recovered from needles, though at a consistently lower rate (Dick et al. [2014]). Concurrent to epidemiological work for red <b>needle</b> <b>cast,</b> a range of trials were initiated to investigate possible fungicides that could be effective for management of red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> on Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Phosphorous acid was chosen as a key fungicide for further research on potential red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> management since this active ingredient (in the form of phosphorous acid) is used widely in agriculture and horticulture for control of Phytophthora species (Lobato et al. [2011]; Rebollar-Alviter et al. [2007]; Shearer and Crane [2009]).|$|E

30|$|The {{heritability}} estimated {{here for}} red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> was comparable with heritability estimates for other diseases on radiata pine. These include examples of Dothistroma needle blight in New Zealand (0.17 - 0.40; Carson [1989]; and Wilcox [1982] family-mean heritability of 0.32). Dothistroma needle blight heritabilities in Australia {{have ranged from}} non-significant to 0.69 (median 0.35); (Ivković et al. [2010]). Cyclaneusma <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> heritabilties (0.44 - 0.68; from Beets ([1997])) were slightly higher than the RNC heritabilities estimated here although estimates of individual narrow-sense heritabilities vary considerably between trial sites and are most frequently between 0.1 and 0.4 (Dungey et al. [2006]).|$|E
30|$|This study {{aimed to}} provide the first {{estimates}} of heritabilities from a clones-within-families genetics trial {{in order to determine}} whether tree breeding would help to mitigate the long-term effects of red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> disease on radiata pine in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii, {{the causal}} agent of Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> disease, is widely {{distributed}} throughout New Zealand, where the disease may cause significant growth losses in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plantations. In western Oregon, where the pathogen is native, pathogen abundance and disease severity are correlated with mean daily winter temperatures and spring moisture, enabling {{the development of}} climate-based disease prediction models. The distribution of P. gaeumannii and severity of Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> was surveyed in 16 Douglas-fir plantations throughout NewZealand in 2005. Retention of foliagewas assessed {{in the field and}} samples of 1 - and 2 -year-old needles were collected for assessment of P. gaeumannii abundance. Foliage retention and abundance of P. gaeumannii varied across sites. Less colonisation by P. gaeumannii and greater needle retention was found in the South Island. Abundance of P. gaeumannii was found to be positively correlated with August minimum temperature and June average temperature, and showed a similar relationship to winter temperature as observed in western Oregon. These data will be used to derive a disease prediction model for Swiss <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> in New Zealand {{that can be used to}} guide further research and provide short- and long-term disease risk predictions and cost/benefit analyses...|$|E
30|$|The figures {{obtained}} {{here for}} predicted gain are high {{compared with the}} estimates for needle loss from Dothistroma <b>needle</b> <b>cast,</b> outlined above. This result is encouraging, and implies that breeding will be a useful tool to mitigate future damage to New Zealand P. radiata forests.|$|E
30|$|Red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> {{was found}} to be most common on trees over four years old and most severe on trees over ten years old. Younger trees and {{seedlings}} have shown symptoms of infection but usually only when growing in close association with heavily infected older stands.|$|E

30|$|Red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{at a number of}} discrete sites predominantly in damp and/or elevated locations in the North Island of New Zealand and also in the north of the South Island. However, significant areas of the forest estate remain unaffected by the disease. Sites where symptoms have been frequently recorded, and where they are most severe, are typically prone to mist and fog, and hence to prolonged periods of needle wetness. Such sites are commonly at elevations greater than 500  m such as plateaus or ridge tops. Sites at lower elevations have different (lower) moisture conditions that result in reduced incidence and severity of red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> symptoms or their complete absence. At many sites, only the lower foliage has been affected and this feature, coupled with the seasonal onset of the disease during late autumn and winter when tree growth is negligible, may mean that tree growth will be largely unaffected. At the rare sites where disease levels have been severe during consecutive years there will be increment loss. The extent of this loss is currently being evaluated at a range of sites around the country. The findings presented here suggest the existence of clonal variation in host susceptibility to Phytophthora pluvialis/red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> (Table  1, Figure  9). This has been corroborated by a clonal field trial in New Zealand (Dungey et al., in preparation) which indicates that breeding efforts and careful selection of radiata clones selection can reduce the risk of red <b>needle</b> <b>cast</b> and thus limit economic losses from future pine plantations in New Zealand. This aspect will be further examined and selections of resistant lines employed in those sites where climatic conditions result in consistently high disease levels.|$|E
