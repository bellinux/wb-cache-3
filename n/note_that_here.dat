2500|$|In a {{location}} {{such as a}} steadily moving railway carriage, a dropped ball (as seen by an observer in the carriage) would behave as it would if it were dropped in a stationary carriage. The ball would simply descend vertically. It is possible to ignore {{the motion of the}} carriage by defining it as an inertial frame. [...] In a moving but non-accelerating frame, the ball behaves normally because the train and its contents continue to move at a constant velocity. [...] Before being dropped, the ball was traveling with the train at the same speed, and the ball's inertia ensured that it continued to move in the same speed and direction as the train, even while dropping. <b>Note</b> <b>that,</b> <b>here,</b> it is inertia which ensured that, not its mass.|$|E

2500|$|The {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} discontinuous linear maps on normed spaces can be generalized to all metrisable topological vector spaces, especially to all Fréchet-spaces, but there exist infinite-dimensional locally convex topological vector spaces such that every functional is continuous. On the other hand, the Hahn–Banach theorem, which applies to all locally convex spaces, guarantees the existence of many continuous linear functionals, and so a large dual space. [...] In fact, to every convex set, the Minkowski gauge associates a continuous linear functional. [...] The upshot is that spaces with fewer convex sets have fewer functionals, and in the worst-case scenario, a space may have no functionals at all other than the zero functional. This is the case for the L'p(R,dx) spaces with 0<nbsp&pnbsp&<nbsp&1, from which it follows that these spaces are nonconvex. <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>here</b> is indicated the Lebesgue measure on the real line. [...] There are other L'p spaces with 0nbsp&<nbsp&pnbsp&<nbsp&1 which do have nontrivial dual spaces.|$|E
