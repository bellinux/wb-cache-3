50|$|Burnett worked {{full-time}} for Ryan Aviation after ending school. One fall, he {{was laid}} off but he, determined to work, returned without pay. This resulted in him receiving flying instruction from the company as a Christmas present later that year in 1925. He began flying on his own after instruction of only four hours. In 1926, before even the federal government restricted activities in the air, the City of San Diego set up licensing for pilots. Burnett was within the first three pilots to receive their licsense from the city. Around this time, Charles Lindbergh came to Ryan to have the Spirit of St. Louis built. Burnett, obsessed with wings, worked on the woodworking and design of the wings. Lindbergh and Burnett became friends throughout the process. Lindbergh's wife even visited Dan's baby shower for his daughter. Before Lindbergh's flight, Burnett asked him to take a one dollar bill and a letter, both signed by Captain Martell and a red carnation given to him by Lieutenant Kelley. The carnation was the first flower to fly across the Atlantic. Lindbergh also said that he prized the possessions. The dollar bill later transferred hands to Sir Hubert Wilkins for his flight to the Antarctic and on Doles' race with Martin Jensen to Honolulu. Dan later worked for a while on parachute development with Jimmy Russell. In 1930, he then worked for the Bowlus Sailplane Company as the Superintendent. Then in 1933, returned to Ryan Aviation. In 1937, he became the foreman of wing and control surface assembly at Ryan. And in 1939, he became the head of the experimental department and was later appointed <b>night</b> <b>superintendent</b> in 1940. The San Diego Air and Space Museum acquired a wing rib jib that Burnett had built for the St. Louis and started selling replica wing ribs in the '80s for $45 along with a certificate of authenticity with Burnetts name on it. Burnett died on June 13, 1976.|$|E
