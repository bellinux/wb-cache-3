5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017, {{ahead of}} its FX debut on February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29. The season {{received}} critical acclaim for its cast, particularly Stevens; Hawley's visuals and design; and the nonlinear, unreliable nature of the storytelling. Several critics did note that the latter aspects would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> all viewers, and some criticized this as just {{the latest in a}} trend of series with unreliable narratives. Legion was renewed for a second season on March 15, 2017.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of gross}} {{domestic}} product or gross national product should be treated with caution as this does not accurately measure a country's ability to provide aid. Similarly, whether to use 'nominal' or 'real' GNP/GDPs can be argued. Some GDP/GNP figures are also out of date e.g. for the year 2002, or even 2001, so comparisons between countries may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the same time period. A better comparison might be used by examining purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP/GNP figures (as used in the CIA factbook).|$|E
500|$|In 1870 Ge again {{returned}} to Saint Petersburg there {{he turned to}} Russian history for subject matter. The painting [...] (1871) was a great success, but other historical paintings were met without interest. Ge took the cold response to his work very hard. He wrote that a man should live by doing agricultural work, and the art should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> sale. He bought a small khutor (farm) in Chernigov gubernia (currently Ukraine) and moved there. He became acquainted with Leo Tolstoy and became an enthusiastic follower of his philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{economic}} themes, Bezner {{said that there are}} political elements that will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> everyone. The Jersey Journal critic William Kulesa said its [...] "deeply considered speculation on society, technology, and the future" [...] made it high-quality science fiction. Newsarama reviewer Vanessa Gabriel said Lazarus [...] "engages the reader with plausibility" [...] and Chin-Tanner found it to be a character driven story even though it dealt with political and scientific issues. While Ana Grilo recommended the book for The Book Smugglers, she felt the disparity in numbers between the family, serf, and waste was too unstable to be plausible.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the group}} have {{generally}} been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several notable musicians, including Rush, John Lydon, Marc Almond, Graham Coxon, Luca Prodan, Mark E. Smith, John Frusciante, Bruce Dickinson and Julian Cope. Dickinson, {{who has been a}} fan of the band since he saw them at Oundle School aged 13, said that Hammill was one of his childhood heroes. Coxon is particularly fond of [...] "House with No Door" [...] from H to He (1970), saying the track is [...] "extremely beautiful, with Jackson's truly lovely sax-and-flute instrumental section." [...] Almond recalled hearing [...] "Killer" [...] for the first time saying, [...] "I'd never heard anything like it before. It wasn't just Peter's snarling operatic vocal, it was the mix of instruments... I became an instant fan." [...] Mentioning their reputation as something of an acquired taste, Lydon said, [...] "There's a few Van Der Graaf things I like, but I'm not going to recommend anything to anyone. It might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> them. Music doesn't come with a set of guidelines." ...|$|E
500|$|Her last Mercury {{album was}} The Innocent Years in 2000. Before the album's release, Mattea {{returned}} to West Virginia {{to care for}} her father, who had been diagnosed with colon cancer. She said that this resulted in a very intermittent recording process, but also informed the album's content; she told Country Standard Time, [...] "I {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about what's important to me. I think this is an album about those things." [...] Although Mattea rarely writes her material, she wrote two songs on the album with Vezner. The album's final track, a novelty song called [...] "BFD", was included as a bonus track because it was popular with fans, but she was unsure of how to sequence it with the rest of the album. [...] "The Trouble with Angels" [...] and [...] "BFD" [...] made the Hot Country Songs charts in 2000, although neither made Top 40. Country Standard Time reviewer Eli Messinger wrote that [...] "though the smooth sound and heart-on-her-sleeve lyrics may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the country roots fan...Mattea's superb voice and mature readings are clearly the work of an accomplished artist chasing her musical muse." ...|$|E
500|$|The PC and Xbox One {{releases}} of Fragments of Him received [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, {{according to the}} review aggregator site Metacritic. On Steam, the game varies between 80% and 90% positive reviews. Reviewers said {{that because of the}} graphics, as well as the slow pace of the game, it was obviously created for casual gamers. Bob Richardson of the website RPGFan said that it might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> everyone, and would appeal to those who like relaxing video games. He said that the design of the graphics might be too minimalistic for today, although he liked it and thought that it worked well with the game. He said that it was worth trying out and that the time the creators had put into making the game was obvious. Jose Rodriguez of the website IGN praised the [...] "deep and realistic" [...] story and said that the game gave priority to the narrative, and that it will appeal to casual gamers because of its realism and leisurely gameplay. Rodriguez criticised the duration of the game saying, that it is quite short for its price. Andrea Maderna, also from IGN, said that the game was not suited for everybody, but that those who appreciate games based on interactive storytelling should try playing it.|$|E

In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop). Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.|$|E

Helicopters on board the ship cannot tow its mine-hunting sensors, so it must rely on unmanned systems for mine countermeasures, although those systems are not in service, and will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> several years. Its 30mm Mk44 Bushmaster IIs [...] "exhibit reliability problems." [...] The Mk 110 57mm gun is differently designed on the Freedom class, which cause vibrations at high speeds that make accurate firing difficult. [...] The integrated weapons systems and air/surface search radar have “performance deficiencies” that affect the ship’s “tracking and engagement of contacts.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ramtanu Lahiri {{returned}} to Krishnanagar College before retirement. Alfred Smith, principal of Krishnanagar College, wrote on his application for pension, “In parting with Baboo Ram Tanoo Lahiri I may {{be allowed to}} say that Government will lose the services of an educational officer, than whom [...] no officer has discharged his public duties with greater fidelity, zeal and devotion, or has laboured more assiduously and successfully for the moral elevation of his pupils.” [...] On retirement, Ramtanu Lahiri settled down in Krishnanagar but it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> long. He lived in Gobardanga for some time as guardian of the zemindar’s sons. When Keshub Chunder Sen established the Bharat Ashram in 1872, he moved in along with his family. He presided over the first day meeting of the All-India National Conference in Kolkata in 1883.|$|E

Gabriel's opening week gross {{represented the}} second highest of an Australian-made film released in 2007, behind Rogue which opened the previous week with approximately A$667 000. In its opening weekend, Gabriel opened on 98 screens and averaged $4,797 per screen, the third highest per screen average of the top 20 grossing films for the weekend. The Age journalist Jim Schembri described Gabriel's opening week as [...] "impressive," [...] writing that [...] "The gloom-laden film may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> all tastes, {{but it looks like}} it's hitting the right spots with its intended audience of goths, emos and people who have trouble sleeping at night."
