40|$|Mutual {{toxicity}} of chromium and <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphates</b> {{for growth and}} development of maize plantlets was studied. Its combined action at low concentrations (10 – 5 M) results to significant suppression of growth of both above-ground and root systems of maize.

Then, on the sixth day, the growth of above-ground and root system was inhibited equally. Application of high nickel concentration and low chrome concentration, in contrast to high chromium and low nickel levels, depresses the biomass gain.

In view of this challenge, the influence of vehicular pollution on the accumulation of heavy metal in the surface soils of the Ado-Odo local government of Ogun State, Nigeria has been investigated. The main objective of this research was to determine the effect of vehicular emissions such as copper, cadmium, lead, manganese, <b>nickel</b> and <b>sulphate</b> on soil around Ota. Seven locations were selected due to the high concentration of traffic experienced in the location and three sites with little or no traffic concentration were also selected within the seven locations to act as a control sites.

However, the background chemical information for this process, including the fundamental physicochemical properties of acidic metal sulphate leachate solutions, is not well known. In order to improve the efficiency of current and future HPAL plants, high quality physicochemical and thermodynamic data will be necessary. This thesis reports measurements on the densities and heat capacities of <b>nickel</b> and cobalt <b>sulphate</b> solutions and their mixtures along with detailed studies {{of the nature of}} the species present and the thermodynamics of their interconversions. Densities and heat capacities of <b>nickel</b> and cobalt <b>sulphate</b> and perchlorate solutions and their ternary mixtures were measured using a vibrating tube densimeter and a flow microcalorimeter respectively. These data were used to calculate the apparent molal volumes and heat capacities of these solutions. Standard partial molal quantities were then obtained by appropriate extrapolation procedures, along with the volume and heat capacity changes of ion pair formation. A comparison has been made between experimental densities and heat capacities with those predicted by Young's rule. Good agreement was obtained except when the degree of complexation varied significantly in the mixtures. The various ion pair species in <b>nickel</b> and cobalt <b>sulphate</b> solutions, along with those of magnesium sulphate (which is a major impurity in HPAL leachates), were reinvestigated by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Doubly solvent separated ion pairs, solvent shared ion pairs and contact ion pairs were shown to exist simultaneously in solution and their concentrations were determined from dilute to near-saturated concentrations. Evidence for the possible existence of a triple ion, M 2 SO 4 2 +, was also obtained in highly concentrated solutions. The equilibrium constants of the stepwise reactions and the effective hydration numbers of ions and ion pairs were also calculated. The heats of complexation of nickel(II) and cobalt(II) sulphate were determined at different ionic strengths in sodium perchlorate media by titration calorimetry. These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state values.

40|$|Abstract: Solvent {{extraction}} {{was used}} to recover nickel and zinc from synthetic acidic solution. Many leaching solution and waste waters contain both zinc and nickel at the same time. Bis (2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272) and Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA) were used to separate nickel and zinc. In the D 2 EHPA system, at equilibrium pH of 2, zinc extraction was more than 98 % whereas nickel extraction was only 0. 36 %. The extraction of metals was found to increase with an increase of pH of the aqueous phase. At equilibrium pH 3. 5, zinc extraction was completed and higher than 99 % zinc was extracted using Cyanex 272. The maximum nickel extractions using D 2 EHPA and Cyanex 272 were achieved at equilibrium pH 4. 5 and 7. 5, respectively. Both extractants showed the relatively good separation levels between nickel and zinc. D 2 EHPA and Cyanex 272 isotherms for single metal solutions showed that the extraction order was Zn 2 +>Ni 2 +.
