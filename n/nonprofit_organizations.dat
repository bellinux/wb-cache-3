40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> {{can have a}} {{positive}} rationale in an economy based on the division of labor, {{taking into account that}} the process of the division of labor occurs through profit-motivated economic behavior. By reconsidering existing economic theories of <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> {{in the context of the}} theory of the division of labor, the paper shows <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> to be an institutional consequence of two limitations on the division of labor: high coordination costs among interdependent agents and the existence of production-related, as opposed to consumption-related, preferences. These limitations prevent the system of the division of labor from fully gratifying the consumption preferences of economic agents and, thereby, create a functional niche for <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization.</b> Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2006 D 23, division of labor, <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization,</b> preferences, property rights,...|$|R

An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E

5|$|Two <b>nonprofit</b> <b>{{organization}}s</b> {{manage the}} park, which NYC Parks owns and operates. Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization founded in 2009, manages educational and cultural programs, and maintains the recreational areas. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, an independent nonprofit established in 1992, provides educational programs and assists in the upkeep of the park's natural areas. However, {{the two organizations}} {{have not had the}} same amount of funding as similar private organizations who manage parks in wealthier areas of the city. In 2013, Friends of Van Cortlandt Park only raised $416,612—as opposed to the Central Park Conservancy, which in 2016 had an $81 million endowment to maintain Central Park, or the Four Freedoms Parks Conservancy, which raised $8 million in 2011 alone for the construction of the Four Freedoms Park. Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park; the earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the public relations}} evaluation process in a <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization.</b> By conducting {{a case study of}} a nonprofit organization’s approach on evaluation, the researcher investigates and analyzes the common success indicators found in the theoretical public relations evaluation models and the success indicators used by the <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> in its evaluation. Based on the findings of this study, a theoretical model of public relations evaluation dedicated to the <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> is proposed. The results of the analysis reveal that the <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> values evaluation and looks at it as tool for improving the organizational impact. This thesis proposes that the evaluation of the <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organization</b> should focus more on the role of public relations as a bridge between the nonprofit and its audience, and between the organizational goals and the community goals. The proposed model of public relations evaluation is aimed at helping the organization to better fulfill its objectives and to pave the way towards a dedicated theoretical framework for nonprofit public relations evaluation.
