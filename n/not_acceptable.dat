5|$|After World War I, {{and with}} another European war looming, {{leaders from the}} {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize about how {{to cooperate with the}} government to avoid the difficulties of World War I. Holding a common view that any participation in military service was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable,</b> they devised a plan of civilian alternative service, based on experience gained by American Friends Service Committee work in Europe during and after World War I and forestry service done by Russian Mennonites in lieu of military service in Tsarist Russia.|$|E

5|$|Daud Khan, who {{launched}} his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and finally {{arrived at the}} Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms of surrender and payment of tribute were <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to the Chiros'; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chiro rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Chiros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied by Daud Khan, and the Chiros fled to the jungles. Hindus were driven out, the temples were destroyed, and Islamic rule imposed.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and Philip {{were married}} on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They {{received}} 2500 wedding gifts {{from around the}} world. Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell. In post-war Britain, it was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, {{to be invited to}} the wedding. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.|$|E

The case was closed in 2011, when it was ruled that the tape was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> evidence {{and there was no}} overpricing. It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and the tape was accepted as evidence.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal calculus {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.|$|E
5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{men have}} {{resigned}} {{the office of}} governor {{before the end of}} their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Wendell H. Ford. Six resigned to accept a higher office: Crittenden was appointed Attorney General of the United States and the other five were elected to the U.S. Senate. Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin's power was entirely checked by a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state's government in gridlock, Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned as Speaker, and the Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James Fisher Robinson as Speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State William H. Seward {{that there would be}} no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would {{continue}} to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber-rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable.</b> Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of India has {{hundreds}} of languages. During the British Raj, English was the official language. When the Indian Independence Movement gained {{momentum in the}} early part of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to make Hindustani as a common language to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government. As early as 1918, Mahatma Gandhi established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha (Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India). In 1925, the Indian National Congress switched to Hindustani from English for conducting its proceedings. Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were supporters of Hindustani and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindustani in non-Hindi speaking Provinces of India. The idea of making Hindustani or Hindi the common language, was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to Periyar, who viewed it as an attempt to make Tamils subordinate to North Indians.|$|E

Instead, a research conference should always have room for industrial case studies, evaluated according to criteria for empirical research. Such case studies would <b>not</b> be <b>acceptable</b> at a practitioners’ industrial conference, just as papers presented at such conferences would <b>not</b> be <b>acceptable</b> at research conferences. It follows as corollary that if researchers want to become familiar with problems and solutions of RE practice, they should visit industrial conferences...|$|R
5|$|The {{adoption}} {{of an official}} language for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the framing of the Indian Constitution after India's independence from the United Kingdom. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India with English continuing as an associate official language {{for a period of}} fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations.|$|E
5|$|On {{account of}} the rivalry between the chiefs of Bobbili and Vizianagaram, in 1756 there was a {{rebellion}} among the local chieftains which necessitated strong military measures. General Bussy attacked the rebel forces with a contingent of European forces, supported by 11,000 troops of the Raja of Vizianagaram as a token of his loyalty. The Raja of Vizianagaram instigated General Bussy by a canard stating that the Raja of Bobbili was behind the rebellion. It is {{also said that the}} Raja bribed his interpreters to persuade General Bussy to direct Ranga Rao, the Raja of Bobbili to vacate the Bobbili Fort and shift southward. General Bussy cautiously made an offer to the Chief of Bobbili that he would be pardoned if he moved away from Bobbili, and in return given a compensatory package of equivalent land elsewhere. But this was <b>not</b> <b>acceptable</b> to the Chief of Bobbili. Then, General Bussy attacked the fort several times, breached the mud fort with cannons, and took control of the ramparts of the fort. Although the Raja of Bobbili and his defenders realized their precarious condition, they fought fiercely but eventually lost the battle. When General Bussy entered the fort with his depleted strength of soldiers he found dead bodies scattered in the fort area. At that time an old man approached General Bussy and handed him a child who he said was the son of the dead Raja of Bobbili. The Raja of Vizianagaram, happy with his victory in the hard fought battle, rejoiced by entering the Bobbili city and hoisted the Flag of France. But his jubilation was short lived. Three days after this event, the Raja of Vizianagaram's camp was attacked in the night by three people of Bobbili, including Tandra Paparayudu who had rushed to the demolished Bobbili Fort to help his sister's family. He killed the Raja of Vizianagaram and then committed suicide along with his accomplices.|$|E
