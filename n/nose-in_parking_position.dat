50|$|This wheel {{arrangement}} allows {{entry and}} exit at four points around the vehicle's perimeter. The CityCar {{was designed for}} front entry, which is feasible {{because there is no}} engine in the way. Baggage and emergency entry and exit are at the rear, and there is no side entry and exit. This configuration allows <b>nose-in</b> <b>parking</b> to the curb, and passenger embarkation from the sidewalk rather than from the road, which allows the elimination of the need for side clearance between parked vehicles. It also simplifies the vehicle, which does not need to accommodate door openings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Automatic/semi-automatic parking system {{consists}} of three components: target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation, path planning, and path tracking. This paper summarizes published papers about target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation up to now, and proposes four phase strategy based on the strong and weak points of each method. Generally, target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation can be classified into four categories: GUI-based, parking slot marking-based, free space-based, and infrastructure-based. Among them, according to used sensor and signal processing technology free space-based {{can be divided into}} seven categories again: ultrasonic sensor-based, short range radar(SRR) -based, still image-based, motion stereo-based, binocular stereo-based, light stripe projection(LSP) based, and scanning laser radar-based. As we can not find one almighty method, we expect target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation method to evolve according to changes of related technologies and industrial environments. Our prediction suggests four phase strategy: 1) Ultrasonic sensor-based free space detection + rear view camera-based monitoring, 2) ultrasonic sensor-based free space detection + human machine interface (HMI) + semi-automatic parking slot markings recognition, 3) scanning laser radar-based + HMI + semi-automatic parking slot markings recognition, and 4) scanning laser radar-based...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{according}} to whether they have a fixed <b>parking</b> <b>position,</b> the PrEVs {{can be divided into}} three groups: ① Group A, the PrEVs with fixed <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> and self-charging posts. ② Group B, the PrEVs without fixed <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> but equipped with battery swapping system. ③ Group C, for which centralized charging in charging station is the only choice. Assuming a PrEV in Group C can finish its charging before 22 : 00, it charges and leaves, otherwise the charging station will take charge of it for both charging and parking till its owner come to pick it up on the next day. According to [19], the proportions of Group A, B and C are set as 0.55, 0.33 and 0.12 respectively.|$|R

50|$|The main {{passenger}} terminal {{consists of three}} interconnected buildings totaling approximately 220000 ft2 m2. The central building consists of just under 120000 ft2 m2 of space while the western and eastern wings occupy slightly more than 50000 ft2 m2 each. The apron fronting the {{passenger terminal}} has ten aircraft <b>parking</b> <b>positions,</b> each able to accommodate a Boeing 747. Only eight of the positions are usable; two are used to provide eleven helicopter <b>parking</b> <b>positions</b> and there are just seven passenger loading bridges.|$|R
50|$|Loading bridges {{restrict}} aircraft parking to spots immediately {{adjacent to}} the terminal. Thus, airports use mobile staircases to facilitate disembarking at hardstands (remote <b>parking</b> <b>positions).</b>|$|R
50|$|A. N. R. Robinson International Airport has two terminals. The International Terminal {{was once}} both the {{regional}} and international passenger terminal for the airport but has been renovated {{to serve as an}} all-international terminal. It serves international cargo flights, general aviation and helicopter flights. It has seven aircraft <b>parking</b> <b>positions.</b> The Regional Terminal or North Terminal is the main passenger terminal for flights to and from the Caribbean and Trinidad. It handles all regional commercial and cargo passenger airline traffic. It has six aircraft <b>parking</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Piarco International Airport has two {{terminal}}s. The south terminal {{was once}} the passenger terminal for the airport but has been renovated {{to serve as an}} executive terminal.
