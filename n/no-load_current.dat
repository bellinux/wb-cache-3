40|$|Abstract — The {{internal}} faults of transformer can {{be identified}} by various techniques. The proposed technique is by the analysis of <b>no-load</b> <b>current</b> and harmonic contents present in it. The <b>no-load</b> <b>current</b> of transformer is non-sinusoidal for sinusoidal input voltage. And hence it contains harmonics in healthy condition of transformer. But if transformer has any internal fault then the <b>no-load</b> <b>current</b> magnitude and its harmonic content will vary depending upon the type of fault. The winding fault increases the %THD i and magnitude of noload current, whereas the core fault increases only the %THD i of <b>no-load</b> <b>current.</b> For winding fault if the inter-turn fault is on the primary side then both %THD i and magnitude of noload current increases but if the inter-turn fault is on secondary side then only magnitude of <b>no-load</b> <b>current</b> will increase. From eq. (2) {{it is evident that}} if the flux produces in core is sinusoidal, and hence the current should also be a perfect sinusoidal. Unfortunately, this is not true since the transformer will reach to a state of near saturation {{at the top of the}} flux cycle. Hence at this point, more current is required to produce a certain amount of flux. (2...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} transformer core diagnostics. The method uses the <b>no-load</b> <b>current</b> of the transformer as an indicator, and gives different characteristic signatures for different types of faults or defects. Using the <b>no-load</b> <b>current</b> for the diagnostic gives high sensitivity. The method is therefore able to detect defects that {{are too small to}} have an impact on the losses. In addition to different types of fault, the method can in some cases also distinguish between faults in different locations within the core. Both single-phase and three-phase transformers can be diagnosed using this method, and the measurements can be easily performed at any facility capable of measuring the no-load loss. There are, however, some phenomena that occur in large transformers, and in transformers with high rated voltages. Examples include capacitive resonance and magnetic remanence. This thesis proposes and demonstrates techniques for compensating for these phenomena. With these compensating techniques, the repeatability of the measurements is high. It is shown that units with the same core steel tend to have very similar no-load behavior. The diagnostics can then be performed either by comparing the transformer to another unit, or to simulations. The thesis presents one possible simulation method, and demonstrates the agreement with measurements. This topological simulation method includes both the electric circuit and an accurate model of the magnetic hysteresis. It is therefore also suitable for other, related, studies in addition to core diagnostics. Possible subjects include ferroresonance, inrush, DC magnetization of transformers, and transformer core optimization. The thesis also demonstrates that, for three-phase transformers, it is possible to compare the phases to each other. This technique makes it possible to diagnose a transformer even without a previous measurement to compare to, and without the data required to make a simulation. QC 20170607 </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} design a power {{transformer}} {{it is important to}} understand its internal electromagnetic behaviour. That can be obtained by measurements on physical transformers, analytical expressions and computer simulations. One benefit with simulations is that the transformer can be studied before it is built physically and that the consequences of changing dimensions and parameters easily can be assessed. In this thesis a time-domain transformer model is presented. The model includes core phenomena as magnetic static hysteresis, eddy current and excess losses. Moreover, the model comprises winding phenomena as eddy currents, capacitive effects and leakage flux. The core and windings are first modelled separately and then connected together in a composite transformer model. This results in a detailed transformer model. One important result of the thesis is the feasibility to simulate dynamic magnetization including the inhomogeneous field distribution due to eddy currents in the magnetic core material. This is achieved by using a Cauer circuit combined with models for static and dynamic magnetization. Thereby, all magnetic loss components in the material can be simulated accurately. This composite dynamic magnetization model is verified through experiments showing very good correspondence with measurements. Furthermore, the composite transformer model is verified through measurements. The model is shown to yield good correspondence with measurements in normal operation and non-normal operations like <b>no-load,</b> inrush <b>current</b> and DC-magnetization. QC 2010070...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel space-vector based Generalized Discontinuous {{pulse width modulation}} (GDPWM) algorithm without angle estimation based {{on the concept of}} imaginary switching times. The conventional space vector pulse width modulation (CSVPWM) method with equal division of zero state vectors V 0 and V 7 is modified. A constant-variable µ and modulation phase angle δ ranging from 0 to 1 are used to generate infinite number of modulating waveforms. Also, the classical triangle comparison approach is replaced by space vector approach. To avoid the complex coordinate transformations, trigonometric calculations and sector identification involved in CSVPWM, the concept of imaginary switching times is utilized. The imaginary switching times proportional to the reference phase voltages are used to calculate the actual switching times for reduced complexity and memory required. The proposed PWM technique results in reduced current ripple over the CSVPWM at high modulation indices and low switching losses at all modulation indices.

The methodology of this paper requires only six input data: transformer rating, low voltage, high voltage, connection of low-voltage coil, connection of high-voltage coil, and frequency.
