From this time to Mirabeau's death, he was the bearer of almost daily communications between Mirabeau and the queen. Mirabeau at first attempted to make an alliance with Lafayette, but it was useless, for Lafayette was not a strong man himself.|$|E

[...] Oh, yes, if that's all you mean, I don't suppose we shall always be able in {{everything}} to keep up our exclusive position. Our neighbours, who (bar the advantage of insularity, which means a coast and a port always close at hand) seem nearly as well situated as we are {{for access to the}} world-markets, are beginning to wake up and take a slice of the cake from us. Germany is manufacturing; Belgium is smelting; Antwerp is exporting; America is occupying her own markets. But that's a very different thing indeed from national decadence. We may have to compete a little harder with our rivals, that's all. The Boom may be over; but the Thames remains: the geographical facts are still unaltered. And notice that all the time while there's been this vague talk about [...] "bad times"--income-tax has been steadily increasing, London has been steadily growing, every outer and visible sign of commercial prosperity has been steadily spreading. Have our watering-places shrunk? Have our buildings been getting smaller and less luxurious? If Antwerp has grown, how about Hull and Cardiff? [...] "Well, perhaps the past is all right; but consider the future! Eight hours are going to drive capital out of the country!" [...] Rubbish! I'm not a political economist, thank God; I <b>never</b> <b>sank</b> quite <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as that. And I'm not speaking for or against Eight Hours: I'm only discounting some verbose nonsense. But I know enough to see that the capital of a country can no more be exported than the land or the houses. Can you drive away the London and North-Western Railway? Can you drive away the factories of Manchester, the mines of the Black Country, the canals, the buildings, the machinery, the docks, the plant, the apparatus? Impossible, on the very face of it! Most of the capital of a country is fixed in its soil, and can't be uprooted. People fall into this error about driving away capital because they know you can sell particular railway shares or a particular factory and leave the country with the proceeds, provided somebody else is willing to buy; but you can't sell all the railways and all the factories in a lump, and clear out with the capital. No, no; England stands where she does, because God put her there; and until He invents a new order of things (which may, of course, happen any day--as, for example, if aerial navigation came in) she must continue, in spite of minor changes, to maintain in the main her present position.|$|R

60|$|It was {{afternoon}} when the canoes slid {{out from the}} forest on to the broad expanse of the Shadow River. The day was calm and hot, although the sky was covered with soft gray clouds, that subdued the light. The river had shrunk, for the driftwood on the bank stood high above the water level, and Thirlwell had only known it <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> during the summer when Strange was drowned. For all that, the current ran fast and the long rows of pines rolled swiftly back to meet the canoes as they floated down. The trees had lost their rigid outline and melted gently into the blue distance, while the savage landscape was softened {{by the play of}} tender light and shadow.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was not}} in the whole chapel a person whose {{imagination}} was not centred on what was invisibly taking place within the vestry. The thunder of the minister's eloquence echoed, of course, through the weak sister's cavern of retreat no less than round the public assembly. What she was doing inside there--whether listening contritely, or haughtily hastening to put on her things and get away from the chapel and all it contained--was obviously the thought of each member. What changes were tracing themselves upon that lovely face: did it rise to phases of Raffaelesque resignation or <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as to flush and frown? was Somerset's inquiry; and a half-explanation occurred when, during the discourse, the door which had been ajar was gently pushed to.|$|R
60|$|No; if {{you were}} setting women free for {{something}} else, I might be more melted. If you can assure me, privately and gravely, that you are setting women free to dance on the mountains like mænads, or to worship some monstrous goddess, I will make a note of your request. If you are quite sure that the ladies in Brixton, the moment they give up cooking, will beat great gongs and blow horns to Mumbo-Jumbo, then I will agree that the occupation is at least human and {{is more or less}} entertaining. Women have been set free to be Bacchantes; they have been set free to be Virgin Martyrs; they have been set free to be Witches. Do not ask them now to <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as the higher culture.|$|R
60|$|From {{her they}} learned that in a fashion the princess was happy enough--who would not be that had just escaped from Al-je-bal?--yet weary of the strange Eastern life, of the {{restraints}} upon her, and of her aimless days; vexed also that she might not mix with the brethren. Day by day she sent them her greetings, and with them warnings to attempt nothing--not even to see her--since {{there was no hope}} that they would succeed. So much afraid of them was the Sultan, Rosamund said, that both she and they were watched day and night, and of any folly their lives would pay the price. When they heard all this the brethren began to despair, and their spirits <b>sank</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that they cared not what should happen to them.|$|R

60|$|A laugh {{came from}} the next room. It was not muffled, as before, but frank and clear. It was woman's laughter, and Langbourne easily {{inferred}} girlhood as well as womanhood from it. His neighbors must have come by the late train, and they had probably begun to talk {{as soon as they}} got into their room. He imagined their having spoken low at first for fear of disturbing some one, and then, in their forgetfulness, or their belief that there was no one near, allowed themselves greater freedom. There were survivals of their earlier caution at times, when their voices <b>sank</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as scarcely to be heard; then there was a break from it when they rose clearly distinguishable from each other. They were never so distinct that he could make out what was said; but each voice unmistakably conveyed character.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lime tree}} {{was named the}} [...] "flagship of all lime trees" [...] in 1975. Since that year, {{the trunk of the}} lime tree has been {{protected}} by two new lattice fences. On 3 September 1985 the area was declared a natural monument, along with 30 further trees, according to a resolution passed by Dresden city council. This has resulted in regular checks and care of the tree. In 1996 the crown was braced at a cost of roughly 7,000 British pounds. In 1997 a Swiss firm applied for the rights to a gravel quarry in the Kaditzer area, which would have extended beyond the year 2010. This would have caused the water table to <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as to dry out the lime tree. Dresden’s regional city council however rejected the application after countless residents and members of open institutions had voiced their opposition.|$|R

6000|$|Of course, {{there is}} no reason in nature why a wooden bull should be more {{pleasing}} than a flesh-and-blood bull, but it seems to encourage the company, and they set off again with renewed speed, and at last reach India Wharf {{in time to see the}} Nahant steamer packed full of excursionists, with a crowd of people still waiting to go aboard. It does not look inviting, and they hesitate. In a minute or two their spirits <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low,</b> that if they should see the wooden bull step out of a grotto on the deck of the steamer the spectacle could not revive them. At that instant they think, with a surprising singleness, of Nantasket Beach, and the bright colors in which the Gardens of Maolis but now appeared fade away, and they seem to see themselves sauntering along the beautiful shore, while the white-crested breakers crash upon the sand, and run up ...|$|R
60|$|In {{this manner}} the tempest-tossed little bark {{struggled}} forward, now <b>sinking</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> in the troughs that land, ocean, {{and all but}} the frowning billows, with the clouds above their heads, were lost to view; and now rising, as it might be, from the calm of a sombre cavern, into the roaring, hissing, and turbulence of a tempest. These latter moments were the most critical. When the light hull reached the summit of a wave, falling over to windward by the yielding of the element beneath her, {{it seemed as if}} the next billow must inevitably overwhelm her; and yet, so vigilant was the eye of Vicente Yañez, and so ready the hand of Sancho, that she ever escaped the calamity. To keep the wash of the sea entirely out, was, however, impossible; and it often swept athwart the deck, forward, like the sheets of a cataract, that part of the vessel being completely abandoned by the crew.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tupman looked round him. The wine, {{which had}} exerted its somniferous {{influence}} over Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle, had stolen upon the senses of Mr. Pickwick. That gentleman had gradually {{passed through the}} various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner, and its consequences. He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery, and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality. Like a gas-lamp in the street, with {{the wind in the}} pipe, he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy, then <b>sank</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as to be scarcely discernible; after a short interval, he had burst out again, to enlighten for a moment; then flickered with an uncertain, staggering sort of light, and then gone out altogether. His head was sunk upon his bosom, and perpetual snoring, with a partial choke occasionally, were the only audible indications of the great man's presence.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{what will}} ye {{do in the}} end thereof?" [...] asks Jeremiah. What indeed! [...] What the Jews did in the end thereof you may read {{in the book of}} the prophet Jeremiah. They did nothing, and could do nothing--with their {{morality}} their manhood was gone. Sin had borne its certain fruit of anarchy and decrepitude. The wrath of God revealed itself as usual, by no miracle, but through inscrutable social laws. They had to submit, cowardly and broken-hearted, to an invasion, a siege, and an utter ruin. [...] I do not say, God forbid, that we shall ever <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low,</b> and have to endure so terrible a chastisement: but this I say, that the only way in which any nation of which I ever read in history, can escape, sooner or later, from such a fate, is to remember every day, and all day long, that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ill-doing of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness, knowing what is true and what is right, yet telling lies, and doing wrong.|$|R
60|$|What {{a welcome}} and joyful sound! In the winter, when {{the days are}} short, and the sun, {{near the end of}} the six school hours, <b>sinks</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> that the light in the room grows dim and gray, with what impatience, my dear child, do you wait for this signal! But it is in the long summer days that you find school most tiresome. The air in the room is hot and drowsy, and outside you can see there is a breeze blowing, for the trees are gently tossing their green boughs as if to twit you with having to work out sums in such glorious weather. And there come to your ears the {{pleasant}} sounds of the buzzing of insects and twittering of birds, and the brook splashing over the stones. Then the four walls of the school-room look very dreary, and the maps glare at you, and the black-boards frown darkly, and the benches seem very hard, and the ink-bespattered desks appear more grimy than ever.|$|R
6000|$|I pursued {{my career}} of unblushing [...] "economy"--as the Jesuits say, meaning, alas! economy of plain truth speaking--and of heathen dissipation. Few were the dances in which I {{did not take}} a part, <b>sinking</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as {{occasionally}} to oblige with a hornpipe. My blue ribbon had long ago worn out, and with it my strict views on Temperance. I acquired a liking for the strange drink of the islanders--a thick wine and water, sometimes mixed with cheese and honey. In fact, I was sliding back--like the unfortunate Fanti missionary, John Greedy, M.A., whose case, as reported by precious Mr. Grant Allen, so painfully moved serious circles--I was sliding back {{to the level of}} the savagery around me. May these confessions be accepted in the same spirit as they are offered; may it partly palliate my guilt that I had apparently no chance of escape from the island, and no hope beyond that of converting the natives and marrying Doto. I trusted to do it, not (as of old) by open and fearless denunciation, but by slowly winning hearts, in a secular and sportive capacity, before gaining souls.|$|R
60|$|Hitherto {{the wind}} had been kept {{a little on the}} {{starboard}} quarter, the caravel steering east, a point or two north, and it was now the aim to lay her head so far round as to permit her to steer north, a point or two west. By {{the manner in which the}} coast appeared to trend, it was thought that this variation in the direction might keep them, for a few hours, at a sufficient distance from the shore. But this manoeuvre could not be effected without the aid of canvas, and an order was issued to set the foresail. The first flap of the canvas, as it was loosened to the gale, was tremendous, the jerk threatening to tear the fore-mast from its step, and then all was still as death forward, the hull <b>sinking</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> behind a barrier of water, as actually to becalm the sail. Sancho and his associate seized the favorable moment to secure the clews, and, as the little bark struggled upward again, the canvas filled with some such shock as is felt at the sudden checking of a cable. From this moment the Niña drew slowly off to sea again, though her path lay through such a scene of turbulent water, as threatened, at each instant, to overwhelm her.|$|R
60|$|These words escaped {{me under}} an impulse I found entirely {{impossible}} to control. Scarcely were they uttered, ere I deeply regretted the indiscretion. Grace {{looked at me}} imploringly, turned as pale as death, and trembled all over, as if {{on the verge of}} dissolution. I took her in my arms, I implored her pardon, I promised to command myself in future, and I repeated the most solemn assurances of complying with her wishes to the very letter. I am not certain I could have found it in my heart not to have recalled my promise, but for the advantage my sister obtained over me, by means of this act of weakness. There was something so exceedingly revolting to me in the whole affair, that even Grace's holy weakness failed to sanctify the act in my eyes; at least so far as Rupert was concerned. I owe it to myself to add that not a selfish thought mingled with my reluctance, which proceeded purely from the distaste I felt to seeing Lucy's brother, and a man for whom I had once entertained a boyish regard, making himself so thoroughly an object of contempt. As I entertained serious doubts of even Rupert's <b>sinking</b> <b>so</b> <b>low,</b> I felt the necessity of speaking to my sister on the subject of such a contingency.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the whole}} {{then we must}} regard Catherine's European {{correspondence}} as {{at least in some}} measure the result of political calculation. Its purposes, as has been said, were partly those to which in our own times some governments devote a Reptile-fund. There is a letter from the Duchesse de Choiseul to Madame du Deffand, her intimate friend, and the friend of so many of the literary circle, in which the secret of the relations between Catherine and the men of letters is very plainly told. [...] "All that," [...] she writes--protection of arts and sciences--"is mere luxury and a caprice of fashion in our age. All such pompous jargon is the product of vanity, not of principles or of reflection.... The Empress of Russia has another object in protecting literature; she has had sense enough to feel that she had need of the protection of the men of letters. She has flattered herself that their base praises would cover with an impenetrable veil in the eyes of her contemporaries and of posterity, the crimes with which she has astonished the universe and revolted humanity.... The men of letters, on the other hand, flattered, cajoled, caressed by her, are vain of the protection that they are able to throw over her, and dupes of the coquetries that she lavishes on them. These people who say and believe that they are the instructors of the masters of the world, <b>sink</b> <b>so</b> <b>low</b> as actually to take a pride in the protection that this monster seems in her turn to accord to them, simply because she sits on a throne."[78] ...|$|R
60|$|The air was solemn and slow. At {{times it}} {{rose to the}} fullest compass of the rich voices of the females, who hung over their little book in holy excitement, and again it <b>sank</b> <b>so</b> <b>low,</b> that the rushing of the waters ran through their melody, like a hollow accompaniment. The natural taste and true ear of David governed and {{modified}} the sounds to suit the confined cavern, every crevice, and cranny of which {{was filled with the}} thrilling notes of their flexible voices. The Indians riveted their eyes on the rocks, and listened with an attention that seemed to turn them into stone. But the scout, who had placed his chin in his hand, with an expression of cold indifference, gradually suffered his rigid features to relax, until, as verse succeeded verse, he felt his iron nature subdued, while his recollection was carried back to boyhood, when his ears had been accustomed to listen to similar sounds of praise, in the settlements of the colony. His roving eyes began to moisten, and before the hymn was ended, scalding tears rolled out of fountains that had long seemed dry, and followed each other down those cheeks, that had oftener felt the storms of heaven than any testimonials of weakness. The singers were dwelling on one of those low, dying chords, which the ear devours with such greedy rapture, as if conscious that it is about to lose them, when a cry, that seemed neither human nor earthly, rose in the outward air, penetrating not only the recesses of the cavern, but to the inmost hearts of all who heard it. It was followed by a stillness apparently as deep as if the waters had been checked in their furious progress, at such a horrid and unusual interruption.|$|R
