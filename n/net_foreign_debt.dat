40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the changes that have}} occurred in the composition of funds raised by provincial borrowers during the 1990 s. Higher financing requirements, coupled with the declining availability of funds from non-market sources such as the Canada Pension Plan, led provincial governments and their Crown corporations to broaden and to diversify their debt management programs. In particular, provincial borrowers expanded their presence in foreign bond markets, increased their issuance of floating-rate debt, and incorporated a wide variety of innovative debt instruments into their borrowing programs in order to minimize their borrowing costs and to manage the risks associated with the issuing of debt. As a result, the composition of funds raised by provincial borrowers during the 1990 s differed markedly from that of the previous decade: between 1990 and 1995, provincial borrowing requirements were met almost entirely through the issuance of marketable <b>debt,</b> and <b>net</b> new <b>foreign</b> currency <b>debt</b> issues averaged nearly 50 per cent of funds raised, whereas between 1980 and 1989, non-market sources provided close to 30 per cent of funds raised, and <b>net</b> new <b>foreign</b> currency <b>debt</b> issues provided less than 20 per cent. ...|$|R

In {{addition}} to a balance-of-payments surplus or deficit, {{the size of a}} country’s foreign debt and foreign assets is affected by the exchange rate and the price of securities. Consequently, Finland’s foreign debt increased noticeably when the price of technology shares increased drastically in the late 1990s due to a large proportion of these shares being owned by households, funds and companies abroad. In this way, these foreign owners held a greater claim on Finland. When share prices decreased drastically in 1999-2001 in the dot-com bubble, it also led to a marked decrease in Finland’s <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b> Iceland’s foreign net debt accounts for close to five times of its GDP.

Sweden also had foreign debts by the end of 2010, however, at a much smaller scale. In 2012, all Nordic countries had a surplus on the total balance of payments.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} events pose challenging {{questions for}} macroeconomists. The rising global imbalances {{raise the issue}} whether existing international macroeconomic models can explain the patterns observed in the data on real exchange rates and current accounts. The first chapter of this dissertation addresses the question whether a standard portfolio balance model can account for the long-run dynamic behavior of the real exchange rate and <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> in the United States (US). The rest of the dissertation does not test how well theoretical models fit reality but uses models {{in order to understand}} reality better. The second and third chapters are motivated by the most significant economic event in the last decade-the US 2008 financial crisis. It triggered a major collapse in US real activity, called the Great Recession, and disrupted the job matching process in the labor market. The second chapter of this dissertation addresses the challenges faced by monetary policymakers in response to an increase in labor market frictions. Two striking features of the Great Recession are the speed and synchronicity with which real activity collapsed across the world. The third chapter analyzes how shocks such as the 2008 crisis are transmitted across countries. The findings of each chapter are briefly summarized in the following paragraphs. A strand of models of the joint behavior of the current account, <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> stock and the real exchange rate postulate that this behavior is driven by saddle-path dynamics and the related portfolio balance effect. This saddle-path dynamics {{is based on the assumption}} that domestic and foreign assets are imperfect substitutes and that the financial markets clear before the goods markets. Chapter 1 uses the Johansen test for cointegration to check the prediction of a portfolio balance model that the <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> stock and real exchange rate display saddle path dynamics. Newly constructed quarterly series on the face value of the United States <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> as a percentage of nominal GDP, together with data on the broad real effective exchange rate index of the United States Dollar, are analyzed. The results indicate that the US <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> and real exchange rate are cointegrated and do not display saddle path dynamics. The cointegrating relationship is found to be negative and trend-stationary. These empirical results suggest that a richer framework that incorporates the dynamic behavior of relative asset supplies is more appropriate for interpretation of the joint dynamics of the US <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> and real exchange rate. In chapter 2 I build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with search and matching frictions in the labor market and analyze the optimal monetary policy response to an outward shift in the Beveridge curve. The main finding is that the optimal monetary policy depends on the shock that causes the shift. A fall in the efficiency of matching does not cause an increase in the unemployment gap; the optimal response of the central bank is to stabilize inflation. An increase in the elasticity of employment matches with respect to vacancies presents the policy maker with a trade off between stabilizing inflation and unemployment. The optimal policy response to the efficient labor market shock changes when real wages are sticky but remains unchanged when home and market goods are imperfect substitutes, compared to the case when they are not. When contrasted to a Taylor rule that targets inflation and output growth, the optimal monetary policy is more aggressive in pursuit of its objectives. Chapter 3 is a joint effort with Abigail Hughes from the Bank of England and explores how financial factors affect the international transmission mechanism. We look at how financial frictions affect the international transmission of country specific productivity shocks. We then explore how two types of shocks that affect the external finance premium are propagated across countries. We build a two country DSGE model with financial frictions to explore the size and nature of international spillovers. Our main findings are that financial frictions magnify movements in international relative prices. In addition, external finance premium shocks can generate significant and persistent international spillovers but they depend on the type of shock. A shock to the dispersion of the productivity of entrepreneurs results in a shift in the foreign aggregate supply curve. A shock to the survival probability of entrepreneurs generates a shift in the foreign aggregate demand curve...|$|E

40|$|This quick guide {{looks at}} the level of Australia’s foreign debt, the {{interest}} liability on foreign debt and how these have changed over time. It also looks at foreign debt as a component of net foreign investment, the other component being equity investment. Finally, given that Australia’s gross foreign debt is now bigger than its annual gross domestic product (GDP), the quick guide also considers whether our foreign debt level is too high. What is foreign debt? Foreign debt is the amount borrowed from non-residents by residents of Australia. It includes securities such as bonds, as well as loans, advances, deposits, debentures and overdrafts. Foreign debt is a subset of the financial obligations that make up Australia’s foreign investment position.   It is distinguished from other forms of foreign investment capital inflow such as equity investment (foreign ownership) by the obligation to pay interest and/or repay capital. Foreign debt is {{not to be confused with}} national debt, which is the total government debt. National debt comprises government borrowings from overseas residents and government borrowings from Australian residents and thus excludes overseas borrowings by the private sector. A distinction is made between gross and <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b> Gross foreign debt is the total amount of borrowing from non-residents. <b>Net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> is equal to gross foreign debt minus the sum of lending by residents of Australia to non-residents and official reserve assets held by the Reserve Bank...|$|E

Given that the bulk of capital movements related to risk-off episodes is driven by decisions of Swiss residents, capital flow management policies that discriminate based on the residency of the investor (capital controls) {{are not likely to be}} effective at reducing the impact of risk-off episodes.

Endogenous variables in the study is the budget deficit and <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b> Whereas exogenous variables are economic growth, exchange rates, oil prices, inflation, interest rates, net exports, FDI, investment and savings gap and foreign interest rates. The study concluded that (1) <b>foreign</b> <b>debt,</b> economic growth, exchange rates, oil prices, inflation, and interest rates {{have a significant effect on}} the budget deficit in Indonesia. (2) budget deficit, <b>net</b> exports, <b>foreign</b> exchange reserves, FDI, and savings investment gap significantly influence the <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> in Indonesia. In other words, when the budget deficit rose, <b>net</b> exports declined, <b>foreign</b> exchange reserves decreased, FDI down, as well as foreign interest rates also decreased the budget deficit will increase. However, variables and savings investment gap does not significantly influence <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> in Indonesia. Based on these results the policies that can be recommended increase economic growth as measures to reduce the budget deficit, stabilize the prices of basic necessities that inflation is under control, keeping the exchange rate certainty so that exporters are not at a loss as well as the interest rate that can keep the investment climate. The conditions are expected to emerge from the economic certainty that may increase the state budget so avoid the problem of budget deficit. In addition, a reduction in the dependence on <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> can be achieved with fiscal discipline, maintain the balance of payments deficit, the reduction of <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> abroad and trying to divert the <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> into the country...|$|R

We assess the macroeconomic impact on Europe of global current account adjustment under alternative scenarios, emphasizing both trade and financial channels. Finally, we consider heterogeneous exposure across individual European economies to external adjustment shocks.

40|$|Capital flows often confront {{central banks}} with a dilemma: {{to contain the}} {{exchange}} rate or {{to allow it to}} float. To tackle this problem, an equilibrium model of capital flows is proposed. The model captures sudden stops with shocks to the country risk premium. This enables the model to deal with capital outflows as well as capital inflows. From the equilibrium conditions of the model, I derive an expression for the accounting of <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets, which helps study the evolution of <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> under di¤erent policy experiments. The policy experiments point to three main conclusions. First, interest rate defenses of the exchange rate can deliver recessions during capital outflows even in financially resilient economies. Second, during unanticipated reversals in capital inflows, the behavior of <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> is not necessarily improved by containing the exchange rate. Third, an economy can gain resilience not by simply shifting the currency denomination of debt, but by both, shifting the denomination and floating the currency.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the neoclassical model does not {{generate}} comovement among macroeconomic aggregates in response to news about future total factor productivity. We show that this problem is generally more severe in open economy versions of the neoclassical model. We present an open economy model that generates comovement both in response to sudden stops and to news about future productivity and investment-specific technical change. We find that comovement is easier to generate in the presence of weak short-run wealth effects on the labor supply, adjustment costs to labor, and/or investment, and whenever the real interest rate faced by the economy rises with the level of <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b> business cycles, neoclassical model, future total factor productivity, open economy...|$|E
40|$|Countries in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) have diverse {{economic}} structures. Some {{countries are}} oil exporters, some are oil importers and some countries are very poor dependent on agriculture. Since current account {{is an important}} indicator of an economy‟s health, it is of interest to examine if current account balances in MEA region are sustainable. However, empirical research paid scant attention to this issue. No study has been conducted before to examine this issue. The present paper makes an attempt to fill this research gap by employing panel data model over the period from 1995 to 2014 to examine current account sustainability in MEA countries. We follow intertemporal budget constraint approach and examine long-run relationship between export and import plus interest on <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b> As we work with panel data, we {{pay special attention to}} cross-section dependence. We use annual data collected from World Development Indicators. All data (exports, imports and interest on long-term external borrowing) are in current US dollar and expressed as percentage of GDP. Interest payment on long-term external borrowing (also in current US dollar) is used as a proxy for interest on <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b> Panel unit root test to cross-section dependence indicate variables are first-difference stationary. We next use panel cointegration and bootstrap critical values under null hypothesis to accommodate cross-section dependence. Panel cointegration result suggests that current account is sustainable. However, panel cointegrating regression estimation indicates that the value of sustainability coefficient is less than 1 (one), which implies that current account is weakly sustainable. As current account is weakly sustainable, it is desirable to make policy intervention at macro level to ensure strong sustainability. This may be achieved by accelerating ongoing trade reforms in MEA countries to boost export earnings and hence ensure the ability of external debt in the long run...|$|E
40|$|The {{procyclicality}} {{of fiscal}} policy that is prevalent {{in developing countries}} and emerging markets is well known. Its explanation is less clear. Recently, social inequality and the combination of corruption and democracy have been suggested as alternatives to the traditional explanation of these countries' exposure to boom-bust cycles in international credit markets. Differences in methodological approach are also partly responsible for diverging empirical results. In this paper, competing hypotheses are tested on a comprehensive set of measures of the cyclicality of fiscal policy. The evidence for corruption and democracy is stronger than for social inequality or <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>debt,</b> but the interpretation of this result is less obvious, since the index of corruption is closely correlated with poor credit ratings. In OECD countries, by contrast, the cyclicality of fiscal policy largely reflects the strength of automatic stabilizers...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{tractable}} {{variant of the}} open economy neoclassical growth model that emphasizes political economy and contracting frictions. The political economy frictions involve a preference for immediate spending, while the contracting friction {{is a lack of}} commitment regarding <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> and expropriation. We show that the political economy frictions slow an economy’s convergence to the steady state due to the endogenous evolution of capital taxation. The model rationalizes why openness has different implications for growth depending on the political environment, why institutions such as the treatment of capital income evolve over time, why governments in countries that grow rapidly accumulate <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets rather than liabilities, and why foreign aid may not affect growth...|$|R
