25|$|Natural {{gas from}} gas wells and from {{condensate}} wells, {{in which there}} is little or no crude oil, is called non-associated gas. Gas wells typically produce only raw natural gas, while condensate wells produce raw natural gas along with other low molecular weight hydrocarbons.

50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>gasoline</b> is {{a natural}} gas liquid with a vapor {{pressure}} intermediate between natural gas condensate (drip gas) and liquefied petroleum gas and has a boiling point {{within the range of}} gasoline. The typical gravity of <b>natural</b> <b>gasoline</b> is around 80 API. This hydrocarbon mixture is liquid at ambient pressure and temperature.

50|$|Some early {{internal}} combustion engines—such {{as the first}} types made by Karl Benz, and early Wright brothers aircraft engines—used <b>natural</b> <b>gasoline,</b> which could be either drip gas or a similar range of hydrocarbons distilled from crude oil. <b>Natural</b> <b>gasoline</b> has an octane rating of about 30 to 50, sufficient for the low-compression engines of the early 20th century.

5000|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>gasoline</b> {{is often}} used as a {{denaturant}} for Fuel Grade Ethanol where it is commonly added volumetrically between 2.0% and 2.5% to make Denatured Fuel Ethanol (DFE) or E98. This process renders the fuel grade ethanol undrinkable. It is then transferred to a blender which will add this E98 to conventional gasoline to make common 87 octane fuels (E10). It can also be added to Ethanol in higher volumetric concentrations to produce High Level Blends of Ethanol such as E85. <b>Natural</b> <b>gasoline</b> has a lower octane content (RON roughly equal to 70) than conventional commercial distilled gasoline, so it cannot normally be used by itself for fuel for modern automobiles. However, when mixed with higher concentrations of ethanol (RON roughly equal to 113) to produce products such as E85, the octane level of the <b>Natural</b> <b>Gasoline</b> and Ethanol mixture is now within the usable range for flex-fuel vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Two {{separate}} reaction mechanisms {{were developed}} to predict the auto-ignition and combustion processes in HCCI engines operated on <b>natural</b> gas and <b>gasoline.</b> <b>Natural</b> gas {{is considered to be}} a blend of methane, ethane, propane and n-butane, while gasoline is modeled as a mixture of iso-octane, n-heptane as well as toluene. The mechanisms for <b>natural</b> gas and <b>gasoline</b> are constructed by combining the sub-mechanisms of constituent species reduced by a sensitivity analysis. The specific feature of the mechanisms developed is the retention of low-temperature reaction mechanisms for all constituent species. The mechanisms are restricted in size (67 species and 360 reactions for natural gas, 111 species and 512 reactions for gasoline) to be applicable to detailed-chemistry CFD engine modeling. Nevertheless, validation of the mechanisms showed that ignition delay time data from shock tube experiments could be predicted accurately for the constituent species. Results are presented for the successful application of the mechanisms to the modeling of existing engines: the gasoline mechanism was used to predict the HCCI process in a single-cylinder research engine by means of a 1 -D engine cycle simulation code with a multi-zone combustion model. The mechanism for natural gas oxidation was applied to 2 -D calculations of HCCI combustion in a heavy-duty engine using the KIVA code...|$|R

30|$|Madrzykowski and Fleischmann (2012) {{performed}} {{a study of}} the response of gypsum wallboard and the reproducibility of the damage pattern created when exposed to known heat release rate (HRR) fires with varying types of fuel sources and wall construction. The fuels used for their experiments included a <b>natural</b> gas burner, <b>gasoline</b> pool fire and polyurethane foam. The wall construction was varied between a single sheet of gypsum wallboard with wood framing, a gypsum wallboard front and back with wood framing and gypsum wallboard front and back with fiberglass batt insulation in the voids of the wood framing. The gypsum wallboard was covered with a primer and cover coats of latex paint. This study focused on the effects where the paper had been burned away (consumed) and where the paper had been peeled up (penetration). To accomplish this, the researchers evaluated the variability of the flame height in comparison to the height and area of damage. As expected, the results indicated that the patterns generated by the polyurethane foam fire had greater uncertainty than the <b>natural</b> gas and <b>gasoline</b> pool fires. The wall construction had no significant impact on the damage.|$|R
40|$|Market-based {{policies}} to address fossil fuel-related externalities including climate change typically operate {{by raising the}} price of those fuels. Increases in energy prices have important consequences for a typical U. S. household that spent almost $ 4, 000 per year on electricity, fuel oil, <b>natural</b> gas, and <b>gasoline</b> in 2005. A key question for policymakers is how these consequences vary over different regions and subpopulations across the country—especially as adjustment and compensation programs are designed to protect more vulnerable regions. To answer this question, we use non-publicly available data from the U. S. Consumer Expenditure Survey over the period 1984 – 2000 to estimate long-run geographic variation in household use of electricity, fuel oil, <b>natural</b> gas, and <b>gasoline,</b> {{as well as the}} associated incidence of a $ 10 per ton tax on carbon dioxide (ignoring behavioral response). We find substantial variation: incidence from the tax range from $ 97  dollars per year per household in New York County, New York to $ 235 per year per household in Tensas Parish, Louisiana. This variation can be explained by differences in energy use, carbon intensity of electricity generation, and electricity regulation...|$|R
