5|$|By 2008, {{the club}} was in a financially {{precarious}} position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club a year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, {{the club was}} purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5million. Performances were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini. City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on {{a place in the}} Champions League, and competed in the UEFA Europa League in season 2010–11.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, MacDonald left {{again for}} Europe and while there, signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first MGM film was The Cat and the Fiddle (1934), {{based on the}} Jerome Kern Broadway hit. Her co-star was Ramón Novarro. The plot about {{unmarried}} lovers shacking up just barely slipped through the new Production Code guidelines that took effect July 1, 1934. Despite a Technicolor finale—the first use of the new three-color Technicolor process other than Disney cartoons—the film was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success.|$|E

25|$|Their last album {{containing}} new material, the 1985 dance/Hi-NRG release Sex Over the Phone, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> commercial success, but it {{fared better}} {{in sales and}} club play than Renaissance. The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the BBC because of its subject matter: credit-card phone sex. The album featured yet another new lead singer, Ray Stephens (of The Great Space Coaster fame). Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens {{for some of the}} group's live appearances in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. While the graphics were often {{the topic of}} scrutiny and comparison to better looking titles of the time, such as Quake, reviewers were largely unanimous in praising the game's orchestral soundtrack, composed by Clint Bajakian, and solid gameplay. The voice cast includes veteran talent such as John de Lancie, Richard Moll and Jack Angel. A free expansion, entitled Handful of Missions, was released in 1998. Community-created expansion levels are also available and have received media coverage. Although <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> financial success, the game has a cult following.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 1989, Kilroy's {{childhood}} friend Bradley Moore finished exams early at Texas A University {{and headed to}} Austin to pick him up. Both of them then headed to Santa Fe to pick up two other friends, Bill Huddleston and Brent Martin, before heading to South Padre Island, Texas for spring break. After a foggy, 9-hour drive to South Texas, they arrived at South Padre Island shortly before midnight. They checked in at the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts the next morning before heading to the beach. When they first got to South Padre Island, there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> crowd of people because it was barely the first weekend out of a five-week spring break season. But thousands of students from the entire U.S. were beginning to arrive as the weekend progressed. Beer sponsors were staging a variety of entertainment events, including free movies, music concerts, calls home, surf-simulator activities, and opportunities to appear on TV commercials. Kilroy and Bradley made free phone calls to their parents that day. Later that evening, they met a group of female students from Purdue University and partied until the next morning.|$|E

25|$|The last group {{match was}} a thrilling {{match for the}} both teams, where Sri Lanka came as the {{favorites}} to win the match. Skipper Chandimal was out of play due to some injuries, so Lasith Malinga captained the match. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, and Corey Anderson. During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started pretty well with Guptill and Kane Williamson. At this time, Malinga decided to go with Rangana Herath, who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner {{is not at all}} interested. The bowler is wise to the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. he stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals.|$|E

50|$|Drafted in {{the second}} round by the Rams in 1996, Conwell was the Rams' {{starting}} tight end but did <b>not</b> play <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> role in their explosive offense.

500|$|As some Arsenal {{players were}} seen consoling each other, manager Arsène Wenger {{was left to}} rue the defeat and said that his Arsenal side could not take their chances: [...] "It was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{advantage}} {{for us to have}} Hagi sent off, sometimes you defend better with 10 men because everybody is focused." [...] He was displeased with the penalty shoot-out and criticised Spanish referee Antonio López Nieto for deciding the penalty shoot-out to take place in front of Galatasaray fans. Wenger was also unhappy with the decision made by UEFA officials regarding a coin toss during extra time, which would affect where the spot kicks would be taken.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{its initial}} press and {{critical}} reception, Ultimate Comics Spider-Man was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{hit in the}} direct market. By August 2013, sales on the title had slipped, and sales for the other two Ultimate titles, Ultimate Comics X-Men and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates, had dropped to numbers at which mainstream Marvel titles are cancelled. That November, Ultimate Comics Spider-Man ended its run with issue #28, {{and the other two}} titles ended along with it, {{to make way for the}} miniseries Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man, one of the books in the crossover storyline [...] "Cataclysm", in which the heroes of the Ultimate universe face the threat of the Earth-616 Galactus, and Miles is transported to the mainstream Marvel universe.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, it sold {{well enough}} to {{encourage}} Parker Brothers to develop more Star Wars titles. In the December 11, 1982, issue of Billboard, {{it was reported that}} Parker Brothers was developing its second game cartridge. Titled Star Wars: Jedi Arena, the game was set for release the following month. During Jedi Arenas production, Parker Brothers relied upon an abstract approach to combat that took advantage of [...] "the unique technologies and situations of the Star Wars universe". The game was programmed by Rex Bradford and inspired by one scene in Star Wars in which Luke Skywalker defends himself from the Seeker ball's incoming laser bolts with his lightsaber on board the Millennium Falcon. The game was released for the Atari 2600 as scheduled, in January 1983.|$|E

500|$|While critics praised Morgan for his {{performance}} in the role, their reaction to the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of BuddyTV felt that John is a [...] "rather divisive character", with some fans not understanding John's motivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found the character to be [...] "completely fascinating". He chose [...] "In My Time of Dying" [...] as the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's contributions, stating, [...] "Even if you're <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> fan of Poppa Winchester, I think it's impossible not to be moved by the final ten minutes of this episode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that he's proud of him, is {{one hell of a}} tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park." [...] Williams praised Matt Cohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel episode [...] "In the Beginning", believing that he [...] "did an excellent job at portraying a more innocent John Winchester than we've ever seen before".|$|E
500|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy {{was better}} received. Bob Mackey at USgamer {{appreciated}} how {{the games were}} mostly left untouched, while getting minor improvements, {{such as the ability}} to read the text at the player's own pace rather than waiting for it to [...] "slowly [...] across the screen". He said that the game's graphical upgrades were hit or miss, with certain characters, including Phoenix and Edgeworth, looking great, while elements that originally had less definition, such as the judge's beard, were [...] "a little wonky". Thomas Whitehead at Nintendo Life said that Capcom had done a [...] "solid job" [...] with the port, and appreciated the stereoscopic 3D effect and the game's faithfulness to the original; he, however, felt that the lack of an orchestral soundtrack similar to that in [...] was a minor disappointment. Geoff Thew at Hardcore Gamer called the updated art gorgeous, and noted that it did not have the same animation-related problems as the Trilogy HD on iOS. He appreciated the 3D effect, which he said works well most of the time, but said that the window frame in the detention center was not rendered on its own layer; he said that it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> problem, but that it was distracting as the player visits that area often. He also commented on the lack of a remastered soundtrack, calling it a letdown.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] was not {{as funny}} as the {{previous}} episode, [...] "The Camel", but that it included excellent physical comedy like Ron's refusal to throw up, and Andy's piggyback rides throughout Pawnee town hall. Sepinwall also praised Leslie's intelligence and savvy, which he said differentiates the show from Greg Daniels' other show, The Office and its protagonist Michael Scott. IGN writer Matt Fowler particularly praised the pairing of Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, which he called simultaneously funny, naturalistic and sweet. Fowler said the main hunting plot was funny, but [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> fan of horrific personal injury {{as a vehicle for}} humor". Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said he liked the episode, but that the main hunting subplot was messy because there was too much action involving too many supporting cast members. Heisler said the Andy and April subplot was more effective. Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner praised [...] "Hunting Trip", especially the scene in which the characters become convinced they are being stalked by the Predator, the alien antagonist from the 1987 film of the same name. Weiner called it a [...] "detour into an inspired absurdity that tugs against and tweaks the show's bureaucratic backdrop". Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] demonstrated how far Leslie Knope had developed since the first season. Poniewozik praised the [...] "ultra-deadpan" [...] pairing of Andy and April, which he said was another in a continued line of [...] "interesting combinations for its side players". Steve Penner of The Portsmouth Herald said the sequence of Poehler's statements to the park trooper was [...] "worthy of her absolutely best SNL impressions".|$|E
