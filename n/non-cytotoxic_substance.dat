Potentiodynamic polarization and AC impedance methods have been used. The corrosion inhibition efficiency increases on increasing plant extract concentration. Polarisation studies showed that Annona squamosa extract was mixed-type inhibitor in 1 M HCl. The inhibition efficiency of Annona squamosa extract was temperaturedependent and its addition led to an increase of the activation corrosion energy revealing a physical adsorption between the extract and the metal surface. The adsorption of the Annona squamosa extractfollowed Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm. The inhibitive effect of Annona squamosa is ascribed {{to the presence of}} organic compounds in the extract. The examined extract is considered as <b>non-cytotoxic</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that N-methacrylate glycol chitosan, a photo-polymerisable, biocompatible and water-soluble derivative of chitosan, can be easily processed to create non-woven mats of nanofibres with controlled physicochemical characteristics. The produced fibrous mats are characterised by thermal stability, Young's modulus of 140 MPa and ultimate strength of 4 MPa. The degree of cross-linking of the realised fibres regulates their durability and degradation profile under conditions of high humidity, but also allows controlling the delivery over time of active agents encapsulated inside the fibres. We demonstrate that the N-methacrylate glycol chitosan nanofibres are able to release an antimicrobial drug within 24 hours. Moreover, cells proliferation of 85 % indicates that <b>non-cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> were released from the electrospun mats...|$|R

Weight loss measurements, polarisation curves and AC impedance methods have been used. These {{studies have shown that the}} thiadiazole derivatives were very good inhibitors for mild steel in 1 M HCl. Comparison of results showed that 3 -TTH was the best inhibitor. The potential of zero charge (PZC) of mild steel was studied by AC impedance method, and the mechanism of adsorption has been predicted. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy surface analysis with thiadiazole derivatives shows that it chemisorbed at the mild steel/HCl interface. The adsorption of these inhibitors followed Langmuir's adsorption isotherm. The electronic properties of 2 -TTH and 3 -TTH, obtained using the AM 1 semi-empirical quantum chemical approach, were correlated with their experimental efficiencies using the linear resistance model (LR). These inhibitors are considered as <b>non-cytotoxic</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{chemotherapy}} {{agent and}} {{a method for}} local delivery of carmustine have recently been approved {{for the treatment of}} malignant glioma. However, the increase in survival remains modest at best with only a very select patients currently benefiting truly of these treatments. Combination regimen of different alkylating agents or prior O 6 -alkyltransferase depletion by O 6 -benzylguanine or continuous temozolomide administration schedules have shown some indication for increased activity. There is preclinical rational for combining temozolomide with radiotherapy and the initial results of a phase II clinical trial were promising. Several new cytotoxic agents are currently in clinical trials in patients with recurrent glioma. More importantly, targeted therapy and antiangiogenic agents have entered the clinical development phase also for patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. The optimal timing of administration of <b>non-cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> and their integration into the currently available treatments remains a challenge. Novel study designs and identification of surrogate markers are necessary in order to make rapid and clinically meaningful progress. This review summarises the currently available evidence of activity of the recently approved drugs against malignant glioma and mentions also agents which have failed to demonstrate a significant antitumour activity. Study endpoints are critically discussed. Combination regimens with other agents and radiation therapy are reviewed. The rational for using antiangiogenic drugs in selected ongoing trials is discussed...|$|R
