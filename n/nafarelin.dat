Some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. A newer hormonal intervention used in Europe is the use of GnRH analogs such as <b>nafarelin</b> or buserelin; the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hCG, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. Limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment; whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. The cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal.

5000|$|The area of {{intranasal}} medication delivery {{provides a}} huge opportunity for research - both for specifically developed pharmaceutical drugs designed for intranasal treatment, {{as well as}} for investigating off label uses of commonly available generic medications. Nasal sprays for local effect are quite common. Steroids, antiasthma medications such as salbutamol, ipratropium, montelukast and a large number of inhalational anaesthetic agents are being used commonly. The recent developments in intranasal drug delivery systems are prodigious. Several antimigraine drugs, available by the trade names of Imitrex- sumatriptan; Zomig - Zolmitriptan; Migranal - Dihydroergotamine and the OTC nasal spray Sinol-M; are also currently administered by nasal administration because a fast effect is desired and oral administration can be prohibited by nausea. Peptide drugs (hormone treatments) are also available as nasal sprays, in this case to avoid drug degradation after oral administration. The peptide analogue desmopressin is, for example, available for both nasal and oral administration, for the treatment of diabetes insipidus. The bioavailability of the commercial tablet is 0.1% while that of the nasal spray is 3-5% according to the SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics). Syntocinon nasal spray containing oxytocin is used to increase duration and strength of contractions during labour. Intranasal oxytocin is also being actively investigated for many psychiatric conditions including alcohol withdrawal, anorexia nervosa, PTSD, autism, anxiety disorders, pain sensation and schizophrenia. Intranasal Calcitonin, calcitonin-salmon is used to treat Hypercalcaemia arising out of malignancy, Paget's disease of bone, post menopausal and steroid induced osteoporosis, Phantom limb pain and other metabolic bone abnormalities, available as Rockbone, Fortical and Miacalcin Nasal Spray. GnRH analogues like <b>nafarelin</b> and busurelin are used for the treatment of anovulatory infertility, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, delayed puberty and cryptorchidism. Other potential drug candidates for nasal administration include anaesthetics, antihistamines (Azelastine), antiemetics (particularly metoclopramide and ondansetron) and sedatives that all benefit from a fast onset of effect. Intranasal midazolam is found to be highly effective in acute episodes of seizures in children. Recently, {{the upper part of the}} nasal cavity, as high as the cribriform plate, has been proposed for drug delivery to the brain. This [...] "transcribrial route" [...] published first in 2014 was suggested by the author (Baig AM. et al,) for drugs to be given for Primary Meningoencephalitis [...] Naloxone is used intravenously in opiate addiction in emergency cases, in rapid opiate detoxification, and as a diagnostic tool. The nasal drug administration of naloxone was found to be as effective as the intravenous route. In opioid overdoses, where hypotension and sometimes damaged veins make intravenous administration difficult, nasal naloxone offers a wide margin of safety and reduced risk of infection from vessel puncture while enabling even untrained bystanders to assist a victim. The prevention of abnormal nasal blood vessel growth (Avastin) and even the delivery of medications and drug antidotes such as hydroxocobalamin (antidote to cyanide poisoning) are being developed via intranasal medications. More recently interest is developing on delivery of a number of peptides and other drugs to the nose for direct transport into the brain to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Intranasal insulin is being investigated for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. IN ketamine, commonly being used for the treatment of breakthrough pain in patients with chronic pain is now becoming an area of significant research interest for the treatment of bipolar disease and major depressive disorder with early results suggesting a strong and prolonged antidepressant effect following a single subdissociative dose (50 mg) of ketamine.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of <b>nafarelin,</b> a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue, versus danazol in the treatment of women with endometriosis in Taiwan. Methods: Fifty-nine women with laparoscopically and pathologically confirmed endometriosis were randomized to receive <b>nafarelin</b> or danazol for 180 days. Efficacy was assessed from mean changes in laparoscopy score (LS) and total symptom severity score (TSSS). Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameters, including hematology, hepatic function, blood pressure, and lipid levels, were monitored for safety evaluations. Results: All demographic and baseline factors, except body weight, were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. Both <b>nafarelin</b> and danazol satisfactorily resolved pelvic tenderness, induration, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. No significant differences were noted in efficacy endpoints between <b>nafarelin</b> and danazol regarding LS and TSSS at 90 and 180 days of treatment. No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the overall incidence of AEs, except for laboratory-related AEs. However, <b>nafarelin</b> tended to have less impact than danazol on aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, and <b>nafarelin</b> was better tolerated than danazol regarding changes in lipid profiles. Both treatments had little or no effect on hematologic parameters. Conclusion: <b>Nafarelin</b> and danazol demonstrated similar clinical efficacy, but <b>nafarelin</b> was associated with fewer laboratory changes and a stable lipid profile, relative to danazol. Moreover, intranasally administered <b>nafarelin</b> is noninvasive, and may be a more comfortable and safer alternative to slow-release injectable GnRH agonists. Based on this study, we suggest that <b>nafarelin,</b> like other GnRH analogues, may be a treatment of choice for Taiwanese women with endometriosis. However, direct comparative studies of <b>nafarelin</b> with slow-release injectable GnRH agonists are now required...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>nafarelin</b> and danazol for endometriosis. Design: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy. Setting: Multiple European institutions. Patients: In total, 307 patients with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis received <b>nafarelin</b> (n = 206) or danazol (n = 101); 263 (171 <b>nafarelin,</b> 92 danazol) were analyzed for efficacy. Interventions: Intranasal <b>nafarelin</b> 200 -mu-g two times a day or oral danazol 200 mg {{three times a day}} were administered for 6 months. Main Outcome Measures: Efficacy assessments were based on preadmission and end-of-treatment laparoscopic scores and subjective symptom scores at admission, end of treatment, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Safety was evaluated by adverse events and clinical laboratory tests. Results: In each group, endometriosis growth and symptoms significantly improved during treatment (P < 0. 001). After treatment, symptoms returned in each group, but severity was less than at admission at all time points (P less-than-or-equal-to 0. 016). Mean body weight increased in the danazol-treated group (P < 0. 001), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase increased in both groups (P < 0. 001 for both) but significantly more in danazol users (P < 0. 002), and more <b>nafarelin</b> recipients had hot flushes (P < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{administered}} concentration and applied current density on the iontophoresis of the leutinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analog, <b>Nafarelin,</b> {{have been studied}} in vitro. Peptide electrotransport, at fixed current density {{as a function of}} concentration, and at fixed concentration as a function of current density, has been measured across hairless mouse skin. The results indicate that <b>Nafarelin</b> delivery does not increase linearly with applied concentration: while there is an increase when the donor concentration is doubled from 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/ml, further increments in applied peptide level result in decreased transport. At constant concentration, <b>Nafarelin</b> flux does increase with increasing current density (up to 0. 63 mA/cm 2), but the dependence is very weak. Further experiments utilizing radiolabeled mannitol as a neutral marker of electroosmosis revealed that <b>Nafarelin</b> electrotransport is very sensitive to the extent and direction of convective flow. With increasing amounts of applied <b>Nafarelin,</b> reversal of electroosmosis (from the anode-to-cathode to the cathode-to-anode direction) was apparent; it appeared that the cationic peptide associated strongly with, and neutralized, the net negative charge on the skin, thereby resulting in depression and, ultimately, reversal of the convective flow. This, in turn, inhibits <b>Nafarelin</b> transport by the electroosmotic mechanism and explains, we believe, both the inverse dependence of flux upon concentration and the only weakly dependent behavior upon current density (where, although more current delivers more ions, more current also drives more peptide into the skin and thereby diminishes electroosmosis). Overall, then, this research emphasizes the complicated interplay between peptide structure, skin electrical properties and formulation variables which must be carefully considered in the development and optimization of an iontophoretic drug delivery device...|$|E
40|$|The Iontophoretic {{delivery}} of the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue, <b>nafarelin</b> ([D-Nal (2) 6]LHRH) across hairless mouse skin in vitro has been investigated. The initial range-finding studies showed that a pharmacologically significant amount of the decapeptide can be transported across the skin in a relevant period of time. However, metabolism of <b>nafarelin</b> was observed to take place during its transdermal delivery. It was further found that a reservoir of <b>nafarelin</b> could be established in the skin; for example, following current passage {{for a period of}} 12 h, the amount transported across the tissue was comparable to that which subsequently desorbed passively from the skin over the next 12 h. Different current profiles were tested in an attempt to improve drug delivery and minimize the apparent reservoir effect. In addition, the electro-osmotic transport (from both anode and cathode chambers of the in vitro diffusion cell) of an uncharged compound (namely, mannitol) with and without the anodal {{delivery of}} <b>nafarelin</b> was determined.

The anodal {{delivery of the}} cationic peptide into the current-conducting pathways of the skin is believed to result in an association of the drug with the fixed negative charges on the membrane; this neutralization and further concentration of the lipophilic peptide reverses the permselectivity of the skin and hence electro-osmotic flow is also reversed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was designed to}} assess the impact of oral contraceptive (OC) scheduling with a GnRH antagonist (ganirelix) regimen on the ovarian response of women undergoing recombinant FSH (rFSH) stimulation for IVF, compared with a non-scheduled ganirelix regimen and a long GnRH agonist (<b>nafarelin)</b> protocol. METHODS: A total of 110 women was treated with an OC and ganirelix, 111 with ganirelix alone and 111 with <b>nafarelin.</b> The OC (containing 30 µg ethinylestradiol/ 150 µg desogestrel) was taken for 14 – 28 days and stopped 2 days prior to the start of rFSH treatment. Primary efficiency parameters were the number of cumulus-oocyte complexes (per attempt) and the number of grade 1 or 2 embryos (per attempt). RESULTS: In terms of follicular growth and hormone profiles, the OC-scheduled antagonist regimen mimicked the agonist regimen rather than the (non-scheduled) GnRH antagonist regimen. In the OC-scheduled GnRH antagonist group and the <b>nafarelin</b> group (versus the non-scheduled antagonist group), pituitary suppression was more profound at the start of stimulation (P # 0. 001), there was a slower start of follicular growth (P # 0. 001), longer stimulation was required (11. 7 and 10. 3 days respectively versus 9. 4; P # 0. 001), and more rFSH was used (2667 and 2222 IU versus 1966 IU; P # 0. 001). In the three groups, the number of oocytes was similar (13. 1, 12. 9 and 11. 5 respectively; not significant) as well as the number of good quality embryos (5. 1, 5. 7 and 5. 0 respectively; not significant). CONCLUSION: OC treatment prior to the rFSH/ganirelix regimen can be successfully applied to schedule patients, although more days of stimulation and more rFSH are required than with a non-scheduled GnRH antagonist regimen.

40|$|The pituitary-gonadal axis was {{evaluated}} in a mother after {{two of her}} sons with familial male-limited pseudoprecocious puberty {{were found to have}} a constitutively activating mutation of the LH receptor (LHR). Genotyping demonstrated that all showed a mutation in one of the two alleles, a substitution of Gly for Asp 578 in the sixth transmembrane segment of the LHR. Ovarian function was normal in the 36 -yr-old mother as assessed by LH dynamics and FSH and androgen levels throughout the menstrual cycle. Hormonal responses to acute GnRH agonist (<b>nafarelin)</b> challenge, chronic GnRH agonist administration, and dexamethasone were also normal. Studies of the boys upon presentation at 2. 4 and 3. 5 yr of age revealed that acute LH responses to <b>nafarelin</b> were in the hypogonadotropic range, and the FSH responses were prepubertal despite the presence of late pubertal testosterone blood levels. Upon the inception of true puberty at 11 yr of age in the older brother, gonadotropin responses normalized for the state of development. The data show that this activating LHR mutation does not cause functional ovarian hyperandrogenism and causes only incomplete pubertal activation of Leydig cells. The results are compatible with relatively low constitutive activity associated with this structural abnormality of LHR. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Transdermal {{administration}} by iontophoresis (enhanced transport via {{the skin}} using {{the driving force}} of an applied electric field) has been successfully demonstrated but no formal relationship between peptide sequence/structure and efficiency of delivery has been established. There are notable examples, such as the lipophilic leutinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs, <b>Nafarelin</b> and Leuprolide, that exhibit down-regulation of their own transport across the skin under the influence of an iontophoretic current. The hypothesis that this phenomenon is due to neutralization of the skin's net negative charge by these cationic peptides was examined with LHRH oligopeptides. The impact of these compounds on the electroosmotic flow of solvent into the skin, which is induced by iontophoresis and which contributes significantly to the electrotransport of large, positively charged ions, was examined and quantified. Close juxtaposition of cationic and lipophilic residues profoundly inhibited electroosmosis and, presumably, peptide flux. The results indicate that the lipophilicity of the oligopeptides facilitates van der Waals interactions with hydrophobic patches along the transport route, thereby permitting the positively charged oligopeptide to interact with carboxylate side chains that give the skin its net negative charge at neutral pH. The lipophilic, cationic oligopeptide, therefore, becomes anchored in the transport path, neutralizing the original charge of the membrane, and completely altering the permselective properties of the skin...|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS: Six oocyte donors were commenced on Gonal-F (150 IU) and two on Gonal-F 225 IU daily on day 4 together with cetrorelix 0. 25 mg daily on day 8 until the day of administration of hCG. Six premenopausal recipients were down-regulated with intranasal <b>Nafarelin</b> 400 mg twice daily; two women with premature menopause did not require down-regulation for synchronization between donor and recipient cycles. The median (range) of oocytes retrieved and the median (range) fertilization rates were 7 (3 ± 13) and 50 % (0 ± 71 %) respectively. With {{the exception of a}} recipient who had failed fertilization, seven recipients had two embryos transferred. The median (range) num-ber of days of ovarian stimulation, cetrorelix administration and number of Gonal-F ampoules administered for ovarian stimulation were 9 (7 ± 12) days, 5 (3 ± 8) and 18 (14 ± 24) respectively.

For each season, the groups were subdivided in two, which one was treated with the Ovsynch protocol and the other group for Presynch protocol. There was no statistical difference for artificial insemination pregnancy rates (AIPR) among the protocols and reproductive season. However, there was a difference in the accumulated pregnancy rates (APR) after the reviews with the bull. The BCS did not show influence in the AIPR, while the APR of the buffalos with BCS > 2. 5 (66. 13 %) was superior (P= 0. 003) than the APR animals with BCS 2, 5 (66, 13 %) foi estatisticamente superior à TPA do ECC < 2, 5 (28, 57 %). Foram observadas correlação positiva entre o peso e TPIA (+ 0, 35; P= 0, 001), assim como aconteceu na TPA (+ 0, 47; P= 0, 0001). O tamanho dos ovários esquerdo e direito influenciaram positivamente a TPIA e TPA nos dois tratamentos com o P sempre < 0, 001...|$|E
40|$|During {{iontophoresis}} under neutral pH conditions, {{there is}} a net convective flow of volume (elec-troosmosis) from anode to cathode leading to the enhanced transport of dissolved polar (but uncharged) solutes in the same direction. The objective {{of this study was}} to address the following unresolved questions with respect to electroosmotic transport: [1] Whether the efficiency of electroosmotic transport is solute size-dependent and, if so, how severe is this dependence? [2] Is electroosmosis linearly related to current density in the same way that the iontophoretic flux of charged species appears to be? [3] Are positively charged permeants able to influence their own electrotransport across the skin (by modifying the net charge on the membrane and altering, as a result, the permselectivity) and, if so, why and to what extent? Electroosmosis was assessed from the iontophoreically driven fluxes of mannitol, sucrose and lactose across hairless mouse skin in vitro. It was found that:- (a) The electroosmotic transport rate of mannitol is similar to that of the disaccharides, sucrose and lactose, when examined under identical conditions. The dependence of electroosmotic flux upon molecular size requires study of solutes having a wider range of MW than those considered here, (b) Electroosmotic flow from anode-to-cathode increases with applied current density; similarly, convective flow in the opposite direction diminishes with increasing current density. Apparently, there is correlation between the net movement of solvent and the total flux of ions across the skin, (c) The permselectivity of skin can be ‘neutralized’ by driving, iontophoretically, a cationic, lipophilic peptide (specifically the leutinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analog, <b>Nafarelin)</b> into the membrane. The apparently tight association of the peptide with the fixed, negatively-charged sites in the skin reduces significantly, in a concentration-dependent fashion, the anode-to-cathode electroosmotic flow across the barrier. Peptide lipophilicity appears to be necessary for this effect to be seen: the parent peptide, LHRH, does not exhibit this phenomenon...|$|E
