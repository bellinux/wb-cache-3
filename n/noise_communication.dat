40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the tradeoffs between sensing and communication in a consensus+innovations distributed detection problem {{when the local}} communications among agents are noisy. Intuitively, we can expect that the error performance of the distributed detector is affected by both the sensing noise and the <b>noise</b> corrupting the <b>communication</b> among agents in the network. Too little communication (cooperation) and the distributed detector error performance will be dominated by the sensing <b>noise.</b> Too much <b>communication</b> and the detector error performance {{is dominated by the}} <b>communication</b> <b>noise.</b> We make this tradeoff precise through a large deviations analysis, i. e., by studying the exponential decay rate of the probability of error of the consensus+innovations distributed detector at each agent. Under a mild assumption of network connectedness, we show: 1) the weight sequences affecting the consensus and innovations potentials in the distributed detector need to be carefully designed for the error probability at every agent detector to decay exponentially fast; 2) the network exhibits a phase transition with respect to the <b>communication</b> <b>noise</b> power. Below a threshold on the <b>communication</b> <b>noise</b> power, cooperation (<b>communication)</b> among agents improves the error detection performance; above threshold, inter-agent communication does not enhance the error detection performance.

40|$|Disclosed is a <b>noise</b> <b>communication</b> {{system and}} method. The <b>noise</b> <b>communication</b> system {{comprises}} a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter indexes {{through at least}} two noise records which comprise a series of randomly generated samples, the noise records being divided into noise segments, to maintain a current noise segment for each noise record. The transmitter modulates a predefined base signal using the segments of the noise records to represent the symbols of the base signal. In modulating the predefined base signal, the transmitter replaces the respective symbols of the base signal with the current noise segments from the noise records, thereby generating a noise signal in which the symbols can not be discerned. The noise signal is transmitted across a communications channel to the receiver which demodulates the noise signal into the base signal. The demodulation employs a number of correlators that equals the number of noise records employed at the transmitter. The receiver includes logic to index through the noise records {{in a similar manner}} to the transmitter to produce the current noise segments. Each correlator performs a multiplication function between a current noise segment from the noise record assigned to the correlator and the received segments of the noise signal which reveals a peak output when the segments match.

Consider the standard additive <b>noise</b> <b>communication</b> channel with a quadratic power constraint. Although waterfilling provides the optimal input distribution for Gaussian noise channels, sub-optimal distributions are often not too bad. For example, [1] shows that transmitting at only 2 levels (either on or off) in each sub-channel loses very little. Similarly, [2], [3] {{show that the}} mutual information for an optimal waterfilling power allocation on any additive noise channel is at most 0. 5 bits per real channel use higher than the mutual information for an independent, identically distributed, Gaussian input.

40|$|Abstract—The {{relatively}} high phase noise of coherent optical systems poses unique challenges for {{forward error correction}} (FEC). In this letter, we propose a novel semi-analytical method for selecting combinations of interleaver lengths and binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes that meet a target post-FEC bit error rate (BER). Our method requires only short pre-FEC simulations, based on which we design interleavers and codes analytically. It is applicable to pre-FEC BER around 10 − 3, and any post-FEC BER. Additionally, we {{show that there is}} a trade-off between code overhead and interleaver delay. Finally, for a target of 10 − 5, numerical simulations show that interleaver-code combinations selected using our method have post-FEC BER around 2 × target. The target BER is achieved with 0. 1 dB extra signal-to-noise ratio. Index Terms—Optical fiber communications, error correction codes, block codes, phase <b>noise,</b> <b>communication</b> systems.

40|$|Noise is a {{ubiquitous}} {{feature in}} natural {{as well as}} in urban habitats. The presence of noise can have multiple direct and indirect effects on <b>communication.</b> <b>Noise</b> can directly mask signals leading to reduced detection and recognition. Noise also affects internal physiological processes which can influence attention and decision rules and, thus, indirectly affect communication. Also community effects of noise leading to lower densities or different community composition with respect to copying style or personality will affect communication through different communication distances and different daily behavioural routines. All these direct and indirect effects of <b>noise</b> on <b>communication</b> have been well documented but often are treated separately.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{distributed}} algorithm for blind macro calibration in sensor networks based on output synchronization is proposed. The algorithm is formulated {{as a set}} of gradient-type recursions for estimating parameters of sensor calibration functions, starting from local criteria defined as weighted sums of mean square differences between the outputs of neighboring sensors. It is proved, on the basis of an originally developed methodology for treating higher-order consensus (or output synchronization) schemes, that the algorithm achieves asymptotic agreement for sensor gains and offsets, in the mean square sense and with probability one. In the case of additive measurement <b>noise,</b> additive inter-agent <b>communication</b> <b>noise,</b> and <b>communication</b> outages, a modification of the original algorithm based on instrumental variables is proposed.

By working on a linear setting the infimal SNR for stabilisability is defined as the infimal achievable H 2 norm between the channel noise input and the channel signal input.

40|$|We {{study the}} large {{deviations}} performance of consensus+innovations distributed detection over noisy networks, where sensors {{at a time}} step k cooperate with immediate neighbors (consensus) and assimilate their new observations (innovation.) We show that, even under noisy communication, all sensors can achieve exponential decay e^-k C_dis of the detection error probability, even when certain (or most) sensors cannot detect the event of interest in isolation. We achieve this by designing a single time scale stochastic approximation type distributed detector with the optimal weight sequence α_k, by which sensors weigh their neighbors' messages. The optimal design of α_k balances the opposing effects of communication noise and information flow from neighbors: larger, slowly decaying α_k improves information flow but injects more communication noise. Further, we quantify the best achievable C_dis {{as a function of}} the sensing signal and <b>noise,</b> <b>communication</b> noise, and network connectivity. Finally, we find a threshold on the communication noise power below which a sensor that can detect the event in isolation still improves its detection by cooperation through noisy links.
