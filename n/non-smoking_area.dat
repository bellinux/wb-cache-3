40|$|Office {{buildings}} Smoking areas Field monitoring {{was conducted}} in office buildings in Seattle and Dallas to assess the effectiveness of various workplace smoking configurations in con-trolling non-smokers exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Simul-taneous measurements of vapour-phase and particle-phase tracers of ETS were conducted in adjacent smoking and <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> Pressure rela-tionships between smoking and <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> were determined. The Seattle portion of the study focused on the direct infiltration of ETS from smoking to <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas,</b> as minimal recirculation of return air was occurring. Negative pressurisation of smoking areas eliminated the direct migration of ETS. Tracers of ETS exposure were not detected in <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> adjacent to negatively pressurised smoking lounges. In the Dallas study buildings, the impact of recirculation of ETS through the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems was assessed. Vapour-phase ETS constituents were recirculated into <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> at diluted concentrations. However, elevated particle-phase constituents were not found in <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> The overall results indicate that non-smokers exposure to ETS can be effec-tively reduced in the office workplace without regulations or policies that require either direct exhaust of air from smoking areas to the outdoors by dedicated ventilation systems or total prohibition of smoking within build-ings...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) {{in hotels}} and clubs is of {{community}} concern and {{may lead to}} a variety of adverse health outcomes for workers and patrons. This study sought to measure ETS in both smoking and <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> of hospitality venues in South Australia and to assess the effectiveness of ETS control measures. Seven hotels, clubs and cafes were investigated and the concentrations of airborne nicotine and particulate matter (PM 10) were measured as markers of ETS exposure during normal to busy periods. Overall average concentrations were higher in smoking areas (nicotine= 15 mg/m 3 and PM 10 = 255 mg/m 3) compared with <b>non-smoking</b> dining <b>areas</b> (nicotine= 7 mg/ m 3 and PM 10 = 192 mg/m 3). The data demonstrate an approximate two-fold reduction of ETS within nonsmoking areas and suggest that mechanical ventilation is only partially effective in preventing propagation of ETS throughout premises.

40|$|We {{performed}} 124 {{measurements of}} particulate matter (PM(2. 5)) in 95 hospitality venues such as restaurants, bars, cafés, and a disco, which had differing smoking regulations. We evaluated {{the impact of}} spatial separation between smoking and non-smoking areas on mean PM(2. 5) concentration, taking relevant characteristics of the venue, such as the type of ventilation or the presence of additional PM(2. 5) sources, into account. We differentiated five smoking environments: (i) completely smoke-free location, (ii) non-smoking room spatially separated from a smoking room, (iii) <b>non-smoking</b> <b>area</b> with a smoking area located in the same room, (iv) smoking area with a <b>non-smoking</b> <b>area</b> located in the same room, and (v) smoking location which could be either a room where smoking was allowed that was spatially separated from non-smoking room or a hospitality venue without smoking restriction. In these five groups, the geometric mean PM(2. 5) levels were (i) 20. 4, (ii) 43. 9, (iii) 71. 9, (iv) 110. 4, and (v) 110. 3 microg/m(3), respectively. This study showed that even if non-smoking and smoking areas were spatially separated into two rooms, geometric mean PM(2. 5) levels in non-smoking rooms were considerably higher than in completely smoke-free hospitality venues. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: PM(2. 5) levels are considerably increased in the <b>non-smoking</b> <b>area</b> if smoking is allowed anywhere in the same location. Even locating the smoking area in another room resulted in a more than doubling of the PM(2. 5) levels in the non-smoking room compared with venues where smoking was not allowed at all.

40|$|Since {{individuals}} {{spend the}} majority of their times indoors, fine particles generated in indoor combustion processes and by resuspension are important for health effects assessment. The nature and magnitude of indoor particle exposures can change rapidly because of the rapid changes in activities and sources. Indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured in indoor office, café, and home where people spend majority of their time in there. A real time monitor was used to provide a high degree of resolution for investigating temporal patterns in particle concentrations. The average PM 2. 5 concentration obtained from the direct reading compared with the mean PM 2. 5 concentrations that are obtained by gravimetric measurements during the same continuous sampling. Mean PM 2. 5 concentrations in the big office were more than twice as high as those measured in the small quiet office (19. 8 and 7. 3 respectively). In the home, cooking increased PM 2. 5 concentration. The highest particle concentrations in home (average 28 µg m- 3) were related to a period around midnight when there were a larger number of occupants inside the living room.

Methods The study measured air nicotine concentrations over 7 days to characterise secondhand smoke exposure in 30 bars/restaurants in 2008. Owner/manager interviews and physical inspections were conducted. Results Median IQR air nicotine concentrations measured in all venues were 4. 38 (0. 61 e 13. 62) mg/m 3. Air nicotine concentrations were higher in bars (median 7. 22, IQR 2. 48 e 15. 64 mg/m 3) compared to restaurants (1. 12, 0. 15 e 9. 22 mg/m 3). By smoking status, nicotine concentrations were higher in smoking venues (13. 46, 5. 31 e 16. 87 mg/m 3), followed by smoking areas in mixed venues (9. 22, 5. 09 e 14. 90 mg/m 3) and <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> in mixed venues (0. 99, 0. 19 e 1. 27 mg/m 3). Air nicotine concentrations were markedly lower in smoke-free venues (0. 12, 0. 11 e 0. 46 mg/m 3). After adjustment for differences in volume and ventilation, air nicotine concentrations were 3. 2, 35. 5 and 56. 2 times higher in <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> in mixed venues, smoking areas in mixed venues and smoking venues, respectively, compared to smoke-free venues. Conclusions Exposure to secondhand smoke remains high in bars and restaurants in Santiago, Chile. These findings demonstrate that the partial smoking ban legislation enacted in Chile in 2007 provides no protection to employees working in those venues. Enacting a comprehensive smoke-free legislation which protects all people from exposure to secondhand smoke in all public places and workplaces is urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure secondhand tobacco (including kretek) smoke (SHS) {{concentrations}} in public places in Jakarta, Bogor, and Palembang before laws banning smoking in public spaces went into effect. Methods: Particulate matter (PM 2. 5) was measured in 15 hospitals, 15 government offices, 30 restaurants, and 26 entertainment venues throughout the three cities. Also, in Jakarta, vapor-phase nicotine was measured in 5 schools, 5 hospitals, 5 government offices, 9 restaurants, and 10 entertainment venues. Data were analyzed descriptively. Differences by city and venue characteristics were analyzed by Student’s t-test, ANOVA, and Bonferroni pairwise statistical tests. Results: Geometric mean PM 2. 5 levels were highest in entertainment venues (96 μg/m 3), followed by restaurants (78 μg/m 3), government offices (57 μg/m 3), and hospitals (46 μg/m 3). Air nicotine levels in Jakarta were highest in designated smoking areas (4. 71 μg/m 3) and designated <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> (1. 55 μg/m 3) of entertainment venues. These were followed by government offices (0. 30 μg/m 3), designated smoking areas (0. 24 μg/m 3) and designated <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> (0. 19 μg/m 3) of restaurants, hospitals (0. 01 μg/m 3), and schools (0. 01 μg/m 3). Conclusion: SHS was detected in all venues in the three cities in Indonesia. High levels of air nicotine were found in <b>non-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> of restaurants and entertainment venues, indicating that designated smoking areas are not an effective solution to eliminate SHS. There is no safe level of SHS exposure and thus SHS in these venues increases the risk of adverse health effects among children and adults. These findings support the need for 100 % smoke-free laws covering all public venues in these and other Indonesian cities.
