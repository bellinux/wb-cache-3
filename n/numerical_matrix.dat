5000|$|Another {{approach}} is <b>numerical</b> <b>matrix</b> diagonalization. If the Hamiltonian matrix is computed in any complete basis, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained by diagonalizing the matrix. However, all complete basis sets are infinite, {{and we need}} to truncate the basis and still obtain accurate results. These techniques boil down to choosing a truncated basis from which accurate wavefunctions can be constructed. The computational time required to diagonalize a matrix scales as , where [...] is the dimension of the matrix, so it is important to choose the smallest basis possible from which the relevant wavefunctions can be constructed. It is also convenient to choose a basis in which the matrixis sparse and/or the matrix elements are given by simple algebraic expressions because computing matrix elements can also be a computational burden.|$|E

40|$|This paper interprets {{chirality}} in {{the context}} of dihedral (finite) group algebras. It is argued that the presence and quantification of chirality or handedness in certain objects is dependent on how these objects respond when subject to (dihedral) rotations and reversals. The absence of response to reversals is an indication of absence of chirality. Rotationreversal displays are introduced in order to describe an object’s responds to dihedral actions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers one- and two-electron-hole-pair excitations in ideally spherical semiconductor {{quantum dots}} with infinite or finite confinement potentials. The optical absorption {{edge of the}} semiconductor micsrocrystallites {{is found to be}} higher than that in the corresponding bulk semiconductor. This blue shift is approximately proportional to 1 /R², where R is the radius of the semiconductor microspheres. For small quantum dots with infinite confinement potential, the energies and wave-functions of quantum confined excitons and biexcitons are computed using a <b>numerical</b> <b>matrix</b> diagonalization method. Both <b>numerical</b> <b>matrix</b> digaonalization and perturbative calculations prove that the binding energy of biexcitons is strictly positive regardless of material parameters. A general formula for the optical susceptibility of quantum dots is derived, from which, optical spectra are computed. The theoretical results qualitatively agree with recent experimental observations. Some novel optical properties of quantum dots are revealed by this study, such as the existence of excited biexciton states energetically above the exciton ground state resonance and modified optical nonlinearities. Extending our numerical scheme, we compute the effects of impurities or crystal defects in a simple model. The calculation shows that charge defects or impurities have only a small influence on the optical spectra of quantum dots. The details of the quantum confinement conditions, such as the finite value of the quantum confinement potential and different electron-hole masses inside and outside the dot, are studied {{within the framework of the}} variational scheme. Finally, we extend the <b>numerical</b> <b>matrix</b> diagonalization method to investigate the valence band coupling effect in quantum dots by including the Luttinger Hamiltonian. It is found that the concept of heavy- and light-hole has to be modified to describe the hole states in semiconductor quantum dots. Also, the valence band mixing due to spin-orbit interaction changes significantly the optical selection rules and consequently influences the allowed optical excitations in quantum dots...|$|E
