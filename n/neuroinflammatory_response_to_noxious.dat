40|$|Up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines {{in brain}} ("neuroinflammation") accompanies {{neurological}} disease and neurotoxicity. Previously, we documented a striatal <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> acute administration of a neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine (METH), i. e. one associated {{with evidence of}} dopaminergic terminal damage and activation of microglia and astroglia. When we used minocycline to suppress METH-induced neuroinflammation, indices of dopaminergic neurotoxicity were not affected, but suppression of neuroinflammation was incomplete. Here, we administered the classic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), {{in an attempt to}} completely suppress METH-related neuroinflammation. METH alone caused large increases in striatal proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine mRNA and subsequent astrocytic hypertrophy, microglial activation, and dopaminergic nerve terminal damage. Pre-treatment of mice with acute CORT failed <b>to</b> prevent <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> METH. Surprisingly, when mice were pre-treated with chronic CORT in the drinking water, an enhanced striatal <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> METH was observed, an effect that was accompanied by enhanced METH-induced astrogliosis and dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Chronic CORT pre-treatment also sensitized frontal cortex and hippocampus <b>to</b> mount a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> METH. Because the levels of chronic CORT used are associated with high physiological stress, our data suggest that chronic CORT therapy or sustained physiological stress may sensitize the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> and neurotoxicity <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> METH.

40|$|Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multi-symptom {{disorder}} {{with features}} characteristic of persistent sickness behavior. Among conditions {{encountered in the}} Gulf War (GW) theater were physiological stressors (e. g., heat/cold/physical activity/sleep deprivation), prophylactic treatment with the reversible AChE inhibitor, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the insect repellent, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and potentially the nerve agent, sarin. Prior exposure to the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), at levels associated with high physiological stress, can paradoxically prime the CNS to produce a robust proinflammatory <b>response</b> <b>to</b> neurotoxicants and systemic inflammation; such neuroinflammatory effects {{can be associated with}} sickness behavior. Here, we examined whether CORT primed the CNS <b>to</b> mount <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> GW exposures as a potential model of GWI. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with chronic (14 days) PB/ DEET, subchronic (7 - 14 days) CORT, and acute exposure (day 15) to diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a sarin surrogate and irreversible AChE inhibitor. DFP alone caused marked brain-wide neuroinflammation assessed by qPCR of tumor necrosis factor- 1, IL 6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, IL- 12, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M. Pre-treatment with high physiological levels of CORT greatly augmented (up to 300 -fold) the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> DFP. Anti-inflammatory pre-treatment with minocycline suppressed many proinflammatory <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> CORT+DFP. Our findings are suggestive of a possible critical, yet unrecognized interaction between the stressor/environment of the GW theater and agent exposure(s) unique to this war. Such exposures may in fact prime the CNS <b>to</b> amplify future <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> pathogens, injury, or toxicity. Such occurrences could potentially result in the prolonged episodes of sickness behavior observed in GWI. Gulf War (GW) veterans were exposed to stressors, prophylactic medicines and, potentially, nerve agents in theater. Subsequent development of GW Illness, a persistent multi-symptom disorder with features characteristic of sickness behavior, may be caused by priming of the CNS resulting in exaggerated <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> pathogens/insults. Nerve agent, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), produced a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> that was exacerbated by pre-treatment with levels of corticosterone simulating heightened stressor conditions. While prophylactic treatments reduced DFP-induced neuroinflammation, this effect was negated when those treatments were combined with corticosterone.

40|$|Although central serotonergic {{systems are}} known <b>to</b> {{influence}} <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> stimuli, mechanisms underlying serotonergic modulation of pain responses are unclear.

In mice constitutively lacking 5 -HT 2 CRs (2 CKO mice) we found normal baseline sensory <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli. In contrast, 2 CKO mice exhibited a selective enhancement of affect-related ultrasonic afterdischarge vocalizations in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> footshock.

40|$|Neuroinflammatory {{processes}} {{are well known}} to regulate behavior, mood, and cognition and are considered {{a key factor in}} the development of psychiatric disorders. Exposure to acute or chronic stressors primes the neuroimmune microenvironment to produce exaggerated or enhanced <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> a subsequent immune challenge. This primed state persists for many days after stress exposure. However the mechanism(s) that lead stressors to prime neuroinflammation are largely unknown. Advancement in our understanding of peripheral innate immune function led to the discovery that endogenous molecules are released in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> `danger 2 ̆ 7 to assist immune/inflammatory processes. Recent evidence suggests similar {{processes are}} present in the CNS. Here, stress is explored as a process that can be conceptualized as `danger 2 ̆ 7 in which the danger signal, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB- 1) is released in the brain <b>to</b> prepare <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> subsequent pro-inflammatory stimuli. The data presented in this dissertation established that signaling via toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and/or TLR 4 in the brain is required for stress-induced microglia priming and sensitization of <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> a peripheral immune challenge. Next, HMGB- 1 was explored as the signal to TLR 2 /TLR 4. Inescapable tailshock increased HMGB- 1 protein in the hippocampus and HMGB- 1 was actively released by hippocampal microglia. Central administration of an HMGB- 1 antagonist during inescapable tailshock prevented stress-induced microglia priming. HMGB- 1 is susceptible to post-translational modifications that determine receptor interaction and inflammatory function. Disulfide HMGB- 1 has been shown to bind TLRs and is likely the primary form that drives stress-induced priming. Central administration of dsHMGB- 1 was sufficient to prime the overall <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> a peripheral LPS injection as well as microglia <b>response</b> <b>to</b> LPS ex vivo. This is likely mediated, in part, by a direct effect on microglia as microglia treated with dsHMGB- 1 were primed to a later LPS challenge. Lastly, the intracellular mechanism by which HMGB- 1 drives neuroinflammatory priming was explored. Stress-induced HMGB- 1 likely primes <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> via the NLRP 3 inflammasome. Both inescapable tailshock and central administration of dsHMGB- 1 increased hippocampal NLRP 3 protein for at least 24 h. Furthermore, direct treatment of dsHMGB- 1 on isolated microglia increased NLRP 3 transcription. This effect was not accompanied by the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that the NLRP 3 inflammasome is primed but not active. The work presented in this dissertation implicates HMGB- 1 as an endogenous danger signal that is released in the brain in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> stress <b>to</b> prime <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> by acting on the NLRP 3 inflammasome, in preparation for a later immune challenge...|$|R

40|$|Variability in opioid {{analgesia}} {{has been}} attributed to many factors. For example, genetic variability of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) -encoding gene introduces variability in MOR function and endogenous opioid neurotransmission. Emerging evidence suggests that personality trait related to the experience of reward is linked to endogenous opioid neurotransmission. We hypothesized that opioid-induced behavioral analgesia would be predicted by the trait reward responsiveness (RWR) and the response of the brain reward circuitry <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> stimuli at baseline before opioid administration. In healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging and the μ-opioid agonist remifentanil, we found that the magnitude of behavioral opioid analgesia is positively correlated with the trait RWR and predicted by the neuronal <b>response</b> <b>to</b> painful <b>noxious</b> stimuli before infusion in key structures of the reward circuitry, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and the ventral tegmental area.

Expression of c-Fos observed in CL nucleus after intensive visceral stimulation confirmed the activation. However, excited CL neurons did not have somatic fields, except in 3 of 43 (7 %) CL neurons tested for <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> somatic stimulation (innocuous brush and noxious pinch).

Nevertheless, further observations to confirm whether the observed fMRI effects of eTNS are both related to clinical improvement and specific to antinociceptive modulation in migraine patients are mandatory...|$|R

To assess whether this modality-specific contribution is also manifest {{at the level}} of spinal cord neuron responsiveness, here we made extracellular recordings from lumbar dorsal horn neurons of the mouse in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> graded thermal and mechanical stimulation. We found that, following intrathecal injection of capsaicin to eliminate the central terminals of TRPV 1 + nociceptors, neurons in the region of laminae I and V of the spinal cord lost responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> heat (whether generated by a contact heat probe or diode laser), with no change in their <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> mechanical stimulation. In contrast, ablation of MrgprD+ afferents did not alter the <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> heat, but reduced the firing of superficial dorsal horn nociceptive-specific neurons in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> graded mechanical stimulation and decreased the relative number of wide dynamic range neurons that were exclusively mechanosensitive. Neither ablation procedure reduced the number of dorsal horn neurons that responded <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> cold. These findings support the conclusion that TRPV 1 + nociceptors are necessary and probably sufficient for noxious heat activation of dorsal horn neurons and that, despite their polymodal properties, TRPV 1 + and MrgprD+ nociceptors provide modality-specific contributions <b>to</b> the <b>response</b> properties of spinal cord neurons. © 2013 The Physiological Society...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases with age as the greatest risk factor. As the general population experiences extended life span, preparation for the prevention and treatment of these and other age-associated neurological diseases are warranted. Since epidemiological studies suggested that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use decreased risk for AD and PD, increasing attention has been devoted to understanding {{the costs and benefits of}} the innate <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> functional recovery following pathology onset. This review will provide a general overview on the role of neuroinflammation in these neurodegenerative diseases and an update on NSAID treatment in recent experimental animal models, epidemiological analyses, and clinical trials...|$|R
25|$|Argument {{by analogy}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to assess}} the capacity of other animals to experience pain. This is based on the principle that if a non-human animal's <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> stimuli {{are similar to those of}} humans, they are likely to have had an analogous experience. For example, if a pin is stuck in a chimpanzee's finger and she rapidly withdraws her hand, then argument by analogy indicates that like humans, she felt pain.|$|R
