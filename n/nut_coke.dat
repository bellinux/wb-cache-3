40|$|The {{blast furnace}} consumes {{a large amount}} of high quality {{metallurgy}} coke (size 35 - 80 mm) in addition to ore in the form of pellets and sinter. This coke is the coarse fraction, derived from the coke plant. The fine fraction (8 - 35 mm), arise after sieving, named <b>nut</b> <b>coke,</b> can’t be directly used in blast furnace. The fraction of smaller than 8 mm is used in the sinter plant. Therefore, a large fraction of coke around 20 % from coking plant/process is not used for iron ore reduction. Recent research indicates that usage of <b>nut</b> <b>coke</b> will be economic if properly used. <b>Nut</b> <b>coke</b> cannot be directly mixed with normal coke because it will decrease the permeability of the coke layer in the blast furnace. However, mixing <b>nut</b> <b>coke</b> into the ferrous burden layer could be an effective way to use the coke resource economically. This mixed charging could improve softening and melting behaviour, reduction kinetics and permeability and also make full use of the coke resource. It may, however, also worsen the layer permeability and even deteriorate the whole blast furnace process. The mechanism of the effect of mixing <b>nut</b> <b>coke</b> into the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace is still not clear, and thus the usage of <b>nut</b> <b>coke</b> is still limited. To investigate the effect and mechanism of using <b>nut</b> <b>coke</b> in the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace, cold flow model experiments and high temperature experiments have been conducted. An advanced Reduction, Softening and Melting experimental facility (RSM) was designed for high temperature experiments at TU Delft.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} in use of reducing agents in blast furnace (BF) ironmaking has been significantly improved over the years. At most blast furnaces, auxiliary fuels are injected to replace some of the coke. To further reduce carbon consumption, prevention of losses and modification of raw materials or process conditions are required. In this study coke properties, their development during the descent in the BF under different process conditions, contribution to off-gas dust as well as modifications of coke aiming for reduced energy consumption in the BF have been investigated. The changes in chemical composition of coke ash, mineral phase developments and coke participation in the endothermic gasification reaction with CO 2 and coke graphitisation were studied. Also, {{in order to reduce}} the losses of material in the off-gas, a characterisation of the off-gas dust and its connection to BF conditions and coke property development in the BF has been made. Coke properties have been studied in the laboratory and in samples taken out from different parts of the LKAB Experimental BF (EBF®) during varied operational set-ups. Properties of coke from the BF high-temperature region were studied via tuyere core-drilling of samples from the EBF and an industrial-scale BF. The results showed that the coarser dry flue dust is mechanically formed. Coke fines originating from the upper shaft dominates the coarser fractions. Gasification in the shaft has a negligible effect on the high quality coke used in the EBF. The finer dust fraction, sludge, consists mainly of chemically formed spherical particles in the order of < 1 μm. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high-temperature area precipitate from the ascending gas as the temperature decreases. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are favourable for low flue dust amounts expelled from the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured in the standardised test, was compared with coke from basket samples charged into the EBF. Coke reactivity in the EBF is considerably lower for all coke types studied compared to coke studied in the CRI/CSR test. Due to higher gasification in the laboratory test the ash content is higher in that test. However, gaseous components in the EBF, such as recirculated alkali, contribute to changed ash composition in BF coke. Laboratory studies using fixed bed reactor (FBR) and a thermo gravimetric analyser (TGA) on the same material, original as well as Fe- and Ca-activated coke samples, identified the effects on reaction behaviour and were the basis for selection of the potentially best method for activating <b>nut</b> <b>coke</b> to achieve higher reactivity with CO 2 when charged into iron-bearing layers. All types of Fe- and Ca-containing activation agents used increase the apparent reaction rates for coke with low reactivity and contents of catalytic components in the ash. Activation with a solution of Fe(NO 3) 3 has the strongest effect on the reactivity, followed by slurry of Ca(OH) 2 and iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) in descending order. Use of a non-specific weight loss in TGA as a basis for apparent reaction rate demands measurements in a temperature interval free from other reactions involving the activation agents. The reaction rate is reduced when CO is present in the reaction gas. Aiming for a method for determination of thermal history in BF samples the correlation between temperature and coke graphitisation was studied using three different data processing methods for removing the influence from overlapping peaks during X-ray diffraction measurements. Structural changes in coke during heat treatment are accompanied by chemical transformations in ash compounds and changed the pattern of disturbing peaks. Key ash phases were SiO 2 and mullite. At high temperatures (~ 1500 °C) the SiO 2 peaks are reduced in magnitude and finally disappear to be replaced with SiC peaks. The graphitisation was correlated with temperature and time in argon atmosphere and the impact from hot metal and slag was investigated. The graphitisation degree in coke samples from the EBF raceway and hearth was estimated and the evolution of structural order was found to be suitable in order to estimate the thermal history of coke in blast furnaces.
