40|$|Potential {{production}} of bioethanol, <b>biomethane</b> <b>and</b> wood pellets from lignocellulosic biomass wastes of the banana plant (Musa spp.) in Cameroon. Like most African countries who are producers and exporters of banana, Cameroon {{is facing a}} major energy deficit. Yet, the country is generating annually about 4, 500, 000 tons of fresh banana plant lignocellulosic waste biomass matter equivalent to 402, 750 tons of dry matter. The dry matter contained about 80, 57 % organic matter which are not exploited. Under the sustainable development, which is linked to environmental protection, the biotransformation of these residues can potentially produce about 93, 800; 92, 133; 447, 500 tons of bioethanol, <b>biomethane</b> <b>and</b> pellets respectively. The waste transformation could reduce the energy deficit and create jobs opportunities. Productions of this renewable energy or biofuel also constitute a new area which could assure {{an important source of}} income for the banana cultivators and the entire country...|$|R
