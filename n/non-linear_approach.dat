Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg praised both the track's production and lyrical content, saying, [...] "the lyric, too, is among the album's best, a pleasing return to a <b>non-linear</b> <b>approach</b> that paints a desolate landscape of poisoned rivers, nuclear devastation and genetic mutation reminiscent of Diamond Dogs." [...] AllMusic critic Dave Thompson praised the song for its [...] "ecologically inclined lyric, a tremendously buoyant vocal, and a fabulous Sid McGinnis guitar solo [...] make Bowie sound like he's really enjoying himself", which he considered a [...] "rarity" [...] for Bowie in the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Human Revolution was {{composed}} by Michael McCann, {{who worked on}} the score from 2008 to 2011. McCann also handled production, performance, mixing and arranging. Additional arrangements were done by Francois Arbour and Eric Arvisais. Vocals were provided by Andrea Revel and Courtney Wing. McCann, when comparing Human Revolution with his prior work on Ubisoft's , stated that the latter could be scored more like a feature film due to its linear nature, while Human Revolutions <b>non-linear</b> <b>approach</b> to both gameplay and story made composition more challenging. McCann's music for Human Revolution was focused around the game's multilayered dualistic themes, which he described as [...] "technology/nature, past/future, wealth/poverty", all of which were encompassed by the general transhumanist theme. McCann and sound director Steve Szczepkowski initially started out using dark electronic scoring typical of the cyberpunk genre, but during the three-year period he worked on the game the music gradually became more [...] "organic". He was influenced by the visuals' Renaissance styling, convincing him to blend organic and traditional cyberpunk elements. The electronic elements were influenced by the film music of John Carpenter, Vangelis, and the band Tangerine Dream. The acoustic mood elements were inspired by the work of Lisa Gerrard, Ennio Morricone and Elliot Goldenthal. Outside films, he was strongly influenced by electronic bands and musicians, such as Amon Tobin and the band Massive Attack.|$|E
500|$|Part of the game's {{concept is}} {{a balance between}} puzzle-solving and perception, giving the player the freedom to explore The Witnesss world and {{creating}} a <b>non-linear</b> <b>approach</b> to gameplay. Two of the first puzzles Blow had created involved [...] "clues in objects that populate the world", which led him to recognize he needed to create a world to support these puzzles. This would form a dichotomy between exploration and puzzle solving, which [...] "made a lot of sense" [...] to Blow. Blow created the island as open world, so that players can leave puzzles they are stuck at and work at other ones, as to avoid punishing the player {{for not being able}} to solve a key puzzle, a common issue with other adventure games according to Blow. Blow wanted puzzles to be clearly presented in the open and without any red herrings, an approach he had taken with Braid. Exploration is encouraged through the game's narrative, which are told by audio logs the player can find on the unpopulated island; through these, Blow attempted to create a [...] "feeling of loneliness in a beautiful space" [...] for the player. Because these logs can be found in any order, Blow hopes that each player may have a different perception of the narrative depending on how they have approached the game. Initially, these audio logs were to be more story-driven, but Blow opted later to change these out for more obfuscated and obtuse information, similar to the text elements used in Braid, as to avoid directly relating out the story of the game for the player and let them think about what the narrative means instead. Blow's team designed the narrative that those that solve more of the puzzles will gain more of a concrete understanding of the story.|$|E

40|$|According to {{the design}} codes for wind turbine blades, it is {{sufficient}} to evaluate the blade's limit states using solely a linear analysis. This study, however, shows the need of non-linear analyses in blade design. Therefore, a geometrically non-linear structural response of a 34 m blade under flap-wise loading has been compared with a linear response to determine the blade's resistance in the ultimate strength and stability limit states. The linear analysis revealed an unrealistic failure mechanism and failure mode. Further, it did not capture the highly non-linear response of the blade that was measured in an ultimate full-scale test to failure and determined by a geometrically non-linear analysis. A design evaluation {{in accordance with the}} least stringent Germanischer Lloyd (GL) requirements has been compared with <b>non-linear</b> <b>approaches</b> proposed by GL and Eurocode, which require the application of an imperfection. The more realistic <b>non-linear</b> <b>approaches</b> yielded more optimistic results than the mandatory linear bifurcation analysis. Consequently, the investigated blade designed after the lesser requirements was sufficient. Using the <b>non-linear</b> <b>approaches,</b> considering inter-fibre failure as the critical failure mode, yielded still a significant safety margin for the designer (7 - 28 %). The non-linear response was significantly dependent on the scaling of the imperfection. Eurocode's method of applying an imperfection appeared more realistic than the GL method. Since the considered blade withstood 135 % of the design load at a full-scale test to failure and the blade has operated successfully in the field, GL's safety factors combined with the imperfection size may be too conservative...|$|R
