40|$|Scarcity of {{information}} on office transaction opportunities contributes to office markets being illiquid. Asset and vendor identity is problematic since information is privately held and highly localised in geographically dispersed markets. DiMaggio and Louch (1998) and Rangan, (2000) demonstrate how social networks resolve market uncertainty where conversional mechanisms which rely on publicly available information are not practical. The research question is how social networks are used to resolve uncertainty in commercial office sales markets. Methodology: The paper adopted an exploratory research approach. Data was collected through in-depth face-to-face interviews with opportunistically sampled commercial real estate brokers in Johannesburg, South Africa. Data was organised using NVivo (1999) ® and employed constructivist theoretical thematic analysis. Findings: Social networks seem relevant in high-value office sales transactions involving sophisticated clients. Brokers use social networks to access private information on clients’ acquisition and disposal criteria, manage information on transaction activity as per clients’ interests, pool potential buyers, channel business opportunities, and build relations and trust. Transaction {{are likely to be}} publicly marketed when they involve unsophisticated clients or unknown buyers. Research limitations: There is descriptive validity threat relating to factual validity of respondents’ accounts. There are also interpretive validity threats on accuracy of respondents’ interpretation of contexts, and researcher’s interpretation of responses. Introducing non-mainstream real estate concepts and using an opportunistic sample presents a theoretical validity threat of a plausible theoretical framework associating social networks to office sales transactions. Research implications: This paper contributes to understanding how social <b>networks</b> <b>address</b> <b>information</b> asymmetry in sales transactions where conventional mechanisms are not able to cost-effectively do so. Originality: This paper is extracted from the first author’s PhD research on liquidity in commercial real estate markets. Social networks have been explored in business and built environment, but there are no previous studies that have sought to understand social networks in office sales markets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} {{localized}} address autoconfiguration (LaConf) scheme for wireless ad hoc <b>networks.</b> <b>Address</b> allocation <b>information</b> is maintained {{on the network}} border nodes, called addressing agents (AAs), which are locally identified by a geographic routing protocol GFG (Greedy-FACE-Greedy). When a node joins the network, it acquires an address from a neighboring AA (if any exists) by local communication or from the head AA (a geographic extreme AA) by GFG-based multi-hop communication. A Geographic Hash Table (GHT) is adopted for duplicate address detection. Each address is hashed to a unique location in the network field, and the associated assignment information is stored along the face perimeter enclosing that location (in the planar graph). When a node receives an address assignment, it consults with the perimeter nodes around the hash location of the assigned address about any conflicts. AAs detect network partitions and merger locally according to neighborhood change and trigger AA re-selection and network re-configuration (if necessary). We propose to apply a Connected Dominating Set (CDS) to improve the performance. We also evaluate LaConf through simulation using different planar graphs. Key words: address autoconfiguration; localized algorithms; wireless ad hoc networks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>address</b> {{shuffling}} {{is a novel}} {{moving target}} defense (MTD) that invalidates the <b>address</b> <b>information</b> collected by the attacker by dynamically changing or remapping the host's <b>network</b> <b>addresses.</b> However, most <b>network</b> <b>address</b> shuffling methods are limited by the limited address space and rely on the host's static domain name to map to its dynamic address; therefore these methods cannot effectively defend against random scanning attacks, and cannot defend against an attacker who knows the target's domain name.

40|$|Abstract. The IETF’s Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) {{framework}} {{provides an}} up-to-date signaling protocol suite {{that can be}} used to dynamically install, maintain, and manipulate state in network nodes. In its two-layered architecture, the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol is responsible for the transport and routing of signaling messages. The strong presence of <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translation (NAT) gateways in today’s Internet infrastructure causes some major challenges to network signaling protocols like NSIS. The address translation mechanisms performed by common NAT gateways are primarily concerned with <b>address</b> <b>information</b> contained in the IP and transport layer headers. Signaling sessions between two signaling peers do, however, rely on <b>address</b> <b>information</b> contained in GIST data units. If a non GIST-aware NAT gateway merely adapts addresses in the IP and transport headers only, inconsistent state will finally be installed at the signaling nodes. In this paper we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an application level gateway for the GIST protocol, that translates GIST messages in a way that allows to establish signaling sessions between any two GIST nodes across a NAT gateway.

The same issue exists for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol and is even more difficult when SCTP associations are multi-homed.

We will discuss a unique problem that SCTP introduce with multi-homing, which is port preservation over an entire SCTP association even if it traverses multiple NATs. Most of the existing traversal techniques do not cover synchronizing multiple NATs and are therefore inappropriate for SCTP. Finally, we will show how the NAT/Firewall NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol can be used for reserving the port number, acquiring public addresses and opening data flows over NATs that are included in the SCTP association...|$|R
