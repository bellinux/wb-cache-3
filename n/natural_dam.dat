The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from {{much of the rest}} of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken <b>natural</b> <b>dam</b> of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift.

5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the <b>natural</b> <b>dam</b> of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In Teziutlán, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half of its annual rainfall in about three days. Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in Teziutlán alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in Teziutlán and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a <b>natural</b> <b>dam</b> and a small lake. Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to a church that was also covered, and it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in Teziutlán who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town. In the village of Tetela de Ocampo, 31people died. In Puebla, 30,000people were injured, and 81 municipalities sustained damage, with statewide damage estimated at about $240million (2.1billion pesos).|$|E

Meanwhile, landslides have reduced dam strength on the outside. Seismic activity caused by the lake's volcanic foundation could thus cause the lake wall to give way, resulting in up to 50million cubic metres (1.8billion cuft) of water flooding downhill into areas of the Northwest Province and the Nigerian states of Taraba and Benue. Njilah estimates that the area is {{home to more than}} 10,000people.|$|E

500|$|Bedrock composes {{much of the}} {{streambed}} in {{the upper}} and lower reaches of the Kootenay, but in the middle portion, alluvial sediments allow the river to meander over a broader valley floor. The sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during the previous Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards into present-day BC, Montana and Idaho, blocking the Kootenay River at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, which [...] did not yet exist. Glaciers covered most of the northern Kootenay River watershed and heavily shaped the peaks and valleys one sees today. The glacier that formed Kootenay Lake caused the river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched all the way to Libby, Montana, near where the Libby Dam now stands, and possibly even connected to Lake Pend Oreille, which also was much enlarged at the time. Glacially deposited sediments buried the old streambed of the Kootenay River and created a <b>natural</b> <b>dam</b> where the Kootenay turns west out of Kootenay Lake.
