5|$|The listed National Forest names {{represent}} the current management {{divisions of the}} National Forest System. Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny National Forest and Monongahela National Forest, are listed as separate forests. But forests that are managed together {{may or may not}} be listed separately. Forests managed together and with hyphenated names, such as Salmon-Challis National Forest, are considered to be a single National Forest. Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison <b>National</b> <b>Forests,</b> are considered to be separate forests. <b>National</b> <b>Forests</b> listed in this column in small text are constituent <b>National</b> <b>Forests</b> managed by, but not included in the name of, the named National Forest in normal text. If you are counting to reach 154 <b>National</b> <b>Forests,</b> count hyphenated names as two forests, with the exception of Manti-La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta-Wasatch-Cache is counted as three and George Washington and Jefferson is counted as two.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have {{national}} grasslands).

On maps, <b>national</b> <b>forests</b> in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually {{only a minority of}} the land is owned by the Forest Service.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, the Cascade Forest Reserve {{was divided}} into the Oregon <b>National</b> <b>Forest,</b> the Cascade <b>National</b> <b>Forest,</b> the Umpqua <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> and the Crater <b>National</b> <b>Forest.</b> In 1911, the Santiam <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> was created from parts of the Oregon <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> and the Cascade NF.

5|$|The United States has 154 {{protected}} areas known as <b>National</b> <b>Forests</b> covering 188,336,179 acres (762,169km2/294,275 sq. mi). The <b>National</b> <b>Forests</b> are {{managed by the}} U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first National Forest was established as the Yellowstone Park Timber and Land Reserve on March 30, 1891, then in the Department of the Interior. In 1897, the Organic Act provided purposes for which forest reserves could be established, including to protect the forest, secure water supplies, and supply timber. With the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the President of the United States was given the power to set aside forest reserves in the public domain.

5|$|The West Kootenay, however, is {{transitioning}} from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and {{the rest}} of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is becoming increasingly reliant on tourism, and several Canadian national and state parks have already been established, and several <b>national</b> <b>forests</b> in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including <b>national</b> <b>forests.</b> Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E

5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast {{and in the}} various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Fishing for salmon and steelhead, a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby <b>National</b> <b>Forests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest borders Yellowstone National Park and Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The Continental Divide demarks the {{boundary}} between Shoshone and Bridger-Teton <b>National</b> <b>Forests.</b> Along the Montana border, Shoshone National Forest borders Custer National Forest to the north. Private property, property belonging {{to the state of}} Wyoming and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management form the eastern boundaries. Lastly, the Wind River Indian Reservation also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herd numbers over 200,000 {{individuals}} {{and during the}} spring and fall, they {{take part in the}} longest elk migration in the continental U.S. Elk in the southern regions of Yellowstone National Park and in the surrounding <b>National</b> <b>Forests</b> migrate south towards the town of Jackson, Wyoming, where they winter for up to six months on the National Elk Refuge.

Many of the elk that reside in the northern sections of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in Montana, mainly to the north and west.|$|E

5|$|The park is {{bordered on}} the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, and the Flathead Provincial Forest and Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park in British Columbia.

The Blackfeet Indian Reservation provides most of the eastern boundary. The Lewis and Clark and the Flathead <b>National</b> <b>Forests</b> form the southern and western boundary. The remote Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located in the two forests immediately to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding <b>national</b> <b>forests</b> did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E

5|$|The {{terrain is}} level enough, and the ridge broad enough, {{to allow for}} a 500-foot (150 m) parking lot along the south side of Highway 82 at the height of land.
