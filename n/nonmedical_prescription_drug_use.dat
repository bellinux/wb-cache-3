40|$|Background: <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (NMPDU) {{refers to}} the {{self-treatment}} of a medical condition using medication without a prescriber’s authorization as well as use to achieve euphoric states. This article reports data from a cross-national investigation of NMPDU in five European Countries, with the aim to understand the prevalence and characteristics of those engaging in NMPDU across the EU. Methods: A parallel series of self-administered, cross-sectional, general population surveys were conducted in 2014. Data were collected using multi-stage quota sampling and then weighted using General Exponential Model. A total of 22, 070 non-institutionalized participants, aged 12 to 49 years, in 5 countries: Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, and Sweden.

40|$|This study {{described}} the prevalence and {{risk factors for}} <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (NMPD) among injection drug users (IDUs) recruited at syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in California. Interviews were conducted with 1, 586 IDUs recruited from 24 SEPs across three an-nual cross-sections between 2001 and 2003. Any NMPD use in the past 6 months was reported by 17 % of the sample. Factors independently associated with depressant use include recent participation in a drug treatment program, recent injection of heroin, and frequency of injection. Factors independently associated with opioid use include frequency of injection and history of incarceration. NMPD depressant use increased {{the odds of a}} nonfatal overdose in the past year. The authors ’ findings represent a first step toward creating an epidemiologic profile of NMPD use that may be useful for targeting the implementation of interventions that are effective in reducing overdoses, a significant cause of mortality among IDUs worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Obesity and {{substance}} use are major concern in young people. This study explored the bidirectional longitudinal relationships between the body mass index (BMI) {{of young men and}} their use of (1) 4 classes of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs; (2) alcohol; (3) tobacco; and (4) cannabis. Baseline and follow-up data from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors were used (N = 5007). A cross-lagged panel model, complemented by probit models as sensitivity analysis, was run to determine the bidirectional relationships between BMI {{and substance}} use. Alcohol was assessed using risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD); tobacco, using daily smoking; and cannabis, using hazardous cannabis use (defined as twice-weekly or more cannabis <b>use).</b> <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> (NMPDU) included opioid analgesics, sedatives/sleeping pills, anxiolytics, and stimulants. Different associations were found between BMI {{and substance use}}. Only RSOD (β = -. 053, P =. 005) and NMPDU of anxiolytics (β =. 040, P =. 020) at baseline significantly predicted BMI at follow-up. Baseline RSOD predicted a lower BMI at follow-up, whereas baseline NMPDU of anxiolytics predicted higher BMI at follow-up. Furthermore, BMI at baseline significantly predicted daily smoking (β =. 050, P =. 007) and hazardous cannabis use (β =. 058, P =. 030). These results suggest different associations between BMI and the use of various substances by young men. However, only RSOD and NMPDU of anxiolytics predicted BMI, whereas BMI predicted daily smoking and hazardous cannabis use...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> (NMPD) <b>use</b> is a {{well-documented}} problem {{among college}} students, but {{few studies have}} examined nursing students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes regarding NMPD. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare nursing and non-nursing students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes, risk factors, and current substance use. This descriptive, comparative design utilized a convenience sampling and social media to reach students over 18 years of age and enrolled in a Midwestern university. Twenty-nine students, 14 non-nursing and 15 nursing students, participated in this online survey. Substance use attitudes were measured <b>using</b> the <b>Drug</b> Attitude Scale (DAS). Risk factors for substance use were used as demographic questions and current <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> was measured <b>using</b> the <b>Drug</b> Abuse Screening Tool (DAST). Logistic regression (Chi-Square/Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact) analyses were used to observe the association between risk factors for substance abuse and nursing/non-nursing students. Additionally, a Simple Linear Regression (Two-Sample T-tests) was used to assess the relationship between DAS and DAST scores between nursing/non-nursing students. Prior to discussing the results of the statistical tests, descriptive statistics of the demographic variables of the participants are presented. Data analysis revealed no significant difference in attitude, risk factors, and substance use among nursing students and non-nursing students. Limitations included the low number of participants and access to students via social media only.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> (NMPD) <b>use</b> {{continues to increase}} among emerging adult populations; however, {{little is known about}} the motivations behind this use. The current study aimed to extend previous research by developing and validating the first known comprehensive NMPD motives measure. As such, the primary focus of the current study was to examine evidence for the reliability and validity of the NMPD Motives Questionnaire by assessing the factor structure, internal consistency, and construct validity of the motives scale. Participants were drawn from a larger study of college student substance use behaviors and attitudes (N = 1, 427; Mage= 19. 8; 65 % female; 48. 5 % White Non-Hispanic) from two public universities in the United States. From the larger sample, 423 individuals (Mage= 19. 9; 62 % female; 53 % White Non-Hispanic) reported lifetime NMPD use and thus were included in the final study sample. Participants completed online self-report questionnaires, including the NMPD Motives Questionnaire. Following data reduction procedures, the final measure included 20 -items in which respondents indicated reasons they use NMPDs on a scale of 1 (Almost Never/Never) to 5 (Almost Always/Always). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a four-factor model of NMPD motives; including: Social/recreation, performance, conformity, and self-medication. Results of the current study suggest the overall scale and each of the four subscales of the NMPD Motives Questionnaire demonstrate good to excellent internal consistency, providing evidence for reliability. Moreover, results also suggest strong convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity of the developed NMPD motives measure. Similar to patterns observed for other types of substance use, Social/recreation, performance, and self-medication motives for NMPD use were found to be significant positive predictors of the frequency of past 6 -month NMPD use, after controlling for relevant covariates. Moreover, findings suggest self-medication NMPD motives significantly predict NMPD-related problems after controlling for use. These findings support incremental validity of the developed measure. Taken together, results of this study support the NMPD Motives Questionnaire as a potentially psychometrically sound instrument for measuring motives for NMPD use...|$|R

Objectives: The aim {{of the present study}} was to report {{correlates}} of and compare different subtypes of NMPDU in the Swedish general population. Methods: Data were drawn from a Swedish national household survey conducted in 2008 - 2009. A stratified sample of 58, 000 individuals aged 15 to 64 was randomly selected, with a response rate of 38. 3 %. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to compare sociodemographic, substance use, and health correlates of nonmedical analgesic use, nonmedical sedative use, and combined nonmedical use of these two types of prescription drugs. Results: In the final logistic regression model, all three patterns of NMPDU were equally associated with female gender, hazardous alcohol use, habitual smoking and cannabis use, but there were several significant differences in other demographic, health, and drug use correlates between the groups.

This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with NMPDU for drug classes insufficiently described in opioid-dependent populations, including antihistaminergic anxiolytics and central stimulants. Methods. Study participants were recruited at two OMT clinics in Malmo, Sweden, between October 2014 and December 2015 () and interviewed about their use, motivations for use, and acquisition and administration of prescription drugs. Results. The majority of the sample reported lifetime NMPDU: 60 % for benzodiazepine-like hypnotics (z-drugs), 21 % for pregabalin, 19 % for stimulants, and 12 %– 15 % for antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Lower age was associated with nonmedical benzodiazepine use (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0. 89; 95 % Confidence Interval = 0. 82 – 0. 97). Illicit acquisition was reported by 61 % of people using z-drugs, 46 % of people using pregabalin, and 38 % of people using prescription stimulants, but only by 6 – 10 % of people using antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Conclusions. The substantial nonmedical use of pregabalin, z-drugs, and prescription stimulants {{found in this study}} suggests that clinicians should prescribe these drugs with great caution.

40|$|Background Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} the demographic and behavioral characteristics of {{nonmedical prescription drug}} users (NMPDUs) entering substance abuse treatment settings, and information on the HIV-related risk profiles of NMPDUs is especially lacking. Participation in substance abuse treatment provides a critical opportunity for HIV prevention and intervention, but successful initiatives will require services appropriately tailored {{for the needs of}} NMPDUs. Methods This paper compares the HIV risk profiles of NMPDUs in public (n[*]=[*] 246) and private (n[*]=[*] 249) treatment facilities. Participants included in the analysis reported five or more recent episodes of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> a prior HIV negative test result, and current enrollment in a substance abuse treatment facility. A standardized questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers with questions about demographics, HIV risk, and substance use. Results Private treatment clients {{were more likely to be}} non-Hispanic White, younger, and opioid and heroin users. Injection drug use was higher among private treatment clients, whereas public clients reported higher likelihood of trading or selling sex. Public treatment clients reported higher rates of HIV testing and availability at their treatment facilities compared to private clients. Conclusions Findings suggest differing demographics, substance use patterns, profiles of HIV risk and access to HIV testing between the two treatment samples.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in prescription drug abuse, particularly among adolescents and young adults. While substance abuse on college campuses has remained a pervasive public health concern, rates of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> surpass commonly abused drugs. The three most commonly abused prescription drugs (central nervous system (CNS) depressants, opioids, and stimulants) were assessed to identify differences among student characteristics, as well as their relationship with abuse. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to conduct a secondary analysis to explore demographic variables (race, gender, academic performance, living arrangement, alcohol and other drug usage, and affiliation with a fraternity/sorority) and their relationship with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Also, this study aims to identify potential strategies and provide suggestions to address nonmedical prescription drug abuse for future interventions. Methods: Data was obtained from the 2009 National College Health Assessment. The study consisted of n = 1, 417 undergraduate students attending Virginia Commonwealth University. Initially, overall prevalence rates for past-year illicit use of prescription CNS depressant, opioids, and stimulant use were examined. Bivariate analyses were conducted to identify differences among users and nonusers for each class of prescription drug using Pearson’s Chi-Square test of significance. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine associations between these demographics and illicit use of each prescription drug. Interactions between individual demographics and drug use were also examined. Results: The past year prevalence use of nonmedical prescription central nervous system depressants, opioids, and stimulants use were 4, 11. 2, and 8. 7 % respectively. According to bivariate analyses, nonmedical use was higher among certain college students, however characteristics varied by type of prescription drug. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that students living off campus (OR = 2. 12, 95 % CI = 1. 03, 4. 35) and reported use of alcohol (OR = 3. 91, 95 % CI = 1. 21, 12. 64) and marijuana (OR = 4. 41, 95 % CI = 2. 28, 8. 54) were more likely to use prescription depressants. Students with a GPA of a C or lower (OR = 1. 50, 95 % CI = 1. 03, 2. 17), and reported use of marijuana (OR = 3. 25, 95 % CI = 2. 22, 4. 78) were more likely to use prescription opioids. Nonmedical prescription stimulant use was highest among White students (OR = 2. 02, 95 % CI = 1. 28, 3. 30) with a GPA of a B or lower (OR = 2. 06, 95 % CI = 1. 28, 3. 30) and reported lifetime use of alcohol (OR = 7. 96, 95 % CI = (2. 50, 25. 41). Conclusions: The results of this study provide insight into the demographic variables and their relationship with nonmedical prescription drug abuse.

40|$|To {{account for}} {{potential}} selection {{factors in the}} observed relationship between Medicare Part D coverage and <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> this study uses data from the 2010 and 2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to first examine the determinants of Medicare Part D enrollment, paying {{particular attention to the}} role of functional health status on the enrollment decision. Next, the study assesses whether and to what extent Medicare Part D coverage moderates the effect of functional health status on <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and monthly out-of-pocket spending among older adults. As prior studies indicate, the findings reveal that individuals who take up Medicare Part D have poorer (functional) health relative to nonparticipants, and thus, exhibit greater demand for <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Taking functional health status into account, Medicare Part D coverage is significantly associated with greater <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> among those with few health limitations, and is also significantly associated with greater out-of-pocket spending among those with the most health limitations. Thus, while prior studies have compared Medicare eligible- to non-eligible individuals to find that Medicare Part D coverage significantly lowers out-of pocket costs, and therefore, increases <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> this study compared Medicare Part D enrollees to eligible non-enrollees to generate findings that imply that the presumed effect of Medicare Part D coverage on <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> may be spurious.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (NMPDU) of six drug classes and health. METHODS: Data on young adults males (mean age, 19. 96  years) from the baseline and follow-up of the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF) were used (n = 4, 958). Two sets of logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations between NMPDU of opioid analgesics, sedatives or sleeping pills, anxiolytics, antidepressants, beta blockers and stimulants, and health status (assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 12 -Item Short Form Survey Instrument [SF- 12 v 2]). We first computed odds ratios between NMPDU at baseline and poor mental and physical health at follow-up, adjusting for poor mental or physical health at baseline. We then computed odds ratios between poor mental and physical health at baseline and NMPDU at follow-up, adjusting for NMPDU at baseline. RESULTS: Three key findings regarding mental health were (1) there was a reciprocal risk between poor mental health and sedatives and anxiolytics; (2) poor mental health increased NMPDU of opioid analgesics and antidepressants but not vice versa; and (3) there were no associations with stimulants. Three key findings regarding physical health were (1) poor physical health increased the risk of NMPDU of anxiolytics; (2) the only reciprocal risk was between physical health and NMPDU of opioid analgesics; and (3) there were no associations with stimulants. CONCLUSION: These results, among the first ever on reciprocal effects between NMPDU and mental and physical health status, give unique information concerning the adverse effects of NMPDU on health and vice versa.

40|$|Background Evidence {{from the}} United States and Europe {{suggests}} that the <b>use</b> of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> may vary by ethnicity. In Canada, ethnic disparities in <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> have not been as well documented as disparities {{in the use of}} medical and hospital care. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey and administrative data to examine needs-adjusted rates of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> by people of different ethnic groups. Methods For 19 370 non-Aboriginal people living in urban areas of British Columbia, we linked data on self-identified ethnicity from the Canadian Community Health Survey with administrative data describing all filled prescriptions and use of medical services in 2005. We used sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression analysis to measure differences in the likelihood of filling <b>prescriptions</b> by <b>drug</b> class (antihypertensives, oral antibiotics, antidepressants, statins, respiratory drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Models were adjusted for age, general health status, treatment-specific health status, socio-economic factors and recent immigration (within 10 years). Results We found evidence of significant needs-adjusted variation in <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> by ethnicity. Compared with women and men who identified themselves as white, those who were South Asian or of mixed ethnicity were almost as likely to fill prescriptions for most types of medicines studied; moreover, South Asian men were more likely than white men to fill prescriptions for antibiotics and NSAIDs. The clearest pattern of use emerged among Chinese participants: Chinese women were significantly less likely to fill prescriptions for antihypertensives, antibiotics, antidepressants and respiratory drugs, and Chinese men for antidepressant drugs and statins. Interpretation We found some disparities in <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in the study population according to ethnic group. The nature of some of these variations suggest that ethnic differences in beliefs about pharmaceuticals may generate differences in <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use; other variations suggest that there may be clinically important disparities in treatment use...|$|R

As new drugs are introduced and new <b>uses</b> for old <b>drugs</b> are found, more patients can have improved health and quality of life with the appropriate <b>use</b> of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Current <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> patterns need to be better understood.

40|$|Lifetime {{prevalence}} {{estimates of}} psychotropic medicine use {{as well as}} prevalence of DSM-IV <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> disorders from the baseline investigation of the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) Study are presented. Use of prescription medication {{at some time in}} their life was reported by 27. 4 % of the respondents. Illicit <b>use</b> of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> which means an intake without medical legitimation, was reported by 4. 5 % of the sample. The findings suggest that abuse of and dependence on <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> with most cases reporting polysubstance use, is quite rare in the 14 - to 24 -year-olds. DSM-IV abuse was more prevalent than dependence (0. 5 vs. 0. 3 %). In general, women reported higher prevalence rates of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> whereas men reported higher prevalence rates of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> disorders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the role of principle economic, sociodemographic and health status factors in determining the likelihood and volume of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Econometric demand regression models were developed for this purpose. Ten explanatory variables were examined: family income, coinsurance rate, age, sex, race, household head education level, size of family, health status, number of medical visits, and type of provider seen during medical visits. The economic factors (family income and coinsurance) were given special emphasis in this study. ^ The National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES) was the data source. The sample represented the civilian, noninstitutionalized residents of the United States in 1980. The sample method used in the survey was a stratified four-stage, area probability design. The sample was comprised of 6, 600 households (17, 123 individuals). The weighted sample provided the population estimates used in the analysis. Five repeated interviews were conducted with each household. The household survey provided detailed information on the United States health status, pattern of health care utilization, charges for services received, and methods of payments for 1980. ^ The study provided evidence that economic factors influenced the <b>use</b> of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> but the <b>use</b> was not highly responsive to family income and coinsurance for the levels examined. The elasticities for family income ranged from -. 0002 to -. 013 and coinsurance ranged from -. 174 to -. 108. Income has a greater influence on the likelihood of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> and coinsurance rates had an impact on the amount spent on <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> The coinsurance effect was not examined for the likelihood of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> due to limitations in the measurement of coinsurance. Health status appeared to overwhelm any effects which may be attributed to family income or coinsurance. The likelihood of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> was highly dependent on visits to medical providers. The volume of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> was highly dependent on the health status, age, and whether or not the individual saw a general practitioner. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Sociology, Washington State UniversityNational surveys on {{substance}} use {{indicate that the}} prevalence of non-medical <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is now greater than the prevalence of illicit drugs other than marijuana (National Survey on <b>Drug</b> <b>Use</b> and Health 2008). Of the persons misusing <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> young adults, aged 18 - 25 report the highest prevalence of misuse, with males and females misusing these drugs at comparable rates. This absence of a gender-gap in the misuse of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> runs counter to data on the misuse and abuse of illicit drugs (e. g., cocaine, ecstasy and heroin) and on problem alcohol use which indicate that men use and abuse these substances {{at a much higher}} rate than women. Studies on <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> also indicate that being a college student is a risk factor for <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse and misuse and show that on the most "prescription prone" college campuses 1 in 4 students are misusing <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> (McCabe, Boyd, and Teter, 2006). This study provides an in-depth analysis of college men's and women's opportunities, motivations and justifications for non-medical <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Qualitative methodological techniques were used in the form of semi-structured, open-ended interviews with individuals 18 - 25 years of age attending a large, public University in the Northwest. The analyses are informed by social learning, sub-cultural, and gendered theories of offending that emphasize the importance of learned motives and techniques of acquiring and appropriately <b>using</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Gender similarities and differences in key aspects of the "context of offending" are also identified including reasons for <b>using</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> opportunities and methods for obtaining these drugs and diversion efforts.

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in medical {{practice in the}} United States has grown with the availability of new drugs to treat major diseases, including common chronic conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, and depression. As a result, <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and spending have increased. Spending on retail <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> in the United States more than tripled from $ 15. 0 billion in 1982 to $ 48. 2 billion in 1992, then more than tripled again to $ 162. 4 billion in 2002. In per capita terms, retail <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> spending increased from $ 64 in 1982 to $ 569 in 2002. As a proportion of national health expenditures, retail <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> spending more than doubled from 4. 7 percent in 1982 to 10. 5 percent in 2002. by Margie R. Goulding.

40|$|Medication use was {{assessed}} {{in a population}} of 4186 women who were delivered of infants at Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, between 1980 and 1982. The frequency of over-the-counter and <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> and the association of such use with maternal characteristics was studied. Of all women, 66 % used at least one drug. The mean number of <b>drugs</b> <b>used</b> by all subjects was 1. 3 and, among drug users, 2. 9. Of all <b>drugs</b> <b>used,</b> 68 % were over-the-counter and 32 % were prescription preparations. Internal analgesics, autonomic drugs, antiinfective agents, and antacids were most frequently used. Women who <b>used</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> {{were also more likely}} to use over-the-counter medications. Maternal characteristics that were associated with an increase in both over-the-counter and <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> were being white, smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day, using alcohol, using caffeine, and smoking marijuana. These findings suggest that women who engage in "risk-taking behavior" during pregnancy are also more likely to use medications while pregnan...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} trends, patterns, and {{determinants of}} <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods This is a retrospective, population-based study {{of all women}} who gave birth between Janu-ary 2002 and 31 December 2011 in British Columbia, Canada. Study population consisted of 225, 973 women who had 322, 219 pregnancies. We examined administrative datasets containing person-specific information on filled prescriptions, hospitalizations, and medical services.
