40|$|A theorem {{obtained}} by van Benthem for preservation of formulas under Chu transforms between Chu spaces is strengthened and {{derived from a}} general many-sorted interpolation theorem. The latter has been established both by proof-theoretic and model-theoretic methods; there is some discussion as to how these methods compare and what languages they apply to. In the conclusion, several further questions are raised. Dear Johan, Here, for the record, are some results and ideas {{that came out of}} your stimulating presentation to our logic seminar at Stanford last May, "Information transfer across Chu spaces" [B]. Let me begin by recalling some definitions from <b>your</b> <b>notes</b> and <b>your</b> results <b>concerning</b> them. A Chu space is any structure (A, X,R) with two basic (non-empty) domains A and X and a relation R # AX. The paradigm example is given by A = a set of objects, X = a collection of subsets of A and R = the # relation. A Chu transform between two Chu spaces (A, X,R) and (B, Y, S) is a pai [...] ...|$|R
