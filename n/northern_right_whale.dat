5|$|The North Pacific {{right whale}} appears {{to occur in}} two {{population}}s. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very {{little is known about}} this population. Thus, the two <b>northern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, so as {{to protect}} <b>northern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> from serious injury or {{mortality}} from entanglement in gillnet gear in their calving area in Atlantic Ocean waters off the southeast United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) revised regulations implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP).

40|$|Risk {{assessments}} are an essential aspect of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) {{which must be}} completed by Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) developers. This thesis aims to provide a risk assessment {{in the form of}} a GIS tool which suggests the relative vulnerability of 12 cetacean species found in UK waters to 12 types of MRE devices, including those for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy extraction. This has ultimately been completed from assessing the vulnerability of cetaceans by compiling a biological vulnerability and species importance rating, and with baseline sighting data, to determine vulnerability based on location. The vulnerability has then been assessed using a device impact rating. The results and resultant maps produced from the risk assessment suggest that; 1. The MRE devices likely to be most impacting to cetaceans are offshore wind turbines, followed by tidal stream devices. Tidal barrages are likely to be least impacting to cetaceans. 2. The species/ device interactions which have the potential to be most impacting include sei <b>whales,</b> <b>northern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and fin whales with offshore wind turbines, whilst the interaction with least impact is that of the humpback whale with tidal barrages and tidal lagoons. 3. Cetacean/device vulnerability maps for different cetaceans can be descriptively classified into 3 situations; cetaceans which have high vulnerability in specific locations, such as the sei, fin and <b>northern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> cetaceans which have widespread moderately high vulnerability, such as dolphin species, harbour porpoise and minke whale, or species which have a widespread low vulnerability, such as the humpback whale. The risk assessment also suggests that cumulative impacts need to be assessed, how improvement can be achieved to allow for quantitative assessment and how mitigation measures can be implemented to reduce potential impacts until quantitative impact data in this sector is researched...|$|R

We conclude in Chapter Four that it will be valuable to investigate future trends in climate variability in the Mediterranean to determine whether the recent leveling-off of temperatures represents a brief respite from a persistent warming or a new direction for the Mediterranean. Current conservation oceanography efforts should take into consideration the relationship between the whales and the variabilities of their food sources, and should attempt to maintain mortality rates as low as possible, if we are to save the <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> population from extinction.

40|$|Lampreys {{have long}} been {{thought to be a}} {{cetacean}} ectoparasite, due to the observation of round marks on the skin of whales caught during whaling operations. Pike (1951), Nemoto (1955), and van Utrecht (1959) compared such marks on the skin of various cetacean species caught in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with the dentition of lampreys and concluded that most round marks had been caused by this parasite. However, lampreys were never collected from captured whales and, {{due to the lack of}} direct evidence, some discussion emerged as to the origin of these wounds. Jones (1971) later argued that crescent-shaped marks previously attributed to lampreys were in fact caused by cookie-cutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis). However, he agreed that other round marks were undoubtedly caused by lampreys.

40|$|Abstract—Definitive {{studies on}} the {{response}} of marine mam-mals to anthropogenic sound are hampered by the short surface time and deep-diving lifestyle of many species. A novel archival tag, called the DTAG, has been developed to monitor the behavior of marine mammals, and their response to sound, continuously throughout the dive cycle. The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orienta-tion of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 <b>northern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment.
