40|$|Summary: The Leading Economic Indicator – Nebraska (LEI-N) fell by. 75 % during July 2014. The {{decline in}} the LEI-N, which predicts {{economic}} growth in the state <b>six</b> <b>months</b> in the future, is the first in <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> The decline suggests that economic growth may slow in Nebraska in early 2015 after strong growth {{in the second half of}} 2014. Three components contributed to the {{decline in the}} leading economic indicator in July. There was a decline in manufacturing hours and in single-family building permits during the month. There also was an increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance during July. Among positive components, business expectations remained positive in Nebraska for the sixth consecutive month. In particular, July respondents to the Survey of Nebraska Business predicted an increase in both sales and employment at their business over the <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>month.</b> There also was a modest decline in the value of the U.

40|$|The Leading Economic Indicator – Nebraska (LEI-N) {{declined}} by 0. 07 % during March 2014. The slight {{decline in the}} LEI-N, which predicts {{economic growth in the}} state <b>six</b> <b>months</b> in the future, followed a solid increase in February. Together, results for the two months are consistent with moderate growth in the Nebraska economy during the summer of 2014. Among the components of the leading economic indicator, there was an increase in initial unemployent claims, suggesting a weakening of labor market conditions. At the same time, there was solid improvement in business expectations. Specifically, respondents to the Survey of Nebraska Business predicted an increase in sales and employment at their business over the <b>next</b> <b>six</b> <b>month.</b> Finally, there was little contribution from the remaining four indicator components.
