2500|$|The {{cationic}} 2-aza-Cope rearrangement, most properly {{called the}} 2-azonia--sigmatropic rearrangement, has been thoroughly studied by Larry E. Overman and coworkers. [...] It {{is the most}} extensively studied of the aza-Cope rearrangements due to the mild conditions required to carry the arrangement out, {{as well as for}} its many synthetic applications, notably in alkaloid synthesis. [...] Thermodynamically, the general 2-aza-Cope rearrangement does not have a product bias, as the bonds broken and formed are equivalent in either direction of the reaction, similar to the Cope rearrangement. [...] The presence of the ionic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatom</b> accounts for the more facile rearrangement of the cationic 2-aza-Cope rearrangement [...] in comparison to the Cope rearrangement. Hence, it is often paired with a thermodynamic sink to bias a rearrangement product.|$|E

The results of this work led to the following trends and conclusions: (a) At low concentrations, 2, 5 -dihydroxythiophenol (DHT) chemisorbs on a Pd surface through both diphenolic ring and thiol group. At high concentrations, it chemisorbs only through the thiol group. (b) There is extensive intermolecular attraction between the co-adsorbed thiolated quinone and thiolated hydroquinone molecules. The interaction occurs through the Pd substrate and not through space. (c) The chemisorption properties of Nheteroaromatic compounds are pH-dependent. When the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatom</b> is protonated, it becomes very weakly surface-active. When the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatom</b> is deprotonated, surface activity stronger than the diphenolic ring is exhibited.

40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of chemosensor associated with fluoroionophore has attracted great attention. Fluoro-ionophore 1 - 9 is a compound combining the ionophore and fluorophore, where ionophore binds selectively with a specific ion and fluorophore generates a fluorescence signal upon ion binding. Depending {{on the nature of}} fluorophore-ionophore interaction in fluoroionophore, fluorescence properties of fluorophore such as fluorescence intensity or fluorescence wavelength maximum may be influenced by ion capture of ionophore. 1 - 9 Sensitivity of fluorophore may be associated with the ionic recognition ability of the ionophore, if the fluorophore may be perturbed by the coordination of cation. The recent increase of interest in the synthesis of crown ether derivatives incorporating different fluoroionophores is recently due to their application as alkali metal ion sensors in biochemical analysis and medical diagnostics. In particular, azacrown ether, a typical ionophore, acts as an electron-rich donor as well as a ligand of the cation. The electron pair on the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatom</b> in electron-rich azacrown ether could be transferred towards electron deficient fluorophore in a π-conjugated D-A arrangement, through the charge transfer interaction between ionophore, an electron donor, and fluorophore, an electron acceptor. 10 - 17 The efficient intramolecular charge transfer takes part in the modification of the first electronic transition state of the fluorophore and may lead to weaken the fluorescence from fluorophore. Upon binding of a cation into ionophore cavity, the electron pair on <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatom</b> of ionophore is stabilized and the intramolecular charge transfer is inhibited. Therefore, the original electronic configuration of the unsubstituted fluorophore is recovered, so that fluorescence may be strengthened. Many fluoroionophores including stilbenyl-...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{bacterial}} enrichments {{have been developed for}} their ability to utilize nitrogen and sulfur in coal liquids and the model compound naphtha. These bacteria include the original aerobic bacteria isolated from natural sources which utilize heteroatom compounds in the presence of rich media, aerobic nitrogen-utilizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria. The most promising isolates include Mix M, a mixture of aerobic bacteria; ER 15, a pyridine-utilizing isolate; ERI 6, an aniline-utilizing isolate and a sewage sludge isolate. Culture optimization experiments have led to these bacteria being able to remove up to 40 percent of the sulfur and nitrogen in naphtha and coal liquids in batch culture. Continuous culture experiments showed that the coal liquid is too toxic to the bacteria to be fed without dilution or extraction. Thus either semi-batch operation must be employed with continuous gas sparging into a batch of liquid, or acid extracted coal liquid must be employed in continuous reactor studies with continuous liquid flow. Isolate EN- 1, a chemical waste isolate, removed 27 percent of the sulfur and 19 percent of the nitrogen in fed batch experiments. Isolate ERI 5 removed 28 percent of the nitrogen in coal liquid in 10 days in fed batch culture. The sewage sludge isolate removed 22. 5 percent of the sulfur and 6. 5 percent of the nitrogen from extracted coal liquid in continuous culture, and Mix M removed 17. 5 percent of the nitrogen from medium containing extracted coal liquid.

Under the former conditions, more than 85 % of the parent substrate (340 μM) was removed from nonsterile incubations in 30 days, following a 50 -day acclimation period. Concomitant with substrate decay, an intermediate transiently accumulated in the sediment slurries.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance evidence suggested that a chlorine was reductively removed from the parent substrate at the position meta to the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatom.</b> Upon continued incubation, the dechlorinated product was transformed into an unidentified compound which accumulated and resisted further decay.

In this method, polystyrene-grafted GO was synthesized by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) {{to make it}} dispersible in an organic solvent, benzene [40]. This dispersion was drop-cast onto substrates under humid air flow, resulting in flexible macroporous modified GO films. This method demonstrated that the pore size could be controlled by simply altering the concentration of the precursor solution along with the polymer chain lengths on the surfaces of the GO sheet. By increasing the concentration of polystyrene-grafted GO dispersion, {{they were able to}} decrease the pore size from 4 to 1  μm [40].

The yield of the radiative pathway is generally reduced with respect to the corresponding hydrocarbons, due to a smaller energy barrier for trans→cis (E→Z) photoisomerization in the singlet state, which often can be slightly favoured in the aza-compounds. All compounds investigated exist in solution as mixtures of two or more conformers, which can have different spectral and kinetic properties. Attempts to separate the intrinsic properties by selective photoexcitation, at a wavelength where the light is mainly absorbed by one conformer, allowed in some favourable cases the spectra and decay times of the largely prevalent (quasi-pure) conformer to be obtained. In two cases, the formation of intramolecular (hydrogen-bond-type) interactions between the nitrogen atom and the nearest hydrogen atom of the ethene bridge (proved by NMR measurements and confirmed by theoretical calculations) were found to stabilize a specific conformer thus affecting a selective relaxation of the excited molecule. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

Thus, the technology combining the one-pot approach with the template process to obtain the yolk-like structured nanomaterials was highly desired by the scientist. Recently, the extension of the Stöber method for the synthesis of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) polymer nanospheres opens a novel pathway for synthetic strategies in the facile preparation of RF based core-shell and core@carbon yolk shell nanospheres. For example, Fuertes and coworkers reported a one-step Stöber method to synthesize RF@silica and carbon capsule structures [13]. Furthermore, Liu et al. reported one-step Stöber approach to produce uniform Au(Ag)-silica-polymer spheres with a core-shell-shell structure as templates for Au(Ag)@void@C yolk-shell nanostructures [14, 15]. Shao synthesized the magnetic rattle-type carbon nanospheres using the similar strategy [16]. These greatly widen the application of the RF Stöber method.

Moreover, the strongly carcinogenic phenol/formaldehyde would do harm both to humans and the environment.

From the viewpoint of electronic theories of aromatics, the sulfur heteroatom is con-sidered to be equivalent to a =CH=CH- group in the appropriate ring. co ceo t!i (XX...|$|E
40|$|New chiral diamines were prepared, {{based on}} the {{cyclohexane}} diamine core. The two different substituents on each <b>nitrogen</b> allow this <b>heteroatom</b> to become a stereogenic center upon chelation with a metal, such as lithium. The enantioselective addition of MeLi to imines, with ee's up to 68 %, illustrates the validity of this concept...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Thirty phosphane ligands were {{prepared}} and characterized. Aryl {{groups of the}} phosphane ligands were modified through change in functionality. The side chains were the following: trifluoromethylphenyl, selenomethylphenyl, 9 -anthryl, alkyl-substituted aryl groups, and pyridyl and alkyl groups. In addition, three chromium carbonyl complexes of potentially bidentate arylphosphanes containing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatoms</b> {{were prepared}} and characterized. Characterization of the isolated complexes verified the monodentate coordination from phosphorus and two bidentate coordination modes, (P,N) -bound and (N,N') -bound. Ligands and complexes were characterized by 1 H, 13 C{ 1 H}, 31 P{ 1 H}, and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. The 13 C{ 1 H} and 31 P{ 1 H} NMR spectra, and calculated cone angles of the o-alkyl-substituted aryl- and arylalkylphosphane ligands provided valuable parameters, which could be plotted against catalytic results {{in the search for}} correlations between the structures and catalytic behavior of ligands. Correlations were found between the parameters and the catalytic behavior of Rh-catalysts modified with the o-alkyl-substituted phenylphosphanes. The research reported here was directed toward the preparation and characterization of phosphane ligands which would favor the formation of isobutanal in propene hydroformylation. The o-alkyl-substituted arylphosphanes, which were studied most throughly, gave the highest selectivity to isobutanal but at the cost of activity. Linear n-butanal was still the main product, though only barely. Alkyl substituents in meta position increased the activity of propene hydroformylation even up to the level with the reference ligand PPh 3, but, the selectivity decreased simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{general theory of}} {{electron}} [...] hole recombination in {{organic light emitting diodes}} that leads to formation of emissive singlet excitons and nonemissive triplet excitons. We briefly review other existing theories and show how our approach is substantively different from these theories. Using an exact time-dependent approach to the interchain/intermolecular charge-transfer within a long-range interacting model we find that, (i) the relative yield of the singlet exciton in polymers is considerably larger than the 25 % predicted from statistical considerations, (ii) the singlet exciton yield increases with chain length in oligomers, and, (iii) in small molecules containing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>heteroatoms,</b> the relative yield of the singlet exciton is considerably smaller and may be even close to 25 %. The above results are independent {{of whether or not the}} bond-charge repulsion, X_perp, is included in the interchain part of the Hamiltonian for the two-chain system. The larger (smaller) yield of the singlet (triplet) exciton in carbon-based long-chain polymers is a consequence of both its ionic (covalent) nature and smaller (larger) binding energy. In nitrogen containing monomers, wavefunctions are closer to the noninteracting limit, and this decreases (increases) the relative yield of the singlet (triplet) exciton. Our results are in qualitative agreement with electroluminescence experiments involving both molecular and polymeric light emitters. The time-dependent approach developed here for describing intermolecular charge-transfer processes is completely general and may be applied to many other such processes.
