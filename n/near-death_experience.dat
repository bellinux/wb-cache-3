5|$|In this episode, the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has a <b>near-death</b> <b>experience</b> and {{is sent to}} the Klingon {{version of}} Hell known as Gre'thor. There she {{encounters}} her Klingon mother Miral (Karen Austin), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own identity as a Klingon.

5|$|For {{several years}} on the series, a {{defining}} characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped {{him when he was}} fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a <b>near-death</b> <b>experience</b> and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked {{in front of him and}} pleading with him to make love to her, he rejects her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm.|$|E

5|$|Raghuveer {{discovers that}} Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior. He murders Indu's father and frames Harsha, causing Indu to hate Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha tries {{to catch them}} but fails; falling into a lake, he faces a <b>near-death</b> <b>experience</b> and learns about his past life in 1609. In that year, Emperor Sher Khan is {{preparing}} to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha), commander of the Udayghad army. King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back. Her cousin, Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in battle, {{and he does not}} wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhirava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.|$|E
5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the <b>near-death</b> <b>experience</b> and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E
5|$|Ofuji was {{responsible}} for creating the basic scenario from which Brotherhoods main writers would work: working from the character sheets created by the writers of Final Fantasy XV, he created the entire scenario based on each character's background characteristics, such as Ignis' love of baking and Prompto's childhood obesity. The anime focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and includes interpersonal scenes {{that could not be}} included in the game. Its storyline details the backstory of Noctis from his childhood to the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes tie directly into the events of , a free tech demo showing Noctis' journey through a dreamworld during a <b>near-death</b> <b>experience.</b> The anime also serves as an introduction for potential players to the characters. In previous Final Fantasy games, the player party was built up gradually {{over the course of the}} game. In Final Fantasy XV, the complete party will be available from the start, and since the backstory moments could not be fitted into the game, the anime serves as a similar means of allowing players to sympathize with them. Each episode's event also helped detail some of the characters' different social classes, with the cited example being the contrast between Prompto's small house and hard-working parents when compared to Gladiolus' more luxurious life.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their <b>near-death</b> <b>experience.</b> The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends.

5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her <b>near-death</b> <b>experience,</b> but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E

5000|$|The 1980s also {{introduced}} {{the research of}} Melvin Morse, another profile {{in the field of}} near-death studies. Morse and colleagues investigated <b>near-death</b> <b>experiences</b> in a pediatric population. They found that children reported NDE's that were similar to those described by adults. Morse later published two books, co-authored with Paul Perry, that were aimed at a general audience: Closer to the light: learning from children’s <b>near-death</b> <b>experiences</b> (1990) [...] and Transformed by the light: the powerful effect of <b>near-death</b> <b>experiences</b> on people’s lives (1992). Another early contribution to the field was the research of British Neuro-psychiatrist Peter Fenwick, who started to collect NDE-stories in the 1980s. In 1987 he presented his findings on a television-program, which resulted in more stories being collected. The responses from Near-death experiencers later served as the basis for a book published in 1997, [...] "The Truth in the light", co-authored with his wife Elizabeth Fenwick. Co-operating with other researchers, among others Sam Parnia, Fenwick has also published research on the potential relationship between cardiac arrest and <b>Near-death</b> <b>Experiences.</b>|$|R
