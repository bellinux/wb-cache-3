In 1963, the President of the Republic of Algeria, Ahmed Ben Bella, halted {{the activities of the}} APN and set up a Revolution Council lasting from 1965 to 1976. The APN was reestablished in 1976 with the passage of Algeria's new constitution, at the time only a unicameral legislature. Up until 1991, the ruling party was the National Liberation Front (FLN), and in fact, the 1976 Algerian constitution considered the FLN as the preferred Algerian political party. The first APN election with multiple parties was held in December 1991. After a predicted Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) victory, a fundamentalist opposition party, the Algerian People's National Armed Forces canceled the elections. A substitute legislative body, the National Consultative Council, was established in April 1992 and lasted until May 1994, when the <b>National</b> <b>Transitional</b> Council <b>ruled</b> for until the next elections, held on 5 June 1997.
