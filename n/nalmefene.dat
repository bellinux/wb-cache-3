5|$|Naltrexone is a {{competitive}} antagonist for opioid receptors, effectively blocking {{the effects of}} endorphins and opioids. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is {{a reduction in the}} pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol. Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking. <b>Nalmefene</b> also appears effective and works by a similar manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{closely related}} medication, methylnaltrexone, {{is used to}} treat opioid-induced {{constipation}} but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood brain barrier. <b>Nalmefene</b> is similar to naltrexone and {{is used for the}} same purposes as naltrexone. Naltrexone {{should not be confused with}} naloxone, which is used in emergency cases of opioid overdose.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as <b>nalmefene</b> may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist <b>nalmefene</b> may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
2500|$|Intravenous {{naloxone}} [...] or <b>nalmefene,</b> quick-acting opioid antagonists, are the first-line {{treatment to}} reverse respiratory depression {{caused by an}} overdose of opium tincture. [...] Gastric lavage may be of some use in certain cases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nalmefene</b> is an opiate {{derivative}} {{similar in}} both structure and activity to the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Advantages of <b>nalmefene</b> relative to naltrexone include longer half-life, greater oral bioavailability and no observed dose-dependent liver toxicity.|$|E

5000|$|Based on a meta analysis, the {{usefulness}} of <b>nalmefene</b> for alcohol dependence is unclear. <b>Nalmefene,</b> in combination with psychosocial management, may decrease the amount of alcohol drank in people who are alcohol dependent. The medication may also be taken [...] "as needed", when a person feels the urge to consume alcohol.|$|E
5000|$|In vivo {{evidence}} {{indicative of}} KOR activation, such as elevation of serum prolactin levels due to dopamine suppression and increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation via enhanced adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol secretion, {{has been observed}} in humans and animals. Side effects typical of KOR activation such as hallucinations and dissociation have also been observed with <b>nalmefene</b> in human studies. It is thought that the KOR activation of <b>nalmefene</b> might produce dysphoria and anxiety. In addition to MOR and KOR binding, <b>nalmefene</b> also possesses some, albeit far lower affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) (Ki = 16 nM), where it shows agonistic activity.|$|E

[...] England followed Scotland by offering the substance as a treatment for problem drinking in October 2014. [...] In November 2014 <b>nalmefene</b> was appraised and approved as a treatment supplied by Britain's National Health Service (NHS) for reducing alcohol consumption in people with alcohol dependence.|$|E
50|$|Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors such as fluvoxamine and citalopram may {{be useful}} in the treatment of CBD, although current evidence is mixed. Opioid antagonists such as naltrexone and <b>nalmefene</b> are promising potential treatments for CBD. A review concluded that evidence is limited and insufficient to support their use at present, however. Naltrexone and <b>nalmefene</b> have also shown effectiveness in the treatment of gambling addiction, an associated disorder.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{describes}} {{the application of}} opioid blockers (naltrexone or <b>nalmefene)</b> {{as an alternative to}} help alcohol addicts in place of other more mainstream solutions such as 12-step plans, a regimen also known as [...] "The Sinclair Method." [...] The treatment is claimed by the C Three Foundation to have a 78% success rate in remedying alcohol dependence. Naltrexone is FDA approved for use in the United States. In 2013/4 the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) approved <b>nalmefene</b> for use as part of the NHS National Services Scotland. Some studies have shown the treatment to be effective in reducing the urge to drink.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nalmefene</b> (trade name Selincro), {{originally}} {{known as}} nalmetrene, is an opioid antagonist used {{primarily in the}} management of alcohol dependence. It has also been investigated for the treatment of other addictions such as pathological gambling.|$|E
50|$|Some {{currently}} common {{drugs that}} have been classed as partial agonists at particular receptors include buspirone, aripiprazole, buprenorphine, <b>nalmefene</b> and norclozapine. Examples of ligands activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma as partial agonists are honokiol and falcarindiol.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} drugs of this type, <b>nalmefene</b> may {{precipitate}} acute withdrawal symptoms {{in patients who}} are dependent on opioid drugs, or more rarely when used post-operatively, to counteract the effects of strong opioids used in surgery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nalmefene</b> is {{extensively}} metabolized in the liver, {{mainly by}} conjugation with glucuronic acid {{and also by}} N-dealkylation. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted unchanged. The glucuronide metabolite is entirely inactive, while the N-dealkylated metabolite has minimal pharmacological activity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nalmefene</b> acts as {{a silent}} {{antagonist}} of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) (Ki = 0.24 nM) and as a weak partial agonist (Ki = 0.083 nM; Emax = 20-30%) of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), with similar affinity for these two receptors but a several-fold preference for the KOR.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nalmefene</b> is {{structurally}} {{related to}} naltrexone and differs from it by substitution of the ketone {{group at the}} 6-position of naltrexone with a methylene group (CH2). It binds to the MOR with similar affinity relative to naltrexone, but binds [...] "somewhat more avidly" [...] to the KOR and DOR in comparison.|$|E
50|$|The {{closely related}} medication, methylnaltrexone, {{is used to}} treat opioid-induced {{constipation}} but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood brain barrier. <b>Nalmefene</b> is similar to naltrexone and {{is used for the}} same purposes as naltrexone.

50|$|Some {{drugs can}} produce dysphoria, {{including}} κ-opioid receptor agonists like salvinorin A (the active constituent of the hallucinogenic plant Salvia divinorum), butorphanol, and pentazocine, μ-opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and <b>nalmefene,</b> and antipsychotics like haloperidol and chlorpromazine (via blockade of dopamine receptors), among others. Depressogenic and/or anxiogenic drugs {{may also be}} associated with dysphoria.|$|E
50|$|Doses {{greater than}} 1.5 mg {{do not appear}} to give any greater benefit in this application. The {{half-life}} of <b>nalmefene</b> is longer than that of naloxone, which might make it useful for treating overdose involving longer acting opioids such as methadone, in that it would require less frequent dosing and hence reduce the likelihood of renarcotization as the antagonist wears off.|$|E
50|$|One Little Pill is a {{documentary}} {{film about the}} use of generic medications (primarily naltrexone, but also <b>nalmefene)</b> for treating and curing alcoholics. The primary focus is on The Sinclair Method, which pairs these medications with continued drinking. It was produced by Zard Productions as a film project for the C Three Foundation and released on Vimeo and VHX for On Demand viewing in October 2014. As of August 2015, DVD-R copies are also available.|$|E
5000|$|Activation of the KOR {{appears to}} antagonize {{many of the}} effects of the MOR, {{including}} analgesia, tolerance, euphoria, and memory regulation. Nalorphine and <b>nalmefene</b> are dual MOR antagonists and KOR agonists that have been used clinically as antidotes for opioid overdose, although the specific role and significance of KOR activation in this indication, if any, is uncertain. In any case however, KOR agonists notably do not affect respiratory drive, and hence do not reverse MOR activation-induced respiratory depression.|$|E

5000|$|As to {{behavioral}} treatment, {{some recent}} research supports {{the use of}} both activity scheduling and desensitization {{in the treatment of}} gambling problems. In general, behavior analytic research in this area is growing [...] There is evidence that the SSRI paroxetine is efficacious in the treatment of pathological gambling. Additionally, for patients suffering from both pathological gambling and a comorbid bipolar spectrum condition, sustained release lithium has shown efficacy in a preliminary trial. The opioid antagonist drug <b>nalmefene</b> has also been trialled quite successfully for the treatment of compulsive gambling.|$|E
50|$|Studies have shown, that <b>nalmefene</b> has {{the ability}} to {{significantly}} limit both the patient's average alcohol intake and the number of days with an intake above five units of alcohol. The drug works by removing the patient's desire to drink more, thereby controlling and limiting the intake of alcohol. The drug will be used in tablet form, and taken only according to need. According to the company this is a novel approach for alcohol dependency treatment; existing treatments are aimed at keeping the patient from drinking and the drugs have to be taken continuously {{over a longer period of}} time.|$|E

50|$|Nalodeine, {{also known}} more {{commonly}} as N-allylnorcodeine, is an opioid antagonist (specifically, an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor) {{that was never}} marketed but is of notability in having been the first opioid antagonist to have been discovered. It was first reported in 1915, and {{this was followed by}} the clinical introduction of nalorphine (N-allylnormorphine) in 1954, naloxone (N-allyloxymorphone) in 1960, and naltrexone (N-methylcyclopropyloxymorphone) in 1963. <b>Nalmefene</b> (6-desoxy-6-methylene-naltrexone), another structurally related opioid antagonist derivative, was also subsequently introduced, in 1996. In animals, nalodeine both reverses morphine- and heroin-induced respiratory depression and acts as a respiratory stimulant in its own right (i.e., when given alone). Similarly to nalorphine, nalodeine has also been found to act as an agonist of the κ-opioid receptor.|$|E
