5|$|Olga {{remained}} <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> Russia. Her {{room was}} filled with icons from her homeland and, in the palace chapel, she sang Slavic hymns with her children. She often visited Russian ships that were docked at Piraeus and invited the Russian sailors to the royal palace. She {{was the only woman}} in history to bear the title of Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy, an honor given to her on marriage. She was honored in the Greek navy by having a ship named after her.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, {{the same size}} as the early sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps in order to attract fans who were <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again in May of that year.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's guilt over her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her guilt over the affair, she is unable to express her love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasingly}} upscale {{nature of}} the city – not just the northern part, which was always affluent, but the southern Ocean Park neighborhood as well {{which has become a}} favorite of those in the entertainment industry – has created some tensions between newcomers and longtime residents <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the more bohemian, countercultural past. Nevertheless, with the recent corporate additions of Yahoo! (2005) and Google (2006), gentrification continues.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{short story}} {{was set in}} the 1960s and dealt with characters <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> their childhoods in the Midwestern United States in the 1920s. In the Chronicles version, which takes place forty years later but which still relies on 1920s nostalgia, the story contains a brief paragraph about medical treatments that slow the aging process, so that the characters can be traveling to Mars in the 2000s but still remember the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2006, a {{group of}} 31 {{prominent}} New Zealanders signed an open letter, published as a full-page newspaper advertisement, calling for better quality programmes and less advertising on TVNZ. These included mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, and former governors-general Sir Michael Hardie Boys and Dame Catherine Tizard. However, they were accused of being out of touch and <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> local programmes from the 1970s and 1980s, when New Zealand had {{only one or two}} TV channels.|$|E

25|$|Today, most BBS {{software}} {{that is still}} actively supported, such as Worldgroup, Wildcat! BBS and Citadel/UX, is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or DOSBox (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem terminal emulation software, like Telix, Terminate, Qmodem and Procomm Plus. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and SyncTerm include native telnet support.|$|E
25|$|In the post-Soviet period, {{the members}} of the former Soviet intelligentsia have {{displayed}} diverging attitudes towards the communist regime. While the older generation of intelligentsia has attempted to frame themselves as victims, the younger generation, who were in their 30s when the Soviet Union collapsed, has not allocated so much space for the repressive experience in their self-narratives. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the popularity and influence of the intelligentsia has significantly declined, therefore it is typical for the post-Soviet intelligentsia to feel <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the last years of the Soviet Union (perestroika), which they often regard as the golden age of the intelligentsia.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{although}} Cliff was occasionally <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the 'Bizarre' years, as {{witnessed in}} personal letters to friends, {{she seemed to}} be realistic and accepted the commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice seemed to enjoy playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing that she could not recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the post-war production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as Tonquin rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff's reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The post-war ware has little value at auction.|$|E

25|$|The term Rhodie {{was first}} used by British Army and civil service {{personnel}} in Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) during the period between the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979 and the formal independence of Zimbabwe in April 1980. The term was initially applied to all white Zimbabweans. After independence, the term began to be applied increasingly to those whites who were <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the past. The nostalgia a Rhodie feels relates particularly to the UDI era (1965 to 1979), during which the predominantly white government, headed by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, declared independence from Britain {{in an attempt to}} prevent any commitment to a set timetable regarding black majority rule. The UDI project ended in the Bush War of the 1970s, fought between the Rhodesian Security Forces and the communist-backed black nationalist insurgents of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).|$|E
25|$|Outlawed by the French Revolution, {{the slave}} trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in {{the first decades of}} the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, {{continuing}} it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from Réunion in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on Réunion sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseilles were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. <b>Nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours–Saint-Nazaire railway.|$|E

500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little.

He does have a darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other.

500|$|Eurogamer Martin Robinson {{said the}} game made him <b>nostalgic</b> <b>for</b> a score attack game {{from the early}} 90s that does not exist, and as such called Ziggurat [...] "one of the finer simple score-attack {{shooters}} ... on the App Store" [...] and {{an expression of the}} golden age of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. He called the game's mechanics [...] "fine-tuned" [...] and the gun's abilities collated from the best elements of other video games. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com likewise found the controls [...] "very well suited" [...] for touchscreens. He also praised the chained explosions and shot charging as [...] "satisfying", and compared the game to Missile Command in its allure. Robinson of Eurogamer said the game's deserving peers were Geometry Wars and Robotron for their refined play styles that make players predict what enemies are about to act. TouchArcade Leray praised the game design and never reached a place where his skills plateaued. He advised against using the Slingshot mode controls.|$|E
