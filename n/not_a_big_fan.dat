500|$|Matthews later {{admitted}} {{that she was not}} a serious fan of the show, but that she only used the line because it adequately described the type of relationship she was singing about. In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of [...] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode". After questioning, she later said that she would [...] "prefer to go out for {{a night on the town}} with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [...] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny". Matthews also related that [...] "I'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake, but who cares? They should be flattered we wrote a song about [...] anyway".|$|E

Said Whedon, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of extreme long lens, talky movies – I {{like to see the}} space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years." [...] Whedon also said that [...] "there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D" [...] but [...] "The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.|$|E

5000|$|John Flynn later recalled:The main {{interest}} {{for me was}} the Trickster character (a cadaverous Alice Cooper-like entity who materializes from a CD-ROM computer game - Ed.). The Trickster was {{the core of the}} movie and what attracted me to the script. We found this stage actor (T. Ryder Smith) to play the Trickster and he was extraordinary. Eddie Furlong was a 15-year-old kid who couldn’t act. You had to “slap him awake” every morning.

2500|$|International {{sporting}} {{events such as}} the Tour de France got little mention except when there was a scheduled interview or major story. Both Russo and Francesa have admitted to not being experts in hockey, but playoff games involving the local teams were discussed and noted NHL guests sometimes appeared. Boxing was not talked about much, as both hosts consider the sport not to be what it once was. Although Freddy Adu and a few other soccer celebrities did interviews on the show, the FIFA World Cup and the sport itself received little to no attention on the program; the local MLS team, the New York Red Bulls, were rarely mentioned at all. (Russo said in his first book that he played soccer as a teenager, but was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of the game.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, {{and knew}} {{no one else}} well. He saw a {{familiar}} face: Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and they began talking. Laurents {{told him he was}} working on a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later. In 1957, West Side Story opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on Candide, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of [...] West Side Storys music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from West Side Story during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off. Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished [...] "someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because {{it would have been nice}} to get that extra percentage".|$|E
500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies". Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, {{while others were}} completely removed. Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, we were {{out to make a}} movie, so we tried to keep the pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> real <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape." [...] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.|$|R
2500|$|However, Saigh {{ultimately}} {{sold the}} Cardinals to St. Louis-based brewer Anheuser-Busch (A–B). In February 1953, {{a group of}} local businessmen, some of whom sat on the company's board of directors, approached company {{president and chief executive}} officer Gussie Busch about A–B buying the team. They persuaded Busch to meet with Saigh, who told him that a group of investors from Milwaukee, which at that time did <b>not</b> have <b>a</b> major league team, were seriously considering buying the team. The 55-year-old Busch had <b>not</b> been <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baseball <b>fan,</b> preferring the gentlemanly outdoor sports of hunting, fishing and horseback riding he had grown up taking part in on his family's estate.|$|R

[...] "There's probably <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> Twilight Singers <b>fan</b> {{in the whole world}} than Scott Ford," [...] Dulli says.

500|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film {{would be based on}} an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> Bond film <b>fan</b> through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen Casino Royale prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Forster found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet".|$|R
5000|$|Students at Oberlin College have {{discussed}} the logo's use with team owner Larry Dolan, who formerly served on Oberlin's board of trustees. The head of the American Indian Council at Oberlin presented Dolan with a packet [...] "containing historical, scholarly and position papers about American Indian team mascots", and Dolan has met with Oberlin students and faculty who oppose the use of Chief Wahoo. In 2000, the school's American Indian Council expressed its concern over Dolan's presence {{on the board of}} trustees at an open forum meeting. Around the same time, other Oberlin students, faculty, and staff spoke out about Chief Wahoo. The assistant dean of students and director of the school's multicultural resource center said, [...] "On finding out that Larry Dolan was a trustee, I almost fell out of my chair. It surprises me that Oberlin would get a trustee that was related to a racist symbol like that." [...] A professor of history said, [...] "It's clearly offensive. And I am as flabbergasted as I was when I first moved to Ohio every time I see that logo. I'm also flabbergasted that all Indian fans don't recognize its offensiveness." [...] The college secretary was more ambivalent, saying, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baseball <b>fan,</b> but I've always found the anti-Indians/Wahoo argument non-convincing. I don't see it as racist, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Indian." ...|$|R
500|$|Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will [...] "greatly enjoy this disc", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: [...] "It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although {{much has been made}} of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as <b>not</b> only <b>a</b> singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress – I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] music video. He concluded by stating that: [...] "Although I'm <b>not</b> really <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout." [...] Beierle compared Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good to the video releases of Mariah Carey. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as [...] "very slick and promotional". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez [...] "comes through energetically" [...] and without [...] "much star-ego". In the United States, Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 50,000 units.|$|R

Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon. The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had. The director found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet." ...|$|R
