40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} <b>cost</b> {{effectiveness}} (<b>net</b> <b>costs</b> per life year gained) of pneumococcal vaccination of elderly individuals aged 65 years {{and over in}} The Netherlands. Design and setting: A pharmacoeconomic analysis was conducted from the healthcare perspective in The Netherlands. The gender- and age-specific modelling framework linked epidemiological aspects of invasive pneumococcal disease (e. g. incidence, mortality, life years lost) to vaccination and hospital resource use. To derive 90 % confidence limits for <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> per life year gained a stochastic analysis was performed. Intervention: Pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly with the 23 -valent vaccine. Effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease was derived from international studies. Main outcome measures and results: Pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly was {{not found to be}} cost saving. At baseline, stochastic and univariate sensitivity analysis <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> per life year gained were estimated to be between 6000 and 16 000 euro (EUR) [EUR 1 = 1. 1 US dollars; cost level 1995]. A scenario analysis on alternative age-dependent vaccination strategies indicated even higher <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> per life year gained, up to EUR 28 000 for vaccinating only those elderly aged 85 years and over. Conclusions: Pneumococcal vaccination is associated with <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> per life year gained of EUR 10 100 (at baseline assumptions). These costs are higher than those for influenza vaccination (EUR 5500). Our pharmacoeconomic approach, which needs to be considered in conjunction with social, psychological and budgetary issues, is intended to contribute to rational decision-making in healthcare policy.

We constructed a deterministic economic model that {{is compatible with the}} Dutch livestock production systems for cattle, sheep and goats. Two hundred cattle farms and 270 sheep farms were infected with BTV 8 in the epidemic of 2006, whereas 30, 417 cattle farms, 45, 022 sheep farms and 35, 278 goat farms were estimated to be infected in the epidemic of 2007. The <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> (costs minus benefits) of the BTV 8 epidemic of 2006 (BT 2006) was estimated at 32. 4 million Euros. The <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> of the BTV 8 epidemic of 2007 (BT 2007) was valued at 164 – 175 million Euros, depending on the mortality and morbidity rates for cattle used.

30|$|Finally, Muehlemann et al. (2013 a) {{show that}} the {{expected}} <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> or <b>net</b> benefits from training (during the training period) also affect a firm’s treatment of apprentices with different abilities. Firms on average expecting a net benefit from training {{are more inclined to}} compensate for a weak initial ability with additional training, whereas firms expecting <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> focus their resources on the most able apprentices – {{at the expense of the}} weaker ones. As a consequence, the dropout risk for apprentices is significantly lower if apprenticeship training is profitable on average, as a firm will be more likely to spend additional resources to prevent dropouts of weak apprentices. As long as dropouts occur early on, the costs for a firm may be limited, even if training results in <b>net</b> <b>costs.</b> However, a firm may expect that school-leavers without appropriate qualifications are more likely to drop out and thus refrain from offering an apprenticeship position in the first place.|$|R
30|$|In Germany, nearly 90 % of {{training}} firms were traditionally willing to bear substantial <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> {{up to the}} year 2000 (Beicht et al. 2004). 5 However, the most recent cost-benefit survey in 2007 indicates {{a significant decrease in}} <b>net</b> training <b>costs</b> across many occupations (Schönfeld et al. 2010). Although 70 % of all firms continue to incur <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> {{by the end of the}} training period, average <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> dropped by 36 %, primarily because apprentices were used more extensively for productive activities in 2007 than in 2000 (cf. Pfeifer et al. 2009, Jansen et al. 2012). Thus, while German training firms on average still make net investments in apprenticeship training, there is now a significant share {{of training}} firms (30 %) for which apprenticeships are in fact profitable. Although firms who recoup their training investments by the end of training no longer need to rely on retaining their apprentices for financial reasons, the overall retention rate of apprentices (i.e., the share of apprentices that remains with the firm as skilled workers after training) in Germany remained at a high level (slightly above 50 %).|$|R

30|$|First, set-up <b>costs</b> are the <b>net</b> <b>costs</b> that a firm invests {{to train}} its {{apprentices}}. <b>Net</b> Training <b>Costs</b> in Euros include the average gross costs, e.g., costs for apprentices (wages), costs for trainers, physical costs and other costs, minus the corresponding {{benefits such as}} productive contribution of apprentices during their training. 10 <b>Net</b> training <b>costs</b> can be positive (i.e., a net investment) or negative (i.e., a net benefit). Empirically, non-training firms might not train apprentices because of significantly higher <b>net</b> training <b>costs</b> in contrast to training firms (Wolter et al. 2006). Therefore, training costs for non-training firms would systematically differ if these firms were {{to switch to a}} training policy. Muehlemann et al.

Analogously, we estimate training costs for non-training firms with identical selection models and the same exclusion restriction, i.e., availability of skilled workers. 11 Subsequently, we multiply these <b>net</b> training <b>costs</b> per year and per apprentice by the Training Duration for a specific training occupation in years (ranging from 2 to 3.5  years) to calculate the <b>net</b> training <b>costs</b> for the whole training duration of one apprentice.|$|R
