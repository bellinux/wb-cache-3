5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an {{inertial reference frame}} doesn't see objects he would describe as moving faster {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|Rumelia (or Trakya) {{refers to}} the region of Turkey {{which is part of}} Southeast Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, the {{northern}} part of Çanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). Folk songs from this region share similarities with Balkan, Albanian and Greek folk musics, especially from the ethnic minorities and natives of Thrace. Cypriot folk music also shares folk tunes with this region, e.g. the Çiftetelli dance. These type of folk songs also share close similarities with Ottoman court music, suggesting that the distinction between court and folk music was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> clear. However, folk songs from Istanbul may have been closely influenced by its locality, which would include Ottoman rakkas and court music.|$|E

25|$|While Ruffini and Abel {{established}} that the general quintic could not be solved, some particular quintics can be solved, such as (x1)5=0, and the precise criterion by which a given quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be solvable or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was solvable or not was equivalent {{to whether or not}} the permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, whether or not it was a solvable group. This group was always solvable for polynomials of degree four or less, but <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains why there is no general solution in higher degree.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying {{a significant portion of}} the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes. However, the situation is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.|$|E
25|$|Arabs relying {{largely on}} Berbers conquered the Iberian Peninsula {{starting}} in 711, subduing the whole Visigothic Kingdom by 725. The triumphant Umayyads got conditional capitulations probably {{in most of}} the towns, so that they could get a compromise with the native population. This was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so.</b> For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the Goths (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the Forum Iudicum) continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws. The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters. Al-Andalus or Muslim ruled Iberian peninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, {{as a result of their}} expansion taking place especially after the definite collapse of the Caliphate of Cordova in 1031.|$|E

25|$|The modal {{differences}} are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> observable in the Sephardic or Southern tradition. Here {{the participation of}} the congregants has tended to a more general uniformity, and has largely reduced the intonation to a chant around the dominant, or fifth degree of the scale, {{as if it were a}} derivation from the Ashkenazic daily morning theme (see below), but ending with a descent to the major third, or, less often, to the tonic note. Even where the particular occasionsuch as a fastmight call for a change of tonality, the anticipation of the congregational response brings the close of the benediction back to the usual major third. But enough differences remain, especially in the Italian rendering, to show that the principle of parallel rendering with modal difference, fully apparent in their cantillation, underlies the prayer-intonations of the Sephardim also. This principle has marked effects in the Ashkenazic or Northern tradition, where it is as clear in the rendering of the prayers as in that of the Scriptural lessons, and is also apparent in the Ḳerobot.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} some reasons to believe that {{seasonal}} changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus {{is known to have}} a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the albedo patterns. In addition, the microwave data showed increases in pole–equator contrast after the 1986 solstice. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, having bolstered expectations that it would brighten soon. In particular, an analog of the bright polar collar present in its southern hemisphere at −45° was expected to appear in its northern part. This indeed happened in 2007 when Uranus passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, whereas the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained asymmetric, with northern winds being slightly slower than southern.|$|E

[...] By the third century AD, the difference between Sappho's literary reputation as a poet and her moral reputation as a woman had become so significant that the suggestion that there were in fact two Sapphos began to develop. [...] In his Historical Miscellanies, Aelian wrote that there was [...] "another Sappho, a courtesan, not a poetess".|$|E

500|$|The strongest {{themes in}} Sherwood's early evangelical {{writings}} are {{the need to}} recognize one's innate [...] "depravity" [...] {{and the need to}} prepare oneself for eternity.

[...] In her adaptation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678)—The Infant's Progress (1821)—she represents original sin as a child named [...] "In-bred Sin" [...] who tempts the young pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Celestial City (Heaven) and it is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, [...] "tedious" [...] for even the [...] "willing reader." [...] Thus, [...] "some young readers may have found [...] activities more interesting than the spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation."
