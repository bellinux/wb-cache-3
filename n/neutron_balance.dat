50|$|Most current ADS designs {{propose a}} high-intensity proton {{accelerator}} with an energy of about 1 GeV, directed towards a spallation target or spallation neutron source. The source {{located in the}} heart of the reactor core contains liquid metal which is impacted by the beam, thus releasing neutrons and is cooled by circulating the liquid metal such as lead-bismuth towards a heat exchanger. The nuclear reactor core surrounding the spallation neutron source contains the fuel rods, the fuel being preferably Thorium. Thereby, for each proton intersecting the spallation target, an average of 20 neutrons is released which fission the surrounding fissile part of the fuel and enrich the fertile part. The <b>neutron</b> <b>balance</b> can be regulated or indeed shut off by adjusting the accelerator power so that the reactor would be below criticality. The additional neutrons provided by the spallation neutron source provide the degree of control as do the delayed neutrons in a conventional nuclear reactor, the difference being that spallation neutron source-driven neutrons are easily controlled by the accelerator. The main advantage is inherent safety. A conventional nuclear reactor's nuclear fuel possesses self-regulating properties such as the Doppler effect or void effect, which make these nuclear reactors safe. In addition to these physical properties of conventional reactors, in the subcritical reactor, whenever the neutron source is turned off, the fission reaction ceases and only the decay heat remains.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a novel method for performing Monte Carlo calculations of the effect, on the neutron flux, of stationary fluctuations in macroscopic crosssections. The basic principle relies on the formulation of two equivalent problems in the frequency domain: one that corresponds to the real part of the <b>neutron</b> <b>balance,</b> and one that corresponds to the imaginary part. The two equivalent problems are in nature similar to two subcritical systems driven by external neutron sources, and can thus be treated as such in a Monte Carlo framework. The definition of these two equivalent problems nevertheless requires the possibility to modify the macroscopic cross-sections, and we use the work of Kuijper, van der Marck and Hogenbirk to define group-wise macroscopic cross-sections in MCNP. The method is illustrated in this paper at a frequency of 1 Hz, for which only the real part of the <b>neutron</b> <b>balance</b> plays a significant role and for driving fluctuations leading to neutron sources having the same sign in the two equivalent sub-critical problems. A semi-analytical diffusion-based solution is used to verify the implementation of the method on a test case representative of light water reactor conditions in an infinite lattice of fuel pins surrounded by water. The test case highlights flux gradients that are steeper in the Monte Carlo-based transport solution than in the diffusion-based solution. Compared to other Monte Carlo-based methods earlier proposed for carrying out stationary dynamic calculations, the presented method does not require any modification of the Monte Carlo code...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{suggest that}} neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries rotate within {{a narrow range}} of spin frequencies clustered around 300 Hz. A proposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation from a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star’s core halts the spin-up due to accretion. For the <b>neutron</b> star transients, <b>balancing</b> the time-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from steady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent luminosity too bright {{to be consistent with}} observations (in particular of Aql X- 1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin of 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a thermal luminosity ∼ 10 34 ergs − 1 when accretion halts. This is the minimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous heating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is the case when the core of the star is superfluid. We therefore conclude that either the accretion torque is much less than ˙M(GMR) 1 / 2, or that a steady-state r-mode does not limit the spin rate of the neutron star transients. Future observations with Chandra and XMM promise to further constrain the amount of viscous dissipation in the neutron star core...|$|R
