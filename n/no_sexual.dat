5|$|The species {{exhibits}} <b>no</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism, {{and characteristics}} of the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru reed warbler is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed warbler, which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger, and the Oriental reed warbler has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism. Juveniles {{are very}} similar to adults, but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} on the chest. Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season, whereas juveniles only have a partial moult, in which they replace a variable number of rectrices.|$|E
5|$|Whether Smilodon {{was sexually}} dimorphic has {{implications}} for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had <b>no</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, {{there would have been}} evolutionary selection for competition between males. The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.|$|E

5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or <b>no</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E

25|$|In complex organisms, the sex {{organs are}} {{the parts that}} are {{involved}} in the production and exchange of gametes in sexual reproduction. Many species, particularly animals, have sexual specialization, and their populations are divided into male and female individuals.

This is very frequent in plants.|$|E

25|$|Tropical {{species of}} pigeons can display a rich variety of colour, presumably to {{facilitate}} species recognition.
