5|$|Some {{factions in}} the ACLU {{proposed}} <b>new</b> <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, {{to becoming a}} legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to {{be more willing to}} compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU, {{which had}} been {{controlled}} by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested <b>new</b> <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.|$|E

25|$|With {{the power}} to vote, freedmen started {{participating}} in politics. While many slaves were illiterate, educated blacks (including escaped slaves) moved down from the North to aid them, and natural leaders also stepped forward. They elected white and black men to represent them in constitutional conventions. A Republican coalition of freedmen, southerners supportive of the Union (derisively called scalawags by white Democrats), and northerners who had migrated to the South (derisively called carpetbaggers)—some of whom were returning natives, but were mostly Union veterans – organized to create constitutional conventions. They created new state constitutions to set <b>new</b> <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> southern states.|$|E

He noted that the album contained less [...] "rough edges and attitude" [...] than predecessor Vulture Street, and likening the album more to Odyssey Number Five. Sputnikmusic's James Bishop agreed, claiming the band should be concerned by the [...] "lack of experimentation or ambition" [...] on the album. He again {{stated that the}} album was consistent, noting that [...] "there actually isn't a bad song present". The review, which gave the album {{three and a half}} stars, commented that it seemed the band were trying to move towards the bluegrass genre, and [...] "edging their way into the adult-contemporary section" [...] of a music store, something they had not shown on their previous works.|$|E

500|$|Under communism, Agârbiceanu's lay {{work began}} to be fully {{recovered}} in the late 1960s. An important effort in this process was undertaken by literary historian Mircea Zaciu, who had begun a critical re-evaluation as early as 1955, with a short monograph that took up George Călinescu's observation whereby Agârbiceanu was not a moralizer but an artistic narrator of moral situations. Zaciu went further, seeking to detach the Sămănătorist label and place him {{within the framework of}} ethical Transylvanian prose. His work, re-edited and amplified in 1964 and 1972, revived interest in the writer by precisely cataloguing his corpus and opening <b>new</b> <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> its critical analysis. The recovery was limited: according to Voncu, the arrival of national communism left critics unsure about whether to reintroduce Agârbiceanu's [...] "uncompromising vision of rural life" [...] into the literary canon.|$|E
500|$|Babbit, {{whose mother}} runs {{a halfway house}} called <b>New</b> <b>Directions</b> <b>for</b> young people with drug and alcohol problems, had {{wanted to make a}} comedy about {{rehabilitation}} and the 12-step program. After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas. With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she {{came up with the idea}} for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp. They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is [...] "...the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity." [...] Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the femme perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, Go Fish and The Watermelon Woman). She also wanted to satirize both the religious right and the gay community.|$|E

2500|$|Following the lackluster {{reception}} of The Final Frontier {{at the box}} office, Bennett once again proposed a Starfleet Academy style film with an all new main cast {{to coincide with the}} 25th anniversary of the franchise. The idea leaked and was argued against on the convention circuit by Roddenberry and the main cast, and Paramount began to receive a huge backlash from the fanbase. Roddenberry said, [...] "Who was going to cast the new Kirk and Spock? No one has ever cast a Trek character besides me that's worked." [...] On the basis of the negative fan reaction, and a limited time-frame before the anniversary, Paramount CEO Frank Mancuso Sr. gave the organisational duties for the sixth film to Nimoy, asking him to appoint producers, writers and a director. Nimoy brought Nicholas Meyer back to Star Trek to direct the sixth film. Together Meyer and Denny Martin Flinn wrote <b>new</b> <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> some of the characters, including the attachment of Spock on his protege, Valeris, played by Kim Cattrall. Nimoy also felt that the theme of [...] was successful, saying [...] "Spock experienced prejudice growing up half-Vulcan and half-human, in Star Trek VI, Spock becomes an emissary against prejudice and discovers, {{during the course of the}} story, his own prejudices." ...|$|E
