5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets <b>net</b> <b>of</b> its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|Manuel Komnenos {{attempted}} {{to draw the}} Russian principalities into his <b>net</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy directed against Hungary, {{and to a lesser}} extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of Hungary and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel's ally (symmachos), and Vladimirko of Galicia is described as Manuel's vassal (hypospondos). Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.|$|E

The next month, filming took place at a training facility for London's Metropolitan Police Service, which doubled as a city in Sokovia. Additional filming took place in Chittagong, Bangladesh, including the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard, and in New York City. On August 6, Whedon announced on social media that he had completed principal photography on Avengers: Age of Ultron. Disney spent $330.6 million on Avengers: Age of Ultron from February 2013 to November 2014, but $50.7 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority.

At {{the end of}} the month, Jaimie Alexander was injured on the London film set, after she slipped while walking in the rain. On October 12, 2012, production moved to Iceland with filming taking place in Dómadalur, Skógafoss, Fjaðrárgljúfur and Skeiðarársandur. Iceland Review described the shoot as being among the most extensive film projects to have ever taken place in Iceland. Three days later, Disney announced that the film would be released in 3D. In late October, filming commenced at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London. Filming also took place at Shepperton Studios and Longcross Studios in Surrey between October and December 2012. Other filming locations included Wembley, Borough Market, Hayes and Stonehenge. Alexander tweeted that principal photography wrapped on December 14, 2012. Disney spent $237.6 million on Thor: The Dark World but $37 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority. A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A.

40|$|Abstract: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (<b>NETs)</b> <b>of</b> the jejunum, ileum, and {{appendix}} {{are also}} collectively known as midgut carcinoids. Similar to NETs in general, the diagnosed incidence <b>of</b> the midgut <b>NETs</b> {{is on the}} rise. Their presenting symptoms vary depending on stage and primary site. Local-regional NETs often present with vague and nonspecific symptoms. Classic carcinoid syndrome {{is more likely to}} appear in patients with advanced disease. Local-regional <b>NETs</b> <b>of</b> the small bowel should be resected whenever possible. With the exception <b>of</b> small well-differentiated <b>NETs</b> <b>of</b> the appendix, <b>NETs</b> <b>of</b> the mid-gut have substantial risk of relapse after resection and need to be followed for at least 7 years. Metastatic/advanced <b>NETs</b> <b>of</b> the midgut are incurable. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Somatostatin ana-logs are effective in the management of carcinoid syndrome. Octreotide long-acting release has also recently been shown to delay disease pro-gression. Liver-directed therapy and surgical debulking can improve quality of life in selected patients. Pivotal phase 3 studies with bev-acizumab targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and everolimus targeting mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) are ongoing and may lead to improved outcome. Further studies of novel approaches such as peptide receptor radiotherapy are also warranted...|$|R
