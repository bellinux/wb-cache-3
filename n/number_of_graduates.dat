30|$|Finally, {{we found}} a {{statistically}} significant difference in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> students employed in capital versus non-capital regions for both the humanities and social sciences, with professors in both disciplines employing larger <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> students per researcher in capital areas than in non-capital areas. In contrast, no such regional difference was identified for the natural sciences or engineering. As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> students is generally proportional to the size of research funds, this difference might have arisen from funding differences between capital and non-capital areas (Kwon 2010).|$|R

In order to address this question, we have collected a large scale data on Korean academics’ research performance. According to the results of the analysis, first, male researchers were found to have more {{graduate students}} than female researchers. Second, we found significant differences in the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> students employed by senior and junior researchers. Third, researchers from the capital were also found to manage more graduate students.
