5|$|Although the SYOGOC did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> an {{official}} medal tally, news outlets, such as xinmsn, kept unofficial medal tables, where medals won by mixed-NOCs teams are credited to the NOCs that the athletes belong to. The following table lists {{the top ten}} ranked NOCs and the host nation. See 2010 Summer Youth Olympics medal table for more details and a full table with medals won by mixed-NOCs teams counted separately.|$|E
5|$|Each farmer must {{immediately}} report all {{stocks of}} grain and livestock and no farm produce may be sold except {{through the office}} of the Kommandant of supplies in Winnipeg. He may <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> any for his own consumption but must buy it back through the Central Authority in Winnipeg.|$|E
5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> pace with the rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about {{five percent of the}} watershed.|$|E

5|$|Mexico {{launched}} {{two small}} expeditions into Texas in 1842. The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in {{battle in the}} Dawson massacre. Despite these successes, Mexico did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> an occupying force in Texas, and the republic survived. The republic's inability to defend itself added momentum to Texas's eventual annexation into the United States.|$|E
5|$|Pitch darkness. Every now and then, an {{explosion}} in the night. They had orders to fire on any who could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up. Their fingers on the triggers, they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure. If one of us had stopped for a second, a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> Macedonia as an {{administrative}} unit: since 1864 parts of geographical Macedonia lay in three vilayets, which also comprised some non-Macedonian areas. Northern Macedonia {{was part of}} the Kosovo vilayet and then of Skopje; the Thessaloniki (south Macedonia), and the Monastir (Central Macedonia) vilayet were also created. This administrative division lasted until 1912–13, when Macedonia was divided among the Balkan states.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> the Sooners from running {{the ball on the}} ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing the last two games with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup. At the end of the day, Paul Thompson only threw 11passes, 7completions for 77yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, and Oklahoma had 238yards of rushing.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series, Kane {{tried to}} get Edge to bring Paul Bearer out to them but Edge brought out an empty wheelchair. Kane tried to {{interrogate}} Edge during their fight but in the end, Edge unknowingly double pinned his rival, keeping Kane as World Heavyweight Champion before wheeling Kane into a barricade. On November 26, Edge was offered {{a chance at a}} rematch with Kane for the title if we would let Bearer go free. But Edge did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> his word. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup Final, with the title {{on the line and}} looking to fulfill his {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to one up, eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> his level up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> pace with losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E
5|$|Judah and two {{siblings}} were boarded {{with relatives}} in Fayetteville for about 18 {{months after the}} rest of the family moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first Reform congregation in the United States, with shorter services conducted in English rather than Hebrew. Philip was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> the Sabbath, and the extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain. The boy's intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.|$|E

5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing {{continued}} in the Byzantine Empire, although the Byzantines did <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> as many records and statistics as the Romans did. In place of the detailed inscriptions of Roman racing statistics, several short epigrams in verse were composed celebrating some of the more famous Byzantine Charioteers. The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius, Julianus of Tyre, Faustinus, his son, Constantinus, Uranius, and Porphyrius. Although Anastasius's single epigram reveals almost nothing about him, Porphyrius is much better known, having thirty-four known poems dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|Nagato was {{selected}} to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. In mid-March, Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok, but her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up. The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived. She reached the atoll on 4 April and Bikini in May.|$|E
