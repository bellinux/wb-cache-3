5|$|Gene {{expression}} first involves transcription, {{in which}} DNA {{is used as}} a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exported.|$|E

There are five major {{areas in which}} there are task requirements: (1) potential contaminants <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified, i. e., both the sources and types of contaminants, (2) the scope and magnitude of contaminant effects <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined, i. e., toxicological effects, microbacteriological effects and impurities, (3) mathematical models for predictive methods <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed.

5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known before the exam and highest score <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E
5|$|FH <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence}} of xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stripped {{every two to}} four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
5000|$|Policy {{entrepreneurs}} <b>need</b> additional skills <b>to</b> influence policy. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> political fixers, able {{to understand}} the politics and identify the key players. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good storytellers, able to synthesise simple compelling stories from the results of the research. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good networkers <b>to</b> work effectively with all the other stakeholders, and they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good engineers, building a programme that pulls all of this together.|$|R

5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|In his report, Lord Fraser set out {{a number}} of {{recommendations}} stemming from the inquiry. Primarily, in terms of design selection and when using an international architect linking with a Scottish-based firm, the report advised that a full analysis of the compatibility of different working cultures and practices <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made.|$|E

5|$|Slot broaches (G & H) are {{for cutting}} slots of various {{dimensions}} at high production rates.

5|$|The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) is {{assisting}} the coroner's office in investigating the two deaths. Once completed, the OPP could launch a criminal investigation, if warranted. The Ministry of Labour {{will have an}} engineer examine for further structural problems, and thus whether the mall <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> torn down.

5|$|The most {{traditional}} type of batik, called batik tulis (written batik), is drawn using only the canting. The cloth <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drawn on both sides, and dipped in a dye bath {{three to four}} times. The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ready-use rounds is {{insufficient}} and the hoists are desperately slow. The 47mm guns, {{much more so}} than the large and medium-calibre guns, will have to fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> corrected as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|When {{initiating}} warfarin therapy ("warfarinization"), {{the doctor}} will decide how strong the anticoagulant therapy <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> The target INR {{level varies from}} case to case depending on the clinical indicators, but tends to be 2–3 in most conditions.

5|$|A 2006 International Energy Agency forum {{presented}} {{costs for}} managing intermittency {{as a function}} of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to}} have originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
