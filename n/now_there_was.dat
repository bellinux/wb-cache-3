No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E

During the October fighting heavy guns were not used on the towns to avoid casualties among French civilians, but the 60-pounders were used to 'search' roads and forest clearings. Again, on 4 November, at the Battle of the Sambre, 92nd (M) Bde supported IV Corps in a complex fire programme to assist 37th Division and the New Zealand Division in capturing the old fortress of Le Quesnoy.|$|E
25|$|His {{thoughts}} {{drifted to}} gloom and misanthropy. His mood was not improved {{by the fact}} that by <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no pretence of keeping up appearances: his marriage had failed. Years earlier he had grown resigned to the lack of love between him and Sarah. He had been visiting prostitutes and displayed more idealised amorous inclinations toward a number of women whose names are lost to history. Now in 1819, he was unable to pay the rent on their rooms at 19 York Street and his family were evicted. That was the last straw for Sarah, who moved into rooms with their son and broke with Hazlitt for good, forcing him to find his own accommodation. He would sometimes see his son and even his wife, with whom he remained on speaking terms, but they were effectively separated.|$|E

500|$|On the English-language website of the Lebanese {{newspaper}} Al Akhbar, Syrian journalist Ula Shaybeddine {{recalled how}} the uprisings {{had changed the}} meaning of the word [...] "street" [...] for his generation. Once, much as it had been in English, it had been [...] "a space for thieves, drug addicts, prostitutes, beggars, and 'riffraff.'" [...] But <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a new understanding of the Arab 'street,'" [...] he wrote. [...] "We are beginning to understand why the powers that be wanted us to believe all those lies about [...]" [...] He said it had now become [...] "a place of righteousness and honor, beauty and justice... the space where our youth came of age, as they rebelled against injustice, abuse, and humiliation." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with the}} Biography Channel she explained: [...] "I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [...] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely <b>now...</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> so much history with that family." ...|$|E
500|$|Keeping {{with the}} spirit of past games, Howard promised to keep {{with the spirit}} of [...] "big-world, do-anything"-style games, feeling that a certain size and number of choices were needed to make {{role-playing}} feel [...] "meaningful"; but <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> to be greater emphasis on keeping the game focused. Pete Hines saw the developments between games as less an issue of design focus and more as a [...] "natural side effect of improving and refining how the game works". If smart decisions were made, ease of play would naturally follow. Oblivion would include fewer NPCs and quests than Morrowind, and mindless filler, which Howard felt the team had been guilty of in the past, would be avoided. In exchange, Producer Gavin Carter later explained, there would be greater focus on length and depth in the quests, adding more [...] "alternate paths", more characters [...] "to connect with, who actually have personalities". Carter cast negative aspersions on aspects of gameplay too far removed from the game's central plot. Carter stated that such material was not needed, preferring instead that the focus be on the plot, on [...] "fighting these demon lords", and that further material is [...] "tertiary" [...] and [...] "takes away".|$|E

500|$|Reckitt and Colman {{approached}} Stanley Wagner to buy Coldcrops, {{and after}} a very long negotiation a deal was concluded. A letter from Barclays Bank dated 21 June 1956 reads [...] " [...] Dear Mr Wagner, I have pleasure in enclosing two copies of the Draft for £......... credited to your account, which the Bank will be pleased if you will accept as a souvenir of this most successful transaction". The deal transferred ownership of the packaging and concept from Coldcrops to Reckitt & Coleman, and the new Jif-brand lemon juice was launched in 1956. All parties were delighted, Stanley Wagner with a substantial sum of money, for those days and a large profit from the six million lemons that had been sold, Reckitt's even more so because the negotiating team had permission to pay far more for the business than {{they were able to}} achieve. Lemon farmers in Sicily were also pleased, because the demand had increased for Sicilian lemon juice, which was largely a by-product of Sicilian lemon oil production. For many years, whilst producing lemon oil, Sicilians had found little use for the juice. <b>Now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a rapidly growing market for their near-waste product. In 1970, Jif continued to be prepared with lemon juice from Sicily. Later on, Unilever acquired the Jif brand in 1995 for the price of £250m, when it purchased Colman's of Norwich.|$|E

2500|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{proved to}} be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart {{at the center of the}} soul, <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts. [...] During the same month, Arthur Kornberg announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a viral gene. [...] "Life had been synthesized," [...] said the head of the National Institutes of Health. Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as beta thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia.|$|E

So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he sat there in the darkness, he could [...] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{granting}} of a charter (Stadtrecht) would place responsibility on the inhabitants {{to maintain the}} walls and defences and also provide a force of citizens (Bürgergarde) to defend the town when necessary, The uniformed Bürgergarde survived in some Austrian towns until {{they were forced to}} disband in 1920, but they have been re-established in Radstadt, Murau and Eggenburg. [...] The Bürgergarde were often granted a larger tower on the wall for their musters and other towers may have been granted to craftsmens’ gilds. By the end of the 17th century, evidence from prints suggest that some town walls were starting to fall into decay and in the 18th Century Maria Theresa and Joseph II encouraged the removal of gates to encourage economic growth. But it was the French forces of Napoleon who may have done most to demolish and flatten major fortresses as at Klagenfurt. Houses were now being built against the walls and in the ditches or moats of many towns and new ring roads started to appear. In Vienna, Mayor Karl Luger undertook the massive demolition task of removing the highly fortified bastions and replacing them with the Ringstrasse. Demolition of walls and towers continued into the 20th century, but <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> growing feeling that they should be preserved for their historic interest. Possibly the first instance of the deliberate conservation of a town wall was in 1909 when the Imperial Ministry of Culture and Education granted Drosendorf 3,000 crowns to undertake a repair programme. At Radkersburg, a start was made on the preservation and display of the elaborate fortifications as early as the 1920s. Hitler, whose birthplace was Braunau am Inn, was aware of the demolition of the north gate-tower of the town in 1893 and had plans prepared (unexecuted) to rebuild it. More recently there has been widespread conservation work undertaken on the town defences of towns such as Weitra, Zwettl, Hainburg, Drosendorf, and Radstadt.|$|E
2500|$|The 49 run {{deficit was}} thought to be counterbalanced by the runs England could expect to get on a plumb wicket, but such hope were quickly dispelled. Richardson was out yet again trying to play the ball through the slips and being caught by Neil Harvey off Ian Meckiff. Willie Watson showed his lack of {{practice}} and was beaten by the pace of Alan Davidson. The 60,000 crowd were now strongly behind the Australian team and Tom Graveney's entry in the MCG was compared to the arrival of a Christian being fed to the lions in the Colosseum. He received a sharply rising ball from Ian Meckiff which was caught at full stretch by [...] "The Claw" [...] at short-fine-leg. Peter May joined Trevor Bailey, who was back to his usual stone-walling self and had stayed in for an almost an hour for 14 when he was finely caught by Jim Burke, also at short-fine leg, off a brute of a ball from Meckiff that rose high and hit his glove and bat-handle. Meckiff was bowling with far more accuracy than normal, but retained his fast pace and both he and Davidson bowled left-arm over the wicket, an unusual type of delivery that unsettled the England team. Benaud had also set a short-fine-leg with a short-leg behind him to catch the rising ball as the batsmen fended it off their body. Colin Cowdrey stayed in for 19 minutes before he played at a ball slanting wide across him and was caught by Wally Grout. Godfrey Evans went for a run which wasn't there and cracked his finger as his flung himself at the crease trying to make his ground. May, who had played a typically self-denying innings of 17 in 98 minutes when he was caught by Davidson off Meckiff, again the ball was angled awkwardly across his body. <b>Now</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only the tail to dismiss and they fell quickly; Tony Lock caught and bowled by Davidson, Jim Laker caught by in the slips by Harvey off Davidson and Peter Loader bowled by Meckiff for a duck to leave England 87 all out. Ian Meckiff (6/38) took the best Test figures of his career, backed up by superlative catching from the Australian fielders and Davidson's 3/41.|$|E
