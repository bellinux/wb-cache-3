5|$|I did <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> in any {{way with}} the dispositions made by the police {{authorities}} on the spot. I never overruled those authorities nor overrode them. From beginning to end the police had an absolutely free hand.... I did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers. I was not consulted {{as to whether they}} should be sent for.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of MTBI {{involves}} {{general measures}} such as wearing seat belts and using airbags in cars. Older people are encouraged to reduce fall risk by keeping floors free of clutter and wearing thin, flat, shoes with hard soles that do <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with balance.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{content in}} bulk may be {{determined}} by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO2)2ZnNa(CH3CO2)Â·6H2O precipitates and can be weighed. Caesium and rubidium do <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may {{be determined by}} atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.|$|E

5|$|The ferry {{marks the}} {{starting}} point of the Great River Race and is on the course of the Twickenham Regatta. As the ferry has right-of-way over rowed craft, the races have to be carefully timed to ensure that the ferry does <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with their running.|$|E
5|$|A dam {{was built}} across the Cefni river north of Llangefni {{in the late}} 1940s to {{increase}} the water supply available to the island. The new reservoir, Llyn Cefni, crossed the railway's trackbed, and a bridge was built to support it. A second reservoir, Llyn Alaw, was formed adjacent to the railway north of Llanerchymedd in the 1960s, but did <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with the line's alignment.|$|E

5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} travels to Kuldahar, they meet a drow (dark elf) named Nym, who tells {{them that the}} pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an {{alternate}} path through the Underdark exists. Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group to <b>not</b> <b>interfere.</b> The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E
5|$|Between the 30th and the 1st, The Sun {{reported}} that the remaining strikers had declared they would <b>not</b> <b>interfere,</b> but were confident the company {{would be unable to}} find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had little trouble in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E

5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus. Veneration of Serapis and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern world to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E

5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> in day-to-day administration, she probably {{had the power}} to command the governors in the organization of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that {{did not wish to}} become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
50|$|In November 28, 2012, {{the legal}} battle between JYJ and S.M. finally ended. Both sides agreed to {{retiring}} every judicial accusation {{against each other}} and <b>not</b> <b>interfering</b> in each other's actions.|$|R

5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and {{the lack}} of any {{suitable}} place for aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required a number of features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with stations that were already operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also necessary to keep OTUs as far away from enemy airspace as possible, while the sensitive airspace over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} with Epstein on 24 January 1962 which gave Epstein 10â15 per cent of their income. They signed a new contract in October 1962 which gave Epstein 15, 20, or 25 per cent of revenues, {{depending on how much}} he helped the band earn. The Beatles would then share any income after various expenses had been deducted. Epstein then formed a management company, NEMS Enterprises, telling his parents that managing the group was only a part-time occupation and would <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> with the family business.|$|E
5|$|When the {{war started}} Seward turned his {{attention}} to making sure that foreign powers did <b>not</b> <b>interfere</b> in the conflict. When in April 1861, the Confederacy announced that it would authorize privateers, Seward sent word to the American representatives abroad that the U.S. would become party to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law of 1856, outlawing such vessels, but Britain required that, if the U.S. were to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.|$|E
60|$|Selfishness is {{not living}} as {{one wishes to}} live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live: and unselfishness is letting other people's lives alone, <b>not</b> <b>interfering</b> with them.|$|R
