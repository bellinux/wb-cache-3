5|$|After {{his first}} novel, The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least one}} book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|E

5|$|Byzantines availed {{themselves}} {{of a number}} of diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. According to Dimitri Obolensky, the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{reassessment}} of James {{in the past}} two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least {{for as long as the}} royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E

Robert was involved in the conflict <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation.

In 1793, deputies to the Grodno Sejm, the last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of Russian forces, agreed to the Russian and Prussian territorial demands. The Grodno Sejm became infamous <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> the last sejm of the Commonwealth, but because its deputies had been bribed and coerced by the Russians (Russia and Prussia wanted legal sanction from Poland for their demands).|$|E

5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain.
