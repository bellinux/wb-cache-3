40|$|A {{confirming}} {{check was}} performed to verify that the fuel assembly structural integrity is not impacted by the TPBARs. The structural adequacy of Westinghouse fuel assembly design is evaluated using NRC requirements for combined seismic and LOCA loads per Appendix A to the SRP 4. 2 and the approved methodology (Reference 1). The grid load results for the fuel assembly design in Watts Bar Unit 1 were reviewed. Based on the combined seismic and LOCA grid load there is a sufficient amount of grid load margin. The total weight for 24 TPBARs plus the holddown assembly is approximately 62 lbs, which is approximately 4 % {{of the weight of}} a typical fuel assembly. Because the TPBAR assembly is a hanging structure supported by the top nozzle adapter plate of the fuel assembly and the rodlets are hanging in the guide thimble tubes, the added weight can be considered {{to be a part of}} the fuel assembly <b>nozzle</b> <b>support.</b> The added TPBAR assembly weight, together with the rodlet stiffness, has an insignificant effect on the fuel assembly's dynamic characteristics. Therefore, the design basis analyses/evaluations performed for the fuel assembly structural integrity assessment for Watts Bar remain applicable.

(LibertyWorksLW) began {{considering}} {{the development of}} CMC exhaust forced mixers in 2008, {{as a means of}} obtaining reduced weight and hotter operating temperature capability, while minimizing shape distortion during operation, which would improve mixing efficiency and reduce fuel burn. Increased component durability, enhanced ability to fabricate complex-shaped components, and engine noise reduction are other potential advantages of CMC mixers (compared to metallic mixers). In 2010, NASA was pursuing the reduction of NOx emissions, fuel burn, and noise from turbine engines in Phase I of the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project. ERA subtasks, including those focused on CMC components, were formulated with the goal of maturing technology from proof of concept validation (TRL 3) to a systemsubsystem or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL 6). In April 2010, the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and LibertyWorks jointly initiated a CMC Exhaust System Validation Program within the ERA Project, teaming on CMC exhaust mixer development for subsonic jet engines capable of operating with increased performance. Our initial focus was on designing, fabricating, and characterizing the thrust and acoustic performance of a roughly quarter-scale 16 -lobe oxide oxide CMC mixer and tail cone along with a conventional low bypass exhaust <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Support</b> Services, LLC (Allendale, MI) and ATK COI Ceramics, Inc. (COIC, in San Diego, CA) supported the design of a subscale nozzle assembly that consisted of an oxide oxide CMC mixer and center body, with each component mounted on a metallic attachment ring. That design was based upon the operating conditions a mixer would experience in a turbofan engine. Validation of the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of the subscale mixer via testing and the achievement of TRL 4 encouraged the NASALWCOIC team to move to the next phase where a full scale CMC mixer sized for a RR AE 3007 engine and a compatible attachment flange were designed, followed by CMC component fabrication by COIC, and vibration testing at GRC under conditions simulating the structural and dynamic environment encountered during engine operation. AFRL (WPAFB) supported this testing by performing 3 D laser vibrometry to identify the mixer mode shapes and modal frequencies. The successful fabrication and testing of such a component has been achieved. The CMC mixer demonstrated good durability during vibration testing at room and elevated temperature (TRL 5).

40|$|AbstractBuckling {{collapse}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} failure modes of pressure vessel. But, in the past protection against collapse from bulking has not been implemented as required by codes, especially local buckling. The situation is attributed to two reasons. The first one is that pressure vessel code usually only provided design method by rules to protect against global bulking of shell under conventional loads, such as external pressure or axial compression load. However, local bulking may occur in some local discontinuity regions rather than global region and has to be evaluated using design method by analysis. The second one is that bulking analysis based on numerical method (e. g. FEA) is more sophisticated to implement compared to typical strength analysis due to non-uniqueness of result, initial imperfection, mesh generation and other reasons. The case studied in this paper is that a heavy attaching equipment was closely connected the main equipment by triangular steel structure instead of typical shirt support for the purpose of space saving. The key point of this project case is that the 240 -ton attaching equipment causes significant compress stress in the local regions such as the bottom of <b>nozzle,</b> shirt <b>support</b> of main equipment and triangular steel structure. Regarding the loads, not only weight but also wind, seismic load etc. and their load cases combinations should be considered in the bulking analysis. With this case, the paper introduced the basic principles, implementation procedures and software applications of local buckling analysis of pressure vessel. At the end, this paper proposed some suggestion for the Chinese code of bulking analysis through this typical case study...|$|R

For {{liquid fertilizer}}s, variable-orifice nozzles are being implemented since they provide a much larger nozzle flow range compared to traditional fixed orifice nozzles. However, understanding the performance of variable-orifice nozzles under different field operating conditions has been limited. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of variable orifice <b>nozzles</b> in <b>support</b> of variable-rate application. Two common variable-orifice nozzles offered by different companies were selected for this study. They were tested over three flow ranges (0. 76 to 1. 89 L/min) with all tests replicated three times. A commercially available 18. 6 -m, wet boom sprayer equipped with 37 nozzle bodies was used. Nozzles were numbered but then randomly assigned a position along the boom. To evaluate the performance of an individual nozzle, three random nozzle locations along the spray boom were established for both sets of nozzles. Therefore, 18 tests per replication were required to include the 3 flow rates, 3 different locations, and 2 nozzle types. Once the desired flow rate test was established, tip flow was measured using SpotOn Sprayer Calibrator technology. Tip flows were recorded and statistical analyses performed to evaluate flow uniformity (CV) across the boom but also detect off-rate errors by individual nozzles and locations across the boom. With the exception of a few nozzles, the uniformity across the spray boom, as defined by the CV, was acceptable for both nozzle types over approximately a 2 : 1 flow range. Both nozzle types were less uniform at the low flow rate. There were three nozzles of each type that resulted in unacceptable flow errors in multiple tests. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R

Such thrust vectoring is achieved by small secondary ports in the nozzle body that are perpendicular to the main nozzle. The testing conducted included characterizing and comparing {{the performance of a}} straight aerospike nozzle to that of a thrust-vectored aerospike nozzle. Throttling effects on the aerospike nozzle in an unvectored and in a vectored configuration were also investigated. The interaction between throttling and thrust vectoring of an aerospike nozzle is the focus of this thesis research. This research shows that large-throat/high-thrust operation of an aerospike nozzle provides little thrust vector generation. Conversely, small-throat/low-thrust operation provides ample thrust vector generation. These results have implications in the effectiveness of thrust vectoring an aerospike nozzle with secondary ports. Rockets having an aerospike nozzle with throttling capabilities will be subject to the minimum and maximum turn angles for a given throttle position. As such, certain vehicle maneuvers might not be obtainable at certain throttle operations. Conversely, at lower throttling conditions, higher turn angles will be achievable...|$|R
40|$|During over-expanded {{operation}} of rocket nozzles, which is defined {{to be when}} the exit pressure is greater than internal pressure over {{some part of the}} nozzle, the nozzle will experience a transverse forcing function due to the pressure differential across the nozzle wall. Overexpansion occurs during the nozzle start-up and shutdown transient, even in high-altitude engines, because most test facilities cannot completely reproduce the near-vacuum pressures at those altitudes. During this transient, the pressure differential moves axially down the nozzle as it becomes pressurized, but this differential is never perfectly symmetric circumferentially. The character of the forcing function is highly complex and defined by a series of restricted and free shock separations. The subject of this paper is the determination of the magnitude of this loading during sub-scale testing via measurement of the structural dynamic response of the <b>nozzle</b> and its <b>support</b> structure.

Elevated temperature is one of static loads that influences the boundary conditions of the piping structure thus generating pump nozzle loadings leading to possible pump body deflection. Deflected shape of the pump body results in generation of flow fluctuation, visible and measurable as a pressure pulsation.

Measured on–site pressure pulsation at pumps nozzles has been identified and assumed to be the source of the acoustic waves. In the simulation elastic features of the piping structure as well as the fluid, and pressure loses in pipes, taken into account. Final result of the acoustic part of the simulation was spectral characteristics of the acoustic shock forces, defined further as harmonic loads for the dynamic structural analysis.

40|$|The {{new source}} model was {{combined}} with the original sound propagation model developed for rectangular jets to produce {{a new version of}} the rectangular jet noise prediction code. This code was validated using a set of rectangular nozzles whose geometries were specified by NASA. Nozzles of aspect ratios two, four and eight were studied at jet exit Mach numbers of 0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 9, for a total of nine cases. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions for these jets were provided to the contactor for use as input to the code. Quantitative comparisons of the predicted azimuthal and polar directivity of the acoustic spectrum were made with experimental data provided by NASA. The results of these comparisons, along with a documentation of the propagation and source models, were reported in a journal article publication (Ref. 4). The complete set of computer codes and computational modules that make up the prediction scheme, along with a user's guide describing their use and example test cases, was provided to NASA as a deliverable of this task. The use of conformal mapping, along with simplified modeling of the mean flow field, for noise propagation modeling was explored for other <b>nozzle</b> geometries, to <b>support</b> the task milestone of developing methods which are applicable to other geometries and flow conditions of interest to NASA. A model to represent twin round jets using this approach was formulated and implemented. A general approach to solving the equations governing sound propagation in a locally parallel nonaxisymmetric jet was developed and implemented, in aid of the tasks and milestones charged with selecting more exact numerical methods for modeling sound propagation, and developing methods that have application to other nozzle geometries. The method is based on expansion of both the mean-flowdependent coefficients in the governing equation and the Green's function in series of orthogonal functions. The method was coded and tested on two analytically prescribed mean flows which were meant to represent noise reduction concepts being considered by NASA. Testing (Ref. 5) showed that the method was feasible for the types of mean flows of interest in jet noise applications. Subsequently, this method was further developed to allow use of mean flow profiles obtained from a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solution of the flow. Preliminary testing of the generalized code was among the last tasks completed under this contract. The stringent noise-reduction goals of NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program suggest that, in addition to potentially complex exhaust nozzle geometries, next generation aircraft will also involve tighter integration of the engine with the airframe. Therefore, noise generated and propagated by jet flows in the vicinity of solid surfaces is expected to be quite significant, and reduced-order noise prediction tools will be needed that can deal with such geometries. One important source of noise is that generated by the interaction of a turbulent jet with the edge of a solid surface (edge noise). Such noise is generated, for example, by the passing of the engine exhaust over a shielding surface, such as a wing. Work under this task supported an effort to develop a RANS-based prediction code for edge noise based on an extension of the classical Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) to transversely sheared base flows (Refs. 6 and 7). The RDT-based theoretical analysis was applied to the generic problem of a turbulent jet interacting with the trailing edge of a flat plate. A code was written to evaluate the formula derived for the spectrum of the noise produced by this interaction and results were compared with data taken at NASA Glenn for a variety of jet/plate configurations and flow conditions (Ref. 8). A longer-term goal of this task was to work toward the development of a high-fidelity model of sound propagation in spatially developing non-axisymmetric jets using direct numerical methods for solving the relevant equations. Working with NASA Glenn Acoustics Branch personnel, numerical methods and boundary conditions appropriate for use in a high-resolution calculation of the full equations governing sound propagation in a steady base flow were identified. Computer codes were then written (by NASA) and tested (by OAI) for an increasingly complex set of flow conditions to validate the methods. The NASA-supplied codes were ported to the High-End Computing resources of the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility for testing and validation against analytical (where possible) and independent numerical solutions. The cases which were completed during the course of this contract were solutions of the two-dimensional linearized Euler equations with no mean flow, a uniform mean flow and a nonuniform mean flow representative of a parallel flow jet...|$|R
