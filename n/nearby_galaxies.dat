5|$|Possibly {{related to}} active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear {{emission}}-line regions (LINERs).

Approximately one-third of <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies</b> are classified as containing LINER nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies,</b> it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies</b> (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies.</b> While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E

5|$|There {{are about}} fifty blue {{point-like}} {{objects in the}} HDF. Many seem {{to be associated with}} <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies,</b> which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense star formation. Others may be distant quasars. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies</b> (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E
5|$|Such mergers were theorized {{to produce}} kilonovae, and {{evidence}} for a kilonova associated with GRB 130603B was seen. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests (because of causality) a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms; less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 60,000km or 37,000 miles—four times the Earth's diameter). This further suggests a very compact object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole {{in less than two}} seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, {{over a longer period of}} time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|E

25|$|Novae {{have some}} promise {{for use as}} {{standard}} candle measurements of distances. For instance, the distribution of their absolute magnitude is bimodal, with a main peak at magnitude −8.8, and a lesser one at −7.5. Novae also have roughly the same absolute magnitude 15 days after their peak (−5.5). Comparisons of nova-based distance estimates to various <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies</b> and galaxy clusters with those measured with Cepheid variable stars, have shown them to be of comparable accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Milky Way experiences roughly 30 to 60 novae per year, but a recent examination has found the likely improved rate of about 50±27. The number of novae discovered in the Milky Way each year is much lower, about 10, which likely, is explained by gas and dust absorption by the Milky Way, that is obscuring distant novae. Roughly 25 novae brighter than about the twentieth magnitude are discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy each year and smaller numbers are seen in other <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|E

25|$|What {{already has}} been {{observed}} directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of <b>nearby</b> <b>galaxies</b> have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with {{a high concentration of}} matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.|$|E
