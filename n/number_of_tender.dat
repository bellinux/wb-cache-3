40|$|Objective : Fibromyalgia {{syndrome}} (FMS) is {{a chronic}} rheumatological condition {{which could be}} characterized by generalized pain and fatigue. Cognitive and behavioral therapy {{has been found to}} be a suitable technique in the management of FMS. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy of electromyography (EMG) biofeedback to reduce pain in patients with FMS. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled trial involving two groups of FMS patients, one receiving EMG biofeedback and the other a sham biofeedback, was carried out. The assessment tools included in the study were fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), visual analogue scale (VAS), six-minute walk test (SMWT) and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points; and tenderness of each tender point was done for both the groups. Statistics: A Student&#x 2032;s &#x 2032;t&#x 2032; test was used to study the test for significance. Results: After using biofeedback, the mean VAS scores and the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points were found to be 3 out of 10 and 6 out of 18 respectively. Subjective analysis from both groups showed improvement in physical and psychological realms.

To correlate these data with the score in a functional questionnaire (a validated, French-language version of the neck pain and disability scale). PatientsFifty-nine ambulatory patients (26 males and 33 females, mean±SD age: 46. 3 ± 12 yrs) with common neck pain but no radiation below the elbow. MethodsTwo medical practitioners (a junior and a senior consultant) assessed neck rotation (in degrees) {{and the presence of}} pain during maximum neck flexion and extension, muscle palpation trapezius, levator scapulae, splenius cervicis, semispinalis) and cervical spine palpation. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated for qualitative variables. Angular rotational values (as a continuous variable) were compared using the p coefficient. Pearson coefficient was used to correlate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> spots to the results of the questionnaire. ResultsThere was no significant interexaminer difference (± 10 °) in the neck rotation measurement. Kappa was (i) 0. 71 and 0. 76 for pain in flexion or extension, respectively, (ii) 0. 44 on average for palpation of various muscles and (iii) 0. 53 on average for cervical spine palpation. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> spots correlated strongly with the questionnaire score (Pearson's coefficient: 0. 35; p= 0. 007).

40|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) is a {{clinical}} syndrome {{defined by the}} presence of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and the presence of at least 11 of 18 body tender points and these features are often accompanied by other symptoms such as fatigue, poor sleep quality, loss of memory, and mood disturbance. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect the differences in cerebral chemical changes between FM patients and control participants. Thirty patients with primary FM (27 females and three males) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University Hospitals. Patients with primary FM fulfill the American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of FM. Ten persons were needed as healthy control participants with the same age and sex as the included patients. 1 H-MRS unit was used to assess N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and their ratios from both hippocampi. Our Results showed the following: {{there was a significant difference}} in the level of l-hippocampal (NAA) and right hippocampus Cho and the levels of hippocampal glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in the patient group compared with the control group. There is a highly significant difference between the level of Rt and Lt hippocampal Glx in the same patient, highly significant difference in the level of Rt and Lt hippocampal NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and left hippocampal Cho/Cr ratios between cases and controls, and there was a negative correlation between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points and the level of Lt hippocampal Cr. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points and the level of Rt hippocampal NAA and Lt hippocampal Ch/Cr ratios, highly significant difference between the level of Rt hippocampal NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Lt NAA/Cr and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points, and a highly significant difference between the level of Rt hippocampal NAA/Cho, Rt NAA/Cr, Lt NAA/Cr, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points (P < 0. 001).
