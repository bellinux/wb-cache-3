5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, {{ruthenium}} and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of oxidation states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in <b>normal</b> <b>air</b> to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.|$|E

25|$|A Bose–Einstein {{condensate}} (BEC) is a {{state of}} matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent. A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of <b>normal</b> <b>air,</b> to ultra-low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the decades, the {{management}} of heat density has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers. The large amount of heat generated by a system may also have other effects, such as reducing the lifetime of other system components. There have been diverse approaches to heat management, from pumping Fluorinert through the system, to a hybrid liquid-air cooling system or air cooling with <b>normal</b> <b>air</b> conditioning temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} (EP) is {{a disease}} in which an eosinophil, a type of white blood cell, accumulates in the lung.
