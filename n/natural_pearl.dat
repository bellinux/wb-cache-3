25|$|Pearl {{farmers can}} culture a pearl {{by placing a}} nucleus, usually a piece of {{polished}} mussel shell, inside the oyster. In three to seven years, the oyster can produce a perfect pearl. These pearls are not as valuable as natural pearls, but look exactly the same. In fact, {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, when several researchers discovered how to produce artificial pearls, the cultured pearl market has far outgrown the <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> market.|$|E

50|$|When a {{cultured pearl}} with a bead nucleus is X-rayed, it reveals a {{different}} structure {{to that of}} a <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> (see diagram). A beaded cultured pearl shows a solid center with no concentric growth rings, whereas a <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> shows a series of concentric growth rings. A beadless cultured pearl (whether of freshwater or saltwater origin) may show growth rings, but also a complex central cavity, witness of the first precipitation of the young pearl sac.|$|E
5000|$|Single <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> {{are often}} sold as collectors' items, or set as centerpieces in unique jewelry. Very few matched strands of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> exist, {{and those that}} do often sell for {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars. (In 1917, jeweler Pierre Cartier purchased the Fifth Avenue mansion that is now the New York Cartier store in exchange for a matched double strand of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> Cartier had been collecting for years; at the time, it was valued at US$1 million.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> {{are nearly}} 100% calcium {{carbonate}} and conchiolin. It {{is thought that}} <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> form under a set of accidental conditions when a microscopic intruder or parasite enters a bivalve mollusk and settles inside the shell. The mollusk, irritated by the intruder, forms a pearl sac of external mantle tissue cells and secretes the calcium carbonate and conchiolin to cover the irritant. This secretion process is repeated many times, thus producing a <b>pearl.</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> come in many shapes, with perfectly round ones being comparatively rare.|$|R

5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} pearls, {{but only the}} pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. <b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|R

50|$|A well-equipped gem testing {{laboratory}} can distinguish <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> from cultured pearls by using gemological X-ray equipment {{to examine the}} center of a pearl. With X-rays it is possible to see the growth rings of the pearl, where the layers of calcium carbonate are separated by thin layers of conchiolin. The differentiation of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> from non-beaded cultured pearls can be very difficult without the use of this X-ray technique.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{setting and}} arrangement of these nine gems {{is shown in}} the illustration. A ruby (representing the Sun) is always in the center, surrounded (clockwise from the top) by a diamond, a <b>natural</b> <b>pearl,</b> red coral, hessonite, a blue sapphire, cat's eye, a yellow sapphire, and an emerald. This is the same placement as the Nava-graha Yantra.|$|E
50|$|Mikimoto was {{extremely}} successful at promoting the new Japanese cultured pearl {{to the international}} jewellery industry. He challenged and won against the French <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> dealers in the French Courts who attempted to prevent the Japanese from describing their new cultured pearls as “pearls”. The French Court concluded that cultured pearls were indeed pearls. Mikimoto became the most famous Japanese pearl farmer.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{cultured pearls}} are less {{valuable}} than <b>natural</b> <b>pearls,</b> whereas imitation pearls have almost no value. One way that jewelers can {{determine whether a}} pearl is cultured or natural {{is to have a}} gemlab perform an X-ray examination of the pearl. If X-rays reveals a nucleus, the pearl is likely a bead-nucleated saltwater pearl. If no nucleus is present, but irregular and small dark inner spots indicating a cavity are visible, combined with concentric rings of organic substance, the pearl is likely a cultured freshwater. Cultured freshwater pearls can often be confused for <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> which present as homogeneous pictures which continuously darken toward the surface of the <b>pearl.</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> will often show larger cavities where organic matter has dried out and decomposed.|$|R

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> {{were the}} oldest gems known to mankind.

The Vedas of India, the Bible and the Quran make several reference of pearls as objects of adoration and worship. The <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> of the Gulf of Mannar and the Persian Gulf enjoyed very good reputation in the world trade from the time immemorial. The Gulf of Mannar pearls are famous throughout the world as 'Orient Pearls'...|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Oriental Pride is most likely the Middle East, where {{in the region of}} Basra, natural pearls were found more than 100 years ago. After the rise of the oil {{industry}} in the Middle East, the pollution created by the same industry has distincted the <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> oysters' natural habitat. Hence there is hardly any saltwater sea left that would form a natural habitat for the oysters of natural pearls.|$|E

50|$|South Sea pearl oysters were {{in limited}} {{supply in the}} Philippines, and Iwasaki’s project {{initially}} struggled to survive. The project was moved from the Philippines to Indonesia to Palau, and finally imported live pearl oysters from Arnhem Land in North Australia, but continued to be restricted by an inadequate supply of pearl oysters. Australia had the world’s greatest supply of pearl beds of South Sea pearl oysters, however pearl culture was prohibited {{at that time in}} Australia by the Australian Government to protect the all-important North Australian <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> industry.|$|E

25|$|Pearl oysters are not {{closely related}} to true oysters, being members of a {{distinct}} family, the feathered oysters (Pteriidae). Both cultured <b>pearls</b> and <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> can be extracted from pearl oysters, though other molluscs, such as the freshwater mussels, also yield pearls of commercial value.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{natural pearls}} {{were found in}} many parts of the world. Present day natural {{pearling}} is confined mostly to seas off Bahrain. Australia also has one of the world's last remaining fleets of pearl diving ships. Australian pearl divers dive for south sea pearl oysters to be used in the cultured south sea pearl industry. The catch of pearl oysters is similar to the numbers of oysters taken during the <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> days. Hence significant numbers of natural pearls are still found in the Australian Indian Ocean waters from wild oysters. X-ray examination is required to positively verify natural pearls found today.|$|E
5000|$|Except to {{the extent}} of noting that {{extremely}} small pearls (<2mm) are not cultivated, since there is no incentive to do so because naturally occurring tiny pearls are relatively plentiful, it is usually not possible to determine which of these caused an individual keshi pearl to grow. Because most keshi pearls come from farms where they are commonly and deliberately cultivated, it is necessary to classify keshi as cultivated / cultured pearls. Any <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> (without nucleus) may be called a keshi pearl, but doing so would be rather meaningless without mentioning the species of mollusc in which the pearl grew, or at least its geographic provenance. Use of [...] "keshi pearl" [...] without provenance is confusing and should be avoided.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} and {{advance of the}} cultured pearl hit the pearl industry hard. Pearl dealers publicly disputed the authenticity of these new cultured products, and left many consumers uneasy and confused about their much lower prices. Essentially, the controversy damaged the images of both <b>natural</b> and cultured <b>pearls.</b> By the 1950s, when {{a significant number of}} women in developed countries could afford their own cultured <b>pearl</b> necklace, <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> were reduced to a small, exclusive niche in the pearl industry.|$|R

Traders from India, where <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> were harvested and processed during past centuries, needed no sales talk to be convinced that they could sell Japan Akoya keshi in their market and to visiting Arabs as <b>natural</b> <b>pearls,</b> because their close similarities. Having access to Indian labor capable of sorting, drilling and stringing tiny pearls, arrangements were made to send Japanese keshi pearls to India (even during many years in which imports were not sanctioned); provide processing services at conditions without rival; and covertly retain pearls for sale in India under an allowance for pearls ruined in the course of processing.|$|R
