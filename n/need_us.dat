500|$|During {{the dispute}} with Taylor over the High National Council in December, Khánh {{had tried to}} frame the dispute in {{nationalist}} terms, {{in an attempt to}} rally support around himself against what he saw as overbearing US influence. This worked for a while, as Taylor had angrily berated Khánh's generals, {{but in the long run}} it failed, as South Vietnam and the generals' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Khánh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding. On occasions during the December stand-off, Khánh had appealed to his colleagues to support the expulsion of Taylor from the country. The ambassador said that US support for South Vietnam would end if he was expelled, and the generals backed down, but Khánh said the military did not <b>need</b> <b>US</b> aid. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor credited the fear of US abandonment for having [...] "raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking him", as many were seen as beholden to their desire for personal advancement above all.|$|E

The ships provided a source of income to the devastated Haitian economy and delivered valuable relief supplies to the affected. Furthermore, the company promised to donate all proceeds from the visit to help the earthquake victims. Most passengers on board understood this, although some were [...] "sickened" [...] by the company's decision to dock in Haiti. Associate vice president John Weis defended the company's decision by stating that the company had [...] "tremendous opportunities to use our ships as transport vessels for relief supplies and personnel to Haiti…. Simply put, we cannot abandon Haiti now that they <b>need</b> <b>us</b> most." [...] The Labadee resort is leased to Royal Caribbean by the Government of Haiti.|$|E

6000|$|I {{will give}} one curious example {{from one of}} the best and most {{brilliant}} of the Zionists. Dr. Weizmann is a man of large mind and human sympathies; {{and it is difficult to}} believe that any one with so fine a sense of humanity can be entirely empty of anything like a sense of humour. Yet, in the middle of a very temperate and magnanimous address on [...] "Zionist Policy," [...] he can actually say a thing like this, [...] "The Arabs <b>need</b> <b>us</b> with our knowledge, and our experience and our money. If they do not have us they will fall into the hands of others, they will fall among sharks." [...] One is tempted for the moment to doubt whether any one else in the world could have said that, except the Jew with his strange mixture of brilliancy and blindness, of subtlety and simplicity. It is much as if President Wilson were to say, [...] "Unless America deals with Mexico, it will be dealt with by some modern commercial power, that has trust-magnates and hustling millionaires." [...] But would President Wilson say it? It is as if the German Chancellor had said, [...] "We must rush to the rescue of the poor Belgians, or they may be put under some system with a rigid militarism and a bullying bureaucracy." [...] But would even a German Chancellor put it exactly like that? Would anybody put it in the exact order of words and structure of sentence in which Dr. Weizmann has put it? Would even the Turks say, [...] "The Armenians <b>need</b> <b>us</b> with our order and our discipline and our arms. If they do not have us they will fall into the hands of others, they will perhaps be in danger of massacres." [...] I suspect that a Turk would see the joke, even if it were as grim a joke as the massacres themselves. If the Zionists wish to quiet the fears of the Arabs, surely the first thing to do is to discover what the Arabs are afraid of. And very little investigation will reveal the simple truth that they are very much afraid of sharks; and that in their book of symbolic or heraldic zoology it is the Jew who is adorned with the dorsal fin and the crescent of cruel teeth. This may be a fairy-tale about a fabulous animal; but it is one which all sorts of races believe, and certainly one which these races believe.|$|E
6000|$|Nor is the Army less an object, perhaps almost more. Nay, at one time, old Kur-Pfalz being {{reckoned}} in a dying condition, Friedrich Wilhelm {{is about}} ranking his men, {{prepared to fight}} for his rights in Julich and Berg; Kaiser having openly gone over, and joined with France against his Majesty in that matter. However, the old Kur-Pfalz did not die, and there came nothing of fight in Friedrich Wilhelm's time. But his History, on the political side, is henceforth mainly a commentary to him on that [...] "word" [...] he heard in Priort, [...] "which was {{as if you had}} turned a dagger in my heart!" [...] With the Kaiser he has fallen out: there arise unfriendly passages between them, sometimes sarcastic on Friedrich Wilhelm's part, in reference to this very War now ended. Thus, when complaint rose about the Prussian misbehaviors on their late marches (misbehaviors notable in Countries where their recruiting operations had been troubled), the Kaiser took a high severe tone, not assuaging, rather aggravating the matter; and, for his own share, winded up by a strict prohibition of Prussian recruiting in any and every part of the Imperial Dominions. Which Friedrich Wilhelm took extremely ill. This is from a letter of his to the Crown-Prince, and after the first gust of wrath had spent itself: [...] "It is a clear disadvantage, this prohibition of recruiting in the Kaiser's Countries. That is our thanks for the Ten Thousand men sent him, and for all the deference I have shown the Kaiser at all times; and by this you may see that it would be of no use if one even sacrificed oneself to him. So long as they <b>need</b> <b>us,</b> they continue to flatter; but no sooner is the strait thought to be over, and help not wanted, than they pull off the mask, and have not the least acknowledgment.
