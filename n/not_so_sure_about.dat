500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dumb Head" [...] was Arnell's fifth solo single, {{released}} {{over three}} years after her solo debut, and her second for MGM Records, following [...] "Trouble's Back In Town". [...] Her earlier records had been commercial failures, never charting and receiving little press. [...] The record company teamed her with arranger Al Gorgoni and producer Jim Vienneau. [...] Arnell initially disliked the song [...] "Dumb Head", later saying in an interview:I said to my manager, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> this song." [...] I didn't like calling myself a dumb head, especially as I had just graduated high school with high honours. [...] How could I call myself dumb and feel good about it? [...] But when we recorded it, with the kazoos {{in the background and}} all, it was fun. [...] It came out really good...|$|E
2500|$|Stylistically, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son {{developed}} the sounds first heard on Somewhere in Time, although, on this occasion, the synth effects {{were created by}} keyboards rather than bass or guitar synthesisers. According to Dickinson, the band decided not to hire a keyboard player, with the parts being [...] "mainly one-finger stuff from , Steve, the engineer or whoever had a finger free at the time." [...] Harris was fond of the development, {{in spite of the}} fact that the record did not sell as well as its predecessor in the United States; [...] "I thought it was the best album we did since Piece of Mind. I loved it because it was more progressive—I thought the keyboards really fitted in brilliantly—'cause that's the influences I grew up with, and I was so pissed off with the Americans, because they didn't really seem to accept it. Everyone said afterwards that it was a European-sounding album. I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> that. What's a European-sounding album? To me, it's just a Maiden-sounding album." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 14, 2007, Intelligence Squared held {{a debate}} in New York City titled Global Warming is Not a Crisis, moderated by Brian Lehrer. Crichton was on the for the motion side along with Richard Lindzen and Philip Stott against Gavin Schmidt, Richard Somerville, and Brenda Ekwurzel. Before the debate, the {{audience}} was largely on the against the motion side (57% vs. 30%, with 13% undecided). At {{the end of the}} debate, there was a notable shift in the audience vote to prefer for the motion side (46% vs. 42%, with 12% undecided), leaving the debate with the conclusion that Crichton's group won. Schmidt later described the debate in a RealClimate blog posting, [...] "Crichton went with the crowd-pleasing condemnation of private jet-flying liberals (very popular, even among the private jet-flying Eastsiders present) and the apparent hypocrisy of people who think that global warming is a problem using any energy at all." [...] While those against the motion had presented the agreed scientific consensus of IPCC reports, the audience was [...] "apparently more convinced by the entertaining narratives from Crichton and Stott (<b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> Lindzen) than they were by our drier fare. Entertainment-wise it's hard to blame them. Crichton is extremely polished and Stott has a touch of the revivalist preacher about him. Comparatively, we were pretty dull." [...] Even though Crichton inspired a lot of blog responses and it was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception to his message was mixed.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the study of}} natives’ ethnic status shows {{that there is a}} {{progressive}} decrease of native participants in the achieved status across age groups (from youngest to oldest: 32, 18, and 16 %), with higher representation in the other statuses. This may suggest that native adolescents initially identify with their nationality in opposition to other ethnicities, without any developmental process. When the developmental process begins, they start to question their ethnic identity and do <b>not</b> feel <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> it, increasing the exploration about the meaning of their ethnic identity.|$|R

60|$|The morning came. The sky, {{which had}} been remarkably clear down to {{within a day or}} two, was overcast, and the weather threatening, the wind having an unmistakable hint of water in it. Henchard wished he had <b>not</b> been quite <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the {{continuance}} of a fair season. But {{it was too late to}} modify or postpone, and the proceedings went on. At twelve o'clock the rain began to fall, small and steady, commencing and increasing so insensibly that it was difficult to state exactly when dry weather ended or wet established itself. In an hour the slight moisture resolved itself into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven, in torrents to which no end could be prognosticated.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} making a collective choice by means of approval-preferential voting. The existing proposals are briefly overviewed so as to point out several issues that leave to be desired. In particular, and following Condorcet's last views on elections, we pay a special attention to making sure that a good option is chosen rather than aiming for the best option but <b>not</b> being <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> it. We show that this goal is fulfilled in a well-defined sense by a method that we introduced in a previous paper and whose study is deepened here. This procedure, that we call path-revised approval choice, is based on interpreting the approval and paired-comparison scores as degrees of collective belief, revising them {{in the light of}} the existing implications by means of the so-called Theophrastus rule, and deciding about every option on the basis of the balance of revised degrees of belief for and against its approval. The computations rely on the path scores, which are used also in a method that was introduced by Markus Schulze in the spirit of looking for the best option. Besides dealing with the confidence in the respective results of both methods, we also establish several other properties of them, including a property of upper semicontinuity of the choice set with respect to the profile and a property of Pareto consistency (in a certain weak sense) ...|$|R
