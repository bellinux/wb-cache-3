50|$|The reason many network {{providers}} SIM lock {{their phones}} {{is that they}} offer phones at a discount to customers {{in exchange for a}} contract to pay {{for the use of the}} network for a specified time period, usually between one and three years. This business model allows the company to recoup the cost of the phone over the life of the contract. Such discounts are worth up to several hundred US dollars. If the phones were not locked, users might sign a contract with one company, get the discounted phone, then stop paying the monthly bill (thus breaking the contract) and start using the phone on another network or even sell the phone for a profit. SIM locking curbs this by prohibiting change of network (using a new SIM). SIM locking is very common if subsidized phones are sold with prepaid contracts. It is important to note, however, that the technology associated with the phone must be compatible with the technology being used by the <b>network</b> <b>carrier.</b> A GSM cell phone will only work with a GSM carrier and will not work on a CDMA network provider. Likewise, a CDMA cell phone will only work with a CDMA carrier and will not work on a GSM network provider.. Note that newer (2016+) high end mobile phones are capable of supporting both CDMA and GSM technologies, allowing customers to use their mobile devices on any network. Examples of these mobile devices are the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S8 smart phones.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{construction}} of a low cost airline network by analyzing JetBlue Airways' entry decisions into nonstop domestic U.

Adopting duration models with time-varying covariates, we find that JetBlue consistently avoided concentrated airports and targeted concentrated routes; network economies also affected entry positively. For non-stop entry into a route that has not been served on a non-stop basis before, our analysis reveals that the carrier focused on thicker routes and secondary airports, thereby avoiding direct confrontation with <b>network</b> <b>carriers.</b> Non-stop entry into existing non-stop markets, however, shows that JetBlue concentrated on longer-haul markets and avoided routes already operated by either other low cost <b>carriers</b> or <b>network</b> <b>carriers</b> under bankruptcy protection.

40|$|To {{comply with}} the {{simplicity}} principle of the archetypical low-cost carrier (LCC) business model, most LCCs do not actively offer connecting flights. Given the overall growth of the sector, more and more transfer opportunities between LCC flights have however emerged – albeit mostly as “self-hubbing” under the radar of airlines and airports. This paper assesses this transfer potential between LCC services in Europe over time, relative to the network of the full service <b>network</b> <b>carriers</b> (FSNCs). An SQL-based approach is applied to identify the number of marketable one-stop connections and airport-pairs from Official Airline Guide (OAG) schedules, considering pre-defined restrictions for connecting times and detour factors. The {{results indicate that the}} European LCC network now allows for about 162 k weekly one-stop connections, which is a big rise since 2006 but still far below the almost 725 k connections offered by the <b>network</b> <b>carriers.</b> At airport-pair level, though, the low-cost sector already comes relatively close to the <b>network</b> <b>carriers</b> (15. 9 k vs. 25. 3 k). The paper further identifies Barcelona, London Gatwick and London Stansted as largest potential transfer airports for low-cost connections and provides an overview of the most frequently served indirect airport-pairs. Finally, some operational and commercial restrictions are discussed that should be overcome to fully exploit the identified potential of flight connections between LCCs. This includes the questions of missed connections and baggage through-handling...|$|R
