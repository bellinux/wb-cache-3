In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again.

2500|$|An IWW newspaper, the Industrial Worker, wrote {{just before}} the U.S. {{declaration}} of war: [...] "Capitalists of America, we will fight against you, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>you!</b> There is not a {{power in the world}} that can make the working class fight if they refuse." [...] Yet when a declaration of war was passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1917, the IWW's general secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood became determined that the organization should adopt a low profile in order to avoid perceived threats to its existence. The printing of anti-war stickers was discontinued, stockpiles of existing anti-war documents were put into storage, and anti-war propagandizing ceased as official union policy. After much debate on the General Executive Board, with Haywood advocating a low profile and GEB member Frank Little championing continued agitation, Ralph Chaplin brokered a compromise agreement. A statement was issued that denounced the war, but IWW members were advised to channel their opposition through the legal mechanisms of conscription. They were advised to register for the draft, marking their claims for exemption [...] "IWW, opposed to war." ...|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, as Wei's mansion had no large halls, Emperor Taizong diverted the construction material {{that he was going}} to use for an imperial hall and constructed a hall for Wei in five days, and further awarded him with folding screens, bedding, a small table, and canes, hoping to comfort him. [...] When Wei wrote to thank him, Emperor Taizong wrote back, stating, [...] "I honor you for the people and the state, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> [...] Why thank me?" [...] Meanwhile, Chu, himself by now developing a reputation for offering adverse advice, was pointing out that Emperor Taizong's favors for Li Tai were creating uncertainties for officials, and Emperor Taizong, trying to stem the rumors that Li Tai would displace Li Chengqian, appointed Wei as a senior advisor to Li Chengqian. [...] When Wei grew better, he personally went to the palace to decline, but Emperor Taizong pointed out the symbolic importance of having someone as important as himself serve as Li Chengqian's advisor, stating that even if Wei could only lie on the bed, his being named a senior advisor to Li Chengqian would help clarify the situation.
