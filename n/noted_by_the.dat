5|$|As most {{explicitly}} <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first quatrain, {{the poem}} was {{originally intended to}} be sung. Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply melody and verse. However, due to the oral tradition of the time, the original melody of the song was not notated and {{over the course of}} time was forgotten.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general {{standard}} of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.|$|E

Christof's victory is <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local vampires, one of whom, Ecaterina the Wise, turns him into a vampire to prevent another clan from taking him.|$|E

5|$|In {{what would}} later become the second of two {{tropical}} cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988, an area of disturbed weather was first <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November1. Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Welpring.|$|E
5|$|Senegal competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. The country's {{appearance}} {{marked the}} second time it had competed at a Winter Olympics. This {{was the first time}} the country has entered more than a single athlete, with skiers Lamine Guèye and Alphonse Gomis both taking part. The lack of support staff meant that Guèye sought medical assistance from another team. Neither competitors won a medal, and Gomis was <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media for the number of falls he had on the slopes.|$|E
5|$|The NATO-Russia Council {{meeting was}} mostly <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> absence of both Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin and of any progress concerning the {{ratification of the}} adapted CFE treaty or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia and Moldova. NATO leaders further welcomed progress made by Ukraine towards membership in the NATO-Ukraine Commission meeting and discussed some general and mostly symbolic topics with its non-NATO counterparts during the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council meeting.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Mercator on the cartographic scene {{would have been}} <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cognoscenti who {{purchased}} Gemma's globe—the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor Charles V at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide {{an important source of}} income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of Arras, and Antoine's father, Nicholas Perrenot, the Chancellor of CharlesV.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of an astatine compound with hydrogen– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide– was <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned, there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride. It is easily oxidized; acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the At0 or At+ forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate astatine as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and precipitates readily as silver(I) iodide.|$|E
5|$|As the Polish troops {{entered the}} city, the first pogrom in modern Vilnius started, as <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Timothy D. Snyder, citing Michał Pius Römer. Dozens of people {{connected}} with the Lit-Bel were arrested, and some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all – Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule – as 65. Jews constituted close to one-half of Vilnius's population, according to the German census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in Vilnius were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
5|$|His {{character}} has {{also appeared in}} other media related to The King of Fighters franchise, including comic adaptations and The King of Fighters live-action film, and portrayed by British martial arts actor Ray Park. As the first boss character from The King of Fighters, the SNK staff created him {{to be one of}} the most difficult characters to defeat. His Omega Rugal form from 95 has been <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> staff to be their favorite boss to the point they added him in the Dream Match titles. Publications for video games and other media have provided praise and criticism for Rugal's character.|$|E
5|$|In late July2003, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist northwest of Chuuk in the Philippine Sea, and was first <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) early on July30. As atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout the day's duration, the system organized, and was upgraded to tropical depression status by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 0600UTC on July31, followed by the JTWC at 0600UTC and Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) six hours later. The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes. Tracking north-northwestward {{under the influence of}} a passing trough, the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600UTC on August2, thus receiving the name Morakot. At the time, the storm was well organized with a steady outflow pattern.|$|E

5|$|Kunu-ri is a {{crossroad}} {{village on}} the northern bank of the Kaechon River, one of Ch'ongch'on River's southern tributaries. As the Chinese counteroffensive grew in strength against the Eighth Army's center, Kunu-ri had become a major bottleneck for the US IX Corps' retreat. In an effort to stabilize the front on November 28, Walker ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to retreat from Kujang-dong and {{to set up a}} new defensive line at Kunu-ri. The importance of Kunu-ri was also <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, and on November 27, Peng instructed the PVA 38th Corps to cut the US IX Corps retreat route. The PVA 114th Division of the 38th Corps would capture Kunu-ri by marching westward on the road from Tokchon, while the PVA 112th Division would follow on a parallel route through the hills north of the road.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive, childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E
5|$|Newman's {{great success}} at ABC had been <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Broadcasting Corporation, whose {{executives}} were keen to revive their own drama department's fortunes {{in the face}} of fierce competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, eager for a new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the scenes}} were highly praised by reviewers. The closing scene with Arya taking her first lesson from the Braavosi Syrio Forel was highlighted. Maureen Ryan from AOL TV stated {{that it was her}} {{favorite}} scene of the series so far, and James Hibberd remarked upon the quality of all the child actors of the show and stated that Maisie Williams owned her role in this episode. Other scenes that were <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> critics were the father-daughter dialogue with Eddard Stark and Arya, King Robert remembering with the members of his Kingsguard their first killings, and Eddard attending his first session of the Small Council.|$|E
5|$|Sławomir Cenckiewicz {{also said}} that in 1983, when Wałęsa was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize, the secret police tried to embarrass him and leaked information about Wałęsa's previous collaboration with the government. By this time though, Wałęsa was already so popular that most Poles {{did not believe the}} official media and dismissed the allegations as a manipulation by the Communist authorities. The book's first print run sold out in Poland within hours. The book received substantial coverage in the media, provoked nationwide debate, and was <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> international press. Wałęsa vowed to sue the authors but never did.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Lucille {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity late on May30 with winds of 85km/h (50mph) {{and an estimated}} barometric pressure of 985mbar (hPa; 29.09inHg). At this time, the China Meteorological Administration assessed Lucille {{to have been a}} stronger system, attaining typhoon status with two-minute sustained winds estimated at 125km/h (78mph). Around 1700UTC on May31, the storm tracked approximately 65km (40mi) west of Iwo Jima. Roughly five hours later, it moved within 15km (10mi) of Chichi-jima where a pressure of 992mb (hPa; 29.30inHg) was measured. Sustained winds on Chichi-jima reached 95km/h (60mph); however, these were determined to be unrepresentative of Lucille's actual intensity due to natural funneling on the island. On June1, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it turned west-northwestward and continued over open waters. The remnants of Lucille were last <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> JMA on June4 as it crossed the International Date Line.|$|E
