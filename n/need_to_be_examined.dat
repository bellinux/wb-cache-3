25|$|Clerid beetles {{fall under}} the {{suborder}} Polyphaga. Key characteristics of Polyphaga are that the hind coxa (base of the leg), do not divide {{the first and second}} abdominal/ventral plates which are known as sternites. Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present. To further identify Clerid beetles, a few additional characteristics <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>examined.</b>|$|E
25|$|Women {{suffering}} from anorgasmia with no obvious psychological cause would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by their GP {{to check for}} absence of disease. Blood tests would {{also need to be}} done (full blood count, liver function, oestradiol/estradiol, total testosterone, SHBG, FSH/LH, prolactin, thyroid function, lipids and fasting blood sugar) to check for other conditions such as diabetes, lack of ovulation, low thyroid function or hormone imbalances. The normal thresholds for these tests and timing in a woman's menstrual cycle is detailed in Berman et al., 2005.|$|E

25|$|Small lung nodules {{identified}} on a thorax CT <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> for malignancy, thus {{a small portion}} of sample tissue is taken out in a needle procedure. The needle is advanced through the bronchial tree, or trans-thoracically, towards the position of the nodule. To make sure tissue is captured from the nodule as opposed to accidentally taking healthy lung tissue, imaging modalities such as mobile C-Arms, ultrasound, or bronchoscopes are used. The yield rate of biopsies in small nodules is reported to be between 33–50% in tumors smaller than 3cm.|$|E
25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{high school}} years usually have two semesters, {{starting}} in September and February. In some rural areas, operation {{may be subject to}} agricultural cycles. The number of lessons offered by school on a weekly basis is very subjective, and largely depends on the school's resources. In addition to normal lessons, periods for private study and extracurricular activity are provided as well. The academic curriculum consists of Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Ideology & Political Science, Music, Fine Arts, PE, Technology, Computing etc. Some schools may also offer vocational subjects. Generally speaking, Chinese, Mathematics and English are considered as three main subjects as they will definitely be examined in Gaokao.

500|$|Furthermore, Johnson {{believed}} that later editors both misunderstood {{the historical context}} of Shakespeare and his plays, and underestimated the degree of textual corruption that the plays exhibit. He {{believed that}} this was because [...] "The style of Shakespeare was in itself perplexed, ungrammatical, and obscure". To correct these problems, Johnson believed that the original works would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>examined,</b> and this became an issue in his Proposal. Johnson also believed that an edition of Shakespeare could provide him with the income and recognition that he needed. However, a full edition of Shakespeare would require a publisher to make a large commitment of time and money, so Johnson decided to begin by focusing on a single play, Macbeth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} {{rounding}} up at 0.5 {{is that for}} positive decimals, only the first figure after the decimal point needs be examined.

This is not true for negative decimals, such as −17.5000…, where all the fractional figures of the value <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> to determine if it should round to −17 (if it were −17.5000000) or to −18 (if it were −17.5000001 or lower).
