40|$|The {{question}} of the composition and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Esther {{continue to be a}} matter of debate as Esther studies of the last two decades show. This debate has, however, been conducted primarily perspective. from a historical and critical The latter half of this century, and the last three decades in particular, has seen the emergence of newer approaches to the text of Scripture. These approaches, influenced by the developments in literary theory, have resulted in an emphasis on the text as a literary unity and have encouraged a synchronic reading of biblical texts. I believe the questiop of the composition and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Esther can be fruitfully approached using these newer literary approaches. A literary reading of Esther, which demonstrates that it is a <b>narrative</b> <b>unity,</b> is done. The literary reading is synchronic in nature, and demonstrates that chiasticreversal underlies the whole of the Esther narrative. Moreover, careful attention is given to the literary devices of chiasmus and characterisation, which make a significant contribution to the <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Esther because of the inseparable link, which exists, between these literary elements. This inseparable link derives from the fact that the chiasmus found in Esther is characterised by the reversal of the positions, fortunes, and destinies of the main characters. Furthermore, the role and portrayal of the king is germane to the <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Esther beca~se intrinsic to the chiastic-reversal pattern in Esther is the role of the king in reversing the positions, fortunes and destinies of the main characters. Consequently his role will receive special attention. In addition, as a character, he can be seen as the glue <b>of</b> the <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Esther because of the pivotal role he plays in the story's chiastic-reversal pattern. It therefore follows that the way the narrative characterises him must receive attention. In this regard 'traditional' stereotypical descriptions of the king are discussed critically and a fresh perspective· of his character is offered.

40|$|Résumé de l'ouvrage) This volume {{contains}} the papers {{presented at the}} 47 th Colloquium Biblicum Lovaniense (Leuven, 1998). The general theme of the meeting was the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. Main papers on this topic were read by R. L. Brawley, J. Delobel, A. Denaux, J. A. Fitzmeyer, F. W. Horn, J. Kremer, A. Lindemann, O. Mainville, D. Marguerat, F. Neirynck, W. Radl, M. Rese, J. Taylor, C. M. Tuckett, and J. Verheyden. While {{a large majority of}} scholars agree that Luke intended his work to cover both the past and the continuing history of Jesus (Gospel and Acts), the essays also illustrate the complexities of this view on the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> when it comes to interpret the various aspects of Lukan theology, christology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology, the expansion of the Church in light of its Jewish origins, the genre <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts,</b> and the literary and stylistic means Luke used to make his work a unity. In total the volume includes some 40 papers, of which 24 are offered papers: L. Alexander, H. Baarlink, M. Bachmann, D. Bechard, T. L. Brodie, G. P. Carras, A. del Agua, C. Focant, G. Geiger, B. J. Koet, V. Koperski, D. P. Moessner, G. Oegema, J. Pichler, E. Plümacher, A. Puig i Tarrèch, U. Schmid, B. Schwank, N. Taylor, P. J. Tomson, S. Van den Eynde, S. Walton, G. Wasserberg, F. Wilk. This collection is an invaluable contribution to current discussions in Lukan study and to a nuanced understanding of the relationship between Luke's two volumes...|$|R
40|$|After {{presenting}} {{a map of}} Paul Ricoeur’s ethical philoso- phy, the following pages explore {{the way in which}} he adopts the Aristotelian concept of good life, thus to pinpoint its con- tinuity with the contemporary concept of action, proper to the analytical philosophy, though amplified by life’s practices and plans, in order to show a broader framework for ethics’ teleolog- ical perspective, according to which all human actions tend to a good that is simultaneously its end. The <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> a life, from the stance of the hermeneutical philosophy developed by Ricoeur, is the working locus of every ethical reflection insofar it is a narrative that presents actions as moments of more complex actions, from which in turn surface increasingly broader teleo- logical schemes...|$|R
50|$|In Nietzsche’s Epic of the Soul: Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Seung {{develops}} {{an innovative}} reading of Nietzsche’s most abstruse work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Seung’s primary contention is that Nietzsche’s readers have not paid sufficient {{attention to the}} <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Zarathustra. Indeed, many readers have treated the work {{as nothing more than}} a collection of disjointed aphorisms, speeches, and parables. The most generous interpretations prior to Seung’s have allowed that the first three Parts of Zarathustra do, in fact, constitute a coherent narrative. However, Seung finds troubling the tendency of these interpretations to view the fourth and final Part of Zarathustra either as an embarrassing addition to the first three Parts or as a low comedy following a tragedy, after the manner of ancient Greek theater. Seung maintains that Part IV, rather than constituting a burlesque that is irrelevant to what precedes it, actually depicts the fulfillment of Zarathustra’s previously unrealized ambitions. Hence, Part IV represents the epic conclusion to a spiritual journey, the trajectory of which spans from Part I to Part IV of Zarathustra.|$|R
40|$|Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue {{presented}} a reinterpretation of Aristotelian virtue ethics that is {{contrasted with the}} emotivism of modern moral discourse, and provides a moral scheme that can enable a rediscovery and reimagination of a more coherent morality. Since After Virtue’s publication, this scheme {{has been applied to}} a variety of activities and occupations, and has been influential in the development of research in accounting ethics. Through a ‘close’ reading of chapters 14 and 15 of After Virtue this paper considers and applies the key concepts of practices, institutions, internal and external goods, the <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> a human life and tradition, and the virtues associated with these concepts. It contributes, firstly, by providing a more accurate and comprehensive application of MacIntyre’s scheme to accounting than available in the existing literature. Secondly, it identifies areas in which MacIntyre’s scheme supports the existing approach to professional accounting ethics as articulated by the various International Federation of Accountants pronouncements as well as areas in which it provides a critique and challenge to this approach. The application ultimately provides an alternative philosophical perspective through which accounting can be examined and further research into accounting ethics pursued...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} the question <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> «canonical» classic autobiography of Austrian {{literature of the}} 20 th century. T.

Fictional autobiography is nonuniqueness in narrative terms. The manner of narration in the novel «A Child», dedicated to early childhood of the writer, is {{significantly different from the}} manner of the narrative of the first four novels based on the events of his youth. The first four novels of the pentolog share a common plot scheme and the availability of copyright of meta comment where in rhetorical manner the author talks about the truth and falsehood in an autobiographical narrative. The fifth story does not fit the scheme of the plot of the first four, is devoid of metanarrative level. Reflection of the author of the autobiographical narrative moves to plot level (a fictional episode of the bike ride, for which can be traced several references), change the nature of the characters and the narrative style: the story of his own life events conducted in more direct manner, different from the stylized narrative of the first stories...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} what can be discovered from Luke-Acts about early Christian baptism, recognising that {{the environment in which}} Luke's tradition developed was both Jewish and Gentile. The thesis begins with a brief survey of the Jewish practice of ritual washings. The ideas and practices which encouraged the formal rite of John the Baptist and the early church are identified and evaluated. The second chapter focuses attention on Acts 2 : 37 - 3 : 21. Baptism is defined in this passage (Ac. 2 : 38) {{in the context of the}} proclamation by Peter (Ac. 2 : 14 - 36) and the life of the community, which includes koinonia (Ac. 2 : 42 - 47), the performance of a miracle (Ac. 3 : 1 - 1 0), and a further proclamation (Ac. 3 : 12 - 26). Using the methods of redaktiongeschichte and narratological analyses, the literary <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> will be shown in the light of the elements of baptism. In the third chapter the different accounts of baptism recorded in Luke-Acts will be analysed and compared in order to determine how the church tradition which Luke represents understood baptism, and what was the significance of the rite and the practice of baptism in the early church. Finally, in order to emphasise the importance in the Greek world of the ideas and example of the moral philosophers, the meaning of terms related to baptism, such as akouo, metanoeo and pisteuo, is examined in the light of both Jewish and Greek concepts. The community life of the baptised expressed also practices and ideas which appear to owe more to the Greek world than the Jewish. These concepts include parrhesia, koinonia, and the way in which Christianity is described by its members and outsiders- Christianoi, hairesis, hodos. Finally the setting of the Christian meetings in the Gentile context is discussed. The conclusion indicated by the evidence is that Christianity was organised in a form which was scarcely distinguishable from a school under a kathegetes. Baptism initiated the believer into a relationship with a teacher. It was the nature of the teacher as well as the content of the teaching which gave to Christianity its uniqueness...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an epistemological {{study of}} virtue and {{its place in}} addressing the transdisciplinary question 2 ̆ 2 What is a good life? 2 ̆ 2 Alasdair MacIntyre 2 ̆ 7 s three-pronged account of virtue is applied to {{a case study of}} the Nice Paper, an alternative newspaper published in Rhode Island from 1989 until 1995, in order to discern the workings of virtue as resistance to late-capitalist modernity. It was discerned through hermeneutic phenomenology that the practices, traditions and <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the community of the paper were expressed in the sub-communities of alternative-ness, journalism, being in and of Providence and Rhode Island, being a maker and do-er, and art. The paper functioned as a well curated wunderkammer, itself like a work of art. The application of MacIntyre 2 ̆ 7 s account was expanded, and the interpretation included the discovery of the Nice Paper 2 ̆ 7 s being a 2 ̆ 2 community of virtue, 2 ̆ 2 in which the individual was transformed from 2 ̆ 2 plain person 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 moral philosopher 2 ̆ 2 through the practices that aimed not only at the goods of the sub communities, but also at the greater good of human flourishing.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} and defends a MacIntyrean {{account of}} contemporary work. MacIntyre's virtue ethics seems to entail a wholesale {{rejection of the}} modern order; throughout his writings MacIntyre is highly critical of capitalism, large-scale modern institutions, management, regulation, and indeed of our whole 'emotivistic' culture (as he sees it) which he regards as being inimical to our potential to virtuously flourish. MacIntyre's mature period, from After Virtue (2007, originally published 1981) contains much that is relevant to a philosophy of work. I will develop and update MacIntyre's own arguments and I will also argue that contemporary working life can be more MacIntyrean than MacIntyre himself realises. 	Because both work as a topic, and the relevant parts of MacIntyre's writings are extremely diverse, my strategy will be to examine the different key elements of a MacIntyrean philosophy of work without decontextualising the key notions of practices, virtues and institutions from MacIntyre's wider moral philosophy. I will argue that MacIntyre's key concept of a practice, the first stage in his definition of a virtue, is able to account for productive activities and can survive a variety of challenges. We are best able {{to make sense of}} the notion <b>of</b> the <b>narrative</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> a whole life, the second stage in MacIntyre's definition of a virtue, if we distinguish between lived-narratives and the told-narratives that best allow us to understand our lives. Despite his broad endorsement of Marx's critique of capitalism, a MacIntyrean account of work differs from Marx's theory of alienation. I will argue that a fully MacIntyrean workplace will be small-scale, will not pressurise employees to identify with compartmentalised roles, and will allow trust to flourish. However, because MacIntyre overstates the extent to which people accept the definitions of ???success??? that are dominant within modernity, he is unable to see the extent to which MacIntyrean communities can survive the threats posed by contemporary corporations. Another element of MacIntyre's account of work which needs modification is his critique of the character of the manager, and I will offer an emendation of this in order to make it applicable to contemporary forms of management. 	Finally I show that distinctively modern phenomena of workplace governance and regulation can serve MacIntyrean ends and can allow us to codify broadly MacIntyrean workplace initiatives. However, because of the deep context-sensitivity of the key MacIntyrean notions: practices, narrative-unity, and communities, such measures resist detailed and explicit formulation. My aim is to defend MacIntyre, to deepen our understanding of what a MacIntyrean philosophy of work entails, and to show that and how good work exists even within modernity...|$|R
40|$|A {{concern with}} unity {{has been a}} {{consistent}} theme in modern Burmese politics. This article examines a particularly problematic conception <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> that I argue draws strength from its resonance with Buddhist moral notions {{of the self and}} overcoming self-centeredness. As a moral concept, this <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> is idealized in devotion to a common purpose and loyalty to a group or community; it requires subsuming one’s own interests {{for the benefit of the}} whole, something that encapsulates the Buddhist practice of rejecting atta (ego). Disunity, then, is the result of a group of individuals committed only to their own benefit; it is evidence of moral failure. This discourse <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> has been an effectively anti-democratic disciplining tool (deployed by both governments and opposition groups) for suppressing internal dissent. Despite General Aung San’s oft-quoted slogan of “unity in diversity,” political movements in Myanmar have been more commonly characterized by hegemonic attempts at imposing a top-down unity that labels deviation from or criticism of dominant positions as disloyalty. This article examines the perpetuation of a rigid, unitary understanding <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> and argues that developing a more flexible and accommodating notion <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> will be a necessary step in the process of national reconciliation...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} to determine why Luke 5 : 1 - 11 is unique in its singular focus on Simon Peter in the Synoptic Gospel tradition of the call of the first disciples. Traditional historical-critical methodologies have provided some insight into Luke 5 : 1 - 11, but none has sufficiently explained the central function of this pericope within the two-part narrative <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts.</b> The procedure to solve this problem has five parts. Chapter one surveys the findings from secondary scholarly literature on Luke 5 : 1 - 11 according to the methodological approaches of source, form, redaction, and narrative. It is shown that each of the previous exegetical methods has insufficiently recognized the importance and function of Luke 5 : 1 - 11 with Luke-Acts. Chapter two examines more closely the relatively recent method of narrative criticism in terms of its current eclectic application and varied results. Two case studies of recent narrative-critical approaches to the gospels situate this dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s methodological approach within narrative criticism 2 ̆ 7 s eclectic application. Chapter three details the narrative theory and communication model of Seymour Chatman, a modern literary critic. It is Chatman 2 ̆ 7 s theory and model which is the interpretive control for the narrative analysis of Luke 5 : 1 - 11. In this context, the overall story and discourse <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> is detailed with special emphasis on Simon Peter in terms of characterization and narration. Chapter four is the narrative-critical analysis of Luke 5 : 1 - 11, focusing on the implied author (the 2 ̆ 2 organizing principle 2 ̆ 2 : the set of codes and conventions which create the text 2 ̆ 7 s norms and values) and implied reader. It finds that Luke-Acts 2 ̆ 7 implied author informs the implied reader of the Gentile mission and inclusion in the early church. This is one of the governing norms and values <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts.</b> Luke 5 : 1 - 11 becomes a critical link in the plot toward advancing this governing norm and value. Chapter five, focusing on the real author and real reader of Luke 5 : 1 - 11, provides the historical-critical component missing in Chatman 2 ̆ 7 s story and discourse model. Using genre criticism, it is determined that the real author <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> created a hybrid genre whose rhetorical purpose is catechetical: to instruct and persuade the real reader of the first century about the mission to include the Gentiles in the early church. This reinforces the importance of Luke 5 : 1 - 11 within the overall story and discourse <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts.</b> The principal conclusion {{of this study is that}} there is a right way to read Luke 5 : 1 - 11. Luke-Acts is a two-part narrative in the form of a hybrid genre whose rhetorical purpose is catechetical: to instruct and persuade the reader of the mission to include the Gentiles in the early church. This is one of the governing norms and values of the text, and is evidenced by the conventions of narration and characterization and the specific codes they communicate. Luke 5 : 1 - 11 is an essential pericope for advancing this governing norm and value <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts.</b> The narrative-critical methodological of this study has proven indispensable insights into Luke 5 : 1 - 11 which previous exegetical methods were unable to find...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the dynamics of the Ananias and Sapphira episode in Acts (5 : 1 – 11) and its role in the narrative <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts.</b> The study begins by locating the passage within its literary context, emphasizing the framing of this divine judgement discourse by its literary surroundings, {{and the manner in which}} it is embedded in a discourse on the life of the Christian community expressed through shared goods. The study then moves on to examine the dynamics in the verbal encounter between Peter and the couple. Utilizing Speech-Act Theory, I argue that Peter’s words, divinely sanctioned, directly execute the divine judgement upon Ananias and Sapphira. This thesis is argued by appealing to the social processes and conventions of language-use within the context of community-of-goods discourse as manifest in the Lukan narrative. Appeal is made to the socio-cultural repertoire of community-of-goods discourse in contemporary traditions sharing the socio-cultural milieu <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts.</b> I look at both a Hellenistic example (the Pythagoreans) and some Jewish examples (the Essenes and the Qumran covenanters). Next, I appeal to the conventions deployed in the narrative world <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> which undergird the efficacy of prophetic speech to effect divine judgement. This includes the patterns established by prophetic figures in the Scriptures of Israel and Luke’s own characterization of Jesus as Prophet-King. Attention is also given to Luke’s strategy of preparing his audience to see the character of Peter as an apostolic-prophetic successor to Jesus, deputized to speak on behalf of God. Finally, there is {{an examination of}} the successful execution of the speech-act of divine judgement...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. "I tell you, {{among those}} born of women none {{is greater than}} John" (Luke 7 : 28). Thus the author <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> expresses his basic {{assessment}} of John the Baptist. The present study aims to understand the role of John the Baptist as he is portrayed in Luke-Acts through a reading that combines social description and narrative-theological analysis {{in order to gain}} hermeneutical access to the subject of our investigation. This study seeks to achieve this aim in two ways. In the first instance there is an attempt (through recourse to a combination of the stated critical methodologies) to provide a reading <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> that interfaces social description and narrative-theological analysis in order to make possible a rhetorical engagement with the text in a way that provides hermeneutical access to John the Baptist as he is portrayed in Luke-Acts. In his portrayal of John the Baptist as a prophet and witness who plays a unique role in the history of salvation, the author <b>of</b> <b>Luke-Acts</b> weaves a spell over his readers that draws them into his narrative world and into his particular theological perspective. In the second instance, this study also aims to show how Luke-Acts preserves a unique dynamic of John the Baptist which has rather been buried in the other Gospel traditions. Through this dynamic, Luke seeks to transmit his own ideal of the authentic prophet and witness {{in such a way that}} his audience may be moved to emulate John's example with conviction and imagination both in living out their Christian ideal as well as in proclaiming the good news...|$|R
