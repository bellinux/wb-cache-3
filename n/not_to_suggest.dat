5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to make sure that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while being careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (12 months – 20 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Uganda(see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research, not a diagnostic, tool and the resulting attachment classifications are not 'clinical diagnoses.'

500|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of Kew Asylum and its sister asylums {{is the use}} of a variation on ha-ha walls around the patients' courtyards. [...] They consisted of a trench, one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks, the other side sloped and turfed. From the inside, the walls presented a tall face to patients, deterring them from escaping, while from outside the walls looked low so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> imprisonment. [...] A journalist with The Argus described the walls as an [...] "excellent arrangement, as it enables the patients to see the outside world, and does away with that gaol appearance and feeling inculcated by the walls of the old asylums". [...] Many of Kew's ha-ha walls were retained and remain intact, unlike those at Beechworth and Ararat which were partially dismantled or the trenches were filled in.|$|E
500|$|Wisemore is not {{the only}} one to serve as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{tensions}} in the late 1960s and 1970s somewhat simmered down. Both teams synthesized the next element, element 106, but decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> their names. In 1968, the Soviet team presented a report calling recognition of discovery of elements 102 and 103 by other teams, including the American team, [...] "hasty". Afterwards, they suggested establishing an international committee on elaborating the discovery criteria. This proposal was accepted in 1974; however, the newly formed Committee never assembled to assess the claims. Neither team showed interest in resolving the conflict through a third party, and so the leading scientists of the LBL—Albert Ghiorso and Glenn Seaborg—traveled to Dubna in 1975 and {{had a meeting with}} the leader of the Soviet team, Georgy Flerov, in an attempt to resolve the conflict internally and render the neutral joint group unnecessary; however, the meeting was unsuccessful. The conflict remained unsolved, and in 1979, the IUPAC published a new suggested system of systematic element names (according to which element 105 would be named unnilpentium, from the Latin roots un- and nil- and the Greek root pent- (meaning [...] "one", [...] "zero", and [...] "five", respectively, referencing the decimal digits of the atomic number) intended to be used as placeholders until permanent names were established; the scientists ignored it, not wishing to weaken their claims by adopting a neutral naming system rather than their own.|$|E
500|$|The {{metaphor of}} the MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release of}} Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you think about where [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that." ...|$|E

60|$|Controversies as to {{relative}} sacrifice {{are very}} barren and very foolish also; {{for there is}} no reason in the world why relative sacrifice should necessarily be equal,--so many other very relevant considerations being quite different in the two cases. The two or three facts following are put forward, therefore, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that they provide any compelling argument for Americans, but only to show that from his own selfish point of view an Englishman is not seeking to avoid due sacrifice on his country's part in making the present suggestion. (1) The sums which the British Treasury borrowed from the American Treasury, after the latter came into the war, were approximately offset by the sums which England lent to her other Allies during the same period (i.e. excluding sums lent before the United States came into the war); so that almost the whole of England's indebtedness to the United States was incurred, not on her own account, but to enable her to assist the rest of her Allies, who were for various reasons {{not in a position to}} draw their assistance from the United States direct.[167] (2) The United Kingdom has disposed of about $5,000,000,000 worth of her foreign securities, and in addition has incurred foreign debt to the amount of about $6,000,000,000. The United States, so far from selling, has bought back upwards of $5,000,000,000, and has incurred practically no foreign debt. (3) The population of the United Kingdom is about one-half that of the United States, the income about one-third, and the accumulated wealth between one-half and one-third. The financial capacity of the United Kingdom may therefore be put at about two-fifths that of the United States. This figure enables us to make the following comparison:--Excluding loans to Allies in each case (as is right on the assumption that these loans are to be repaid), the war expenditure of the United Kingdom has been about three times that of the United Sates, or in proportion to capacity between seven and eight times.|$|E
