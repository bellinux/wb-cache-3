Good separations based on differences in electrophoretic mobility are obtained {{only when a}} unidirectional flow is maintained. The desired flow has a parabolic structure in the <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> of the chamber and is uniform acros the width, except near the edges where the no-slip condition prevails. However, because of buoyancy, very small laterall or axial temperature gradients deform the flow significantly.

30|$|The folded z-type {{schlieren system}} is {{especially}} useful for {{looking through the}} windows of a test facility such as a wind tunnel (indicated by a dashed outline in Fig.  1 c, d). Wind tunnels tend to be housed in long narrow rooms, the <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> necessitating the folding of schlieren optics. In extreme cases the parallel schlieren beam can be folded twice, as shown in Fig.  1 d. Such a compact schlieren system serves the transonic wind tunnel of DLR Göttingen, for example, where it is entirely inside the pressure plenum of the facility. Note that the large first-surface folding mirrors FM 1 and FM 2 must be flat to better than ¼ wavelength of light across their surfaces. They may cost as much or more than the parabolic mirrors.|$|E

These beams are presently produced by dc-biased photoelectron sources combined with rf chopping and bunching systems with inherently high transverse emittances. Low emittances can be produced with an rf gun, but the vacuum environment has until now been considered too harsh to support a negative electron affinity GaAs photocathode. We propose to significantly improve the vacuum conditions by adapting a PWT rf photoinjector to achieve reasonable cathode emission rates and lifetimes. This adaptation can also be combined with special optics {{that will result in}} a flat beam with a normalized rms emittance in the <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> that may be as low as 10 - 8 m.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the transport of}} Brownian particles in a two-dimensional potential under the action of a uniform external force. The potential is periodic {{in one direction and}} confines the particle to a narrow channel of varying cross-section in the other direction. We apply the standard long-wave asymptotic analysis in the <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> and show that the leading order term is equivalent to that obtained previously from a direct extension of the Fick-Jacobs approximation. We also show that the confining potential has similar effects on the transport of Brownian particles to those induced by a solid channel. Finally, we compare the analytical results with Brownian dynamics simulations {{in the case of a}} sinusoidal variation of the width of the parabolic potential in the cross-section. We obtain excellent agreement for the marginal probability distribution, the average velocity of the Brownian particles and the asymptotic dispersion coefficient, over a wide range of Peclet numbers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Indexing {{methods for}} {{efficient}} processing of multidimensional data are very requested in many fields, like geographical information systems, drawing documentations etc. Well-known R-tree {{is one of}} the multidimensional data structures. The R-tree is based on bounding of spatial near points by multidimensional rectangles. This data structure supports various types of queries, e. g. point and range queries. The range query retrieves all tuples of a multidimensional space in the defined query box. Narrow range query is an important type of the range query includ-ing at least one <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension.</b> Despite many variants of R-trees, narrow range query processing is inefficient. In this paper, we depict a modification of Signature R-tree: data structure for the narrow range query processing.

40|$|Present {{concepts}} {{for solar}} power satellites involve dimensions up {{to tens of}} kilometers and operating internal currents up to hundreds of kiloamperes. A question addressed is whether the local magnetic fields generated by these strong currents during normal operation can shield the array against impacts by plasma ions and electrons (and from thruster plasmas) which can cause possible losses such as power leakage and surface erosion. One of several prototype concepts was modeled by a long narrow rectangular panel 2 km wide and 20 km long. The currents flow in a parallel across the <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> (sheet current) and along the edge (wire currents). The wire currents accumulate from zero to 100 kiloamp and are the dominant sources. The magnetic field is approximated analytically.

One method of calculating the aperture admittance is briefly outlined. The experimental work is outlined and the results presented in graphical and tabular form. It was found that a minimum flange of 2 wavelengths in the directions perpendicular to the broad dimension of the waveguide is required to insure agreement of the conductance to within 2 $ and the susceptance to within 5 $ of the calculated values. It was found that in the direction perpendicular to the <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> of the waveguide, a flange of total width of 0. 9 x was still large enough to insure this same agreement, even though the aperture width was slightly over 0. 8 x.

40|$|A hot-film {{anemometer}} (HFA) probe {{was used}} to obtain local measurements of void fraction and bubble frequency in a vertically oriented, high aspect ratio duct containing R- 134 a under selected adiabatic two-phase flow conditions.

The void fraction profiles displayed large gradients in the near-wall regions and broad maxima near the duct centerline. The trends in the bubble frequency data generally follow those for the local void fraction data. However, the relatively large number of bubbles at higher pressure implies a larger magnitude of the interfacial area concentration, for the same cross-sectional average void fraction. For the two annular flow conditions tested, analysis of the HFA output voltage signal enabled identification of three distinct regions of the flow field; liquid film with dispersed bubbles, interfacial waves, and continuous vapor with dispersed droplets...|$|E

40|$|Microporous {{thin films}} (≈ 50 to 400 nm) {{composed}} of discrete, cavity-containing molecular rectangles have been prepared. The films, which contain both amorphous and microcrystalline domains, display shape-selective transport behavior. They are permeable to small molecules and to molecules that are short or narrow {{in at least}} one dimension—for example, elongated planar molecules—but are impermeable to molecules lacking a <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension.</b> However, the shape selectivity is based on transport through intramolecular rather than intermolecular cavities. By using redox-active probe molecules, rates of transport through the rectangle-based material have been extracted from electrochemical measurements. Spatially resolved measurements obtained via scanning electrochemical microscopy have permitted transport through individual microcrystals to be evaluated semiquantitatively. The measurements reveal that transport is roughly two orders of magnitude slower than observed with thin microcrystalline films of molecular squares featuring similar-sized cavities. The differences likely reflect the fact that cavities within the square-based materials, but not the rectangle-based material, align to form simple one-dimensional channels...|$|E
30|$|An {{optically}} enabled z-axis micro-disk inertia sensor is presented, {{which consists}} of a disk-shaped proof mass integrated {{on top of an}} optical waveguide. Numerical simulations show that the optical power of laser beam propagating in a narrow silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) waveguide located under the disk is attenuated in response to the vertical movement of the micro-disk. The high leakage power of the TM mode can effectively be used to detect a dynamic range of 1 g‒ 10 g (g= 9.8 m/s 2). At lest, the waveguide is kept at a nominal gap of 1 µm from the proof mass. It is adiabatically tapered to a <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> of W×H = 350 × 220 nm 2 in a region where the optical mode is intended to interact with the proof mass. Furthermore, the bottom cladding is completely etched away to suspend the waveguide and improve the optical interaction with the proof mass. The proposed optical inertia sensor has a high sensitivity of 3 dB/g when a 50 µm-long waveguide is used (normalized sensitivity 0.5 dB/µm 2) for the vertical movement detection.|$|E

The physico-chemical investigation of these systems has been performed by a combined experimental strategy, which has allowed a characterization at different observation scales, from the morphological to the micro-structural level. Particularly, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements have revealed the formation of liposomes with a <b>narrow</b> <b>dimension</b> distribution; small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements have led to an estimation of {{the thickness of the}} LOS bilayer, which is consistent with an extended conformation of the acyl chains; electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements have allowed to investigate the bilayer fluidity, as determined by LOS acyl chain conformation and packing; Pulsed-field-gradient stimulated echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSTE-NMR) measurements have shown that water permeability through the LOS bilayer is low. The effect of temperature has been considered. Liposome dimension does not change; however, centered at 30 – 35 C, a progressive transition of the acyl chain self-organization from a gel to a liquid crystalline phase is detected.
