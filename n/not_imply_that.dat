5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} in {{the earliest}} divisions of the egg {{appears to be the}} original condition for the ancestral bilaterians, {{in the earliest}} Ecdysozoa and possibly in the earliest Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa. Hence radial cleavage does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> brachiopods are affiliated with deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that the}} coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form by different process, called enterocoely and schizocoely respectively. However, research since the early 1990s has found significant exceptions. Both types of coelom construction appear among brachiopods, and therefore do <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> brachiopods are deuterostomes.|$|E

5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E

But this does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production {{and a higher}} material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people {{that contributed to the}} Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|Verified status does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> Twitter {{continuously}} checks {{whether such}} accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users {{have tried to}} impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone {{to apply for a}} verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E
5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose does <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes {{with the end of}} Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
