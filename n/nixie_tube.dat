25|$|From 1965 {{to about}} 1971, Wang was a well-regarded {{calculator}} company. Wang calculators cost in the mid-four-figures, used <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> readouts, performed transcendental functions, had {{varying degrees of}} programmability, and exploited magnetic core memory. The 200 and 300 calculator models were available as timeshared simultaneous (SE) packages that had a central processing unit (the {{size of a small}} suitcase) connected by cables leading to four individual desktop display/keyboard units. Competition included HP, which introduced the HP 9100A in 1968, and old-line calculator companies such as Monroe and Marchant.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> has ten cathodes in the shapes of the numerals 0 to 9 (and {{occasionally}} a decimal point or two), but there are also types that show various letters, signs and symbols. Because the numbers and other characters are arranged one behind another, each character appears at a different depth, giving Nixie based displays a distinct appearance. A related device is the pixie tube, which uses a stencil mask with numeral-shaped holes instead of shaped cathodes. Some Russian Nixies, e.g. the IN-14, used an upside-down digit 2 as the digit 5, presumably to save manufacturing costs as there is no obvious technical or aesthetic reason.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> ( [...] ), or {{cold cathode}} display, is an {{electronic}} device for displaying numerals or other information using glow discharge.|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs {{even had}} another Haydu tube that could {{operate as a}} digital counter and {{directly}} drive a <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> for display. This was called a [...] "Trochotron", in later form known as the [...] "Beam-X Switch" [...] counter tube; another name was [...] "magnetron beam-switching tube", referring to their similarity to a cavity magnetron. Trochotrons {{were used in the}} UNIVAC 1101 computer, as well as in clocks and frequency counters.|$|E
50|$|Cold cathodes {{sometimes}} have a rare earth coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain {{a source of}} beta radiation to start ionization of the gas that fills the tube. In some tubes, glow discharge around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube. Examples are the neon lamp and <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices.|$|R
50|$|The Schmitt trigger {{effect of}} the {{negative}} differential resistance-region can be exploited to realize timers, relaxation oscillators and digital circuits with neon lamps, trigger tubes, relay <b>tubes,</b> dekatrons and <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other numeric-display {{technologies}} concurrently in use included backlit columnar transparencies ("thermometer displays"), light pipes, rear-projection and edge-lit lightguide displays (all using individual incandescent or neon {{light bulbs}} for illumination), Numitron incandescent filament readouts, Panaplex seven-segment displays, and vacuum fluorescent display <b>tubes.</b> Before <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There {{have also}} been some {{attempts}} to make new Nixie tubes, the most successful {{of which is that}} of Dalibor Farny, a programmer and electrical engineer from the Czech Republic. His efforts began in February 2012, {{and by the end of}} 2014, Dalibor had created his first marketable <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube,</b> the R|Z568M (whose [...] "R" [...] stands for [...] "resurrection"), which he still sells on his website for $145 USD.|$|E
2500|$|As {{testament}} to their longevity, {{and that of}} the equipment which incorporated them, [...] several suppliers still provide common <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> types as replacement parts, new in original packaging. Equipment with Nixie-tube displays in excellent working condition is still plentiful, though much of it has been in frequent use for 30–40 years or more. Such items can easily be found as surplus and obtained at very little expense. In the former Soviet Union, Nixies were still being manufactured in volume in the 1980s, so Russian and Eastern European Nixies are still available.|$|E
2500|$|One {{advantage}} of the <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> is that its cathodes are typographically designed, shaped for legibility. In most types, they are not placed in numerical sequence from back to front, but arranged so that cathodes in front obscure the lit cathode minimally. One such arrangement is 6 7 5 8 4 3 9 2 0 1 from front (6) to back (1). [...] Russian NH-12A & NH-12B tubes use the number arrangement 1 6 2 7 5 0 4 9 8 3 from back to front, with the 5 being an upside down 2. [...] The 12B tubes feature a bottom far left decimal point between the numbers 8 and 3.|$|E
50|$|Neon lamps {{with several}} shaped {{electrodes}} {{were used as}} alphanumerical displays known as <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes.</b> These have since been replaced by other display devices such as light emitting diodes, vacuum fluorescent displays, and liquid crystal displays.|$|R
50|$|A text {{display is}} an {{electronic}} alphanumeric display device that is mainly or only capable of showing text, or extremely limited graphic characters. This includes electromechanical split-flap displays, vane displays, and flip-disc displays; all-electronic liquid-crystal displays, incandescent eggcrate displays, LED displays, and vacuum fluorescent displays; and even electric <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cathode {{poisoning}} can be abated {{by limiting}} current through the tubes to significantly below their maximum rating, {{through the use}} of <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> constructed from materials that avoid the effect (e.g. by being free of silicates and aluminum), or by programming devices to periodically cycle through all digits so that seldom-displayed ones get activated.|$|R
2500|$|The early Nixie {{displays}} {{were made}} by a small vacuum tube manufacturer called Haydu Brothers Laboratories, and introduced in 1955 by Burroughs Corporation, who purchased Haydu. The name Nixie was derived by Burroughs from [...] "NIX I", an abbreviation of [...] "Numeric Indicator eXperimental No. 1", although {{this may have been}} a backronym designed to justify the evocation of the mythical creature with this name. Hundreds of variations of this design were manufactured by many firms, from the 1950s until the 1990s. The Burroughs Corporation introduced [...] "Nixie" [...] and owned the name Nixie as a trademark. Nixie-like displays made by other firms had trademarked names including Digitron, Inditron and Numicator. A proper generic term is cold cathode neon readout tube, though the phrase <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> quickly entered the vernacular as a generic name.|$|E
2500|$|A {{firmware}} update (version 1.1) for the Nano {{was released on}} February 28, 2011. The update added the ability to change songs or pause with a double click of the sleep/wake button. It also added the ability to turn the device off by holding the sleep/wake button. The user interface was also enhanced. On October 4, 2011, the iPod Nano 1.2 update was unveiled at the Apple [...] "Let's Talk iPhone" [...] event at the Town Hall, 4 Infinite Loop. This update added the option to increase or decrease {{the size of the}} home buttons for easier use. The update also added a better fitness app, which had a better pedometer split into walking and running style. The update also included 16 new clock faces, which included designs like a <b>Nixie</b> <b>tube</b> clock face or an old-style clock face, and Disney-licensed designs, such as Mickey Mouse and Kermit the Frog, bringing to a total of 18 clock faces. [...] Three more background images were also added.|$|E

25|$|Devices that functioned in {{the same}} way as <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> were {{patented}} in the 1930s, and the first mass-produced display tubes were introduced in 1954 by National Union Co. under the brand name Inditron. However, their construction was cruder, their average lifetime was shorter, and they failed to find many applications due to their complex periphery.|$|R
50|$|The ANITA Mark VII and ANITA Mark VIII calculators were {{launched}} simultaneously in late 1961 as the world's first all-electronic desktop calculators. Designed and {{built by the}} Bell Punch Co. in Britain, and marketed through its Sumlock Comptometer division, they used vacuum tubes and cold-cathode switching tubes in their logic circuits and <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> for their numerical displays.|$|R
25|$|Specialized {{high-voltage}} driver chips {{such as the}} 7441/74141 {{were available}} to drive Nixies. LEDs are better suited to the low voltages that integrated circuits used, which was an advantage for devices such as pocket calculators, digital watches, and handheld digital measurement instruments. Also, LEDs are much smaller and sturdier, without a fragile glass envelope. LEDs have lower power consumption than both VFDs and <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{principle}} of edge-lighting was discovered early {{and used for}} commercial signs. [...] for an [...] "Electric edge lit sign" [...] was filed on July 31, 1914, and granted in 1915. Other similar patents ( [...] , , , [...] ) for illuminated signs were filed 1928-1948. But the need for digit read-out arose with electronic computers in the 1950s with many independent inventions, both in edge-lighting, <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> and other technologies.|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been some {{attempts}} to make new <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes,</b> the most successful {{of which is that}} of Dalibor Farny, a programmer and electrical engineer from the Czech Republic.

2500|$|Average {{longevity}} of <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> varied from about 5,000 {{hours for the}} earliest types, to as high as 200,000 hours or more {{for some of the}} last types to be introduced. There is no formal definition as to what constitutes [...] "end of life" [...] for Nixies, mechanical failure excepted. Some sources suggest that incomplete glow coverage of a glyph ("cathode poisoning") or appearance of glow elsewhere in the tube would not be acceptable.|$|R

5000|$|A few {{different}} versions of the fourteen segment display exist as cold-cathode neon lamps. For example, one type made by Burroughs Corporation was called [...] "Panaplex". Instead of using a filament as the incandescent versions do, these use a cathode charged to a 180 V potential which causes the electrified segment to glow a bright orange color. They operated similarly to <b>Nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> but instead of the full-formed numeric shapes, used segments to make up numerals and letters.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} ways to form text for display. A segment display uses lines, while a dot-matrix display uses a grid of dots, and both of these are seen in LCD, LED, VFD, and vane/disc types. For split-flap displays, the {{characters}} or words are pre-printed, and for <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> the shapes are also pre-formed. In any case, the display elements are controlled by electronics which activate them in the correct physical and temporal sequence to show the desired information.|$|R
50|$|Operator input was {{provided}} {{in the form of}} a box with 10 columns of digits in the center with buttons for each number from 0 to 10. A single column on the left was used to select an accumulator, and the other than to input the ten digit value. There was a row of command keys on the right. Output consisted of two ten-digit displays using <b>nixie</b> <b>tubes</b> on the front of the machine, which also featured a large electric clock.|$|R
