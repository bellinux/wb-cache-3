40|$|The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the {{juridical}} {{person is a}} notion without correspondence in the old civil law theory. In fact the regulation of the {{juridical person}} is a matter that enters relatively recent civil law because in traditional approach civil law dealt with natural persons and associations of natural persons only. The difference between the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement of association and the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person itself, born by such association, is clearly revealed by the law. The two notions are still linked. One cannot imagine a <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement without the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the legal person born by such agreement. Nevertheless the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person is laid down independently, comprising limited cases of occurrences. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person finds out its correspondence in the Company Law. The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> {{the company has a}} distinct regulation, in Company Law, in line with the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person. In this case the civil law imported the notion from commercial law in order to limit the incidences <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> aiming the security of the civil circuit and the interest of the third persons. In a general accepted way, nullity represents a civil sanction which impedes the effects of an act concluded in a way that breach the law.

40|$|The {{absence of}} a Romanian legal {{definition}} of the concept <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies arouses a lot of questions.

In other words, are the cases <b>of</b> <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies regulated only by Law no. 31 / 1990 or by the provisions of common law as well? Started {{from the fact that the}} nullity is not considered by the legislator a simple sanction applicable to the juridical acts but it affects directly the existence of the company and becomes a means to sanction the creation of a legal person by disregarding the imperative legal provisions, we analyzed firstly the Romanian (II) and the EU legal provisions regarding the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies. The elements of this analyze helped us to qualify the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> commercial companies and its effect (III).
