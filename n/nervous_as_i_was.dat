5000|$|Harris was {{commissioned}} {{to paint a}} portrait of Queen Elizabeth II for her 80th birthday. The painting was conducted at Buckingham Palace and was unveiled there by Harris on 19 December 2005. The painting also {{became the subject of}} a special episode of Rolf on Art. Harris explained to The Daily Telegraph the following year: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>as</b> anything. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a panic". The portrait was later voted as the second most-favoured portrait of the Queen by the British public.|$|R
500|$|Harris {{had been}} a popular {{entertainer}} and artist for several decades in Britain {{at the time the}} portrait was commissioned, and was the presenter of Rolf on Art, a series of television programmes on notable artists of the past. Harris subsequently said of the Queen that she was [...] "an incredible lady and it was a real pleasure to paint her. The portrait I've created aims to capture the Queen's warm and friendly personality, rather than being a very formal portrait focusing more on her official status." [...] Harris explained to The Daily Telegraph the following year: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>as</b> anything. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a panic".|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{mentions}} {{his sisters}} Joyce and Loyce in the song. “Oh, {{it was just}} one of them stupid things you write at the time," [...] Jones explained to Nick Toches in the Texas Monthly in 1994. [...] "Bunch of junk. It didn’t seem like junk so much back in those days, but it would be junk today.” Despite being only a regional hit, the song launched Jones' career, although he was viewed as someone trying to sound too much like his heroes, Hank Williams, Frizzell, and Roy Acuff. Jones admitted in his 1996 autobiography: [...] "I can't imagine being <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> today <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> cut my first two songs for Starday at age twenty-two. When anybody gets nervous they rely on their reflexes, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> no exception." ...|$|R
60|$|I had a {{political}} quarrel {{last night with}} the American; {{it was a real}} quarrel for about two minutes; we relieved our feelings and separated; but a mutual feeling of shame led us to a most moving reconciliation, in which the American vowed he would shed his best blood for England. In looking back upon the interview, I feel that I have learned something; I scarcely appreciated how badly England had behaved, and how well she deserves the hatred the Americans bear her. It would have made you laugh if you could have been present and seen your unpatriotic son thundering anathemas in the moonlight against all those that were not the friend of England. Johnson being nearly <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>as</b> <b>I,</b> we <b>were</b> both very ill after it, which added a further pathos to the reconciliation.|$|R

To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch {{so much as a}} glimpse of him--it's more than I can stand. My husband is <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> over it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> but he is out at his work all day, while I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for the girl, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> all alone in the house with him, and it's more than my nerves can stand." ...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{great honor}} for me to give this talk in honor of my mentor and my old friend Is Singer. We {{have known each other}} since 1973. He had a deep {{influence}} in my mathematical thinking and my career. When I first met him at a big conference in geometry in Stanford, my advisor Chern told me that Is wanted to see me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> somewhat <b>nervous</b> <b>as</b> <b>Is</b> <b>is</b> a big name in geometry. To my surprise, Is just smiled and said that he just wanted to get to know me. But he did something for me then that neither of us realized at the time. It was his proposal to invite Robert Geroch to explain the mathematics of general relativity to geometers during that conference. Geroch explained the positive mass conjecture for a special case in very sim-ple terms. It was fascinating as nobody knew how to approach this problem, despite its elegance. I kept this problem in mind until 1978, when I visited Berkeley for one year, again at the invitation of Chern and of Is. In that year, I solved the first major part of the positive conjecture with Richard Schoen. Before this visit, Is invited me to visit MIT for a month during 1976, after I solved the Calabi conjecture. During that period, <b>Is</b> <b>was</b> very busy with a family issue. Nonetheless, we had dinner and he described to me what he heard in Stony Brook when he visited the physicists there. The main question was concerning self-dual instantons. Although I did not work on it immediately, it is such an interesting subject, that I finally worked on the higher dimensional generalization of it known today as the Hermitian Yang-Mills connections. In 1987, Is thought that it was important for mathematicians working on physics related issues {{to have the ability to}} obtain funding to hire postdoc-toral fellows. He was able to work this out with the Department of Energy. And I have benefitted much by his efforts on this. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to hire post-doctoral fellows who earned physics degrees. Having them around have been really useful for my career...|$|R
5000|$|After {{two short}} trips to Europe, in 1809 Bromfield headed to Canton as {{supercargo}} aboard the ship Atahualpa. In the subsequent years {{he served as}} the foreign agent for William Sturgis, Henry Lee, Daniel Bacon, and Augustine Heard among other Boston merchants trading with China. By {{the time he was}} 34 he had accumulated his own fortune and he moved to Boston. [...] Bromfield never married. Quincy quotes him as saying “No woman who has a grain of discretion would consent to bind herself to such a <b>nervous</b> old bachelor <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and a woman without discretion would be --- not to my taste.” ...|$|R
5000|$|As Candy had {{predicted}} after her {{win in the}} Cheveley Park, Airwave's connections {{made no attempt to}} campaign her over longer distances as a three-year-old, opting instead for a sprinting campaign. On her seasonal debut she was matched against colts and older, more experienced horses in the Group Two Temple Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 26 May and started 5/2 joint-favourite with the four-year-old Acclamation. Ridden by Dane O'Neill, who partnered her in seven of her next eight races, she started even more slowly than usual, losing around five lengths and racing {{at the rear of the}} seven-runner field in the early stages. She began to make rapid headway in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by three lengths from the ten-year-old gelding Repertory. After the race Candy commented [...] "I wasn't <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> should have <b>been.</b> <b>I</b> have seen her do the most amazing things. Four lengths is an awful lot to give away against the old professionals, but I wasn't that worried. Dane got there too soon, took a pull, went again and still got there too soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{question}} too, at the queer {{touch of}} association, played up for Mark even under so much {{proof that the}} state of his own soul was being with the lapse of every instant registered. Phil Bloodgood had brought about the state of his soul--there was accordingly that amount of connection; only it became further remarkable that from the moment his companion had sounded him, and sounded him, he knew, down to the last truth of things, his disposition, his necessity to talk, the desire that had in the morning broken the spell of his confinement, the impulse that had thrown him so defeatedly into Mrs. Folliott's arms and into Florence Ash's, these forces seemed to feel their impatience ebb and their discretion suddenly grow. His companion was talking again, but just then, incongruously, made his need to communicate lose itself. It was as if his personal case had already been touched by some tender hand--and that, after all, was the modest limit of its greed. [...] "I know now why you came back--did Lottie mention how I had wondered? But sit down, sit down--only let me, <b>nervous</b> beast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> take it standing!--and believe me when I tell you that I've now ceased to wonder. My dear chap, I have it! It can't but have been for poor Phil Blood-good. He sticks out of you, the brute--as how, with what he has done to you, shouldn't he? There was a man to see me yesterday--Tim Slater, whom I don't think you know, but who's 'on' everything within about two minutes of its happening (I never saw such a fellow!) and who confirmed my supposition, all my own, however, mind you, at first, that you're one of the sufferers. So how the devil can you not feel knocked? Why should you look as if you were having the time of your life? What a hog to have played it on you, on you, of all his friends!" [...] So Newton Winch continued, and so the air between the two men might have been, for a momentary watcher--which <b>is</b> indeed what <b>I</b> can but invite the reader to become--that of a nervously displayed, but all considerate, as well as most acute, curiosity on the one side, and that on the other, after a little, of an eventually fascinated acceptance of so much free and in especial of so much right attention. [...] "Do you mind my asking you? Because if you do I won't press; but as a man whose own responsibilities, some of 'em at least, don't differ much, I gather, from some of his, one would like to know how he was ever allowed to get to the point--! But I do plough you up?" ...|$|R

Not only was this my first solo conference, this was my first solo trip, period. Go big or go home, right? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already feeling <b>nervous</b> and apprehensive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making the transition from being a full time eighth grade teacher to a full time graduate student. As such, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> struggling to find my new home. I needn’t have worried, for instantly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> welcomed into the CEE-GS community. I made connections with other graduate students from across the country and realized that none of us is in this program alone. Though sometimes our work may feel isolating, we return to each other each year to connect, to collaborate, to inspire. I clearly remember my first social dinner with the CEE-GS. I looked around the table and realized that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting among the very people that <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> working with {{for the rest of my}} career. It was such a surreal moment in which I could clearly envision collaborating on future workshops and articles with my new English Education family. In that moment, all of my insecurities evaporated. I knew I had found my new home. Each year our community continues to grow. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still marveling that we all packed into Bilbo Baggins for dinner in DC last month! As membership grows, so do our opportunities to both collaborate and commiserate along each step of our unique journey that is graduate school, celebrating each other through each step of the process and growing as a family. This summer CEE will once again meet in New York City at Fordham University. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> excited to return to where, for me, it all started and to meet new members. We will have a graduate student day on Thursday, July 9 in which we will offer workshops specifically catered towards the needs of our CEE-GS members. Please make plans to attend. In my opinion, while NCTE is a great conference, CEE is takes that same commitment to education and camaraderie and magnifies it b...|$|R
60|$|October 31.--My weak lungs, {{combined}} with the exciting episodes of the voyage, have shaken my nervous system {{so much that the}} most trivial incident affects me. I can hardly believe that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the same man who tied the external iliac artery, an operation requiring the nicest precision, under a heavy rifle fire at Antietam. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>as</b> a child. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying half dozing last night about four bells in the middle watch trying in vain to drop into a refreshing sleep. There was no light inside my cabin, but a single ray of moonlight streamed in through the port hole, throwing a silvery flickering circle upon the door. As I lay I kept my drowsy eyes upon this circle, and was conscious that it was gradually becoming less well-defined as my senses left me, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> suddenly recalled to full wakefulness by the appearance of a small dark object in the very centre of the luminous disc. I lay quietly and breathlessly watching it. Gradually it grew larger and plainer, and then I perceived that it was a human hand which had been cautiously inserted through the chink of the half-closed door--a hand which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> observed with a thrill of horror, was not provided with fingers. The door swung cautiously backwards, and Goring's head followed his hand. It appeared in the centre of the moonlight, and was framed as it were in a ghastly uncertain halo, against which his features showed out plainly. It seemed to me that I had never seen such an utterly fiendish and merciless expression upon a human face. His eyes were dilated and glaring, his lips drawn back so as to show his white fangs, and his straight black hair appeared to bristle over his low forehead like the hood of a cobra. The sudden and noiseless apparition had such an effect upon me that I sprang up in bed trembling in every limb, and held out my hand towards my revolver. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> heartily ashamed of my hastiness when he explained the object of his intrusion, as he immediately did in the most courteous language. He had been suffering from toothache, poor fellow! and had come in to beg some laudanum, knowing that I possessed a medicine chest. As to a sinister expression he is never a beauty, and what with my state of nervous tension and the effect of the shifting moonlight it was easy to conjure up something horrible. I gave him twenty drops, and he went off again with many expressions of gratitude. I can hardly say how much this trivial incident affected me. I have felt unstrung all day.|$|R
