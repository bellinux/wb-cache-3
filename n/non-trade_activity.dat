Locating in parts of Asia, Latin America and other developing economies, they often diversified into <b>non-trading</b> <b>activities,</b> including the ownership of plantations. This article examines three such British firms active initially in Asia, though with operations also in North America, Europe, and Africa. Often regarded as handicapped by managerial failings, especially from the early twentieth century, the authors cast these firms as more entrepreneurial and possessing greater managerial competencies than has been suggested. The article argues that their business strategies continued to evolve in the interwar years and that, when viewed as business groups, their organizational forms were robust, though considerable diversity in the performance of the three British firms can be observed. This evidence is shown to have implications for wider debates about the competencies of British management as a. whole...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a case study {{analyzing}} the impacts of promotion and advertising conducted by the Washington Apple Commission (WAC) using both single- and multi-equation systems. The analyses are compared in terms of the comparability and coherency of results {{and in terms of the}} types of information that can be generated by the multi-equation model but not by the single-equation model. Due to the availability of detailed data from the WAC, the multi-equation system incorporates measures of actual lines of print media within an explicit model of print media as well as a measure of the multiplier effect associated with WAC promotion expenditures relative to the overall (retail-matched) level of print media. This information cannot be effectively included in a single-equation analysis. The multi-equation system also includes supply-response and price linkages between F. O. B. and retail levels. Monthly data are used for all systems. The results of this study suggest that in terms of predicting the quantity effects of promotion expenditures, if one conditions on F. O. B. price levels the effects of <b>non-trade</b> <b>activities</b> from the single equation are not statistically significant and seasonality is not a major factor in determining monthly demand. Conversely, within the multi-equation approach, results of this study suggest that <b>non-trade</b> <b>activities</b> did have a measurable impact on the demand for Washington apples and that seasonality is a major factor in determining monthly demand. In terms of predicting the price effects of promotion expenditures, if one conditions on supply elasticities, the approaches provide similar predictions of price impacts. However, the simultaneous supply feedback is significant in the apple industry case, so, by taking the interaction of supply and demand into account, the more complex multiple-equation approach predicts notable supply response-induced mitigation in price increases originally induced by promotion efforts relative to when impacts of promotions are measured under scenarios of a fixed supply function. Actual cost estimates by type of analysis are also provided for each approach. The estimates are based on actual costs incurred in conducting the analyses. The results of the case study provide a basis for assessing the necessity, as well as the benefits and costs, of conducting a detailed and complex multi-equation promotion evaluation relative to a simpler and more focused single-equation analysis of promotion effectiveness.

40|$|The {{concept of}} factor {{intensity}} {{has played a}} key role in the development of international trade theory. The factor proportions utilized in the production of commodities differ from activity to activity. Some commodities employ a higher ratio of capital to labor than do others, and the basic Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem explaining the pattern of international trade links a nations's factor endowment proportions of capital to labor to the capital/labor factor intensities of its export activities. This theorem has been exhaustively analyzed to reveal that exceptions may occur when technologies exhibit factor-intensity reversals, when demand conditions are highly asymmetric between countries, or when the number of factors and commodities exceeds the frequently-assumed value two. Our remarks in this paper proceed along different lines. We argue that in explaining the link between factor intensities associated with a nation's exports, imports or <b>non-traded</b> <b>activities</b> and that nation's factor endowment base, at least three rather separate roles for factor intensities can be identified. Once this is done, paradoxical statements such as, "Exports from laborabundant countries are capital intensive", can be shown to have some validity. Furthermore, in explaining this position recourse is had to various characteristics of technology and trade which have been in the forefront of recent developments in trade theory, e. g., quality differences in an intra-industry setting, increasing returns to scale activities, uncertainty in production, and the role of services in trade...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{deviations}} from the law of one price in tradable goods are {{an important source of}} violations of absolute PPP across countries. Using highly disaggregated export data, we document systematic international price discrimination: at the U. S. dock, U. S. exporters ship the same good to low-income countries at lower prices. This pricing-to-market is about twice as important as any local non-traded inputs, such as distribution costs, in explaining the differences in tradable prices across countries. We propose a model of consumer search that generates pricing-to-market. In this model, consumers in low-income countries have a comparative advantage in producing <b>non-traded,</b> non-market search <b>activities</b> and therefore are more price sensitive than consumers in high-income countries. We present cross-country time use evidence and evidence from U. S. export prices that are consistent with the model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a monthly domestic demand and supply equilibrium model for Washington apples {{that can be}} used to assess the effectiveness of price and non-price promotional activities. The econometric methodology employed takes into account market differences across the U. S. and is based on data pertaining to individual retail stores located throughout the U. S. The period of analysis is from September 1990 through August 2000 on a regional basis. A unique feature of the model is its explicit allowance for multiplier effects to exist between the level of print media (newspaper ad and flyers) expenditures provided by the Washington State Apple Commission (WAC) in support of apple demand and supplementary funds provided by retailers in support of apple promotion. In particular the model allows for the fact that Commission funds oftentimes represent only a relatively small fraction of the overall print media expenditures made in support of apple sales, and that Commission funds are often effectively only "pump priming" or serve as inducements for additional promotional activities by other entrepreneurs in the marketing chain. Also, the subset of promotional activities (print media and price reductions) provided by retailers is modeled in a dynamic fashion, whereby market conditions feedback affects the level of apple promotion provided by retailers. The overall model includes a set of retail demand equations, a set of retail-F. O. B. price linkage equations, a set of ad lines - WAC Ad buys linkage equations, and an aggregate industry supply function. Additional factors such as asymmetry in retail-F. O. B. price response, the effects of information technology in retail pricing, and the effects of the large crops and the Asian and the Mexican crises on domestic supply are all simultaneously considered. Results of this analysis indicate that, in the aggregate, price promotion is a significant factor positively impacting apple sales. Furthermore, price promotion elasticities were relatively high when compared to non-price promotional activities, leading to a conclusion that greater gains with respect to returns on promotional investment may occur when retail price reductions are pursued. Despite an increased domestic supply and the effects of the Mexican and the Asian crises, among the non-price promotional activities, results indicated that both non-trade (TV and Radio) and trade-related efforts (in store demonstrations, point of sale displays, promotional give-aways, and ad buys) have contributed to increased demand for Washington apples. Sensitivity analysis of trade and non-trade expenditures indicated that trade-related activities were more effective in increasing demand at current expenditure levels relative to <b>non-trade</b> <b>activities.</b> Promotional efforts in the form of billboards, food service expenditures, and other miscellaneous activities, which the industry also carried out during the historical period of analysis, did not have a measurable impact on demand in any of the regions. It was also found that WAC ad buy expenditures resulted in a multiplier effect on the total number of ad lines. While the direct effect of these Commission expenditures on demand would be relatively small without the supplementary efforts forthcoming from retailers, the fact that retailers multiplied the Commission's expenditures into a substantially larger promotional effort resulted in a significant positive effect on apple sales when viewing the promotion program as a whole.
