5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} serious competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp <b>now</b> <b>take</b> up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a change}} in {{election}} law approved by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will <b>now</b> <b>take</b> place in November, with the next election scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral election will take office January 1, 2018.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1656, Charles X Gustav {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with Brandenburg: the Treaty of Marienburg granted Greater Poland to Frederick William in return for military aid. While the Brandenburgian elector was free of Swedish vassalage in Greater Poland, he remained a Swedish vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. Brandenburgian garrisons then replaced the Swedish ones in Greater Poland, who went to reinforce Charles X Gustav's army. On 29 June however, Warsaw was stormed by John II Casimir, who had drawn up to Charles X Gustav with a force of 28,500 regulars and a noble levy of 18,000 to 20,000. Thereupon, Brandenburg actively participated {{in the war on}} the Swedish side, prompting John II Casimir Vasa to state that while his Tartars already had the Swedes for breakfast, he would <b>now</b> <b>take</b> Frederick William into custody, where neither sun nor moon would shine.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 30 ponds in the park. Some– {{including}} Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond– {{have been created}} to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds <b>now</b> <b>take</b> in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas {{of water in the}} park.|$|E
5|$|Due to Song's {{enormous}} {{population growth}} and the body of its appointed scholar-officials being accepted in limited numbers (about 20,000 active officials during the Song period), the larger scholarly gentry class would <b>now</b> <b>take</b> over grassroots affairs on the vast local level. Excluding the scholar-officials in office, this elite social class consisted of exam candidates, examination degree-holders not yet assigned to an official post, local tutors, and retired officials. These learned men, degree-holders, and local elites supervised local affairs and sponsored necessary facilities of local communities; any local magistrate appointed to his office by the government relied upon {{the cooperation of the}} few or many local gentry in the area. For example, the Song government—excluding the educational-reformist government under Emperor Huizong—spared little amount of state revenue to maintain prefectural and county schools; instead, the bulk of the funds for schools was drawn from private financing. This limited role of government officials was a departure from the earlier Tang dynasty (618–907), when the government strictly regulated commercial markets and local affairs; now the government withdrew heavily from regulating commerce and relied upon a mass of local gentry to perform necessary duties in their communities.|$|E

5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} would finally be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false ceiling was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers <b>now</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{tuition at}} the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents {{obtained}} from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted <b>now</b> <b>take</b> the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so that boys who are at prep school may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of {{government}} (Plan 12), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1988. Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish a nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government {{under the terms of}} the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. With this change, Council elections <b>now</b> <b>take</b> place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.|$|E

5|$|In Philadelphia, Thompson gains {{employment}} {{as a high}} school gym coach, while as Venom he comes into conflict with the U-Foes, who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology. When the U-Foes knock Venom, the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space. Kiernan and Thompson's lover Valkyrie later return home, leaving Venom alone. Brock returns as Toxin in Venom #30, to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U-Foes experiments: an alien-lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal. Thompson and Brock's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies: Venom and Toxin. Together, Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens, and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson, promising that the Venom symbiote will inevitably take over Thompson, and that he will return to kill him when that happens. Venom #39 sees the return of Jack, and the introduction of the new symbiote character Mania—Thompson's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom symbiote when Thompson uses it to protect her from Jack. Jack kills Mania's father, and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack's technology into believing he is the real Jack. According to Bunn, when he envisioned a new symbiote character Andi was not intended to be the host, but as the series progressed his plans changed. It is revealed that Mania's symbiote is the cloned symbiote from Way's 2003 Venom series. The symbiote expelled the clone, and the demonic brand along with it, passing it to Mania. When a team led by Crossbones starts killing the brand bearers and taking the brands for themselves, Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto. Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the symbiote, not Thompson. The series ends with Thompson admitting that despite his issues with his father, he had {{always wanted to be a}} dad, and that he will <b>now</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for Mania.|$|E
