The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate compositional and contextual determinants <b>of</b> <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> childhood vaccines in India using multilevel modelling. Methods and Findings: We studied characteristics of unvaccinated children using the District Level Health and Facility Survey 3, a nationally representative probability sample containing 65 617 children aged 12 – 23 months from 34 Indian states and territories. We developed four-level Bayesian binomial regression models to examine the determinants of non-vaccination.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundConsiderable {{research}} has identified barriers to antenatal influenza vaccination, yet no {{research has}} explored temporal trends in reasons for non-receipt. PurposeTo examine trends in reasons for <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> influenza vaccination during pregnancy. MethodsSerial cross-sectional analyses using 8 years of Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Survey (PRAMS) data were conducted. Weighted logistic regression {{was used to}} examine trends in the prevalence of citing reasons for non-receipt over time. ResultsBetween 2004 and 2011, 8300 women reported no influenza vaccination during or immediately before pregnancy. Proportions of women citing “doctor didn’t mention vaccination,” “in first trimester during influenza season,” and “not pregnant during influenza season” decreased significantly over time (Doctor didn’t mention: 48. 0 % vs. 27. 1 %, test for trend p< 0. 001; in first trimester: 26. 8 % vs. 16. 3 %, test for trend p< 0. 001; not influenza season: 24. 2 % vs. 12. 7 %, test for trend p= 0. 001). Safety concerns increased over 2004 proportions in 2010 (concern about side effects for me: 40. 2 % vs. 28. 5 %, prevalence ratio (PR) : 1. 41, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 16, 1. 71; concern about harming my baby: 38. 9 % vs. 31. 0 %, PR= 1. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 04, 1. 53) and 2011 (concern about side effects for me: 39. 0 % vs. 28. 5 %, PR= 1. 37, 95 % CI: 1. 13, 1. 65; concern about harming my baby: 38. 8 % vs. 31. 0 %, PR= 1. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 04, 1. 50). Following the 2009 / 2010 H 1 N 1 pandemic, more Hispanic women cited concern about vaccination harming their baby than other women; in 2011, their concern remained elevated relative to non-Hispanic white women (63 % vs. 35 %; adjusted PR= 1. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 23, 2. 61).

This article describes analyses that sought to produce models of social and emotional loneliness in older people, using demographic, psychological and health, and social variables. Method: Older people (aged 65 þ, n 1255) from the Barnsley metropolitan area of the United Kingdom were recruited randomly from within a stratified sampling frame and received a questionnaire-based interview (response rate: 68. 1 %). The questionnaire contained items and scales on demographic, psychological and health, and social characteristics, and a validated measure of loneliness that assesses both social and emotional loneliness. Results: Of the respondents, 7. 7 % were found to be severely or very severely lonely, while another 38. 3 % were moderately lonely. Social and emotional loneliness shared 19. 36 % variance. Being male, being widowed, low well-being, low self-esteem, low-income comfort, low contact with family, low contact with friends, low activity, low perceived community integration, and receipt of community care were significant predictors of social loneliness (R 0. 50, R 2 0. 25, F(18, 979) 18. 17, p < 0. 001).

Three broad issues were identified. First, the inaccuracy of the computer database (the FPC register) meant some women were inaccessible because they no longer lived at the address recorded. Other women were ineligible or unsuitable within the criteria of the scheme but had been sent invitations inappropriately because their screening records were incomplete or out of date. Second, aspects of service organisation and provision led to misclassification of some attenders as non-attenders and to various failures of communication such as <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> the invitation or health education leaflet or unsuccessful attempts to rearrange appointments. In addition, the appointment or venue offered could be unsatisfactory. The third issue concerned {{the characteristics of the}} women which sometimes interacted with practical problems connected with service provision. Other women believed the test to be inappropriate for themselves while some were deterred by the prospect of the test itself. In general, embarrassment was pervasive and reflected in preferences for different types of service provision. Women who had neither attended nor been otherwise tested were particularly likely to express feelings of fear and fatalism. General attitudes to the test were favourable but this was not always applied personally.

In contrast to higher-income countries, however, there is a critical evidence gap {{on the role of}} school food environments on children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. This mixed-methods study contributes to filling this gap by investigating the role of school food environments on dietary behaviours of children and adolescents in Ghana. It draws on data from household and school questionnaires as well as focus group discussions collected as part of the baseline for an impact evaluation of the Ghana School Feeding Programme (GSFP). Multi-level regression models were fitted with random intercepts at the individual, household and community levels. Excerpts from the focus group discussions provided a deeper understanding of quantitative findings. Children and adolescents who received free school meals provided by the GSFP or who lived further away from school were less likely to go home for lunch. More than half of sampled schools reported offering foods for sale by independent vendors, the most common being meals followed by confectionery, fruit and sugar-sweetened beverages. Predictors of bringing money to school to buy food included <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> free school meals, adolescence, greater commuting distance from home, household asset score, and urban location.

However, there are a lack <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{on the effect of}} deworming therapy on CD 4 count recovery among HIV-infected persons taking ART. To estimate the association between empiric deworming therapy and CD 4 count after ART initiation, we performed a retrospective observational study among HIV-infected adults on ART at a publicly operated HIV clinic in southwestern Uganda. Subjects were assigned as having received deworming if prescribed an anti-helminthic agent between 7 and 90 days before a CD 4 test. To estimate the association between deworming and CD 4 count, we fit multivariable regression models and analyzed predictors of CD 4 count, using a time-by-interaction term with receipt or <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> deworming. From 1998 to 2009, 5, 379 subjects on ART attended 21, 933 clinic visits at which a CD 4 count was measured. Subjects received deworming prior to 668 (3 %) visits. Overall, deworming was not associated with a significant difference in CD 4 count in either the first year on ART (β = 42. 8; 95 % CI, - 2. 1 to 87. 7) or after the first year of ART (β =  - 9. 9; 95 % CI, - 24. 1 to 4. 4).

Appointments with 29 patients and accompanying persons were recorded, and the corpus was repeatedly listened to, in conjunction with the transcripts in order to identify the segments of talk where there was an action hearable as diagnostic delivery, that is where the clinician is evaluating the patient’s condition. Results: Using a conversation analytic approach this analysis suggests that diagnostic communication, which is sensitive and responsive to the patient and their carers, is not predicated on {{the presence or absence of}} particular lexical choices. There is inherent complexity regarding dementia diagnosis, especially in the ‘early stages’, which is produced through and reflected in diagnostic talk in clinical encounters. Conclusion: In the context of continuity of dementia care, diagnostic information is communicated in a way that conforms to intersubjective norms of minimizing catastrophic reactions in medical communication, and is sensitive to problems associated with ‘insight’ in terms of delivery and receipt or <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Diabetes {{complications}} {{are potentially}} avoidable, yet incomplete care is common. Little {{is known about}} patient characteristics that predict incomplete care. Methods: English Longitudinal Study of Ageing participants aged 50 years or older with diabetes reported on four diabetes quality indicators (QIs) in 2008 - 9 and 2010 - 11. Annual checks for glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), proteinuria and foot examination were assessed as a care bundle (n= 907). A further QI assessed whether participants with cardiac risk factors were offered ACE inhibitors/receptor blockers (n= 759). Individual’s baseline (2008 - 9) socio-demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics, diabetes self-management knowledge and health literacy, and previous QI achievement were assessed with logistic regressions on outcomes in 2010 - 11. Results: A third of participants (2008 - 9 = 32. 8 %; 2010 - 11 = 32. 2 %) did not receive all annual checks in the care bundle. Nearly half of those eligible were not offered ACE inhibitors/receptor blockers (2008 - 9 = 44. 6 %; 2010 - 11 = 44. 5 %). Odds of not receiving a complete care bundle were increased for participants lacking diabetes self-management knowledge (OR= 2. 05), having poorer cognitive performance (OR= 1. 78) or having previously received incomplete care (OR= 3. 32). Participants who were single (OR= 2. 16), had with low health literacy (OR= 1. 50) and who had received incomplete care previously (OR= 6. 94) {{were less likely to}} subsequently be offered ACE inhibitors/receptor blockers, whereas trend test showed that being older (OR= 0. 76) and increased BMI categorisation (OR= 0. 70) improved odds of receiving this aspect of care. Conclusions: Quality improvement initiatives for diabetes might usefully target patients with characteristics shown here to predict <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> indicated care, such as poor knowledge of annual diabetes care processes or previous receipt of incomplete care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Management {{of chronic}} {{diseases}} requires patients {{to adhere to}} recommended health behavior change and complete tests for monitoring. While studies have shown an association between low income and lack of adherence, the reasons why people with low income {{may be less likely}} to adhere are unclear. We sought to determine the association between household income and receipt of health behavior change advice, adherence to advice, receipt of recommended monitoring tests, and self-reported reasons for non-adherence/non-receipt. METHODS: We conducted a population-weighted survey, with 1849 respondents with cardiovascular-related chronic diseases (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke) from Western Canada (n =  1849). We used log-binomial regression to examine the association between household income and the outcome variables of interest: receipt of advice for and adherence to health behavior change (sodium reduction, dietary improvement, increased physical activity, smoking cessation, weight loss), reasons for non-adherence, receipt of recommended monitoring tests (cholesterol, blood glucose, blood pressure), and reasons for <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> tests. RESULTS: Behavior change advice was received equally by both low and high income respondents. Low income respondents were more likely than those with high income to not adhere to recommendations regarding smoking cessation (adjusted prevalence rate ratio (PRR) : 1. 55, 95 %CI: 1. 09 - 2. 20), and more likely to not receive measurements of blood cholesterol (PRR: 1. 72, 95 %CI 1. 24 - 2. 40) or glucose (PRR: 1. 80, 95 %CI: 1. 26 - 2. 58). Those with low income were less likely to state that non-adherence/non-receipt was due to personal choice, and more likely to state that it was due to an extrinsic factor, such as cost or lack of accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: There are important income-related differences in the patterns of health behavior change and disease monitoring, as well as reasons for non-adherence or non-receipt. Among those with low income, adherence to health behavior change and monitoring may be improved by addressing modifiable barriers such as cost and access...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundLiver resections (LRs) are {{performed}} {{with increasing frequency}} for metastatic disease. To {{minimize the risk of}} postoperative complications, a period of 6 weeks between the last dose of chemotherapy and LR is typically recommended. The current study examines postoperative morbidity and mortality following LR in patients who received chemotherapy within 30 days prior to LR. MethodsThe merged 2005 – 2007 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Participant Use File was queried for perioperative risk factors, laboratory values and postoperative occurrences or complications in patients who underwent LR. Patients were grouped according to their receipt or <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> chemotherapy within 30 days prior to LR and major postoperative complications. ResultsA total of 2331 patients underwent LR; 2147 did not receive chemotherapy within 30 days of resection (No Chemo group) and 184 received chemotherapy within 30 days prior to resection (Chemo group). The groups were similar with regard to preoperative co-morbidities and operative factors. The median NSQIP statistically computed morbidity probability was similar between the groups (No Chemo 0. 32, Chemo 0. 34; P= 0. 07), whereas the median mortality probability was higher in the Chemo group (0. 02) than the No Chemo group (0. 014; P= 0. 001). Thirty-day survival was similar between the two groups (No Chemo 97 %, Chemo 98 %; P= 0. 44). Major complication rates did not differ between the groups (No Chemo 20 %, Chemo 18 %; P= 0. 51). Factors associated with major complications in the Chemo group included: extent of resection; intraoperative transfusion; preoperative ascites, and preoperative haematocrit. DiscussionMajor morbidity was not increased in Chemo patients. The strongest predictors of major postoperative complications in the Chemo group were extent of resection and intraoperative red cell transfusion. Although the NSQIP dataset does not include data about tumour type or chemotherapy regimen, these data suggest that LR may be safely performed within 30 days of chemotherapy, thereby minimizing the length of time during which patients do not receive systemic treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} {{the status of}} oropharyngeal yeast colonization in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected outpatients {{in the era of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study from October 2009 to January 2010 at a medical centre in southern Taiwan. Fungal cultures of the oropharyngeal swabs were performed on 327 enrolled patients. At enrolment, 258 (79 %) patients had been receiving HAART, and 42 (12. 8 %), 73 (22. 3 %) and 212 (64. 8 %) patients had CD 4 cell counts ≤ 200, 201 – 350, and > 350 cells/mm 3, respectively. Oral yeast colonization was detected in 193 (59 %) patients, among whom 157 (81. 3 %), 25 (13. 0 %), and 11 (5. 7 %) were colonized by a single, two and more than two species, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that receipt of efavirenz-containing regiments and CD 4 cell counts > 200 cells/mm 3 were associated with lower risks of oral yeast colonization, while intravenous drug users were at a higher risk. Among the 241 isolates recovered, Candida albicans accounted for 69. 7 %, followed by C. dubliniensis (9. 5 %), C. glabrata (8. 3 %), C. tropicalis (3. 3 %), C. intermedia (2. 1 %), C. parapsilosis (1. 7 %), and 11 other species (5. 4 %). Overall, 230 (95. 4 %), 236 (97. 9 %) and 240 (99. 6 %) isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. In conclusion, colonization by C. dubliniensis has emerged in recent years. In addition to a CD 4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm 3, which is a known risk factor for oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected patients that was identified in our previous studies, two risk factors, <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> efavirenz-based combinations and intravenous drug use, were first identified in the present study. Fluconazole remained effective in vitro against the yeasts colonizing the oropharynx in this population...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{considerable}} interest in understanding further {{the factors that}} {{increase the risk of}} post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for military personnel. This study aimed to investigate the relative contribution of demographic variables; childhood adversity; the nature of exposure to traumatic events during deployment; appraisal of these experiences; and home-coming experiences in relation to the prevalence of PTSD 'caseness' as measured by a score of 50 on the PTSD Checklist (PCL) in UK Armed Forces personnel who have been deployed in Iraq since 2003. METHOD: Data were drawn from the first stage of a retrospective cohort study comparing UK military personnel who were deployed to the 2003 Iraq War with personnel serving in the UK Armed Forces on 31 March 2003 but who were not deployed to the initial phase of war fighting. Participants were randomly selected and invited to participate. The response rate was 61 %. We have limited these analyses to 4762 regular service individuals who responded to the survey and who have been deployed in Iraq since 2003. RESULTS: Post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with lower rank, being unmarried, having low educational attainment and a history of childhood adversity. Exposure to potentially traumatizing events, in particular being deployed to a 'forward' area in close contact with the enemy, was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. Appraisals of the experience as involving threat to one's own life and a perception that work in theatre was above an individual's trade and experience were strongly associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. Low morale and poor social support within the unit and <b>non-receipt</b> <b>of</b> a home-coming brief (psycho-education) were associated with greater risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Personal appraisal of threat to life during the trauma emerged as the most important predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms. These results also raise the possibility that there are important modifiable occupational factors such as unit morale, leadership, preparing combatants for their role in theatre which may influence an individual's risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Therefore interventions focused on systematic preparation of personnel for the extreme stress of combat may help to lessen the psychological impact of deployment...|$|R
