40|$|Signaling by Notch family receptors is {{involved}} in many cell-fate decisions during development. Several modifiers of Notch activity have been identified, suggesting that regulation of Notch signaling is complex. In a genetic screen for modifiers of Notch activity, we identified a gene encoding a novel WD 40 -repeat protein. The gene is called <b>Notchless,</b> because loss-of-function mutant alleles dominantly suppress the wing notching caused by certain Notch alleles. Reducing <b>Notchless</b> activity increases Notch activity. Overexpression of <b>Notchless</b> in Xenopus or Drosophila {{appears to have a}} dominant-negative effect in that it also increases Notch activity. Biochemical studies show that <b>Notchless</b> binds to the cytoplasmic domain of Notch, suggesting that it serves as a direct regulator of Notch signaling activity...|$|E
40|$|Nearly 240 WD repeat {{proteins}} {{have been}} identified from the Arabidopsis genome. Among these, some well characterized WDR proteins were shown to regulate various developmental processes in plants. 1 We have recently isolated in Solanum chacoense a homolog of the Drosophila <b>NOTCHLESS</b> gene. In Drosophila, <b>NOTCHLESS</b> regulates {{the activity of the}} Notch signaling pathway through a direct interaction with the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor. Although the Notch signaling pathway does not exist in yease and plants, the NLE gene is conserved in animals, plants and yeast. Furthermore, functional conservation was suggested by expression of the plant NLE gene in Drosophila. In plants, underexpression of the plant NLE gene altered numerous developmental processes including seed development, and resulted in reduced aerial organ size and organ numbers, in delayed flowering, and in an increased stomatal index. Surprisingly, the link between these pleiotropic phenotypes is the recently discovered of the involvement of NLE in ribosome biogenesis, emphasizing its role in proper cellular growth and proliferation during plant development...|$|E

The nominal performance of sixtransistor (6 -T) SRAM cells is studied via 3 -D simulation of full cell structures. Compact (analytical) modeling {{is used to}} estimate SRAM cell yields.

40|$|International audienceBlood cell {{production}} {{relies on}} the coordinated activities of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent and lineage-restricted progenitors. Here, we identify <b>Notchless</b> (Nle) as a critical factor for HSC maintenance under both homeostatic and cytopenic conditions. Nle deficiency leads to a rapid and drastic exhaustion of HSCs and immature progenitors and failure to maintain quiescence in HSCs. In contrast, Nle is dispensable for cycling-restricted progenitors and differentiated cells. In yeast, Nle/Rsa 4 is essential for ribosome biogenesis, and we show that its role in pre- 60 S subunit maturation has been conserved in the mouse. Despite its implication in this basal cellular process, Nle deletion affects ribosome biogenesis only in HSCs and immature progenitors. Ribosome biogenesis defects are accompanied by p 53 activation, which causes their rapid exhaustion. Collectively, our findings establish an essential role for Nle in HSC and immature progenitor functions and uncover previously unsuspected differences in ribosome biogenesis that distinguish stem cells from restricted progenitor populations...|$|E
40|$|Notch {{signaling}} is an evolutionarily conserved pathway {{involved in}} intercellular communication and {{is essential for}} proper cell fate choices. Numerous genes participate in the modulation of the Notch signaling pathway activity. Among them, <b>Notchless</b> (Nle) is a direct regulator of the Notch activity identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we characterized the murine ortholog of Nle and demonstrated that it has conserved the ability to modulate Notch signaling. We also generated mice deficient for mouse Nle (mNle) and showed that its disruption resulted in embryonic lethality shortly after implantation. In late mNle−/− blastocysts, inner cell mass (ICM) cells died through a caspase 3 -dependent apoptotic process. Most deficient embryos exhibited a delay in the temporal down-regulation of Oct 4 expression in the trophectoderm (TE). However, mNle-deficient TE was able to induce decidual swelling in vivo and properly differentiated in vitro. Hence, our results indicate that mNle is mainly required in ICM cells, being instrumental for their survival, and raise {{the possibility that the}} death of mNle-deficient embryos might result from abnormal Notch signaling during the first steps of development...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMaintenance of cell {{survival}} {{is essential for}} proper embryonic development. In the mouse, <b>Notchless</b> homolog 1 (Drosophila) (Nle 1) is instrumental for survival of cells of the inner cell mass upon implantation. Here, we analyze the function of Nle 1 after implantation using the Meox 2 tm 1 (cre) Sor mouse that expresses the Cre recombinase specifically in the epiblast at E 5. 5. First, we find that NLE 1 function is required in epiblast cells, as Nle 1 -deficient cells are rapidly eliminated. In this report, we also show that the Meox 2 Cre transgene is active in specific tissues during organogenesis. In particular, we detect high Cre expression in the vertebral column, ribs, limbs and tailbud. We took advantage of this dynamic expression profile to analyze the effects of inducing mosaic deletion of Nle 1 in the embryo. We show that Nle 1 deletion in this context, results in severe developmental anomalies leading to lethality at birth. Mutant embryos display multiple developmental defects in particular during axial skeletal formation. We also provide evidence that axial defects are due {{to an increase in}} apoptotic cell death in the somite at E 9. 5. These data demonstrate an essential role for Nle 1 during organogenesis and in particular during axial development...|$|E
40|$|Gametophytes of the fern Ceratopteris {{are either}} male or hermaphroditic. Their sex is epigenetically {{determined}} by the pheromone antheridiogen, which is secreted by the hermaphrodite and induces male and represses female development in other young, sexually undetermined gametophytes. To understand how antheridiogen represses the development of female traits at the genetic level, 16 new mutations that feminize the gametophyte {{in the presence of}} antheridiogen were identified and characterized. Seven are very tightly linked to the FEM 1 locus previously described. Nine others define another locus named <b>NOTCHLESS</b> 1 (NOT 1), as several of the not 1 mutants lack a meristem notch. Some not 1 mutations also affect sporophyte development only when homozygous, indicating that the not 1 mutations are recessive and that NOT 1 is also required for normal sporophyte development. The epistatic interactions among FEM 1, NOT 1, and other sex-determining genes are described. This information was used to expand the genetic model of the sex-determining pathway in Ceratopteris. On the basis of this model, we can say that the presence of antheridiogen leads to the activation of the FEM 1 gene, which not only promotes the differentiation of male traits, but also represses female development by activating the NOT 1 gene. NOT 1 represses the TRA genes necessary for the development of female traits in the gametophyte...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRibosome biogenesis is an {{essential}} cellular process. Its impairment is associated with developmental defects and increased risk of cancer. The in vivo cellular responses to defective ribosome biogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In particular, the consequences of impaired ribosome biogenesis within the intestinal epithelium in mammals have not been investigated so far. Here we adopted a genetic approach to investigate the role of <b>Notchless</b> (NLE), {{an essential}} actor of ribosome biogenesis, in the adult mouse intestinal lineage. Nle deficiency led to defects in the synthesis of large ribosomal subunit in crypts cells and resulted in the rapid elimination of intestinal stem cells and progenitors through distinct types of cellular responses, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and biased differentiation toward the goblet cell lineage. Similar observations were made using the rRNA transcription inhibitor CX- 5461 on intestinal organoids culture. Importantly, we found that p 53 activation was {{responsible for most of}} the cellular responses observed, including differentiation toward the goblet cell lineage. Moreover, we identify the goblet cell-specific marker Muc 2 as a direct transcriptional target of p 53. Nle-deficient ISCs and progenitors disappearance persisted in the absence of p 53, underlying the existence of p 53 -independent cellular responses following defective ribosome biogenesis. Our data indicate that NLE is a crucial factor for intestinal homeostasis and provide new insights into how perturbations of ribosome biogenesis impact on cell fate decisions within the intestinal epithelium...|$|E
40|$|During peri-implantation, {{the embryo}} {{transitions}} from a suspension {{environment in the}} fallopian tubes to an adherent system within the uterus. Successful transition requires maternal and fetal signaling cascades that establish maternal-fetal boundaries. Failure is common, as ~ 25 % of all human pregnancies terminate during these steps. A large-scale mutation study in mice produced two mutants (l 11 Jus 1 and l 11 Jus 4) that are excellent models of this transition. l 11 Jus 1 and l 11 Jus 4 contain missense mutations in the <b>Notchless</b> homolog 1 (Drosophila) (Nle 1) gene. NLE 1 is thought to signal via the canonical NOTCH pathway in vertebrates. Although in invertebrates and lower vertebrates, NOTCH signaling directs cell fate prior to gastrulation, it is dispensable for gastrulation in mice. Moreover, in yeast and plants, which lack NOTCH signaling, Nle 1 is crucial for ribosome biogenesis. These seemingly contradictory data led me to hypothesize that mutation of Nle 1 causes a lethal trauma to the embryo that disrupts multiple signaling pathways during peri-implantation development. I present data that: 1. Refute the presumption that Nle 1 functions as a negative regulator of NOTCH during pre-implantation development; 2. Demonstrate that mutations in Nle 1 lead to mis-expression of {{several members of the}} Wnt pathway; and 3. Show that mutant embryos enter cell cycle arrest; when that fails, they undergo p 53 -mediated programmed cell death. To understand the trauma(s) that precipitated these lethal cascades, I discovered that Nle 1 mutants display delays in ribosomal RNA processing and nucleogenesis. These results uncover novel functions for NLE 1 in the ribosomal biogenesis, TRP 53 and WNT pathways during mammalian embryonic development. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Our {{interests}} lie {{in determining the}} genes and genetic pathways that are important for establishing and maintaining maternal-fetal interactions during pregnancy. Mutation analysis targeted to a 34 Mb domain flanked by Trp 53 and Wnt 3 demonstrates that this region of mouse chromosome 11 contains {{a large number of}} essential genes. Two mutant alleles (l 11 Jus 1 and l 11 Jus 4), which fall into the same complementation group, survive through implantation but fail prior to gastrulation. Results Through a positional cloning strategy, we discovered that these homozygous mutant alleles contain non-conservative missense mutations in the <b>Notchless</b> homolog 1 (Drosophila) (Nle 1) gene. NLE 1 {{is a member of the}} large WD 40 -repeat protein family, and is thought to signal via the canonical NOTCH pathway in vertebrates. However, the phenotype of the Nle 1 mutant mice is much more severe than single Notch receptor mutations or even in animals in which NOTCH signaling is blocked. To test the hypothesis that NLE 1 functions in multiple signaling pathways during pre-implantation development, we examined expression of multiple Notch downstream target genes, as well as select members of the Wnt pathway in wild-type and mutant embryos. We did not detect altered expression of any primary members of the Notch pathway or in Notch downstream target genes. However, our data reveal that Cdkn 1 a, a NOTCH target, was upregulated in Nle 1 mutants, while several members of the Wnt pathway are downregulated. In addition, we found that Nle 1 mutant embryos undergo caspase-mediated apoptosis as hatched blastocysts, but not as morulae or blastocysts. Conclusions Taken together, these results uncover potential novel functions for NLE 1 in the WNT and CDKN 1 A pathways during embryonic development in mammals. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{proposes a}} new and less {{laborious}} version of the size-effect method for measuring the fracture energy or fracture toughness of concrete {{as well as other}} nonlinear fracture characteristics, such as the effective length of fracture process zone or critical crack-tip opening displacement. The size-effect method, based on the size-effect law, is the simplest to carry out because only the maximum loads of specimens need to be measured. No measurements of postpeak deflection and unloading stiffness, nor observations of crack-tip location, are needed; the testing machine need not be very stiff, and {{there is no need for}} closed-loop displacement control. The simplicity of the method makes it suitable not only for the laboratory but also for field quality control. In the original version of the size-effect method, notched specimens of different sizes are tested. The proposed new version further simplifies testing by allowing the use of notched specimens of only one size. The idea is to supplement the one-size notched-beam tests with an evaluation of the maximum load value for specimens with a zero-brittleness number. There are two types of methods that will achieve this. In one type of method, zero-brittleness data are obtained by using plastic limit analysis based on the modulus of rupture or compression strength of concrete to calculate the limiting nominal strength for zero specimen size. In the second type of method, zero-brittleness data are obtained by testing the maximum loads of <b>notchless</b> specimens of the same size. The former type leads to simpler calculations but has the drawback that the material strength to calculate the maximum load for zero size depends on specimen geometry. Both types of the zero-brittleness version of the size-effect method are validated by previously reported test data. The proposed method should also be applicable to other quasibrittle materials such as rock, ice, tough ceramics, and brittle composites...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the genetic pathways required for early mammalian fetal development, a positional cloning study was performed using two embryonic lethal lines of mice, l 11 Jus 1, and l 11 Jus 4. These lines were derived from an ENU mutagenesis screen targeted to a 34 Mb region of mouse chromosome 11. The mutations were identified for both lines in <b>Notchless</b> (Nle 1), a regulator of the Notch pathway, and a gene expression study was initiated. RNA was isolated from wild type and l 11 Jus 1 homozygous embryos for qRT- PCR analysis using a Notch pathway focused PCR array. Genes present on the array include Notch ligands, receptors, target genes, transcription factors, and genes from other related genetic pathways. Very few Notch target genes were misregulated in the mutants, while there was a non-significant down regulation of some of the ligands and receptors. Only Cdkn 1 a was significantly up-regulated in the mutants. Cdkn 1 a is a target gene of Notch signaling, but is also involved in apoptosis. Surprisingly, this study revealed a down-regulation of Wnt genes in the mutant embryos during pre-implantation development. Wnt and Notch are known to interact later in development during somitogenesis, but Notch is not required during pre-implantation development. This study shows a component of Notch signaling (i. e. Nle 1) interacts with Wnt during peri-implantation in the developing embryo without affecting global Notch signaling. The over-expression of Cdkn 1 a could result from misregulation of Notch, disruption in another Nle 1 dependent pathway during this developmental timepoint or because the embryo is undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, either Notch signaling interacts with Wnt during pre-implantation development, or Nle 1 acts through a yet to be identified pathway that alters Wnt signaling. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the interfacial fracture toughness (IFT) of composite cement with dispersed filler (DF) versus polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite blocks after 2 different surface pretreatments using the <b>notchless</b> triangular prism (NTP) test. Two DFs (Cerasmart [CRT] and Lava Ultimate [LVA]), 2 PICNs (Enamic [ENA] and experimental PICN [EXP]), and e. max CAD lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (EMX, control) prism samples were bonded to their counterparts with Variolink Esthetic DC composite cement after either hydrofluoric acid etching (HF) or gritblasting (GR). Both procedures were followed by silanization. All samples (n = 30 per group) were thermocycled (10, 000 cycles) and tested for their IFT in a water bath at 36 °C. Moreover, representative samples from each group were subjected to a developed interfacial area ratio (Sdr) measurement by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization. EXP-HF gave the highest IFT (1. 85 ± 0. 39 MPa·m 1 / 2), followed by EMX-HF and ENA-HF, while CRT-HF gave the lowest (0. 15 ± 0. 22 MPa·m 1 / 2). PICNs gave significantly better results with HF, and DF showed better results with GR. A 2 -way analysis of variance indicated that there were significantly higher IFT and Sdr for PICNs than for DF. A positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 872) was found between IFT and Sdr. SEM characterization showed the specific microstructure of the surface of etched PICNs, indicating the presence of a retentive polymerbased honeycomb structure. Etching of the typical double-network microstructure of PICNs causes an important increase in the Sdr and IFT, while DF should be gritblasted. DF exhibited significantly lower Sdr and IFT values than PICNs. The present results show the important influence of the material class and surface texture, and consequently the micromechanical bond, on the adhesive interface performance of CAD-CAM compositesPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2012. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor:Mihai Marasteanu. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 136 pages. Asphalt concrete mixtures behave as quasi-brittle materials at temperatures {{close to the}} glass transition of the component asphalt binder. A salient feature of structures that consists of quasi-brittle materials is that there exists an intricate size effect on the structural strength. The existence of such size effect is mainly attributed to the presence and the stable growth of a relatively large fracture process zone (FPZ) that develops ahead of the crack tip prior to failure (maximum load) of the structure. This inelastic region is characterized by non-linear material deformation and fracture energy dissipation that ultimately generate stress redistribution and govern the strain-softening of the material. Understanding this size effect is crucial for two purposes: a) extrapolation of small-scale laboratory testing results to full-scale design, and b) identification of material fracture properties. In this research work, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the size effect of asphalt concrete tested in semi-circular bend (SCB) test at low temperature. Geometrically similar specimens of different sizes and with different notch lengths were tested. The experimental results were analyzed with the energetic-size effect theory, and were used to develop type I and II strength scaling laws, respectively, for the <b>notchless</b> and deep notched specimens. The validity of the scaling laws at large sizes was evaluated through finite element simulations of mode I crack growth in the SCB test. A cohesive zone model (CZM) was successfully calibrated by experimental data, and implemented to predict the nominal strength in large SCB specimens. The strengths predicted from the numerical models were in good agreement with the scaling laws' strength prediction. Based on the analyses of the strength scaling laws derived, important conclusions on the fracture behavior of asphalt concrete at low temperature, as well as size of FPZ were drawn...|$|E
