Yet, this is subjected to the pre-specification in the service contract and the maximum should not exceed 48 hours per week or 88 hours in any consecutive two week time. In addition, a shift worker can work up to 12 hours a day, provided that the average working hours per week do not exceed 44 over a consecutive 3-week time. The overtime allowance per overtime hour must not be less than 1.5 times of the employee’s hour basic rates.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} whether elective joint arthroplasty {{performed at the}} weekend {{is associated with a}} different 30 -day mortality versus that performed between Monday and Friday. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the 30 -day cumulative mortality rate (Kaplan-Meier) for all elective hip and knee arthroplasties performed in England and Wales between 1 st April 2003 and 31 st December 2014, comprising 118 096 episodes undertaken at the weekend and 1 233 882 episodes performed on a weekday. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression models to assess for time-dependent variation and adjusted for identified risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: The cumulative 30 -day mortality for hip arthroplasty was 0. 15 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 12 to 0. 19) for patients operated on at the weekend versus 0. 20 % (95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 21) for patients undergoing surgery during the <b>normal</b> <b>working</b> <b>week.</b> For knee arthroplasty, the cumulative 30 -day mortality was 0. 14 % (95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 17) for weekend-operated patients versus 0. 18 % (95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 19) for weekday-operated patients. These differences were independent of any differences in patient age, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade, surgeon seniority, surgical and anaesthetic practices, and thromboprophylaxis choice in weekend versus weekday-operated patients. CONCLUSION: The 30 -day mortality rate after elective joint arthroplasty is low.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was {{to carry out a}} {{feasibility}} study of implementing a small-scale biogas plant on KTH campus using food wastes from the neighbouring restaurants and KTH kitchens as input substrate, where the biogas produced could be used in the Energy laboratory, to run the micro turbine, as an example. Considering that KTH has 10 departments and that each department has its own kitchen, the amount of food wastes that can be recuperated for input to the plant is around 225 kg per day for a <b>normal</b> <b>working</b> <b>week,</b> requiring a 10 m 3 biogas plant. This report also relates to the potential implementation of small-scale biogas plants on farms in Mauritius using manure and crop endings as input substrate as a solution to the waste management problems the farmers are currently facing as well as using the biogas to provide energy for cooking and heating. Based on the quantity of food wastes available from the neighbouring restaurants, the sizing of the proposed biogas plant was calculated and the best technical and commercial options were considered. An experimental biogas plant was setup on the campus and the planning and logistics involved were studied as well as the potential quantity and quality of gas produced from food wastes. The optimal biogas production for a 5 m 3 capacity biogas plant and processing food wastes is 6 to 10 m 3 of biogas per day composed of about 68 - 72 % methane. But, since the experiment was run for only a two-week period, the optimum biogas production could not be reached. Several operational and biological problems were encountered during the operation of the plant. However, the output of the experiment is positive as the logistics required for the setting up and running of a biogas plant on campus or elsewhere including the technicality of such a plant and the human resources requirements have been deduced from the lessons learned...|$|E
40|$|A SenseCam {{can provide}} a {{detailed}} visual archive of a person’s life, activities and experiences. However, {{as the number of}} images captured per year can extend beyond one million, gaining an insight into an individual’s lifestyle in a fast, effective and intuitive manner is a challenging prospect. In this work, we develop an interactive image browsing tool, which incorporates visualisation techniques that can capture not only a snapshot of an individual’s lifestyle over long periods of time, but also how that lifestyle varies with changing days, weeks, or years. The image retrieval tool incorporates the Colour of Life algorithms [1], which can represent an overview of millions of images with a single visualisation. The Colour of Life algorithms focus on the relationship between lifestyle and colour, by capturing the colours to which we are exposed in our lives (and therefore captured by SenseCam images), collating similar colours for specific time periods and depicting how those colours change over time with a flowing time-line – see Figure 1 which depicts the life of a SenseCam user over the period of 8 days. In this figure, time is orientated along the horizontal axis and larger vertical peaks indicate higher user activity for a given period of time. In Figure 1, the <b>normal</b> <b>working</b> <b>week</b> consists of the rhythmical blue, pink (work) and yellow (home) peaks and troughs for each day (with less activity at the start and end of the days), whereas time outdoors increases at the weekend, especially during the night (and hence the darker colours on the left hand side of the figure). The Colour of Life visualisation, while providing information on changes in lifestyle, does not provide sufficient context to understand the exact activities of a user for a given time period. For example, on the left of Figure 1 there is a peak of purple, that does not occur anywhere else during the 8 days of activities images – where was the user {{at this point in time}} and what was he doing? In this work, we build an interactive image browsing tool based around the Colour of Life visualisation. We exploit the use of high resolution multi-touch display walls, where we extend the Colour of Life algorithms to produce an intuitive visualisation, which incorporates image mosaicing (see Figure 2). Through this we incorporate coarse lifestyle data with more fine detailed contextual information on human activities into one interactive visualisation tool. As an additional feature, we have investigated the use of image classification within the framework of the Colour of Life. One such example is the categorisation of images as being as social (i. e. interacting with other people) or non-social. Using such a classification, we can depict a person’s social lifestyle, and how that varies over time...|$|E
