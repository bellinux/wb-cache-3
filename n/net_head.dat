40|$|A {{dichotomy}} in {{regulatory treatment}} and corporate cultures exists between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication carriers. Telephone company executives (Bell Heads) may resent regulation, but they accept their fate and work creatively to exploit anomalies {{and opportunities to}} secure a regulation-conferred competitive advantage. Most ISP executives (<b>Net</b> <b>Heads)</b> appear to embrace a libertarian attitude, strongly opposing any government involvement. Despite the clash of cultures, the telecommunications and Internet worlds have merged. Such convergence jeopardizes the ability of <b>Net</b> <b>Heads</b> to avoid some degree of regulation, particularly when they offer services functionally equivalent to what their Bell Head counterparts offer. This paper will assess the regulatory consequences when telecommunication and Internet services converge in the marketplace {{and in terms of}} operating technologies. The paper identifies commercial developments in the Internet to support the view that the Internet has become more hierarchical and more like telecommunication networks. The paper concludes that telecommunication carriers will display superior skill in working the regulatory process to their advantage. The paper suggests that Bell <b>Heads</b> will outmaneuver <b>Net</b> <b>Heads</b> particularly when the revenue siphoning effect of Internet-mediated services offsets the revenues generated from ISP leases of telecommunication transmission capacity...|$|R

5000|$|On December 3, 2013, Frank was demoted, relegated by <b>Nets</b> <b>head</b> coach Jason Kidd {{to merely}} filing team {{evaluation}} reports. This so-called [...] "re-assignment" [...] meant that Frank would {{be banned from}} being on the bench during games and from even attending team practices. This resulted from escalating tensions and squabbling between the two over the 'right' coaching philosophies, strategies, and tactics for the team.|$|R
50|$|To replace Carlesimo, the Nets hired Jason Kidd, who was {{one week}} removed from {{retiring}} as a player, to become their new head coach on June 12, 2013.

50|$|Manapouri Power Station, Fiordland, New Zealand, built 1963-1972, generates 850 MW from 7 turbines. It {{is built}} 200 m underground, {{and has two}} 10 km {{tailrace}} tunnels. The <b>net</b> <b>head</b> is 170 m.

5000|$|Microhydro {{systems are}} {{typically}} {{set up in}} areas capable of producing up to 100 kilowatts of electricity. This can be enough to power a home or small business facility. This production range is calculated in terms of [...] "head" [...] and [...] "flow". The higher each of these are, the more power available. Hydraulic head is the pressure measurement of water falling in a pipe expressed {{as a function of}} the vertical distance the water falls. This change in elevation is usually measured in feet or meters. A drop of at least 2 feet is required or the system may not be feasible. When quantifying head, both gross and <b>net</b> <b>head</b> must be considered. Gross head approximates power accessibility through the vertical distance measurement alone whereas <b>net</b> <b>head</b> subtracts pressure lost due to friction in piping from the gross head. [...] "Flow" [...] is the actual quantity of water falling from a site and is usually measured in gallons per minute, cubic feet per second, or liters per second. Low flow/high head installations in steep terrain have significant pipe costs. A long penstock starts with low pressure pipe at the top and progressively higher pressure pipe closer to the turbine in order to reduce pipe costs.|$|E
50|$|The Upper Salmon Hydro Development {{utilizes}} {{a portion}} of the residual head between Meelpaeg Lake Reservoir and Round Pond within the watershed of the Bay d'Espoir Hydroelectric Development in Newfoundland and Labrador. The plant operates at a normal supply level of 241 m under a <b>net</b> <b>head</b> of 51 metres. The average rated flow of 189.5 m3/s is used to generate 84 megawatts (MW) of electrical power with an average annual production of 541 GWh.

50|$|Inga Falls is {{currently}} the site of two large hydro power plants and is being considered for a much larger hydro power generating station known as Grand Inga. The Grand Inga project, if completed, would be the largest hydro-electric power generating facility on Earth. The current project scope calls {{for the use of}} a flow rate ~26,400 cubic metres per second at a <b>net</b> <b>head</b> of ~150 metres; this is equivalent to a generating capacity of ~38.9 GW. This hydro-electric generator would be more than double the current world record holder, which is the Three Gorges facility on the Yangtze River in China.|$|E

At a {{distance}} of 4.5 km from the barrage on the canal, water reaches the 30 MW Kulhal Power Plant at [...] The power plant contains three 10 MW Kaplan turbine-generators and has a design hydraulic head of 18 m. Once discharged from the power station, the water is conducted by the canal 13 km to the 72 MW Khara Power Station at [...] in Uttar Pradesh. The Khara Power Station contains three 24 MW Francis turbine-generators and a has a <b>net</b> <b>head</b> of 43 m.|$|E
50|$|The surface {{power station}} {{at the end of}} {{pressure}} shafts has two units, each of 40 MW capacity (Francis turbines) operating under a gross head of 150 m and an average <b>net</b> <b>head</b> is 133.7 m. The annual energy generation is about 185 GWh. This also has beneficial impact on other cascade development projects in the basin as the energy generation gets enhanced by a 48% increase. The power station is run as a peaking station with two peaks, one in the morning and the other in the evening. With the completion of the Tsankov Kamak HPP, and the rehabilitation of the other HPPs, and all stations connected to a common grid, the efficiency of the whole cascade is improved and energy production rose by a further 16 GWh per annum for the cascade.|$|E

50|$|Robert-Bourassa {{generating}} station, Quebec, Canada is {{the largest}} underground power station in the world. It generates 5,616 MW from 16 turbines with a <b>net</b> rated <b>head</b> of 137.2 m.|$|R
5000|$|Inductive pumps {{use both}} sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that {{both sides of}} the pump piston are always {{experiencing}} the inlet pressure at a minimum until the pressure cycle that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the <b>net</b> <b>head</b> pressure in a close circuit, {{at the beginning of a}} stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any dynamic seals that could eventually leek to the outside of the system.|$|E
