5|$|Most of {{the care}} for a young bat comes from the mother. However, in monogamous species, the father plays a role. In addition, allo-suckling, where a female suckles young that is <b>not</b> <b>hers,</b> occurs in several species. This may serve to {{increase}} colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides {{with the development of}} an adult body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is likely due to the species' blood-based diet which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is <b>not</b> <b>hers.</b> Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

25|$|Intraspecific {{competition}} {{has been observed}} to occur between two queens in different nests. Sometimes, nest takeovers can even occur, in which one queen assumes the role of queen in a nest that is <b>not</b> <b>hers.</b> This may mean that kin recognition is not occurring in these circumstances. Though this is not common, it nevertheless may mean that workers do not always recognize the new queen as unrelated.|$|E

It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they would have to move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, <b>not</b> <b>hers,</b> if he wanted to talk to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone.

Her husband was {{deported}} to Ilag VII in Laufen in Bavaria in February 1943, where he remained {{for the rest of}} the war. He did not sign any document delegating his seigneurial authority, which meant that legality of ordinances issued by Hathaway during this period was, at best, questionable. She refused to sign orders issued by Germans, arguing that they were simply <b>not</b> <b>hers</b> to sign. She was insulted by an order that prohibited sexual relations between her tenants and German troops on the grounds of venereal disease outbreak, since the order implied that Sarkese women consorted with Germans.|$|E

500|$|As {{the exact}} nature of Poison's status as gender-variant has been left {{deliberately}} ambiguous by Capcom, the topic has remained a popular subject for debate among fans and gaming media alike. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Eric L. Patterson described her as being a significant character to the trans community, and a perfect example of how it is [...] "so awkward when it comes to knowing how to deal with characters who aren't white, male, and heterosexual" [...] in video games. Complex pointed her out as an example of stereotypical depiction of trans hookers, listing Poison among The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters in Video Games. GamesRadar commented [...] "Poison holds a distinction as one of gaming’s first trans characters, which began as a strange choice in localization but has {{become a part of the}} character that she wears with pride.

500|$|Changeling {{begins with}} an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to {{concentrate}} on {{a portrait of a}} woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled [...] "hysterical and unreliable" [...] if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was [...] "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than [...] "an expression of feminist awareness", David Denby argues, the film—like Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby—is [...] "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman's character in Gaslight(1944), who also wondered if she might be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is <b>not</b> <b>hers.</b> Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after women's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, [...] "The period could not accept [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Rajneesh [...] had coached Sheela {{in using}} media {{coverage}} to her advantage and during his period of public silence he privately stated that when Sheela spoke, {{she was speaking}} on his behalf. He had also supported her when disputes about her behaviour arose within the commune leadership, but in spring 1984, as tension amongst the inner circle peaked, a private meeting was convened with Sheela and his personal house staff. According to the testimony of Rajneesh's dentist, Swami Devageet (Charles Harvey Newman), she was admonished during a meeting, with Rajneesh declaring that his house, and <b>not</b> <b>hers,</b> was {{the centre of the}} commune.

2500|$|Roger Sterling (John Slattery); {{recurring}} Season 1, regular Seasons 2–7: One of the {{two senior}} partners of Sterling Cooper, and one-time mentor to Don Draper. His father founded the firm with Bertram Cooper, hence his name comes before Cooper's in the firm's title. A picture in Cooper's office shows Roger as a child alongside Cooper as a young adult. In Season 2, Bertram Cooper mentions that [...] "the late Mrs. Cooper" [...] introduced Sterling to his wife, Mona, whom Sterling {{is in the process}} of divorcing in favor of Don's former secretary, 20-year-old Jane. Sterling, a World War II Navy veteran, was a notorious womanizer (living like he was [...] "on shore leave") until two heart attacks changed his perspective, although they did not affect his drinking or smoking habits, which remained excessive. Prior to his marriage to Jane, Roger had a longstanding affair with Joan Holloway. In Season 4, he and Joan have a brief romantic encounter, and Joan becomes pregnant. It is revealed in Season 3 that sometime in the mid-1950s, when Don was a salesman at a furrier, and eager to break into advertising, Roger met him and through that connection Don was hired at Sterling Cooper. Season 4 has Roger less involved with the day-to-day activities at SCDP than he was at Sterling Cooper. His primary function is to manage the Lucky Strike account, which is responsible for over half of SCDP's billings. However, in the episode [...] "Chinese Wall", it's revealed that Lucky Strike is moving its account to a rival agency, forcing a dramatic downsizing of the firm. During Season 5, however, Roger is given new accounts to handle. [...] He refocuses his efforts and lands a big account with Chevrolet Motor Company. He offers to financially support his son, but Joan does not believe he is reliable. By the end of the sixth season, however, Joan agrees to let him into Kevin's life but <b>not</b> <b>hers.</b> At the close of the series, Roger indicates to Joan that half his estate will go to Kevin in his will. Roger eventually marries Megan Draper's mother, Marie, and their honeymoon in Paris is part of the final montage in the series.|$|E
