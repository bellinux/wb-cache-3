Due to quantum interferences inside the NC, the spin-torque presents clear qualitative differences {{with respect to the}} case of a multichannel disordered spin-valve. In particular, it can be modulated with the NC gate voltage. In principle, this modulation can be observed experimentally, assuming that the spin-torque affects a ferromagnetic nano-domain in direct contact with the NC...|$|E

We investigate the structure dependence of current flow in electrode-conductor-electrode systems and calculate the local occupation functions and time-dependent conductor current for various conductor lengths and electrode configurations. We also explore fundamental physical limits to the encoding of information in the nanoscale conductor by application of electrode bias in a model system.

30|$|Recently, {{molecular}} dynamic (MD) simulation seems {{a direct}} {{approach to the}} problem, but unfortunately it covered timescale, which does not exceed several microseconds. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop analytical methods for predicting the reliability of such devices over long time intervals of their operation, which {{are estimated to be}} the years. The research results [7] can be considered as one of the attempts aimed at the development of such methods. In this work, carbyne chain connecting two graphene sheets was considered as a model element of such nanodevice. To predict the lifetime of carbyne <b>nanoconductor,</b> energy approach was employed in this work. According to this approach, break of the atomic bond is associated with thermally activated overcoming of the barrier whose height equals the binding energy. It was shown that under certain conditions the proposed model produces the Arrhenius form of the transition theory [8, 9] and the Meyer–Neldel compensation rule [10, 11]. However, in general, the model gives more accurate results than the transition state theory.|$|E

40|$|Networks of {{nanoscale}} conductors such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metallic nanowires {{are promising}} candidates to replace metal oxides as transparent conductors. However, very few previous reports have described nanostructured thin films that reach the standards required by industry for high-performance transparent electrodes. In this review, we analyze the sheet resistance and transmittance data extracted from published literature for solution processed, nanostructured networks. In {{the majority of}} cases, as their thickness is reduced below a critical value, <b>nanoconductor</b> networks undergo a transition from bulk-like to percolative behavior. Such percolative behavior is characteristic of sparse networks with limited connectivity and few continuous conductive paths. This transition tends to occur for films with a transmittance between 50 % and 90 %, {{which means that the}} properties of highly transparent films are predominately limited by percolation. Consequently, to achieve low resistance coupled with high transparency, the networks must be much more conductive than would otherwise be the case. We show that highly conductive networks of metallic nanowires appear to be the most promising candidate to replace traditional transparent electrode materials from a technical standpoint. However, many other factors, including cost, manufacturability, and stability, will have to be addressed before commercialization of these materials...|$|E
40|$|Circuit QED {{techniques}} have been instrumental to manipulate and probe with exquisite sensitivity the quantum state of superconducting quantum bits coupled to microwave cavities. Recently, {{it has become}} possible to fabricate new devices where the superconducting quantum bits are replaced by hybrid mesoscopic circuits combining nanoconductors and metallic reservoirs. This mesoscopic QED provides a new experimental playground to study the light-matter interaction in electronic circuits. Here, we present the experimental {{state of the art}} of Mesoscopic QED and its theoretical description. A first class of experiments focuses on the artificial atom limit, where some quasiparticles are trapped in nanocircuit bound states. In this limit, the Circuit QED techniques can be used to manipulate and probe electronic degrees of freedom such as confined charges, spins, or Andreev pairs. A second class of experiments consists in using cavity photons to reveal the dynamics of electron tunneling between a <b>nanoconductor</b> and fermionic reservoirs. For instance, the Kondo effect, the charge relaxation caused by grounded metallic contacts, and the photo-emission caused by voltage-biased reservoirs have been studied. The tunnel coupling between nanoconductors and fermionic reservoirs also enable one to obtain split Cooper pairs, or Majorana bound states. Cavity photons represent a qualitatively new tool to study these exotic condensed matter states.

40|$|Inefficient {{screening}} of electric fields in <b>nanoconductors</b> makes electric manipulation of electronic transport in nanodevices possible. Accordingly, electrostatic (charge) gating is routinely used to affect {{and control the}} Coulomb electrostatics and quantum interference in modern nanodevices. Besides their charge, another (quantum mechanical) property of electrons - their spin - {{is at the heart}} of modern spintronics, a term implying that a number of magnetic and electrical properties of small systems are simultaneously harvested for device applications. In this review the possibility to achieve "spin gating" of mesoscopic devices, i. e. the possibility of an external spin control of the electronic properties of nanodevices is discussed. Rather than the Coulomb interaction, which is responsible for electric-charge gating, we consider two other mechanisms for spin gating. These are on the one hand the magnetic exchange interaction in magnetic devices and on the other hand the spin-orbit coupling ("Rashba effect"), which is prominent in low dimensional conductors. A number of different phenomena demonstrating the spin gating phenomenon will be discussed, including the spintro-mechanics of magnetic shuttling, Rashba spin splitting, and spin-gated weak superconductivity.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{adsorption}} of individual atoms on the semiconducting and metallic singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) {{have been investigated}} by using first-principles pseudopotential plane wave method within Density Functional Theory. The stable adsorption geometry and binding energy have been determined for {{a large number of}} foreign atoms ranging from alkali and simple metals to the transition metals and group IV elements. We have found that the character of the bonding and associated physical properties strongly depend on the type of adsorbed atoms, in particular on their valence electron structure. Our results indicate that the properties of SWNTs can be modified by the adsorbed foreign atoms. While the atoms of good conducting metals, such as Zn, Cu, Ag and Au, form very weak bonds, transition metal atoms, such as Ti, Sc, Nb and Ta, and group IV elements C and Si are adsorbed with relatively high binding energy. Owing to the curvature effect, these binding energies are larger than the binding energies of the same atoms on the graphite surface.

In {{the first part of}} this seminar, I will introduce a general theoretical framework to describe these experiments and predict new ones [4]. This task faces two challenges. First, one has to quantize the electromagnetic field properly by taking into account electromagnetic boundary conditions which are naturally omitted in atomic cavity QED, due to the smallness of an atom. Second, in the nanocircuits, one has to take into account collective plasmonic modes, as well as electronic quasiparticle states which are absent from circuit QED performed with superconducting quantum bits. I will discuss an effective model where these two types of modes are physically separated. This leads to a description which involves a linear coupling between tunneling electrons and a photonic pseudo-potential. In the second part of this seminar, I will discuss the application of the above approach to a superconducting nanostructure enclosing Majorana quasiparticles, directly coupled to a microwave cavity. I will show that the cavity provides a powerful means to test the properties of these exotic quasiparticles, and in particular their self-adjoint character [5]. [1] M. R. Delbecq et al, Phys. Rev.

Using a circuit design based on a nanoscale spin-valve [5], we coherently hybridize the individual spin and charge states of a double quantum dot while preserving spin coherence. This scheme allows us to increase by five orders of magnitude the natural (magnetic) spin-photon coupling, up to the MHz range at the single spin level. Our coupling strength yields a cooperativity which reaches 2. 3, with a spin coherence time of about 60 ns [6].
