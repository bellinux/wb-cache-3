40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is a {{major problem}} in most major cities around the world with few signs that this is diminishing, despite management efforts. In planning traffic management and control strategies at urban and inter urban level, understanding the factors involved in vehicular progression is vital. Most work to date has, however, been restricted to single vehicle-type traffic. Study of heterogeneous traffic movements for urban single and multi-lane roads has been limited, even for developed countries and motorised traffic mix, (with a broader spectrum of vehicle type applicable for cities in the developing world). The aim of the research, presented in this thesis, was thus to propose and develop a model for heterogeneous motorised traffic, applicable to situations, involving common urban and interurban road features in the western or developed world. A further aim of the work was to provide a basis for comparison with current models for homogeneous vehicle type. A two-component cellular automata (2 -CA) methodology is used to examine traffic patterns for single-lane, multi-lane controlled and uncontrolled intersections and roundabouts. In this heterogeneous model (binary mix), space mapping rules are used for each vehicle type, namely long (double-unit length) and short (single-unit length) vehicles. Vehicle type is randomly categorised as long (LV) or short (SV) with different fractions considered. Update rules are defined based on given and neighbouring cell states at each time step, on manoeuvre complexity and on acceptable space criteria for different vehicle types. Inclusion of heterogeneous traffic units increases the algorithm complexity as different criteria apply to different cellular elements, but mixed traffic is clearly more reflective of the real-world situation. The impact of vehicle mix on the overall performance of an intersection and roundabout (one-lane one-way, one-lane two-way and two-lane two-way) has been examined. The model for mixed traffic was also compared to similar models for homogeneous vehicle type, with throughput, queue length and other metrics explored. The relationship between arrival rates on the entrance roads and throughput for mixed traffic was studied and it was found that, as for the homogeneous case, critical arrival rates can be identified for various traffic conditions. Investigation of performance metrics for heterogeneous traffic (short and long vehicles), can be shown to reproduce main aspects of real-world configuration performance. This has been validated, using local Dublin traffic data. The 2 -CA model can be shown to simulate successfully both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic over a range of parameter values for arrival, turning rates, different urban configurations and a distribution of vehicle types. The developed model has potential to extend its use to linked transport network elements and can also incorporate further motorised and <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicle</b> diversity for various road configurations. It is anticipated that detailed studies, such as those presented here, can support efforts on traffic management and aid in the design of optimisation strategies for traffic flow...|$|E
40|$|In {{many cities}} in {{developing}} countries, both motorised and <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{share the same}} carriageway. Drivers of motorised vehicles can experience high levels of conflict with <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{because of the lack}} of lane discipline in such mixed traffic situations. As a result, the motorised vehicles have low operating speeds, particularly adjacent to intersections. This paper assesses the potential impact of reducing the proportion of <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> and of banning them. Available traffic models and empirical relationships were not found to be suitable for studying the mixed traffic operation and were mostly based on lane-based motorised traffic. Therefore, a micro-simulation model was developed for this study. The model was calibrated and validated using extensive traffic data from Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was applied to see the effect of varying the proportion of <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the performance of a corridor of Dhaka city. The study revealed that even a low proportion of <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> (i. e. 10 % of the traffic mix) reduces the operating speed of motorised vehicles significantly. Any increase in the proportion of <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> beyond 30 % has little effect on the mixed traffic performance. However, the banning of <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> resulted in a 30 % reduction in corridor travel time for motorised vehicles. Banning could also result in an increase in corridor passenger movement capacity of more than 300 % without increase in journey time. ...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{characteristics}} and {{operations at the}} signalised intersections of developing cities are significantly different from those at the similar intersections of cities in developed countries. Considering this, a new microscopic simulation technique, where a co-ordinate approach to modelling vehicle location is adopted, {{has been used for}} modelling the traffic operations at signalised intersections of developing cities. The model has been calibrated and validated on the basis of data collected from Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. It has been found that the concept of passenger car unit (PCU), which is widely used as a signal design parameter, is not applicable in case of mixed traffic comprising of both motorised and <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Therefore, using the developed simulation model the saturation flows at signalised intersections are investigated in an aggregate form of vehicles per hour. It has also been found that saturation flows in terms of aggregate vehicles are very much dependent on the approach width, turning proportion and composition of the traffic mix. Using the simulation results, an equation has also been regressed {{in order to be able}} to estimate the saturation flow from the influencing variables like road width, turning proportion, percentage of heavy and <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles.</b> ...|$|R

To allow for future road development the minimum carriageway width over structure shall be 7. 3 m except where the Chief Engineer agrees an exception. The Standards are mandatory for the Bridge and Culvert designs carried out by or on behalf of Roads and Highways Department. Reconstruction of bridges is also to be undertaken in accordance with these standards. These Standards cover the large majority of situations which will be encountered in the design of RHD Bridges. However if conditions which are not covered by the Standards are encountered, the advice of the Bridge Design Circle must be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{accessibility}} {{planning in}} developing countries {{over the last few}} decades has primarily focused on increasing rural communities access to rural roads. It has been considered that road building improves access to health, education, markets and employment opportunities, and hence promotes economic development. It is argued in this thesis that accessibility, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, has not improved to the desired extent because the problem of mobility, in terms of access to vehicle services, has not been addressed. The provision of rural roads and transport services have been taken as synonymous with each other, but in reality this has not proved to be the case. This thesis attempts to redress that balance by seeking to change the mindset of policy makers to think about mobility and increase the emphasis placed on the promotion of transport services, both motorised and non-motorised. The findings relate to surveys undertaken in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Pakistan where data were collected on vehicle operating costs (VOC's) and performance {{for a wide range of}} commonly used rural vehicles. These included human porterage and <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as bicycles and animal transport, as well as motorised vehicles such as conventional trucks and pickups, agricultural tractors and simple engine-powered vehicles. Analysis of the data demonstrated large differences in the VOC's and transport charges for rural transport services between the generally efficient systems in the Asian countries and the inefficient ones in the African countries studied. These findings form the foundation for the development of the Rural Transport Planner (RTP) and the framework which identifies the relationships between transport charges, VOC's, and factors relating to the vehicles operating environment. The RTP provides the first known attempt at producing a model for rural vehicle selection and for recommending interventions to improve the operating environment for rural transport services...|$|R
40|$|Side {{friction}} {{factors are}} defined as all those actions related to the activities taking place by {{the sides of the}} road and sometimes within the road, which interfere with the traffic flow on the travelled way. They include but not limited to pedestrians, bicycles, <b>non-motorised</b> <b>vehicles,</b> parked and stopping vehicles. These factors are normally very frequent in densely populated areas in developing countries, while they are random and sparse in developed countries making it of less interest for research and consequently there is comparatively little literature about them. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the effect of these factors on traffic performance measures on urban roads. To carry out this work, a research design was formulated including specific methods and prescribed limitations. An empirical case study methodology was adopted where Dar-es-salaam city in Tanzania was chosen as a representative case. The scope was limited to include only road-link facilities. A sample of these facilities including two-lane two-way and four-lane two-way roads were selected and studied. The study was conducted in two parts, of which each involved a distinctive approach. Part one involved a macroscopic approach where traffic and friction data were collected and analyzed at an aggregated level, whereas part two involved a microscopic approach where data of individual frictional elements were collected and analysed individually. Data collection was mainly performed by application of video method, which proved to be effective for simultaneous collection of traffic and side friction data. Data reduction was conducted chiefly by computer, using standard spreadsheet and statistical software packages, mainly SPSS and some computer macros. The analysis part was based on statistical methods, chiefly regression analysis. In the macroscopic approach, traffic and friction data from all sites were adjusted through a process called ‘normalization’, which enabled the data from the different sites to be merged, and consequently to obtain speed-flow curves for each road type. The individual friction factors through regression analysis were weighted and combined into one unit of measure of friction called "FRIC". The effect of "FRIC" on speed-flow curves was analyzed. The results showed significant impact on speed for both road types. Impact on capacity was identified on two-lane two-way roads while field data on four-lane two-way roads did not allow this. In the microanalysis approach, effect of individual side friction factors on speed was analyzed. The results showed that on two-lane two-way roads, all studied factors exhibited statistically significant impact on speed, while on four-lane two-way roads, only one factor showed the same. The results also identified impact values characteristic to the individual friction factors on some roads. Recommendations were made based on these results that highway capacity studies particularly in developing countries, should include the friction variable, though in the form suitable to their own particular circumstances. Further recommendations were made that these results should be applied to formulate management programs seeking to limit levels of side friction on high mobility urban arterial streets in order to improve traffic safety and operation efficiency.
