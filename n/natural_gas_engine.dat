40|$|Problem statement: The Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is a gaseous form of <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> it {{have been}} {{recognized}} as one of the promising alternative fuel due to its substantial benefits compared to gasoline and diesel. <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> is produced from gas wells or tied in with crude oil production. Approach: <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> is promising alternative fuel to meet strict engine emission regulations in many countries. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has long been used in stationary engines, but the application of CNG as a transport engines fuel has been considerably advanced over the last decade by the development of lightweight high-pressure storage cylinders. Results: The technology of engine conversion was well established and suitable conversion equipment is readily available. For petrol engines or spark ignition engines there are two options, a bi-fuel conversion and use a dedicated to CNG engine. The diesel engines converted or designed to run on <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> there were two main options discussed. There are dual-fuel engines and normal ignition can be initiated. <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> can be operated at lean burn and stoichiometric conditions with different combustion and emission characteristics. Conclusions: In this study, the low exhaust gas emissions of CNG engines research and development were highlighted. Stoichiometric <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> were briefly reviewed.
