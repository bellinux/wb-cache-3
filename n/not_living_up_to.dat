5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool {{to create a sense of}} hope for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his potential.|$|E

Drawing {{on the work of}} Norbert Elias and prominent figurational sociologists, it discusses the changes taking place within and through the many partnerships set up by New Labour around the notion of ‘community safety’. Although recognizing the important insights provided by accounts of urban regeneration emerging through studies of governmentality, the article argues that such accounts fail to adequately consider the impact of partnership working on the individuals, communities and organizations involved. While urban regeneration partnerships have the potential to be the motor of the civilizing process in the manner identified by figurational sociologists, the article concludes that they are <b>not</b> currently <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this civilizing potential...|$|R

But her loyalty to the man who had put her into possession of that money was superior to her feelings of prudence and thrift.

40|$|Simulation is {{a crucial}} part of today’s {{research}} and development due to its high efficiency. It is mostly effiective in environments where otherwise high costs or even lives were to be put on stake for testing new approaches. This is both the matter of fact when facing the domain of traffic control. If a traffic light system is malfunctioning the result can vary from a traffic jam, which would create an economic loss on a regional level. This might increase over time if this malfunction is persistent and even lead to accidents that cost lives. For example when all lights at an intersection show green the same time. To avoid all that {{it is very important to}} test everything that goes live on real hardware beforehand and ensure its reliability and fail-safety. Furthermore, the more complex the mechanics to control traffic lights and thus traffic flow in general become too. The existing hardware, especially the controllers, should be integrated into this testing pipeline to estimate the effects of hardware lifespan on the deployed algorithms and to proof that it can actually run the algorithms. This thesis provides a prototype and a design for implementing a scalable and flexible architecture for traffic light signal systems in the DLR’s simulation framework DOS, a possibility to import traffic light programs created with the simulation framework SUMO and examining how hardware testing could be a future feature of DLR’s test environment. Furthermore it’s discussing how the presented architecture is <b>not</b> only <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the promise of scalability and flexibility, but also how control schemes with public transportation consideration can be straight forward deployed on it. Lastly, it presents a preparation for a future feature of the simulation environment, the live-stream of traffc light data from the city of Braunschweig to its virtual counterpart...|$|R
40|$|During waning {{hours of}} its lame duck session, the 109 th Congress passed {{the first major}} {{overhaul}} of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (“MSA”) since the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act (“SFA”). President Bush signed the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization of 2006 (“Reauthorization Act”) on January 12, 2007, ushering a new and challenging era in fisheries management. These amendments effected deep changes to the nation’s fishery management laws by, among many other things, strengthening the MSA’s conservation objectives and fostering increased use of controversial, market-based fisheries management systems. The regulated fishing community, non- governmental organizations, and the government itself are still adjusting to the new regime. As is typical following major changes in law, the Reauthorization Act has spurred {{a great deal of}} litigation. The reason is simple; the legislative process is one of compromise and negotiation, often fostering vague statutory language and contradictory mandates. Congressional give-and-take that ensures clarity is a rare commodity in Washington. Resulting ambiguity leaves room for interpretation, initially by the administering agency—in this case, the National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) —and subsequently by litigants offering competing interpretations of the new law’s (and its implementing regulations’) meaning and reach. This cycle followed {{in the wake of the}} SFA. Major litigation tested the meaning and limits of the SFA’s new requirement to minimize bycatch and create a “standardized bycatch reporting methodology,” its essential fish habitat provision, and the deadlines the law created for ending overfishing and rebuilding stocks. As explained below, a very similar process is now underway, with many early cases beginning to define the meaning and scope of new provisions of the Reauthorization Act. Few would argue that the Reauthorization Act changes are insignificant. Samuel Rauch, acting head of NMFS, stated: “With [Reauthorization Act mandated] annual catch limits in place this year for all domestic fish populations and the continued commitment of fishermen to rebuild the stocks they rely on, we’re making even greater progress in ending overfishing and rebuilding stocks around the nation. ” While many in the fishing industry are heartened by this progress, the cost has been high and there is a feeling that the law’s flexibility is too rarely employed. Conversely, environmental groups frequently challenge the agency for <b>not</b> fully <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Act’s requirements. The stakes in legal battles over Reauthorization Act changes are high. Some of the most important of these are discussed below...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A mission {{statement}} (MS) sets out the long-term goals {{of an institution}} and {{is supposed to be}} suited for studying learning environments. Yet, hardly any study has tested this issue so far. The aim {{of the present study was}} the development and psychometric evaluation of an MS-Questionnaire (MSQ) focusing on explicit competencies. We investigated to what extent the MSQ captures the construct of learning environment and how well a faculty is following - in its perception - a competency orientation in a competency-based curriculum. Methods A questionnaire was derived from the MS “teaching” (Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf) which was based on (inter-) nationally accepted goals and recommendations for a competency based medical education. The MSQ was administered together with the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) to 1119 students and 258 teachers. Cronbach’s alpha was used to analyze the internal consistency of the items. Explorative factor analyses were performed to analyze homogeneity of the items within subscales and factorial validity of the MSQ. Item discrimination was assessed by means of part-whole corrected discrimination indices, and convergent validity was analyzed with respect to DREEM. Demographic variations of the respondents were used to analyze the inter-group variations in their responses. Results Students and teachers perceived the MS implementation as “moderate” and on average, students differed significantly in their perception of the MS. They thought implementation of the MS was less successful than faculty did. Women had a more positive perception of educational climate than their male colleagues and clinical students perceived the implementation of the MS on all dimensions significantly worse than preclinical students. The psychometric properties of the MSQ were very satisfactory: Item discrimination was high. Similarly to DREEM, the MSQ was highly reliable among students (α = 0. 92) and teachers (α = 0. 93). In both groups, the MSQ correlated highly positively with DREEM (r = 0. 79 and 0. 80, p Conclusions The perceived implementation of faculty-specific goals can be measured in an institution to some considerable extent by means of a questionnaire developed on the basis of the institution’s MS. Our MSQ provides a reliable instrument to measure the learning climate with a strong focus on competencies which are increasingly considered crucial in medical education. The questionnaire thus offers additional information beyond the DREEM. Our site-specific results imply that our own faculty is <b>not</b> yet fully <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its competency-based MS. In general, the MSQ might prove useful for faculty development to the increasing number of faculties seeking to measure their perceived competency orientation in a competency-based curriculum. </p...|$|R
500|$|With {{much of the}} {{criticism}} placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts {{during the next few}} seasons as it was deemed that he was <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and was a reason for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a bad match, which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a fixation with Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the [...] "great white hope" [...] {{as soon as he was}} drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of the ladder from 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a poster boy for Melbourne's failures during this period.|$|E

With the arrival of Zidane in the advanced midfield playmaking role, Juventus's formation changed, and Del Piero partnered alongside a more offensive striker up front, such as Christian Vieri and subsequently Inzaghi, as either a supporting forward or as an out-and-out striker. After losing some pace and agility following his injury in 1998, Del Piero performed a muscle strengthening regime, and he took on a more creative role in a combination with Zidane behind the main striker Inzaghi under Ancelotti; although he was accused by some in the media of <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his potential following his injury, due to his decrease in goalscoring, he successfully adapted to his new creative attacking role as an assist provider. As Juventus's playing style continued to change during Lippi's second stint with Juventus starting in 2001, Del Piero partnered with Zidane's replacement, Nedvěd, in a free creative role {{in front of the}} midfield, or occasionally on the left flank, as a supporting striker, with Trezeguet upfront; he subsequently continued to play a similar role under Capello and later managers, and was even occasionally used in a more offensive role as a main striker, although he became increasingly deployed as a substitute due to his advancing age.|$|E
