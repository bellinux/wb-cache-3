40|$|Abstract. While nickel ohmic {{contacts}} to n-type {{silicon carbide}} have good electrical properties, the physical contact, {{and therefore the}} reliability, can be poor.

In the present work, once the Ni contacts have been annealed forming <b>nickel</b> <b>silicides</b> and achieving low contact resistance, they are etched off.

The Ni contacts are then replaced by a second contact metal. This second metal displays low contact resistance as-deposited, indicating that the critical feature responsible for the ohmic contact has not been removed by the primary contact etch.

The morphology of Ni (50 nm) contacts was free of defects at all annealing temperatures, but the reaction during annealing consumed approximately 60 nm of SiC.

NiSi contacts had unsatisfactory droplet-like morphology after annealing at 960 and 1065 °C.

The PL intensity enhancement factor is equal to 5. 77 for normally deposited samples and 18 for obliquely deposited samples. The unchanged spectral shape of PL bands and similar position of PL maximum in samples with and without <b>nickel</b> <b>silicide</b> interlayer indicates that in the SiOx/Ni/Si structures after annealing no additional emitting centers are introduced to compare with reference one.

40|$|As {{continued}} MOSFETs scaling {{becomes increasingly}} challenging, solutions are urgently {{needed to meet}} the requirements of the ITRS roadmap. Schottky barrier-MOSFETs are promising alternative devices to current conventional MOSFET because the metallic source/drain contacts has many inherent advantages. However, generally Schottky barrier-MOSFET devices exhibit an inferior performance due to the high Schottky barrier at the source/drain contacts. In order to overcome this problem, lowering of the effective Schottky barrier of <b>nickel</b> <b>silicide</b> was investigated by dopant segregation at the silicide/Si interface, by the use of ultra-thin gate oxide and ultra-thin body SOI. Modelling of single-gated, fully depleted ballistic SOI Schottky barrier-MOSFET were performed with a self-consistent solution of the one-dimensional modified Poisson and Schroedinger equations. An essential difference be tween Schottky barrier and conventional MOSFET is that tunneling currents through the Schottky barriers play a crucial role. The simulation results show that the Schottky barrier width is strongly influenced by geometrical parameters, i. e., the thinner the gate oxide and the Si channel, the lower the effective Schottky barrier height. Devices with a few nanometers spatially extended highly doped layer directly at the simulated silicide/Si channel interface has a further improved inverse subthreshold slope close to the thermal limit 60 mV/dec. In addition, the on-currents were significantly increased. The reason for the dramatic improvement is that the conduction/valence bands are strongly bent due to the highly doped layer and hence the Schottky barriers for electrons becomes highly transparent resulting in an improved on-as well as off-currents. Before transforming this concept on the device, we investigated the fabrication of <b>nickel</b> <b>silicide</b> on ultra-thin SOI (10 nm) and the effect of silicidation induced dopant segregation on diode characteristics.
