In <b>networked</b> <b>organizations</b> with geographically distributed work force and processes, like logistics networks or SME-clusters, quickly finding the right information for a given purpose often is a challenge. An improved information supply would contribute significantly to saving time and most likely to improving productivity. The paper aims at contributing to improved information logistics by bringing together experiences from knowledge modeling and pattern-based reuse in information system development. We propose a pattern-based knowledge architecture with several inter-working layers of services for implementing information logistics in <b>networked</b> <b>organizations.</b> The knowledge architecture forms a framework for selecting and configuring suitable resources for a given problem situation. The knowledge architecture principle and three types of knowledge patterns within the architecture framework are discussed: task patterns for representing enterprise knowledge of member <b>organizations</b> in a <b>networked</b> <b>organization,</b> information demand patterns addressing the information demand of typical roles in a <b>networked</b> <b>organization,</b> and ontology design patterns for capturing context information for decision support...|$|R

We examine how employees at a high-tech company, referred to as KME, communicate with members of the work group, other colleagues in the organization, and colleagues outside the organization to better understand their boundary-spanning communications. In addition, at each communication distance we examine the use of di#erent media for communication to determine the role of computer-mediated communication (email and instant messaging) versus traditional means of communication (face-to-face and the telephone) in the <b>networked</b> <b>organization.</b> Do employees have the trust to communicate over boundaries using ICTs? We find that boundary-spanning communication has not replaced communication with members of the work group at KME. By contrast, a large proportion of communication continues to occur within the boundary of the work group and organization. Surprisingly, these communications within the boundary of the work group and organization take place via computer-mediated means and not via traditional face-to-face and telephone interactions.
