25|$|Wagner {{wrote of}} his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan {{in a letter}} to Franz Liszt (December 16, 1854): <b>Never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> having enjoyed the true {{happiness}} of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the ‘black flag’ that waves at the end I shall cover myself over – to die.|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{initially}} {{viewed the}} Bolshevik revolution {{in a positive}} light. She wrote in Mother Earth that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented [...] "the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being". By the time she neared Europe, however, she expressed fears about what was to come. She {{was worried about the}} ongoing Russian Civil War and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. [...] "I could <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> work {{within the confines of the}} State," [...] she wrote to her niece, [...] "Bolshevist or otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Though tiki bars {{in general}} {{declined}} in {{popularity in the}} late 1970s and 1980s until {{the revival of the}} style in the 1990s, the Sip 'n Dip survived with few changes. [...] During the 1990s, the idea of having mermaids swim in the pool during evening bar hours was the brainchild of the bar's general manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother, who wanted to add a [...] "fun factor." [...] It began with a single [...] "mermaid" [...] in the pool on New Year's Eve in 1995. [...] Today, [...] Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes herself and said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> believed the mermaid attraction would be such a big hit. People are fascinated with them, and it's not something you'd expect to see in Montana." ...|$|E

500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I <b>never,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1937, Marie fell ill. Her {{personal}} physician, Dr. Castellani, determined she had pancreatic cancer, although her official diagnosis was cirrhosis of the liver. Marie {{had not been a}} drinker and, upon hearing the news, she reportedly said: [...] "then there must be a non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, because I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> tasted alcohol." [...] She was prescribed a diet of cold foods, injections and bed rest. Marie was so weak at times that she could not even pick up a pen. In February 1938, she was sent to a sanatorium in Italy, in hopes that she might recover. There, she was visited by Nicholas and his wife, whom Marie eventually forgave for her transgressions. She was also visited by Princess Helen, whom she had not seen in nearly seven years, and Waldorf Astor. Marie was eventually transferred to a sanatorium in Dresden. Growing weaker and weaker, she requested that she be taken back to Romania, in order to die there. Carol denied her a journey by aeroplane, and she declined a medical flight offered by Hitler, instead choosing to return to Romania by train. She was brought to Pelișor Castle.|$|E

2500|$|Former Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari accused Čech, Michael Ballack and Drogba {{of causing}} his sacking, {{saying that they}} [...] "did not accept my {{training}} methods or my demands".

Čech denied the claims saying that he was [...] "disappointed with [...] because <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> have I had a personal goalkeeping coach".|$|E

2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> played a game of cards. I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish.

2500|$|The Jay Pritzker Pavilion {{received}} the first permanent outdoor LARES {{system in the}} US in 2004. The very visible system is held above the audience of 11,000 on a slender network of curved steel tubes called a [...] "trellis" [...] by architect Frank Gehry. LARES loudspeakers are positioned adjacent to the normal distributed sound system loudspeakers, to bring appropriately delayed reinforcement sound as well as synthesized ambience to each listener. Steve Robinson of classical radio station WFMT said [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> heard sound projected so faithfully and beautifully over such a great distance...

[...] The hat-trick made him the oldest player in NHL history to record his first hat-trick (previously held by Scott Mellanby at 36 years of age), and the oldest defenceman in NHL history to record a hat-trick (previously held by Mathieu Schneider at 37 years of age).|$|E

The sentence Berlet mangles is not a historical statement about slavery but a polemical response to the proponents of reparations who are demanding that only whites pay blacks for an institution—slavery—that has been eradicated {{in the western world}} (but not Arab and black Africa) for more than 100 years. It is intended to remind people that the slaves transported to America were bought from African and Arab slavers—not to blame Africans and Arabs for sole responsibility for slavery.” ...|$|E
