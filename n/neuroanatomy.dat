5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of the brain is <b>neuroanatomy,</b> while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of {{each part of the}} brain.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the brain is}} anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional <b>neuroanatomy</b> uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E
5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and <b>neuroanatomy</b> briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} various {{scientific}} research in evolutionary biology, comparative <b>neuroanatomy</b> and neurophysiology, have explained the phylogeny of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. From {{the point of}} view of biological evolution, the pineal gland represents a kind of atrophied photoreceptor. In the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles, it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also called the pineal eye or third eye.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{neuroscience}} is {{a branch}} of neuroscience that observes concepts in molecular biology applied to the nervous systems of animals. The scope of this subject covers topics such as molecular <b>neuroanatomy,</b> mechanisms of molecular signaling in the nervous system, the effects of genetics and epigenetics on neuronal development, and the molecular basis for neuroplasticity and neurodegenerative diseases. As with molecular biology, molecular neuroscience {{is a relatively new}} field that is considerably dynamic.|$|E
25|$|The Chronobiology Laboratory {{studies the}} {{biological}} rhythms of insects. It {{was established in}} 1987, when researcher-in-charge Mirian David Marques finished her internship in chronobiology at the University of Minnesota. Research methods used in the laboratory include automated (or visual) records of insect behavior. When rhythms are detected the <b>neuroanatomy</b> and neurophysiology of specimens are studied, searching for rhythm-generating centers using histology, histochemistry and molecular biology. Groups studied include springtails (Isotomidae), mosquitoes (Culicidae), crickets (Phalangopsinae), ants (Formicidae) and bees (Apidae).|$|E
25|$|In August 1882 Burckhardt was {{appointed}} as the Medical Director of the Préfargier, {{a small but}} modern psychiatric clinic in Marin in the Swiss Canton of Neuchâtel. Prior to his arrival a laboratory was constructed at the clinic so that Burckhardt could continue his research into <b>neuroanatomy</b> and psychophysiology. In February 1884 he presented at the Préfargier asylum his findings on the heredity and the surface configuration of the brain. He continued to publish on psychiatric and neurological topics such as cerebral vascular movements, brain tumours and optic chiasm, traumatic hysteria, and writing disorders.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of research concerns brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music perception and performance. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, <b>neuroanatomy,</b> psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Vogt-Mugnier rediscovered the {{so-called}} ‘status marmoratus’ of the corpus striatum, characterized by slow, writhing, purposeless movements mainly affecting {{the hands and}} face. This syndrome had already been described by Gabriel Anton in 1896, however his paper attracted little attention whereas Vogt-Mugnier's report {{brought it to the}} forefront of research in basal ganglia pathology. Vogt-Mugnier continued to lead the pioneering work on the <b>neuroanatomy</b> of the thalamus and together with Hermann Oppenheim published their findings on hereditary palsy and double athetosis, in which she noted the mottled appearance of the striatum.|$|E
25|$|Experimental neuropsychology is an {{approach}} that uses methods from experimental psychology to uncover {{the relationship between the}} nervous system and cognitive function. The majority of work involves studying healthy humans in a laboratory setting, although a minority of researchers may conduct animal experiments. Human work in this area often takes advantage of specific features of our nervous system (for example that visual information presented to a specific visual field is preferentially processed by the cortical hemisphere on the opposite side) to make links between <b>neuroanatomy</b> and psychological function.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{testing has}} ancient origins, such as {{examinations}} for the Chinese civil service {{dating back to}} 2200 BC. Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC.–AD. 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906. In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of physiognomy—judgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of <b>neuroanatomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} ethanol to impair both spatial {{long-term}} memory and spatial working memory in various tasks. Chronic ethanol exposure causes deficits in spatial learning and memory tasks. These deficits persist even {{when exposed to}} long periods of ethanol-free time after ethanol exposure, suggesting a long-lasting change in structure and function of the hippocampus, a change in its functional connectome. Whether these changes are due {{to a change in}} place cells or a change in neurotransmission, <b>neuroanatomy,</b> or protein expression in the hippocampus is unknown. However, impairments in using non-spatial components such as cues are not evident in various tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task.|$|E
25|$|Science-fiction author Orson Scott Card {{was hired}} to write a novelization of the film based on the {{screenplay}} and discussions with Cameron. He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit {{on the far side}} of the moon). The NTIs' knowledge of <b>neuroanatomy</b> and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many of the deus ex machina aspects of the film.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some overlap between {{biological}} psychiatry and neurology, the latter generally focuses on disorders where gross or visible pathology {{of the nervous system}} is apparent, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, encephalitis, neuritis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. There is some overlap with neuropsychiatry, which typically deals with behavioral disturbances in the context of apparent brain disorder. In contrast biological psychiatry describes the basic principles and then delves deeper into various disorders. It is structured to follow the organisation of the DSM-IV, psychiatry's primary diagnostic and classification guide. The contributions of this field explore functional <b>neuroanatomy,</b> imaging and neuropsychology and pharmacotherapeutic possibilities for depression, anxiety and mood disorders, substance abuse and eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, and cognitive and personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary school {{curricula}} are not standardized, with programs lasting {{from three to}} six years. In the United States and Canada the program is generally four years long, usually after a four-year pre-vet undergraduate degree). For the first three years, students learn anatomy, physiology, histology, <b>neuroanatomy,</b> pharmacology, immunology, bacteriology, virology, pathology, parasitology, toxicology, herd health (also called population health), nutrition, radiography, and epidemiology. During the third year, students learn anesthesiology, diagnostics, surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and dentistry. For the fourth year, often 12 months long instead of nine, students care {{for a wide range}} of animals. Clinical education is a focus of most veterinary {{school curricula}} worldwide. In 2005, for the first time in its 104-year-history, the Veterinary Medicine Programme at University College Dublin instituted a lecture-free final year focusing on clinical training. The Institute of Veterinary Pathology at the University of Zurich has implemented a curriculum for teaching pathology with an extensive clinical component. Veterinary schools in Israel, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia also emphasize clinical training.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{view was}} that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the tritocerebrum), a view based partly {{on the fact that}} the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the labrum, which is the tritocerebrum in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in mites and spiders, and <b>neuroanatomy</b> in Limulus. If this is the case, then chelicerates simply have no tritocerebrum, i.e. there is no third supraoesophageal ganglion of the brain; the segment corresponding to it would be the suboesophageal pedipalp one. Such a theory does not, however, immediately account for the same ganglionic innervation of the chelicerae and labrum, although one solution is simply to claim that the labrum itself is not homologous between mandibulates and chelicerates (the view, for example, of Dieter Waloszek and colleagues).|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies. A behavioral failure on {{this test is}} diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions of the scores of amusics and controls. Such scores are generally obtained through the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), which involves {{a series of tests}} that evaluate the use of musical characteristics known to contribute to the memory and perception of conventional music. The battery comprises six subtests which assess the ability to discriminate pitch contour, musical scales, pitch intervals, rhythm, meter, and memory. An individual is considered amusic if he/she performs two standard deviations below the mean obtained by musically-competent controls. This musical pitch disorder represents a phenotype that serves to identify the associated neuro-genetic factors. Both MRI-based brain structural analyses and electroencephalography (EEG) are common methods employed to uncover brain anomalies associated with amusia (See <b>Neuroanatomy).</b> Additionally, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is used to detect anatomical differences between the MRIs of amusic brains and musically intact brains, specifically with respect increased and/or decreased amounts of white and grey matter.|$|E

25|$|Ethology is the {{scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually {{with a focus on}} behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait. Behaviourism is a term that also describes {{the scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity. Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint awardees of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as <b>neuroanatomy,</b> ecology, and evolutionary biology. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as aggression, in a number of unrelated animals.|$|E
500|$|The book {{provided}} a tutorial on genetics {{to make the}} material self-contained. Family, adoption and twin studies were investigated to determine [...] the ways vulnerability to the disorder changed with genetic similarity to the patient. Together they supported {{the presence of a}} genetic contribution to the cause and the progress of schizophrenia. Contextual elements such as birth problems and stressful incidents were also analyzed to help the authors build a combined model to explain the disorder. The researchers analyzed populations to determine the role of genes using simplified mathematical models of the influence of genes and the environment on each other, and with no biochemical signal of the disorder to guide them. Rue L. Cromwell, writing in PsycCRITIQUES, wrote that this approach lacked rigor. The role of genes was less emphasized in the results, with a heritability of 70%, than in earlier studies by Kallman. The researchers investigated <b>neuroanatomy,</b> and specifically the neurotransmitter dopamine, as a possible route by which genes influence the functioning of the brain to produce the symptoms of the disorder.|$|E
500|$|Nansen did not resume formal {{studies at}} the university. Instead, on Collett's recommendation, he {{accepted}} a post as curator in the zoological department of the Bergen Museum. He was {{to spend the next}} six years of his life there—apart from a six-month sabbatical tour of Europe—working and studying with leading figures such as Gerhard Armauer Hansen, the discoverer of the leprosy bacillus, and Daniel Cornelius Danielssen, the museum's director who had turned it from a backwater collection into a centre of scientific research and education. Nansen's chosen area of study was the then relatively unexplored field of <b>neuroanatomy,</b> specifically the central nervous system of lower marine creatures. [...] Before leaving for his sabbatical in February 1886 he published a paper summarising his research to date, in which he stated that [...] "anastomoses or unions between the different ganglion cells" [...] could not be demonstrated with certainty. This unorthodox view was confirmed by the simultaneous researches of the embryologist Wilhelm His and the psychiatrist August Forel. Nansen is considered the first Norwegian defender of the neuron theory, originally proposed by Santiago Ramon y Cajal. His subsequent paper, The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System, published in 1887, became his doctoral thesis.|$|E
