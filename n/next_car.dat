25|$|Like the R110As, the R142s feature wider doors than past A-Division equipment, with 54-inch side doors (about 9 inches {{narrower}} {{than the}} R110As' 63-inch doors, but 4 inches {{wider than the}} R62/As' 50-inch doors). All car ends have windows, allowing passengers to see through to the <b>next</b> <b>car,</b> except cab ends, where the cab walls prevent such visibility. The R142 car bodies are constructed from stainless steel.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{driving a}} Talbot Sunbeam, McRae entered the Scottish Rally Championship and soon {{made a name}} for himself with his speed and {{exciting}} style of driving. His driving style drew many comparisons to Finnish ex-World Rally Champion Ari Vatanen, whom McRae had always idolised. In 1988 he performed a giant-killing act when he took the Scottish Rally Championship series crown in a humble Vauxhall Nova. Craving more power, his <b>next</b> <b>car</b> was a Ford Sierra XR 4x4.|$|E

25|$|The Brabham BT55 was a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray and David North for the Brabham team owned by Bernie Ecclestone. It used a BMW four-cylinder turbocharged engine tilted over {{on its side}} to allow a clear supply of air to the rear wing. The car competed during the 1986 Formula One season. It was not successful and its introduction coincided {{with the end of}} Brabham's time as a competitive team. Murray's <b>next</b> <b>car</b> (which he helped Steve Nichols design), McLaren's MP4/4, is usually claimed {{to be based on the}} same principles and won 15 of 16 races in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Marco Andretti was {{the first}} driver to make a {{significant}} improvement on his starting position, putting himself tentatively on the pole. The <b>next</b> <b>car</b> out, Ed Carpenter, raised eyebrows with a first lap of 229.347 mph, and a four-lap average of 228.762 mph. Carpenter bumped Andretti off the top spot, but still had four drivers waiting to make attempts. Rookie Carlos Muñoz squeezed himself on to the front row, landing in second starting position. The final driver with a shot for the pole was Will Power, who was fastest in segment 1. Power's first lap was in the 229 mph range, but his third and fourth laps dropped off significantly. Power ended up 6th, and Ed Carpenter secured his first Indy 500 pole position. It {{was the first}} pole for an American-born driver since Sam Hornish, Jr. in 2006, and the first by an owner/driver since A. J. Foyt in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The A410 {{made its}} debut in the 500 km of Silverstone in 2000, but gearbox {{problems}} prevented it from racing. Team Ascari then attempted {{to compete in the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans, but, having not attended the Le Mans Test, were not invited to race. Zwart then entered himself alongside Werner Lupberger and Jeffrey van Hooydonk at the 1000 km of Nürburgring, but, although the car made the start of a race for the first time, they were forced to retire after 41 laps due to another gearbox failure. At the Brno round of the Sports Racing World Cup, an A410 finished a race for the first time; Lupberger and Zwart finished 19th, and last overall, twelve laps behind the <b>next</b> <b>car.</b> This was also the only time the A410 finished a race in 2000; the team retired at Donington Park without completing a lap due to electrical issues, before suffering similar problems at the Nürburgring after 27 laps, and a spin after 29 laps put the team out of the final race of the Sports Racing World Cup season, held at Magny-Cours.|$|E

500|$|A wooden {{boat was}} then carried in; on board was Annie Lennox who {{proceeded}} to sing [...] "Little Bird".

Near {{the end of the}} song a performer appeared on a tightrope above the stadium, walked along it, and shook hands with a mannequin, which then burst into flames (referencing the cover of Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here). A psychedelic bus then enters with Russell Brand sitting on top singing [...] "Pure Imagination" [...] from [...] "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" [...] then segues into [...] "I Am the Walrus"; before introducing Fatboy Slim, who played [...] "Right Here Right Now" [...] and [...] "The Rockafeller Skank"; as the bus slowly transformed into a large inflatable Octopus. Three convertible Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupés then arrived; the roof of the first was taken down to reveal Jessie J who sang her hit [...] "Price Tag", as the cars did a lap of the stadium. Jessie J provided guest vocals as the <b>next</b> <b>car</b> had its roof removed, to show Tinie Tempah who sang [...] "Written in the Stars".

His Chevy was nicknamed [...] "Hang 'Em High" [...] because his wheelstands scraped the car's bumper. His <b>next</b> <b>car</b> was a big block 1957 Chevy nicknamed [...] "Rat Poison".

2500|$|The <b>next</b> <b>car,</b> No.2, {{introduced}} in 1934, {{was to a}} radically different design. An ungainly looking machine, it had a [...] long, slab-sided lightweight body that was to prove problematic. To eliminate the need to run round its trailer at termini, it was equipped with an elevated driving position at each end (similar to some French railcars) so that the driver could see {{over the top of}} a trailer that was being propelled. No.2 could seat 75 third class and five first class passengers and was powered by two [...] Leyland Diesel engines with a similar transmission to No.1. No.2's looks were improved somewhat when the raised drivers' cabs were removed during its NCC service.|$|E
2500|$|Alfa Corse also {{prepared}} and entered a single 8C 2900B, chassis number 412033, for the 1938 Le Mans. The car featured a streamlined coupé body {{at a time}} when Le Mans racers were almost always open cars. The aerodynamic coupé was built by Carrozzeria Touring. In 1987, an Italian magazine had the car tested at the Pininfarina wind tunnel, where a Cx of 0.42 was measured, down to 0.38 with air intakes closed. The coupé, driven by Sommer and Biondetti, led for most of the race, but tyre trouble was then followed by a dropped valve. The car was driven to the pits, but had to retire there. [...] At the time the valve dropped, the coupé had a lead of more than 160km over the <b>next</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As {{the train}} {{approached}} the Merillon Avenue station, Ferguson drew the gun, dropped several cartridges on the ground, stood up, {{and opened fire}} at random. During the next three minutes, Ferguson killed six people and injured another 19. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, [...] "He's got a gun! He's shooting people!" [...] Ferguson walked east on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to {{the eastern end of}} the train and tried to enter the <b>next</b> <b>car.</b> Ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing.
