40|$|At present {{both the}} wedge gauge and the ICES mesh gauge {{are used to}} examine the mesh opening of trawl cod-ends. A {{thorough}} investigation of both instruments by an EU project (MESH) has revealed a number of deficiencies. This has lead to the conclusions to not further recommend the use of both devices but to go {{for the development of a}} complete new measurement tool. This is presently progressing in a further EU project named OMEGA. Prototypes of the new device have been produced and a number of introductory tests have already been made. This contribution reports on further laboratory tests carried out at the Institute for Fishing technology and Fish Quality with special emphasis on <b>netting</b> <b>yarn</b> diameters below 4 mm. The results demonstrate further yarn size depending inaccuracies of the wedge gauge and support the rapid introduction of the newly developed measurement instrument...|$|E
40|$|Since {{some time}} fishing gear {{scientists}} express their concern over an observed {{tendency of the}} commercial fishery to proceed from codend netting yarns of 3 to 4 mm to higher values or to switch {{to the use of}} double instead of single yarn. A recent large EU-financed project collected statistical evidence on the detrimental effect of such behaviour on the selectivity of the codends. In this context data on cod are very scarce. German-Polish experiments in the Baltic from 1999 to 2001 aimed at filling this gap. The investigations prove a clear evidence of a negativ ecorrelation between <b>netting</b> <b>yarn</b> diameter and selectivity factor and/or L 50. In addition they demonstrate a clear negative effect on selectivity when switching from single to double yarn The effects are of an order of magnitude that counteracting effects as catch size are masked and support the decision of the IBSFC to define maximum yarn diameters both for single and double yarn netting. A measuring instrument for the enforcement of these new regulations was introduced right in time...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in April 5 to May 15, 2017 in Laboratory of Fishing Gear Material of Aquatic Resources Faculty of Fisheries and Marine University of Riau, Pekanbaru. The purpose {{of this research is}} to know the increase of PA <b>net</b> <b>yarn</b> length after soaking in fresh water and sea water. The method used in this research is the experimental method, the result data for changes of the length <b>net</b> <b>yarn</b> is processed using the formula according to SNI 08 - 0889 - 1989 and then analyzed descriptively. From the result of this research, there are changes of polyamide (PA) yarn length after soaked in fresh water and sea water with average length will change after soaking in freshwater and sea water of 1002. 51 mm and 1002. 89 mm while average change of length after several condition in freshwater and seawater of 1002. 51 mm and 1002. 79 mm. The authors suggest to do for further research on the changes of the <b>net</b> <b>yarn</b> length after soaking in freshwater and sea water with the addition of soaking time and conducted research on the tensile strength of PA yarn after immersion...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} merry widow was a corselet incorporating slim {{panels of}} black, elastic <b>yarn</b> <b>netting.</b> A heavy-duty zipper was inserted behind a velvet-backed hook-and-eye flange, {{and the entire}} garment was lined with nylon voile. Nine long, spiral wires were encased in black satin.|$|R

However, statistical analysis of the catch in respect of quality fishes shows that HDPE <b>yarn</b> <b>nets</b> are equally efficient as nylon nets...|$|R
50|$|Net or netting is any textile {{in which}} the yarns are fused, looped or knotted at their intersections, {{resulting}} in a fabric with open spaces between the <b>yarns.</b> <b>Net</b> has many uses, and come in different varieties. Depending {{on the type of}} yarn or filament that is used to make up the textile, its characteristics can vary from durable to not durable.|$|R
40|$|Local {{characteristics}} of fabrics varied to suit special applications. Adjustable reed machinery proposed {{for use in}} weaving fabrics in various <b>net</b> shapes, widths, <b>yarn</b> spacings, and yarn angles. Locations of edges of fabric and configuration of warp and filling yarns varied along fabric to obtain specified properties. In machinery, reed wires mounted in groups on sliders, mounted on lengthwise rails in reed frame. Mechanisms incorporated to move sliders lengthwise, parallel to warp yarns, by sliding them along rails; move sliders crosswise by translating reed frame rails perpendicular to warp yarns; and crosswise by spreading reed rails within group. Profile of reed wires in group on each slider changed...|$|R
50|$|Throughout most {{of their}} existence, the company had {{manufactured}} fishing <b>net</b> twines, cotton <b>yarn</b> of all types (except the very finest threads) and high quality sewing threads. This latter product was especially successful and sales grew strongly during the 1880s. By 1881, the sewing cotton {{side of the business}} had grown {{to such an extent that}} it had been decided to build a new 'state-of-the-art' mill. The company bought land off Honeywell Lane, Oldham and erected Belgrave Mill which subsequently became known as 'Belgrave Number 1 Mill' as a further three mills were erected on the site in the early part of the 20th century. Yarn produced at the Belgrave Number 1 Mill was bleached or dyed in an on-site facility. Belgrave #1 was designed by the architects Potts, Pickup and Dixon a leading firm of mill architects in Lancashire. No expense was spared, including the fitting of a steam engine built by Woolstenhulmes & Rye.|$|R
