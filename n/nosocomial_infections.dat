40|$|Background: <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of death in neonates. In recent years, the results of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> control committee, which carried out, based on a {{protocol}} of National <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>Infection</b> Surveillance (NNIS) is not consistent with neonatal review articles. This study was performed to determine the prevalence and incidence of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> with an active, prospective method based on definitions and characteristics of Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) and comparing it with routine method of NNIS. Methods: This cross-sectional and prospective study was independent from Beasat Hospital <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> control committee and preformed by daily active visiting of neonatal ward (that is level-II) for six month period. The results of this study were compared with the results of the NNIS committee of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection.</b> Collected data were statistically analyzed by SPSS software. Results: From all hospitalized neonates, 369 cases (1292 patients / day) were enrolled in the study. The overall rate of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (frequency) was 2. 71 % and the overall incidence of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> was 7. 73 cases per 1, 000 patients / day. The most common <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> in this study was skin and soft tissue infections; totally 50 %. The incidence of Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLA-BSI) was 14. 2 per 1000 central catheter/day for the six months of study. <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> rate preformed by Beasat Hospital <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> control committee (based on NNIS) was 0. 1 % and incidence of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> 0. 3 per 1, 000 patients/ day at the same 6 month study. Conclusion: It seems that a large part of this considerable differences between the results of this study compared to NNIS based study, is this fact that, for <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> surveillance in the neonatal field, the presence of a specialist as a performer and leader of the team, is necessary...|$|R

40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized {{study to}} establish <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (NI) rate {{was conducted at}} the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) of Jakarta for 1 year in 1982 / 1983.

From 2, 288 patients hospitalized during study period, 723 patients (aged 2 months- 70 years) fulfilled the criteria for inclusion into the study, and NI was found in 191 (26. 4 %) patients with 285 infections according to the anatomical location. From 285 infections, highest infection rate was urinary tract <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (15. 9 %), followed by nosocomial bacteremia (10, 8 %), lower respiratory tract infection (4. 7 %), gastrointestinal tract <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (2. 6 %), skin <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (2, 4 %), oral mucous membrane <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (1, 4 %), <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> of infusion needle and the lowest rate was upper respiratory tract <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> (0. 6 %).

40|$|Background. <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> or {{hospital}} acquired {{infection is}} defined as infection occurring beyond 3 x 24 hours after hospital admission.

To determine underlying diseases, length of stay {{more than a week}}, antibiotics used more than a week, invasive procedures, and decubitus ulcer as risk factors of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and High Care Unit (HCU) of Dr. Kariadi Hospital. Methods. Observational analytic using cross-sectional approach was conducted at Dr. Kariadi Hospital according to medical records of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and High Care Unit (HCU) patients within January 2014 – December 2014. Subjects were selected by consecutive sampling. Odds ratio of risk factors and <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> were analyzed by chi-square test, and considered significant if p< 0, 05. Results. Based on chi-square test, length of stay more than a week [p= 0, 046; OR= 4, 9 (0, 920 - 26, 107) ], antibiotics used more than a week [p= 0, 026; OR= 3, 5 (1, 139 - 10, 996) ] and decubitus ulcer [p= 0, 009; OR= 11, 1 (1, 305 - 95, 137) ] are associated with higher incidence of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection.</b> Conclusion.

25|$|L. jordanis is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It {{has been}} shown to cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans and is responsible for causing a type of pneumonia commonly referred to as Legionnaires' disease. Lung infection with L. jordanis is sometimes misdiagnosed as a Aspergillus mold infection. This mold also causes a fatal type of pneumonia which L. jordanis is able to mimic. Using human sera, indirect fluorescent antibody tests strongly indicated that unrecognized human infections with L. jordanis may be occurring. A study of patients from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, NY revealed a possible risk of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> from shower heads found to contain L. jordanis. After this finding, monthly shower head disinfection procedures were instituted, but about 19% of shower heads remained positive for Legionella. Infections of individuals who are not immunocompromised are also possible.|$|E
25|$|While {{the number}} of nurses {{providing}} patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of nursing care quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing {{is directly related to}} patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated that patient death, <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections,</b> cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios. The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of pediatric nursing care quality are sensitive measures of nursing care. Professional nurses {{play a key role in}} successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain. Astute assessment skills are required to intervene successfully and relieve discomfort.33 Maintenance of a patient’s intravenous access is a clear nursing responsibility. Pediatric patients are at increased risk for intravenous infiltration and for significant complications of infiltration, should it occur.|$|E

40|$|Rotavirus {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of acute {{diarrhoea}} during infancy, and the spread of this infection due to rotavirus in paediatric wards can cause acute diarrhoea during hospitalization, and, in turn, prolong hospitalization or rehospitalization. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the problem and to find an appropriate approach to decrease the rate of infection. The incidence of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> due to rotavirus was studied in 80 children aged 3 - 24 months from November 2003 to April 2004 in the Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Rotavirus antigen was detected by latex aggulutation in stool samples obtained during hospitalization and up to 72 hours after discharge from the hospital. The prevalence of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> due to rotavirus was 26. 25 %, which is a considerable prevalence compared to similar studies which reported a prevalence of 27. 7 %, 19. 4 %, and 14. 6 %. Overall, 15 % of the 21 children with positive rotavirus antigen in their stools had acute diarrhoea during hospitalization and up to 72 hours after discharge (symptomatic <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection),</b> and 11. 25 % of all children (n= 80) studied had asymptomatic <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection.</b> Regarding the low frequency of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> due to rotavirus in other studies which have only studied symptomatic cases during hospitalization and reported a prevalence of 3. 3 and 9 %, it is suggested that the real estimation of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> due to rotavirus in asymptomatic cases that might become symptomatic after discharge from hospital should also be considered.

The key words were: <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> and mortality and pediatrics/neonate/ newborn/child/infant/adolescent.

Among these factors, the only one that can be minimized is inadequate antimicrobial treatment, which has proven to be an important contributor to hospital mortality in critically-ill patients.
