5|$|Many educated Sudanese were {{suspicious}} of the Council and drifted towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections, not for religious reasons but because they were hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members had {{remained}} under Spartan occupation and persuaded the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact. The Romans agreed with the Achaeans, as they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after the Romans left Greece.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of Casimir the Great, the period of {{hereditary}} (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included {{the beginning of the}} general sejm, the dominant bicameral parliament of the future.|$|E

5|$|Following Bowie's death, fans {{gathered}} at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows {{him in his}} Aladdin Sane character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January.|$|E
5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government {{was concerned about the}} reliability of suspension bridges and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} season of Italian football, Milan failed to win a trophy, and Blomqvist often sat on the bench. He nearly decided against going to Old Trafford because he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> repeat of this season. The {{defending}} champions had an equally disappointing season, finishing 11th in Serie A and failing to qualify for European football. Blomqvist was subsequently sold to Serie A runners up Parma {{in the summer of}} 1997. Blomqvist enjoyed more regular football, although the club finished 6th in the league and missed out on the knockout stages of the Champions League. The Swede's sole league goal for the club was scored in a 4–0 win over Napoli at Stadio San Paolo.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (HSL). A conflict arose between the two as the latter {{in cooperation with the}} Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> police investigation until after their report was finished. This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. However, it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 31 May Howe's fleet {{closed with}} the French, making {{full use of}} the {{advantage}} of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted. During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more. Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.|$|E

In Bullet Club's final title match of the event, Styles unsuccessfully challenged Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.

The following day, the rest of Bullet Club turned on Styles and kicked him out of the group with Omega taking over the leadership. Omega also announced his graduation from the junior heavyweight division, stating that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> rematch with Kushida, but instead a match with Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The railway mostly {{ran along}} the {{existing}} tracks of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) but had its own branches from the main line at both London and Brookwood. Trains carried coffins and passengers from a dedicated station in Waterloo, London, onto the LSWR tracks. On reaching the cemetery, the trains reversed down a dedicated branch line to two stations in the cemetery, one for the burial of Anglicans and one for Nonconformists (non-Anglicans) or those who did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> Church of England funeral. The station waiting rooms and the compartments of the train, both for living and for dead passengers, were partitioned by both religion and class to prevent both mourners and cadavers from different social backgrounds from mixing. As well as the regular funeral traffic, the London Necropolis Railway was used to transport large numbers of exhumed bodies during the mass removal {{of a number of}} London graveyards to Brookwood.|$|E
5|$|The story opens {{when the}} Providers, the {{invisible}} and unidentified rulers {{of all the}} Zones, order Al•Ith, queen of the peaceful paradise of Zone Three, to marry Ben Ata, king of the militarised and repressive Zone Four. Al•Ith is repulsed {{by the idea of}} consorting with a barbarian, and Ben Ata does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> righteous queen disturbing his military campaigns. Nevertheless, Al•Ith descends to Zone Four and they reluctantly marry. Ben Ata is not used to the company of women he cannot control, and Al•Ith has difficulty relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.|$|E

5|$|Wilco {{had planned}} on {{releasing}} Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> change in record labels to significantly delay {{the release of}} the album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album.|$|E
