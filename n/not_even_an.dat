5|$|The Theban plays {{consist of}} three plays: Oedipus Rex (also called Oedipus Tyrannus or Oedipus the King), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. All three plays concern {{the fate of}} Thebes {{during and after the}} reign of King Oedipus. They have often been {{published}} under a single cover. Sophocles, however, wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions, many years apart. Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative) but they are <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them. He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes, such as the Epigoni, of which only fragments have survived.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} phase of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency of attacks. German bombers also raided targets as far north as Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1947, Sherman White matriculated at Villanova University. It did not take long for him to rethink his {{decision}} to attend. Villanova was a Catholic school, {{and at the time}} no other African Americans were in attendance. White did not feel comfortable. Additionally, the physical education major that he had been promised was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> option. In his six months at the school, White received twoCs, twoDs and oneF before dropping out and moving back to Englewood.|$|E
25|$|They started positively, riding {{their luck}} and good favour with the umpires – {{a number of}} lbw appeals were turned down {{both before and after}} tea – as Strauss and Trescothick paired up for 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a classic pace-man's short-ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got nicely off the mark with a four with his second ball, however, {{suggesting}} that England would be playing positively to get the target – but Lee and Warne just kept pounding. Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip – having taken him for ten in the previous over – and Bell was left hopelessly plumb to a ball that didn't turn. When Vaughan – who had failed to buy a run off the last 23 deliveries – was bowled comprehensively by Lee, there was nowhere to hide for England, and <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten 42 from Pietersen to see England to stumps could hide the inevitable – that England needed 301 for the last five wickets, with a world-class bowling attack at the other end.|$|E
25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues {{he ought to have}} by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.|$|E

25|$|This is {{followed}} by {{an examination of the}} attacks on the Pentagon. The film opposes the official story of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, alleging that the path of destruction does not match what a 757 would leave. In particular it claims that the size of the hole in the Pentagon, a lack of debris and, little landscape damage seem inconsistent with prior airliner crashes. It also alleges that too few parts were recovered from the crash site to reliably ascertain that they were of a Boeing 757, and that a flywheel observed at the site seemed too small to {{have been part of the}} aircraft's engine turbine. Experts officially declared that the wheel was part of the APU, but others say it didn't come from the APU of a 757 but likely from an E-3 Sentry aircraft. The film also claims that the alleged hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour had difficulty operating basic controls on a small Cessna that he rented at a flight school, and that perhaps <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> experienced pilot could have maneuvered the reflex angle of turn at the airspeed and altitude at which the aircraft approached without going into a high speed stall. The film mentions three cameras on nearby buildings that allegedly caught the entire incident at the Pentagon on film, which it says the government confiscated and has refused to release in full.|$|E

500|$|In {{northern}} Europe, agriculture including {{animal husbandry}} went into decline when the Roman empire collapsed. Some aspects {{such as the}} herding of animals continued throughout the period. By the 11th century, the economy had recovered and the countryside was again productive. The Domesday Book recorded every parcel of land and every animal in Britain: [...] "there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover ... <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in [...] writ."

2500|$|The {{description}} of Vernanimalcula as bilaterian has been strongly challenged. Other workers (Bengtson, Budd and co-workers) {{in the field}} have repeatedly claimed that Vernanimalcula is largely a taphonomic artefact generated by phosphate growth within a spherical object such as an acritarch, and thus Vernanimalcula was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> animal, let alone a bilaterian. Chen et al. initially defended their interpretation of Vernanimalcula against the claims of Bengtson and Budd.

2500|$|Several {{months after}} {{becoming}} leader Downer's support base was quickly eroded, however, {{by a series}} of embarrassing public blunders. One was the emergence of a 1987 speech to the far-right Australian League of Rights. Another was the sacking of John Hewson from the shadow ministry in August 1994. [...] Yet another was the public concern that Downer's wife was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> Australian citizen. During 1994 Downer expressed interest in repealing the Mabo Legislation if elected at the next federal election due to be arranged by 1996. A major incident that damaged Downer's leadership was a scandal which happened at a formal dinner. While promoting the Liberal slogan [...] "The Things That Matter", Downer joked that the party's domestic violence policy would accordingly be named [...] "The Things That Batter", referring to abusive husbands. Downer also found it difficult to handle the gulf between monarchists and republicans in his own party. By the end of 1994, his approval ratings had dwindled to 34 percent after being as high as 53 percent.|$|E
