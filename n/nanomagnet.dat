The researchers used a quadruple electrode chip to create an array of nanocapsules. The AC and DC fields could be oriented parallel or perpendicular to each other in order to create the electric tweezers (the mechanism could transport capsules parallel or perpendicular to their orientations depending on whether or not AC and DC fields were directed parallel or perpendicular to one another). The Ag/Ni/Ag nanocores proved necessary for steering/orientation via the AC field (when removed no net torque resulted). The electric tweezers then moved the nanocapsules to their <b>nanomagnet</b> anchors, utilizing the attraction between Ni in capsule and magnet.|$|E

50|$|Clusters {{are often}} {{regarded}} as zero-dimensional units and most atoms in a nanocluster are surface atoms. Thus, {{it is expected}} that the magnetic moment of an atom in a cluster will be larger than that of one in a bulk material. Lower coordination, lower dimensionality, and increasing interatomic distance in metal clusters contribute to enhancement of the magnetic moment in nanoclusters. Metal nanoclusters also show change in magnetic properties. For example, vanadium and rhodium are paramagnetic in bulk but become ferromagnetic in nanoclusters. Also, manganese is antiferromagnetic in bulk but ferromagnetic in nanoclusters. A small nanocluster is a <b>nanomagnet,</b> which can be made nonmagnetic simply by changing its structure.

40|$|The {{coherent}} {{dynamics of}} a coupled photonic cavity and a <b>nanomagnet</b> is explored {{as a function}} of <b>nanomagnet</b> size. For sufficiently strong coupling eigenstates involving highly entangled photon and spin states are found, which can be combined to create coherent states. As the size of the <b>nanomagnet</b> increases its coupling to the photonic mode also monotonically increases, as well as the number of photon and spin states involved in the system's eigenstates. For small nanomagnets the crystalline anisotropy of the magnet strongly localized the eigenstates in photon and spin number, quenching the potential for coherent states. For a sufficiently large <b>nanomagnet</b> the macrospin approximation breaks down and different domains of the <b>nanomagnet</b> may couple separately to the photonic mode.

40|$|Nanomagnetic logic, {{incorporating}} logic bits in the magnetization orientations of single-domain <b>nanomagnets,</b> has garnered {{attention as}} an alternative to transistor-based logic due to its non-volatility and unprecedented energy-efficiency. The energy efficiency of this scheme is determined by the method used to flip the magnetization orientations of the <b>nanomagnets</b> in response to one or more inputs and produce the desired output. Unfortunately, the large dissipative losses that occur when <b>nanomagnets</b> are switched with a magnetic field or spin-transfer-torque inhibit the promised energy-efficiency. Another technique offering superior energy efficiency, “straintronics”, involves the application of a voltage to a piezoelectric layer to generate a strain which is transferred to an elastically coupled magnetrostrictive layer, causing magnetization rotation. The functionality of this scheme can be enhanced further by introducing magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the magnetostrictive layer, thereby generating four stable magnetization states (instead of the two stable directions produced by shape anisotropy in ellipsoidal <b>nanomagnets).</b> Numerical simulations were performed to implement a low-power universal logic gate (NOR) using such 4 -state magnetostrictive/piezoelectric <b>nanomagnets</b> (Ni/PZT) by clocking the piezoelectric layer with a small electrostatic potential (0. 2 V) to switch the magnetization of the magnetic layer. Unidirectional and reliable logic propagation in this system was also demonstrated theoretically. Besides doubling the logic density (4 -state versus 2 -state) for logic applications, these four-state <b>nanomagnets</b> can be exploited for higher order applications such as image reconstruction and recognition in the presence of noise, associative memory and neuromorphic computing. Experimental work in strain-based switching has been limited to magnets that are multi-domain or magnets where strain moves domain walls. In this work, we also demonstrate strain-based switching in 2 -state single-domain ellipsoidal magnetostrictive <b>nanomagnets</b> of lateral dimensions 200 nm fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate (PMN-PT) and studied using Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM).
