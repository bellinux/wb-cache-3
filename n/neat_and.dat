25|$|Various {{methods are}} used to {{encourage}} the formation of locks such as backcombing, braiding, rolling and the crochet hook method. All of these methods require ongoing work {{to be applied to}} the dread before it becomes <b>neat</b> <b>and</b> tight or mature. However, if the crochet hook method is applied by a skilled hand throughout the length of the dread, then the resulting dreadlocks are instantly tight and will not need any rolling.|$|E
25|$|Final shaping {{was then}} {{applied to the}} usable cutting edge of the tool, again using fine removal of flakes. Some Acheulean tools were {{sharpened}} instead by the removal of a tranchet flake. This was struck from the lateral edge of the hand-axe close to the intended cutting area, resulting in the removal of a flake running along (parallel to) the blade of the axe to create a <b>neat</b> <b>and</b> very sharp working edge. This distinctive tranchet flake can be identified amongst flint-knapping debris at Acheulean sites.|$|E

Then they tap it once again but this time they put their heel a few milimeters above the ground and repeat the process with the other foot. They {{do this in a}} walking motion. it is very hard especially if you have to follow the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums' rhythm.|$|E

25|$|The Ducali saw March's last full {{complement}} of fixtures out with a trip to virtually relegated Cesena, who were 14 points adrift of safety (Parma) prior to kick off with just ten games remaining. Parma had not won in seven, but the home side's run without a win was ten. Both runs went on longer in a match that was full of chances. Parma's Sergio Floccari opened the scoring just before half-time with a <b>neat</b> <b>and</b> powerful finish after Giovinco's square ball, but both sides could have had any number of goals before the halfway point. The second half started in disastrous fashion for the away side; Cesena took the lead with goals from Mario Santana and Simone Del Nero in the first ten minutes. Paletta's header just after the hour brought the scores level. Chances continued to flow, but the game ended 2–2. This preserved Parma's 5-point buffer from relegation because nineteenth-placed Novara played out a goalless draw with eighteenth-placed Lecce.|$|E
25|$|For {{its third}} generation, the American emerged with {{what would be}} its only {{completely}} new design. The entire line was treated to <b>neat</b> <b>and</b> trim lines with pleasing simplicity (compared to the more boxy predecessors) with characteristic tunneled headlights with a simple horizontal grille between them. The Rambler American's wheelbase grew by six-inches or 152mm (to 106in or 2692mm) and the interiors were made more spacious. The station wagons in the restyled 1964 series came with four doors and gained 17% more cargo space compared to the previous design. They all featured a new roll-down disappearing rear window for the bottom-hinged tailgate. Full coil front springs along with soft rear leaf units, gave the new American an unusually smooth ride, better than many larger domestic cars. The new models also incorporated various parts and components (such as doors) that were interchangeable with AMC's larger cars. In essence, the new body was a shorter, narrower version of the previous years new Rambler Classic.|$|E
25|$|The General being {{desirous of}} {{selecting}} a particular number of men, as a Guard for himself, and baggage, The Colonel, or commanding Officer, {{of each of}} the established Regiments, (the Artillery and Rifflemen excepted) will furnish him with four, that the number wanted may be chosen out of them. His Excellency depends upon the Colonels for good Men, such as they can recommend for their sobriety, honesty, and good behaviour; he wishes them to be from five feet, eight Inches high, to five feet, ten Inches; handsomely and well made, and as there is nothing in his eyes more desirable, than Cleanliness in a Soldier, he desires that particular attention may be made, in the choice of such men, as are <b>neat,</b> <b>and</b> spruce. They are all to be at Head Quarters to morrow precisely at twelve, at noon, when the Number wanted will be fixed upon. The General neither wants men with uniforms, or arms, nor does he desire any man to be sent to him, that is not perfectly willing, and desirous, of being of this guard. They should be drill'd men.|$|E

40|$|Impacts of {{oleic acid}} {{diethanolamide}} phosphate (abbreviated as ODAP) as an additive on biodegradability, anti-wear capacity, friction-reducing ability and corrosiveness of an unreadily biodegradable HVI 350 mineral lubricating oil was studied. The biodegradabilities of <b>neat</b> lubricating oil <b>and</b> its formulations with ODAP were evaluated on a biodegradation tester. Furthermore, the anti-wear and friction-reducing abilities and the corrosiveness of <b>neat</b> oil <b>and</b> the formulated oils were determined on a four-ball tribotester and a {{copper strip corrosion}} tester, respectively. The results indicated that ODAP markedly enhanced biodegradability as well as anti-wear and friction-reducing abilities of the lubricating oil. On the other hand, excellent color ratings of copper strips for both <b>neat</b> oil <b>and</b> the ODAP-doped oil were obtained in the corrosion tests, demonstrating that the corrosiveness of <b>neat</b> oil <b>and</b> the doped oil was negligible, although the latter seemed to provide slightly better anti-corrosion ability...|$|R

Burges reconstructed the shell wall that runs along the north-west side of the courtyard [...] thick, complete with arrow holes and a battlement.|$|E
500|$|The {{community}} grew at {{the beginning}} of the century. In 1902, the Corsica mine began operating in earnest and houses were quickly [...] built. Company houses were built among the tall timbers. The community thrived on iron mining, its population nearing 1,000 after World War I, resulting in a <b>neat</b> <b>and</b> comfortable location comprising more than 100 houses. The townspeople were hardy pioneers of a jumble of nationalities, including Croatians, Slovenians, Finns, Italians, Germans, Scandinavians and English, particularly from Cornwall.|$|E
