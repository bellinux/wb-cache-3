Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a <b>natural</b> <b>defense.</b> However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the P'ohang-dong area.|$|E

5|$|With {{the major}} {{population}} shifts of the Slavic migrations completed, the 8th century brought {{a measure of}} stability to the Slavic people settled in Poland. About one million people actively utilized no more than 20–25% of the land; the rest was mainly forest. Normal settlements, {{with the exception of}} a few fortifications and cult venues, were limited to lowland areas below 350 meters above the sea level. Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water. The Slavs were very familiar with the water environment and used it as <b>natural</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E

The exact cause of the die-off is not determined, but most documented mortality events were due to wolf predation, bacterial infection due to injuries sustained from predators, and parasites from whitetail deer to which moose have not developed a <b>natural</b> <b>defense,</b> such as liver flukes, brain worms and winter tick infestations.|$|E
25|$|When {{potato tubers}} {{are exposed to}} light, they turn green and {{increase}} glycoalkaloid production. This is a <b>natural</b> <b>defense</b> to help prevent the uncovered tuber from being eaten. The green colour is from chlorophyll, and is itself harmless.

25|$|Immature maize shoots {{accumulate}} {{a powerful}} antibiotic substance, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA). DIMBOA {{is a member}} of a group of hydroxamic acids (also known as benzoxazinoids) that serve as a <b>natural</b> <b>defense</b> against a wide range of pests, including insects, pathogenic fungi and bacteria. DIMBOA is also found in related grasses, particularly wheat. A maize mutant (bx) lacking DIMBOA is highly susceptible to attack by aphids and fungi. DIMBOA is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the European corn borer (family Crambidae). As maize matures, DIMBOA levels and resistance to the corn borer decline.|$|E
25|$|Dermatological {{vascular}} laser (single wavelength) or intense {{pulsed light}} (broad spectrum) machines offer {{one of the}} treatments for rosacea, in particular the erythema (redness) of the skin. They use light to penetrate the epidermis to target the capillaries in the dermis layer of the skin. The light is absorbed by oxyhemoglobin, which heats up, causing the capillary walls to heat up to 70°C (158°F), damaging them, and causing them to be absorbed by the body's <b>natural</b> <b>defense</b> mechanism. With {{a sufficient number of}} treatments, this method may even eliminate the redness altogether, though additional periodic treatments will likely be necessary to remove newly formed capillaries.|$|E

25|$|At this point, the Mongol {{army was}} divided into five widely {{separated}} groups on {{opposite ends of the}} enemy Empire. After the Shah did not mount an active defense of the cities on the Syr Darya, Genghis and Tolui, at the head of an army of roughly 50,000 men, skirted the <b>natural</b> <b>defense</b> barrier of the Syr Darya and its fortified cities, and went westwards to lay siege to the city of Bukhara first. To do this, they traversed 300 miles of the seemingly impassable Kyzyl Kum desert by hopping through the various oases, guided most of the way by captured nomads. The Mongols arrived at the gates of Bukhara virtually unnoticed. Many military tacticians regard this surprise entrance to Bukhara {{as one of the most}} successful maneuvers in warfare. Whatever Mohammed II was intending to do, Genghis's maneuver across his rear completely stole away his initiative and prevented him from carrying out any possible plans. The Khwarezm army could only slowly react to the lightning fast Mongol maneuvers.|$|E
500|$|But {{the attack}} never came. Instead, on September 8, Howe moved his force north, through Newark and Hockessin into Pennsylvania.

He settled on Chadds Ford, just across the Delaware border, upon the Brandywine River—the last <b>natural</b> <b>defense</b> before the Schuylkill River and Philadelphia. It was there that the two armies clashed again in the major Battle of Brandywine on September 11.
