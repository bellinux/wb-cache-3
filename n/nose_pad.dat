50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} American hog-nosed skunk is it has a single, broad white stripe {{from the top of}} the head to the base of the tail, with the tail itself being completely white. It is the only skunk that lacks a white dot or medial bar between the eyes and has primarily black body fur. The snout of C. leuconotus is relatively long, with a naked <b>nose</b> <b>pad,</b> and resembles the nose of a small hog. The <b>nose</b> <b>pad</b> (20 mm wide by 25 mm long) is about three times wider than that of Mephitis mephitis. The ears are small and rounded, and the eyes are relatively small. The fur is short and coarse.|$|E
50|$|The adult Père David's deer {{reaches a}} head-and-body length {{of up to}} 1.9 - 2.2 m and stands about 1.2 m tall at the shoulder. The tail is {{relatively}} long for a deer, measuring 50 - 66 cm when straightened. Weight is between 135 and 200 kg. The head is long and slender with large eyes, very large preorbital glands, a naked <b>nose</b> <b>pad</b> and small, pointed ears.|$|E

50|$|Billy Reid eyewear is {{designed}} {{in collaboration with}} Eponym's design team, and made in Japan. The Optical collection includes a version of Reid’s signature personal frames made from sustainable buffalo horn. Sunglasses and optical frames have details such as leather, ultra-light titanium <b>nose</b> <b>pads,</b> Italian acetate, and gradient lenses.|$|R
50|$|Asian small-clawed otters have {{flattened}} {{heads and}} short, thick necks; eyes are located {{toward the front}} of the head. The ears are small and rounded and have a valve-like structure that enables them to be closed when swimming underwater. <b>Nose</b> <b>pads</b> are dusky or pinkish in color. The muzzle has vibrissae on either side. These are sensitive to touch and to underwater vibrations, and are important in detecting the movements of prey.|$|R
50|$|Although {{considerable}} variation exists among individuals, their fur {{is usually}} reddish to chocolate brown and marked with creamy or white blotches over {{the chest and}} throat. The head is broad with a short muzzle, small rounded ears, and a hairless <b>nose</b> <b>pad.</b> The teeth are adapted for consuming fish, with large sharp upper canine teeth, curved lower canines, and sharp carnassial teeth. The jaws are similarly adapted, with the mandibular fossa fitting so snugly into the condyle on the lower jaw that the latter cannot move sideways, {{making it easier to}} capture and hold fish.|$|E
50|$|Micronycteris megalotis is {{considered}} a small bat in its genus, although the size of it varies slightly depending on geographical location. It has large ears which are characteristic of its species. It has a large <b>nose</b> <b>pad</b> that is generally {{twice as high as}} it is wide. The head is elongated and eyes are small and black. M. megalotis has short wings that are wide and are relatively short. The wings are attached to the feet, which are long and slender. Their short and wide wings allow for better maneuverability in their habitat.|$|E
5000|$|The Indian {{pangolin}} is a solitary, shy, slow-moving, nocturnal mammal. It {{is about}} 84-122 cm long {{from head to}} tail, the tail usually being 33-47 cm long, and weighs 10-16 kg. Females are generally smaller than the males and have one pair of mammae. The pangolin possesses a cone-shaped head with small, dark eyes, and a long muzzle with a <b>nose</b> <b>pad</b> similar in color, or darker than, its pinkish-brown skin. It has powerful limbs, tipped with sharp, clawed digits. It is an almost exclusive insectivore and principally subsists on ants and termites, which it catches with a specially adapted long, sticky tongue. The pangolin has no teeth, but has strong stomach muscles to aid in digestion. The most noticeable characteristic of the pangolin is its massive, scaled armour, which covers its upper face and its whole body {{with the exception of}} the belly and the inside of the legs. These protective scales are rigid and made of keratin. It has 160-200 scales in total, about 40-46% of which are located on the tail. Scales can be 6.5-7 cm long, 8.5 cm wide, and weigh 7-10 grams. The skin and scales make up about one-fourth to one-third of the total body mass of this species.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rough-haired}} {{and giant}} golden moles live in chambers and passages in mounds reached {{by a system}} of tunnels made {{in part by the}} golden moles and in part by mole-rats. 7 They are generally solitary and territorial, and have been known to fight with competing moles.11Their burrow systems open to the surface via a number of ovoid holes that resemble the holes of freshwater crab chambers. These openings often are filled with shallow soil tailings (soil that has been displaced to the side and back), also similar to those of crabs; sometimes a shallow depression is also found at the burrow entrance, and possibly serves as a latrine. The telltale indicators of rough-haired golden moles are rootings made by the leathery <b>nose</b> <b>pad</b> during nocturnal surface foraging bouts. These signs resemble a scuff made by the edge of the heel of a shoe that has been dug superficially into the soil, and are usually located very close to the open holes. In wet soils the imprint of their feet can sometimes also be seen. Surface foraging and activity usually follows a period of rainfall. It is not known if these moles also forage in underground tunnels like other golden moles, but this seems likely given the long periods without rainfall during the dry winter months throughout most of its range.5 ...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundDecontamination, cleaning, and reuse of {{filtering}} facepiece respirators (FFRs) {{has been proposed}} to mitigate an acute FFR shortage during a public health emergency. Our study evaluates the ability of commercially available wipe products to clean FFRs contaminated with either infectious or noninfectious aerosols. MethodsThree models of surgical N 95 FFRs were contaminated with aerosols of mucin or viable Staphylococcus aureus then cleaned with hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, or nonantimicrobial wipes. After cleaning, FFRs were separated into components (<b>nose</b> <b>pad,</b> fabrics, and perforated strip), and contaminants were extracted and quantified.

50|$|Spring bridge: Also {{known as}} Astig, this variety {{consists}} of a sliding bar connecting the lenses which can be separated through a gentle pull. The bar is telescopic, consisting of two sliders within a tube-like spring, which provides the tension. The <b>nose</b> <b>pads</b> are usually cork and are attached directly to the frames. They can either be hinged or static. This variety was popular from the 1890s to the 1930s, after which they were seldom seen. They were created and marketed as 'sporting pince-nez', which were purportedly more difficult to jar from the face than the other varieties {{as well as being}} more comfortable to wear for longer periods. A major advantage was that one size could often fit a wide variety of nose shapes and sizes. This style was usually available only as a frame, with rimless examples being very difficult to find.|$|R

5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, <b>nose</b> and paw <b>pad</b> are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the <b>nose</b> and paw <b>pads</b> to become mottled pink and black.|$|R
30|$|The hinged ends on the ELGM {{were located}} in the tail and inner corner of the eye. To meet this requirement, an eyeglass-type frame was {{designed}} to fit the facial surface. First, the facial surface was scanned with a 3 D scanner (Artec 3 D M), and the data were exported to SolidWorks. With the scanned facial surface, the tail and inner corner {{were related to the}} back of the nose where the <b>nose</b> <b>pads</b> of the frame were located, and the eyeglass-type frame was designed with SolidWorks. This frame was manufactured with a 3 D printer using Velo Clear (rigid material) and Tango Black Plus (soft material), similar to that of the ELGM. At the hinges of the frame, Tango Black Plus (soft material) was used to adjust and fix the robot on the head of the user. Owing to this precise design with the scanned facial surface and flexibility of the ELGM, the mechanism could be fixed on the eyelid without any tape or glue, and remained fixed due to friction. As a result, a very short time is required to put on or remove the robot.|$|R
5000|$|An {{animal with}} any matched or {{unmatched}} pair of the b alleles will have brown, rather than black, hair, a liver <b>nose,</b> paw <b>pads</b> and eye rims, and hazel eyes. Phaeomelanin is slightly reduced from redder to oranger tan. Only {{one of the}} alleles {{is present in the}} English Setter (bs), Doberman Pinscher (bd) and Italian Greyhound (bc), but in most breeds with any brown allele 2 or all 3 are present. It is unknown whether the different brown alleles cause specific shades or hues of brown.|$|R
50|$|Many {{types of}} skin tumors, both benign (noncancerous) and {{malignant}} (cancerous), exist. Approximately 20-40% of primary skin tumors are malignant in dogs and 50-65% are malignant in cats. Not {{all forms of}} skin cancer in cats and dogs are caused by sun exposure, but it can happen occasionally. On dogs, the <b>nose</b> and <b>pads</b> of the feet contain sensitive skin and no fur to protect from the sun. Also, cats and dogs with thin or light-colored coats are at {{a higher risk of}} sun damage over their entire bodies.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} coat colors are acceptable, {{including}} all combinations of lion-yellow, red, red-brown, and sand. <b>Nose</b> leather, foot <b>pads</b> and lips {{should always be}} black. Faulty colors include brown with brown nose leather, black and tan, black, white or silver and eyes without any brown. A small patch of white on the chest or toes is permitted.|$|R
50|$|Dogs {{also have}} sweat glands on their noses. These are eccrine glands. When these glands are active, {{they leave the}} <b>nose</b> and paw <b>pads</b> {{slightly}} moist and help these specialized skin features maintain their functional properties. The odor associated with dog paw pads is much more noticeable on dogs with moist paw pads than on those with dry pads.|$|R
5000|$|The alleles at the B locus {{are related}} to the {{production}} of tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1) and determine the degree to which an animal expresses tyrosinase, an enzyme related to the production of melanin, in its coat and skin (including the <b>nose</b> and paw <b>pads).</b> There are four known alleles that occur at the B locus: ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to altering base coat color, merle also modifies eye color and coloring on the <b>nose</b> and paw <b>pads.</b> The merle gene modifies the dark pigment in the eyes, occasionally changing dark eyes to blue, {{or part of}} the eye to be colored blue. Since merle causes random modifications, however, both dark-eyed, blue-eyed, and odd-colored eyes are possible. [...] Color on paw <b>pads</b> and <b>nose</b> may be mottled pink and black.|$|R
50|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus {{tends to}} orient its infection towards the lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues. The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract. The virus then enters the blood stream and infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, epithelial, and central nervous systems, and optic nerves. Therefore, the typical pathologic features of canine distemper include lymphoid depletion (causing immunosuppression and leading to secondary infections), interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis with demyelination, and hyperkeratosis of the <b>nose</b> and foot <b>pads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dogs only produce {{sweat on}} areas not covered with fur, {{such as the}} <b>nose</b> and paw <b>pads,</b> unlike humans who sweat almost everywhere. However, they do have sweat glands, called apocrine glands, {{associated}} with every hair follicle on their body. The exact function of these glands is not known, but they may produce pheromones or chemical signals for communication with other dogs. It is believed that these sweat secretions produce an individual odor signal that is recognizable by other dogs.|$|R
40|$|A 12 -year-old {{spayed female}} Labrador {{retriever}} {{presented to the}} Cornell small animal internal medicine service for evaluation of multifocal areas of cutaneous depigmentation. The lesions appeared primarily around mucocutaneous junctions, but also included the <b>nose,</b> paw <b>pads,</b> and anus, and were present for approximately 8 - 12 months prior to presentation. Considerable scaling was also present, although there were no areas of overt hair loss or skin infection. Biopsies of the lesions revealed epitheliotropic lymphoma. Cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma is often misdiagnosed by veterinarians due to poor recognition of the various clinical presentations of the disease. Cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma can present as a variety of lesions including: depigmentation, ulcerative stomatitis, exfoliative disease, mucocutaneous disease, and a nodular or plaque form. A poor prognosis is often given for cutaneous lymphoma, but therapeutic treatment options are available. Some of these options include chemotherapeutics such as dacarbazine (DTIC) and lomustine (CCNU) {{as well as several}} combinations including both agents. Alternative therapies such as linoleate (safflower oil), retinoids, and topical treatments are also available...|$|R
5000|$|The Shih Tzu {{comes in}} a range of colours that include various shades of gold, white, brown, and black. Other colours include black mask gold, black and white, solid black, solid liver, liver and white, brindle, white, red and white, and grey and white. Thus, when two Shih Tzu mate, there is a {{possibility}} that their offspring's coat will be similar to the sire's color, dam's color, tricolor, or a mix of both parents' color in one classification. An interesting point (and often a point of confusion) is that while the coat color of those with black pigmented skin (<b>nose,</b> lips, <b>pads,</b> also referred to as [...] "leather") is determined by the color of the coat itself; the coat color on dogs with either liver or blue pigment is categorized by the color of the pigment. Thus, a parti colored (white and another shade) Shih Tzu with blue pigment is a [...] "blue and white" [...] regardless of the tint of the hair which might very well appear similar to a gold and white or other colors. The same principle applies to solid blue, silver, and silver and white. Sometimes you might see dark brown pigments near the shoulders and between the armpits.|$|R
5000|$|The FCI has {{developed}} a detailed standard which states the eyes of juveniles may be [...] "azure" [...] but those of adults must be amber. White is permitted on the chest and feet. Lighter and darker shades of gray are permitted throughout the coat, {{even to the point}} of speckling. The FCI standard further requires a dark <b>nose,</b> eyelids, and <b>pads</b> of the feet; a scissors bite; and a moderately sloped stop of about 45°. Per the FCI standard, the tail is docked at 50% of natural length, and the dewclaws are removed. The back is straight, and the height at the withers ought to be from 62 - 68 cm for males and from 57 - 64 cm for bitches. The FCI standard also states that [...] "the ratio of length of the body to the height at the withers must be of 10:9 in the males and of 10:8 in the females." ...|$|R
40|$|Leishmaniasis {{a disease}} of {{worldwide}} occurrence is caused by protozoa of the Leishmania genus. In Brazil, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the main parasite responsible for the American cutaneous leishmaniasis. Main hosts of this protozoa are small wild mammals particularly marsupials and rodents. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate if spiny rat Proechimys guyannensis (Rodentia: Echimydae) has role in the cycle of the American cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (V.) braziliensis. Thus, promastigotes (the flagellate stage) of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis were used to inoculate seven spiny rats (Proechimys guyannensis). After inoculated intradermal at the ear pinna, <b>nose</b> and plantar <b>pad,</b> the rats were monitored for 180 days. Tissue samples collected at 90 and 180 days from the rats proved to be negative for the presence of genetic material from the parasite. After euthanasia, the protozoa also failed to growth in culture medium containing tissue samples collected from the rats showing that there was no infection. These results fail to prove that spiny rat has a role in the cycle of the American cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (V.) braziliensis...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, {{composite}} materials have gained mainstream acceptance as a structural material of choice {{due to their}} tailorability and improved thermal, specific strength/stiffiiess and durability performance 1 - 3). For high temperature applications, which include exit nozzle for rockets, leading edge for missiles, <b>nose</b> cones, brake <b>pads</b> etc. Carbon-Carbon composites (C/C composite) are found suitable 4 - 61 Mechanical property estimation of C/C composites is challenging due to their highly heterogeneous microstructure. The highly heterogeneous microstructure consists of woven C-fibers, C-matrix, irregularly shaped voids, cracks and other inclusions. Predicting the mechanical behavior of complex hierarchical materials like C/C composites is of interest which forms the motivation for the present work. A systematic study to predict the effective mechanical properties of C/C composite using numerical homogenization has been undertaken in this work. The Micro-Meso-Macro (MMM) principle of ensemble averages for estimating the effective properties of the composite has been adopted. The hierarchical length scales in C/C composites were identified as micro (single fiber with matrix), meso (fabric) and macro (laminate). Comparisons have been made with mechanical testing of C/C composites at different length scales...|$|R
