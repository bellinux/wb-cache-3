5000|$|From Diocletian onwards, {{emperors}} {{ruled in}} an openly monarchic style {{and did not}} preserve the <b>nominal</b> <b>principle</b> of a republic, but the contrast with [...] "kings" [...] was maintained: although the imperial succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary {{if there was a}} suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy, so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted. Elements of the Republican institutional framework (senate, consuls, and magistrates) were preserved until {{the very end of the}} Western Empire.|$|E
40|$|This article gives {{a precise}} {{commentary}} {{of the texts}} written by Hierocles about duties towards the country and towards parents, texts transmitted by Stobaeus, Ecloguae, 3. 39. 34 - 36 (3. 730. 17 – 734. 10 WH) and 4. 25. 53 (4. 640. 4 – 644. 15 WH). Our scope is to understand the principles of their global organisation and {{to compare it to}} the ones organizing the same sections in Epictetus and Musonius. The « Eurêsis tôn kathêkontôn » follows in Hierocles some very specific principles. Each duty has got a cosmic justification, understandable with two different interpretative models. The first model is the one of the concentric circles : the duty of the individual reason is to shape oneself while shaping its relations of affections, from the closer (the body, the family) to the more distant (humanity qua generical abstraction, or humanity as a whole). This double constitution is done when obeying to the following rule : transfering to the more distant things ￼or beings the affection we have for closer ones. A second model is here at stake : this transfer of affection and its corollary scale of duties can be explained by what I chose to call the « principle of generational transitivity ». Every single being has got duties towards what has fathered it, that is, towards each causal principle : parents, country, god. This principle of generational transitivity is completed by a <b>nominal</b> <b>principle,</b> similar to the one adopted by Epictetus : it is from the definition of the being that one can deduce the duties one will have to carry out...|$|E

The galloping inflation thus caused the end of a principle, [...] "a mark is worth a mark", which had been recognized, the <b>nominal</b> value <b>principle.</b>|$|R
60|$|We have dwelt {{on these}} {{secondary}} matters, because {{they show that}} the author hardly brings {{to the study of}} modern democracy the ripe preparation of detail which he gave to ancient law. In the larger field of his speculation, the value of his thought is seriously impaired by the absence of anything like a philosophy of society as a whole. Nobody who has studied Burke, or Comte, or Mill--I am not sure whether we should not add even De Maistre--can imagine any of them as setting to work on a general political speculation without reference to particular social conditions. They would have conducted the inquiry in strict relation to the stage at which a community happened to be, in matters lying outside of the direct scope of political government. So, before all other living thinkers, should we have expected Sir Henry Maine to do. It is obvious that systems of government, called by the same name, bearing the same superficial marks, founded and maintained on the same <b>nominal</b> <b>principles,</b> framed in the same verbal forms, may yet work with infinite diversity of operation, according to the variety of social circumstances around them. Yet it is here inferred that democracy in England must be fragile, difficult, and sundry other evil things, because out of fourteen Presidents of the Bolivian Republic thirteen have died assassinated or in exile. If England and Bolivia were at all akin in history, religion, race, industry, the fate of Bolivian Presidents would be more instructive to English Premiers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe explore an axiomatized nominal {{approach}} to variable binding in Coq, using an untyped lambda-calculus as our test case. In our nominal approach, alpha-equality of lambda terms coincides with Coq's built-in equality. Our axiomatization includes a <b>nominal</b> induction <b>principle</b> and functions for calculating free variables and substitution. These axioms are {{collected in a}} module signature and proved sound using locally nameless terms as the underlying representation. Our experience so far {{suggests that it is}} feasible to work from such axiomatized theories in Coq and that the nominal style of variable binding corresponds closely with paper proofs. We are currently working on proving the soundness of a primitive recursion combinator and developing a method of generating these axioms and their proof of soundness from a grammar describing the syntax of terms and binding...|$|R

By using two {{different}} sensing principles, a better adaption {{to the human}} sensory system can be achieved. Based on the tactile and kinesthetic parts of haptic perception, this is done using different sensing <b>principles,</b> <b>nominal</b> ranges, bandwidth and degrees of freedom for each part. The requirements of each part are described in detail and possible realizations are investigated. The proposed concept allows for {{a better quality of}} haptic feedback at lower costs...|$|R
5000|$|Through the {{enactment}} of N° 26597 in April 1996, the government took the position that physical delivery of the bonds was tantamount to effective payment. In 1996, however, the Engineers’ Bar Association asked this Tribunal to declare Law N° 26597 unconstitutional {{on the basis that}} it affected the valuation criteria and payment for expropriated lands enshrined in article 70 of the Constitution. The Engineers’ Bar Association argued that the land reform expropriations had actually been “seizures,” because landowners had received Bonds that were worth far less than the expropriated land, and that due to the “inflation process,” the value of the Bonds had been “eroded in relation to the actual value of the expropriated land.” The Constitutional Tribunal noted that Congress “denied and opposed” the Engineers’ Bar Association’s petition, arguing that “the land reform bonds are valid payment and are governed by the <b>nominal</b> payment <b>principle,</b> under which the creditor receives the exact sum of money appearing on the bond, regardless of any changes in its purchasing power.” ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} key {{syntactic}} and semantic {{aspects of a}} nominal framework allowing scopes of name bindings to be arbitrarily interleaved. Name binding (e. g. delta x. M) is handled by explicit name-creation and name-destruction brackets (e. g.) which admit interleaving. We define an appropriate notion of alpha-equivalence for such a language and study the syntactic structure required for alpha-equivalence to be a congruence. We develop denotational and categorical semantics for dynamic binding and provide a generalised <b>nominal</b> inductive reasoning <b>principle.</b> We give several standard synthetic examples of working with dynamic sequences (e. g. substitution) and we sketch out some preliminary applications to game semantics and trace semantics...|$|R
40|$|Nominal {{logic is}} a first-order theory {{of names and}} binding based on a {{primitive}} operation of swapping rather than substitution. Urban, Pitts, and Gabbay have developed a nominal unification algorithm that unifies terms up to nominal equality. However, because of <b>nominal</b> logic's equivariance <b>principle,</b> atomic formulas can be provably equivalent without being provably equal as terms, so resolution using nominal unification is sound but incomplete. For complete resolution, a more general form of unification called equivariant unification, or "unification up to a permutation" is required. Similarly, for rewrite rules expressed in nominal logic, a more general form of matching called equivariant matching is necessary. In this paper, we study {{the complexity of the}} decision problem for equivariant unification and matching. We show that these problems are NP-complete in general. However, when one of the terms is essentially first-order, equivariant and nominal unification coincide. This shows that equivariant unification can be performed efficiently in many interesting common cases: for example, anypurely first-order logic program or rewrite system can be run efficiently on nominal terms...|$|R
