5|$|Fewer than 95 deluxe {{editions of}} Agrippa are extant, {{although}} {{the exact number}} is unknown and {{is the source of}} considerable mystery. The Victoria and Albert Museum possesses a deluxe edition, numbered 4 of 10. A publicly accessible copy of the deluxe edition is available at the Rare Books Division of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Library and a small copy resides at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, while the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City hosts a promotional prospectus.

The same copy was subsequently also included in a V display entitled Digital Pioneers, from 2009–2010. Another copy of the book was exhibited in the 2003–2004 exhibition Ninety from the Nineties at the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Library. Gibson at one point claimed never to have seen a copy of the printed book, spurring speculation that no copies had actually been made. Many copies have since been documented, and Gibson's signature was noted on the copy held by the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Library. In 2011, the Bodleian Library's Special Collections Department at the University of Oxford acquired Kevin Begos' copy of Agrippa, as well as the archive of Begos' papers related to the work.|$|E

5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>public</b> schools in 1921. The ACLU, {{working with the}} NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not {{make an effort to}} defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was not fully rebuilt until 1911. A house was constructed {{at the site}} of the Springtown depot the year before it was rebuilt. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Service Commission, a regulatory agency founded in 1907, ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate. The Springtown station had no station agent or freight house. In 1925, sparks shooting off a passing train caused a fire in Springtown that burned down six buildings, causing $7,000 in damage. The prominence of the New Paltz station, as well as the growth of SUNY New Paltz in the village, caused the decline of Springtown as a community.|$|E
5|$|The hotel faced stiff {{competition}} from the early 20th century, {{with a range of}} new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), The St. Regis (1904), The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929; it was demolished soon afterwards. The Waldorf–Astoria Hotel records of 1893–1929 are held by the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Library's Archives & Manuscripts division.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Public</b> Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans were was a massive trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; in turn, the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked down {{to make room for the}} 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.|$|E
