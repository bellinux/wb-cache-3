This study aimed to ascertain whether <b>neuro-degenerative</b> <b>disease,</b> e. g., Parkinson's disease (PD) affects gait and mobility with comparison to the healthy control. Fifteen subjects (left and right foot) from both the groups are selected where the signal is obtained using force-sensitive resistors (Gait Dynamics in <b>Neuro-Degenerative</b> <b>Disease</b> Data Base). The proposed methodology is divided into five parts: (i) 1 hr recording of gait dynamics data are segmented into three intervals (0 - 20 min, 20 - 40 min and 40 - 60 min); (ii) Normalization of each segmented data (20 min), i. e., preprocessing (noise and baseline drift removal); (iii) Then the frequency domain powers for each segments are calculated which further introduced features in the successive stages for classification and clustering; (iv) The classification of Parkinson's disease and healthy control group is accomplished using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA); (v) Clustering of these two classes is performed using K-means clustering algorithm taking same sets of features. Certainly the classification and clustering results signify the classification probability using frequency domain power of gait dynamics/electromyogram signal. The re-substitution error of LDA during classification {{is found to be}} 21. 11 %.

Here we show that nanomolar concentrations of puri®ed PrPSc from mouse scrapie brain induce apoptosis of N 2 A neuroblastoma cells. PrPSc toxicity was associated with an increase of intracellular calcium released from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and up-regulation of several ER chaperones. Caspase- 12 activation was detected in cells treated with PrPSc, and cellular death was inhibited by overexpression of a catalytic mutant of caspase- 12 or an ER-targeted Bcl- 2 chimeric protein. Scrapie-infected N 2 A cells were more susceptible to ER-stress and to PrPSc toxicity than non-infected cells. In scrapie-infected mice a correlation between caspase- 12 activation and neuronal loss was observed in histological and biochemical analyses of different brain areas.
