5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{presence}} of the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted. The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{composition}} and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, <b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption. Few fisheries, though, {{have been able to}} make the switch to catching the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> since that requires a significant amount of capital resources.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{introduced}} <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), {{and water}} hyacinth, deforestation {{that led to}} water siltation, and overfishing, many Lake Victoria cichlid species have become extinct or been drastically reduced. By around 1980, lake fisheries yielded only 1% cichlids, a drastic decline from 80% in earlier years.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{it should}} not be assumed that conserving {{ecosystems}} is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> to Lake Victoria, the ecological consequence was decimation of native fauna. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the largest}} Lake Victoria group are the haplochromine cichlids, with more than 500 species, but at least 200 of these (approximately 40%) have become extinct, and many others are seriously threatened. Initially it was feared that the {{percentage}} of extinct species was even higher, but some species have been rediscovered after the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> started to decline in the 1990s. Some species have survived in nearby small satellite lakes, or in refugia among rocks or papyrus sedges (protecting them from the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch),</b> or have adapted to the human-induced changes in the lake itself. The species were often specialists and these were not affected to the same extent. For example, the piscivorous haplochromines were particularly hard hit with a high number of extinctions, while the zooplanktivorous haplochromines reached densities in 2001 that were similar to before the drastic decline, although consisting of fewer species and with some changes in their ecology.|$|E

In the 1990s, exports of 1.68 million birds, 523,000 reptiles, 12,000 mammals and 148,000 amphibians occurred, in addition to an increase in wildlife related tourism by about 30%. Fishery resources have also contributed richly to the export revenue of the country with export value of US$130 million reported in 2003, with export of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> accounting for a major share of US$100 million.|$|E
25|$|In a joint Israeli-Ugandan project, a {{professor}} from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Faculty of Agriculture {{conducted a survey}} of Lake Victoria with a Ugandan colleague from Makerere University. They found that <b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> introduced by the British sixty years ago, have decimated native fish populations, leading to malnutrition in the lakeside communities. She helped to set up artificial fish ponds to raise carp, which had disappeared from the local diet. The United States Agency for International Development sponsored the digging of the ponds and sent villagers to Kibbutz HaMa'apil in Emek Hefer to learn spawning techniques. Graduates of the training program established carp farms.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{decrease in}} the member of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, {{increase the amount of}} detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.|$|E
25|$|There are {{concerns}} about the ecological impact of introducing the wels catfish to non-native regions. These concerns {{take into account the}} situation in Lake Victoria in Africa, where <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> were introduced and rapidly caused the extinction of numerous indigenous species. This severely impacted the entire lake, destroying much of the original ecosystem. The introduction of foreign species is almost always a burden on the affected ecosystem. Following the introduction of wels catfish, some fishes' numbers are in clear and rapid decline. Since its introduction in the Mequinenza Reservoir in 1974, it has spread {{to other parts of the}} Ebro basin, including its tributaries, especially the Segre River. Some endemic species of Iberian barbels, genus Barbus in the Cyprinidae, were once abundant especially in the Ebro river but due to competition from and predation by wels catfish have since disappeared in the middle channel Ebro. The ecology of the river has also changed, as there is now a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae. Barbel species from mountain stream tributaries of the Ebro that wels catfish have not colonized are not affected.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, it was {{proposed}} to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> to improve the fisheries in the lake. At {{the same time it}} was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O. esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as [...] "thrash fish" [...] or even a vermin by the British colonial authorities. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962—63. The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstancial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954—55 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Lake Victoria {{supports}} Africa's largest inland fishery (as of 1997). Initially {{the fishery}} involved native species, especially tilapia and haplochromine cichlids, but also catfish (Bagrus, Clarias, Synodontis and silver butter catfish), elephantfish, ningu (Labeo victorianus) and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus). Some of these, including tilapia and ningu (Labeo victorianus), had already {{declined in the}} first half of the 20th century due to overfishing. To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> were introduced to the lake in the 1950s. Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent). Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives. At the peak in the early 1990s, [...] of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ecology of}} the Victoria haplochromines is {{extremely}} diverse, falling into at least 16 groups, including detritivores, zooplanktivores, insectivores, prawn-eaters, molluscivores and piscivores. As a result of predation by the introduced <b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> eutrophication and other changes to the ecosystem, {{it is estimated that}} at least 200 species (about 40 percent) of Lake Victoria haplochromines have become extinct. Initially it was feared that this number was even higher, by some estimates 65 percent of the total species, but several species that were feared extinct have been rediscovered after the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> started to decline in the 1990s. Several of the remaining species are seriously threatened and additional extinctions are possible. Some species have survived in nearby small satellite lakes, have survived in refugias among rocks or papyrus sedges (protecting them from the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch),</b> or have adapted to the human-induced changes in the lake itself. Such adaptions include a larger gill area (adaption for oxygen-poor water), changes in the feeding apparatus, changes to the eyes (giving them a better sight in turbid water) and smaller head/larger caudal peduncle (allowing faster swimming). The piscivorous (affected by both predation and competition from <b>Nile</b> <b>perch),</b> molluscivorous and insectivorous haplochromines were particularly hard hit with many extinctions. Others have become extinct in their pure form, but survive as hybrids between close relatives (especially among the detritivores). The zooplanktivores have been least affected and in the late 1990s had reaches densities similar to, or above, the densities before the drastic declines, although consisting of fewer species and often switching their diet towards macroinvertebrates. Some of the threatened Lake Victoria cichlid species have captive [...] "insurance" [...] populations in zoos, public aquaria and among private aquarists, and a few species are extinct in the wild (only survive in captivity).|$|E

2500|$|Starting in the 1950s, {{several species}} have been {{introduced}} to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids. Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (Coptodon rendalli), redbelly (C. zillii), and [...] Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus), and O. leucostictus. Although these {{have contributed to the}} extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> (Lates niloticus).|$|E
2500|$|Fishermen {{supplied}} fish to inland communities, as {{remains of}} fish, including bones and scales, {{have been discovered}} at many inland sites. To preserve them for transport, the fish were first smoked or dried and salted. Merchants also imported fish, sometimes from as far as from Egypt, where pickled roe was an export article. Remains of <b>Nile</b> <b>Perch</b> from Egypt have been found, and these must have been smoked or dried, before being imported through the trade network that connected ancient Near Eastern societies. Merchants shipped fish to Jerusalem and there was evidently a significant trade in fish; one of the gates of Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate, named for a fish market nearby ( [...] , , , , [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The Northern Lakes of Egypt are {{important}} to preserve biodiversity. From west to east the lakes in the Nile Delta are Lake Mariout south of Alexandria, Lake Edku east of Alexandria, Lake Burullus east of Rosetta and Lake Manzala between Damietta and Port Said. Another important Northern Lake is Lake Bardawil in northern Sinai that is not fed by the Nile. Several hundred thousand water birds winter in these lakes, including the world’s largest concentrations of little gulls and whiskered terns. Other birds making {{their homes in the}} delta include grey herons, Kentish plovers, shovelers and cormorants. Also found are egrets and ibises. Lake Bardawil and Lake Burullus are protected wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Despite of the flourishing fish production in Egypt, only 17 species remain as of 1995 out of 47 species in 1948. The <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> {{is one of the more}} prominent fish species in the Egyptian Nile. It is found in Lake Nasser and in Lake Mariout in the Nile Delta. [...] Other fish found in the delta include the striped mullet and soles. Other animals found in the delta include frogs, turtles, tortoises, mongooses, and the Nile monitor.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> was {{introduced}} to Lake Victoria in East Africa in the 1950s, and has since been fished commercially.
