5000|$|<b>Nitroxoline</b> and its analogues {{have also}} been shown to have antiangiogenic properties. For example, <b>nitroxoline</b> {{inhibits}} MetAP2 activity, an enzyme associated with angiogenesis, and HUVEC proliferation. [...] This is further evidence that <b>nitroxoline</b> would make an effective anticancer drug. With different derivatives of <b>nitroxoline</b> demonstrating various levels of inhibition, <b>nitroxoline</b> may also prove to be a novel starting point for future research into cancer treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chelating}} {{activities of}} <b>nitroxoline</b> {{have also been}} used in an anticancer setting. <b>Nitroxoline</b> {{has been shown to}} be more cytotoxic to HL60, DHL-4, Panc-1, and A2780 cells lines than clioquinol and other 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives. [...] It also demonstrated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu2+ was added. The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl2. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl2, indicating, based on this model, that <b>nitroxoline</b> is not a zinc chelator. Because the zinc chelating action of clioquinol has been associated with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy, the use of <b>nitroxoline</b> as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and in vivo trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitroxoline</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{that has been}} in use in Europe for about fifty years, and has proven to be very effective at combating biofilm infections. <b>Nitroxoline</b> was shown to cause a decrease in the biofilm density of P. aeruginosa infections, which would allow access to the infection by the immune system in vivo. It was shown that <b>nitroxoline</b> functions by chelating Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions from the biofilm matrix; when Fe2+ and Zn2+ were reintroduced into the system, biofilm formation was reconstituted. The activity of biofilm degradation is comparable to EDTA, but has a history of human use in clinical settings and therefore has a precedent with which to allow its use against “slimy” biofilm infections.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nitroxoline</b> {{has been}} shown to inhibit the enzymatic {{activity}} of cathepsin B. [...] Cathepsin B degrades extra-cellular membrane proteins in tumor cells, allowing them to proliferate more freely, and metastasize throughout the body. <b>Nitroxoline</b> was shown to be a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of these actions in MCF-10A neoT cells. The Ki (dissociation constant) values it demonstrates are comparable to other reversible inhibitors of cathepsin B. This indicates that it may be a candidate for further trials as an anticancer drug, especially given its history as an antimicrobial agent and its well-known pharmacokinetic profile. The mechanism of action by which <b>nitroxoline</b> inhibits cathepsin B may also suggest that further research of noncovalent, noncompetitive inhibitors of cathepsin B could be warranted. In fact, it was recently shown that a balance exists between the potency and the kinetics of a molecule, reflected in the molecular weight, which must be optimized in order to create the best drug for inhibition of a target enzyme. [...] For example, a certain inhibitor may have a high affinity for an enzyme, but it may prove impractical to use in a clinical setting for treatment because of its size.|$|E
40|$|Cathepsin B is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} lysosomal cysteine protease that {{participates in}} protein turnover within lysosomes. However, its protein and activity levels {{have been shown}} to be increased in cancer. Cathepsin B endopeptidase activity is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix,a process that promotes tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Previously, we reported an established antibiotic <b>nitroxoline</b> as a potent and selective inhibitor of cathepsin B. In the present study, we elucidated its anti-tumor properties in in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Tumor and endothelial cell lines with high levels of active cathepsin B were selected for functional analysis of <b>nitroxoline</b> in vitro. <b>Nitroxoline</b> significantly reduced extracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation by all evaluated cancer cell lines using spectrofluorimetry. <b>Nitroxoline</b> also markedly decreased tumor cell invasion monitored in real time and reduced the invasive growth of multicellular tumor spheroids, used as a 3 D in vitro model of tumor invasion. Additionally, endothelial tube formation was significantly reduced by <b>nitroxoline</b> in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Finally, <b>nitroxoline</b> significantly abrogated tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo in LPB fibrosarcoma and MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse models. Overall, our results designate <b>nitroxoline</b> as a promising drug candidate for anti-cancer treatment...|$|E

40|$|Since cations {{have been}} {{reported}} as essential regulators of biofilm, we investigated {{the potential of the}} broad-spectrum antimi-crobial and cation-chelator <b>nitroxoline</b> as an antibiofilm agent. Biofilmmass synthesis was reduced by up to 80 % at sub-MIC <b>nitroxoline</b> concentrations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and structures formed were reticulate rather than compact. In pre-formed biofilms, viable cell counts were reduced by 4 logs at therapeutic concentrations. Complexation of iron and zinc was demonstrated to underlie nitroxoline’s potent antibiofilm activity. Biofilm formation on epithelia and foreign devices poses a se-vere clinical challenge, as bacteria embedded in these struc-tures are protected from antimicrobial therapy and host immune responses (6, 8, 13). Maintenance of these complex bacterial com-munities is a dynamic process that has previously been shown to be regulated by various divalent cations, including Fe 2, Zn 2, Mg 2, and Ca 2 (3, 5, 21, 22). Currently, attempts are under way to identify therapeutically applicable compounds that would show strong chelating properties without concomitant immuno-genicity or toxicity (1, 18, 19).

40|$|<b>Nitroxoline</b> is an {{effective}} antibacterial agent that is industrially produced by chemical and pharmaceutical enterprises in Ukraine. Parameters of its toxicity are determined under conditions of acute and subchronic toxicological experiments on 3 kinds of laboratory animals, by administering the drug orally and by application onto the skin and mucous membranes. The duration of acute experiment was 14 days, subchronical - 24 days. It was found that median lethal dose (DL 50) for white female rats is 980 (852 : 1127) mg/kg, of white male rats – 835 mg/kg, white male mice– 660 mg/kg, by this parameter the drug {{can be attributed to}} 3 class of hazard – moderately hazardous substance. Average effective time of death (ET 50) for albino rats is 28 hours. Species sensitivity of laboratory animals to <b>nitroxoline</b> is slightly expressed. The death of the animals starts on the first day after the injection and is recorded during three days of the experiment. In application on intact skin, locally-irritant and skin-resorptive effects are absent.

In this context, nitr-oxoline (5 -nitro- 8 -hydroxyquinoline) (Fig. 1), an oral antibiotic, has received renewed attention {{in the management of}} UTI. Nitr-oxoline possesses activity in vitro against a variety of microorgan-isms, including E. coli and other uropathogens (4, 5). The mech-anism of action is believed to be chelation of divalent cations required for bacterial RNA polymerase, leading to bacteriostatic activity in most cases (6, 7). <b>Nitroxoline</b> has received marketing authorization for prophy-laxis and treatment of acute and recurrent UTI in various Euro-pean countries, including Germany.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of <b>nitroxoline</b> (NIT), an antibiotic {{used in the}} treatment of acute or recurrent urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, is decreased in the presence of Mg 2 + and Mn 2 + but not Ca 2 +. In order to elucidate the interaction between this drug and the divalent cations, spectrophotometric studies based on the natural absorption of the <b>nitroxoline</b> moiety were conducted. In the presence of the divalent metal ions, a shift in the NIT A 448 suggested the formation of drug-ion complexes, for which the stability followed the order Mn 2 + > Mg 2 + > Ca 2 +. A clear correlation was found between the chelating property and {{antibacterial activity}} of NIT; both were pH dependent. A convenient colorimetric method for the determination of NIT uptake by bacterial cells was also developed. Uptake was energy independent and showed biphasic kinetics: a rapid association with cells and then a slower increase in cell-associated NIT which reached a plateau. NIT uptake was reduced in the presence of magnesium. The implications of metal ion complexation and pH on the clinical efficacy of NIT are discussed...|$|E

A {{growing body of}} evidence documents its diverse functions contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. As such, discovery of agents that can target FoxM 1 would be valuable for the treatment of CCA. The quinoline-based compounds, namely clioquinol (CQ) and <b>nitroxoline</b> (NQ), represent a new class of anticancer drug. However, their efficacy and underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated in CCA. In this study, anticancer activities and inhibitory effects of CQ and NQ on FoxM 1 signaling were explored using CCA cells. Methods: The effects of CQ and NQ on cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using the colorimetric 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium (MTS assay). Colony formation and cell migration affected by CQ and NQ were investigated using a clonogenic and a wound healing assay, respectively. To demonstrate the agents’ effects on FoxM 1 signaling, expression levels of the target genes were quantitatively determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: CQ and NQ significantly inhibited cell survival of HuCCT 1 and Huh 28 in a dose- and a time-dependent fashion. Further investigations using the rapidly proliferating HuCCT 1 cells revealed significant suppression of cell proliferation and colony formation induced by low doses of the compounds. Treatment of CQ and NQ repressed expression of cyclin D 1 but enhanced expression of p 21. Most importantly, upon CQ and NQ treatment, expression of oncogenic FoxM 1 was markedly decreased concomitant with downregulation of various FoxM 1 ’s downstream targets including cdc 25 b, CENP-B, and survivin. In addition, the compounds distinctly impaired HuCCT 1 migration as well as inhibited expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and MMP- 9. Conclusion: Collectively, this study reports {{for the first time the}} anticancer effects of CQ and NQ against CCA cells, and highlights new insights into the mechanism of actions of the quinoline-based compounds to disrupt FoxM 1 signaling.

40|$|Abstract 8 -Hydroxyquinoline (8 HQ) {{compounds}} {{have been}} reported to possess diverse bioactivities. In recent years, drug repositioning has gained considerable attention in drug discovery and development. Herein, 8 HQ (1) and its derivatives (2 – 9) bearing various substituents (amino, nitro, cyano and halogen) were investigated for their antimicrobial against 27 microorganisms (agar dilution method) and antioxidant (DPPH method) activities. The parent 8 HQ (1) exerted a highly potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including diploid fungi and yeast with MIC values in the range of 3. 44 – 13. 78 μM. Moreover, the halogenated 8 HQ, especially 7 -bromo- 8 HQ (4) and clioquinol (6), displayed a high antigrowth activity against Gram-negative bacteria compared with the parent compound (1). Apparently, the derivatives with a relatively high safely index, e. g., <b>nitroxoline</b> (2), exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC= 5. 26 μM) and selectively inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa with the MIC value of 84. 14 μM; cloxyquin (3) showed a strong activity against Listseria monocytogenes and Plesiomonas shigelloides with MIC values of 5. 57 and 11. 14 μM, respectively. Most compounds displayed an antioxidant activity. Specifically, 5 -amino- 8 HQ (8) was shown to be the most potent antioxidant (IC 50 = 8. 70 μM) compared with the positive control (α-tocopherol) with IC 50 of 13. 47 μM.

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} bacterial resistance of uropathogens against standard antibiotics, such as trimethoprim (TMP), older antimicrobial drugs, such as <b>nitroxoline</b> (NTX), should be reevaluated. This randomized crossover study investigated the uri-nary concentrations of parent drugs and their metabolites and their antibacterial activities (urinary inhibitory titers [UITs] and urinary bactericidal titers [UBTs]) against uropathogens at three different urinary pH values within 24 h in six healthy volun-teers after a single oral dose of NTX at 250 mg versus TMP at 200 mg. In three additional volunteers, urinary bactericidal kinetics (UBK) were studied after oral administration of NTX at 250 mg three times a day. The mean urinary concentrations of NTX and NTX sulfate in 24 h were 0. 012 to 0. 507 mg/liter and 0. 28 to 27. 83 mg/liter, respectively. The mean urinary concentrations of TMPwere 18. 79 to 41. 59 mg/liter. The antibacterial activity of NTX was higher in acidic urine than in alkaline urine, and that of TMPwas higher in alkaline urine than in acidic urine. The UITs and UBTs of NTXwere generally {{lower than those of}} TMP ex-cept for a TMP-resistant Escherichia coli strain, for which NTX showed higher UITs/UBTs than did TMP.

40|$|Biofilms are the {{preferred}} sessile and matrix-embedded life form of most microorganisms on surfaces. In the medical field, biofilms are a frequent cause of treatment failure because they protect the bacteria from antibiotics and immune cells. Antibiotics are selected {{according to the}} minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) based on the planktonic form of bacteria. Determination of the minimal biofilm eradicating concentration (MBEC), which can be up to 1, 000 -fold greater than the MIC, is not currently conducted as routine diagnostic testing, {{primarily because of the}} methodical hurdles of available biofilm assessing protocols that are time- and cost-consuming. Comparative analysis of biofilms is also limited as most quantitative methods such as crystal violet staining are indirect and highly imprecise. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for assessing biofilm resistance to antibiotics that overcomes several of the limitations of alternative methods. This algorithm aims for a computer-based analysis of confocal microscope 3 D images of biofilms after live/dead stains providing various biofilm parameters such as numbers of viable and dead cells and their vertical distributions within the biofilm, or biofilm thickness. The performance of this algorithm was evaluated using computer-simulated 2 D and 3 D images of coccal and rodent cells varying different parameters such as cell density, shading or cell size. Finally, genuine biofilms that were untreated or treated with <b>nitroxoline</b> or colistin were analyzed and the results were compared with quantitative microbiological standard methods. This novel algorithm allows a direct, fast and reproducible analysis of biofilms after live/dead staining. It performed well in biofilms of moderate cell densities in a 2 D set-up however the 3 D analysis remains still imperfect and difficult to evaluate. Nevertheless, this is a first try to develop an easy but conclusive tool that eventually might be implemented into routine diagnostics to determine the MBEC and to improve outcomes of patients with biofilm-associated infections...|$|E
40|$|The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway {{is crucial}} to normal {{cellular}} function, and as such, has been extensively investigated as a potential target for cancer therapeutics. Many compounds have been tested for their proteasome inhibitory ability, including various small peptide aldehydes, and, following the success of cisplatin, several metal-containing complexes. The efficacy of these compounds in preclinical studies ultimately resulted {{in the development and}} approval of the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the use of which, unfortunately, has been hindered by toxicity and resistance. These limitations have led to a massive push toward designing and developing new, less toxic proteasome inhibitors for clinical use. The discovery more than twenty years ago that the heme-synthesis enzyme ä-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) possesses proteasome inhibitory activity revealed another potential approach for targeting the UPP in cancer. However, this discovery predated the initial investigation into proteasome inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, so a surprising lack of research into the relationship between ALAD and the proteasome exists. Therefore, further investigation into this relationship is necessary. Taken together, these observations validate the proteasome as a viable chemotherapeutic target. Additionally, novel agents that target not only the proteasomal core, but also other factors involved in the pathway, including E 3 s like XIAP which are also critical components of the apoptotic cascade, as well as potential endogenous inhibitors like ALAD. The data presented in this dissertation suggest a novel interaction between the 20 S proteasomal core and ALAD, which results in proteasome inhibition and tumor cell growth suppression, suggesting that targeting this relationship is a promising approach for cancer treatment. Additionally, a series of new metal-based complexes with various metal centers, including cobalt, gold, gallium and the copper chelator <b>nitroxoline</b> were shown to be potent inhibitors of the proteasome in several cancer cell lines and tumor xenograft models. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition was also revealed as a secondary mechanism of cell death for mercury-containing species. Finally, zinc chelation was explored as a strategy for inducing apoptosis via degradation of the E 3 ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). Collectively, these data confirm the potential of the UPP as an anticancer target and substantiate several factors within the pathway as viable druggable targets...|$|E
