5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for <b>non-malicious</b> reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{examinations}} of audit logs by researchers, {{it has been}} reported that some attackers may have exploited the flaw for at least five months before discovery and announcement. Errata Security pointed out that a widely used <b>non-malicious</b> program called Masscan, introduced six months before Heartbleed's disclosure, abruptly terminates the connection in the middle of handshaking in the same way as Heartbleed, generating the same server log messages, adding [...] "Two new things producing the same error messages might seem like the two are correlated, but of course, they aren't." ...|$|E
500|$|BitLocker {{and other}} full disk {{encryption}} {{systems can be}} attacked by a rogue boot manager. Once the malicious bootloader captures the secret, it can decrypt the Volume Master Key (VMK), which would then allow access to decrypt or modify any information on an encrypted hard disk. By configuring a TPM to protect the trusted boot pathway, including the BIOS and boot sector, BitLocker can mitigate this threat. (Note that some <b>non-malicious</b> changes to the boot path may cause a Platform Configuration Register check to fail, and thereby generate a false warning.) ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of multiple Fatalities (post-match animations of the victorious characters executing their defeated foes) as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves to the franchise: Babalities (turning the opponent into a crying baby), Friendships (a <b>non-malicious</b> interaction, such as dancing or giving {{a gift to the}} defeated opponent) and additional stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting his or her opponent into an abyss below, spikes in the ceiling, or a pool of acid in the background). Finishing moves cannot be performed neither by nor against the boss or secret characters.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 2009, most games {{released}} on Steam had traditional anti-piracy measures, including the assignment {{and distribution of}} product keys and support for digital rights management software tools such as SecuROM or <b>non-malicious</b> rootkits. With an update to the Steamworks SDK in March 2009, Valve added its [...] "Custom Executable Generation" [...] (CEG) approach into the Steamworks SDK that removed the need for these other measures. The CEG technology creates a unique, encrypted copy of the game's executable files for the given user which allows them to install it multiple times and on multiple devices, and make backup copies of their software. Once the software is downloaded and installed, the user must then authenticate through Steam to de-encrypt the executable files to play the game. Normally this is done while connected to the Internet following the user's credential validation, but once they have logged into Steam once, a user can instruct Steam to launch in a special offline mode {{to be able to}} play their games without a network connection. Developers are not limited to Steam's CEG and may include other forms of DRM and other authentication services than Steam; for example, some titles from publisher Ubisoft require the use of their UPlay gaming service, and prior to its shutdown in 2014, some other titles required Games for Windows– Live, though many of these titles have since transitioned to using the Steamworks CEG approach.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "false positive" [...] or [...] "false alarm" [...] is when {{antivirus}} software identifies a <b>non-malicious</b> file as malware. [...] When this happens, {{it can cause}} serious problems. For example, if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable. Recovering from such damage to critical software infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken. For example, in May 2007 a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files, leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Non-malicious</b> {{duplicate}} content {{may include}} {{variations of the}} same page, such as versions optimized for normal HTML, mobile devices, or printer-friendliness, or store items that can be shown via multiple distinct URLs. Duplicate content issues can also arise when a site is accessible under multiple subdomains, such as {{with or without the}} [...] "www." [...] or where sites fail to handle the trailing slash of URLs correctly. Another common source of <b>non-malicious</b> duplicate content is pagination, in which content and/or corresponding comments are divided into separate pages.|$|E
50|$|Session {{poisoning}} {{has been}} demonstrated in server environments where different, <b>non-malicious</b> applications (scripts) share the same session states but where usage differ, causing ambiguity and race conditions.|$|E
50|$|For <b>non-malicious</b> administration, {{the user}} must install or enable server {{software}} on the host system {{in order to}} be viewed. Then the user/client can access the host system from another computer using the installed software.|$|E
50|$|In July 2008, TheDefaced.org, a {{computer}} security group, released a <b>non-malicious</b> cross-site scripting (XSS) worm onto the Justin.tv site. After successfully propagating the virus, TheDefaced.org contacted Justin.tv programmers {{and worked with}} them to fix the vulnerability.|$|E
50|$|A {{sinkhole}} is a DNS provider {{that supplies}} systems looking for DNS information with false results, allowing an attacker to redirect {{a system to}} a potentially malicious destination. DNS sinkholes have also historically been used for <b>non-malicious</b> purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The Local Resilience Forums are {{responsible}} for assessing risks, planning responses, and recovery {{from a range of}} incidents that could {{have a major impact on}} their areas.

Nile claimed that the Homosexual Vilification Act was being abused to gag free speech and prevent open <b>non-malicious</b> public discussion.|$|E
5000|$|Microsoft's Kernel Patch Protection FAQ further explains: Because {{patching}} replaces kernel code with unknown, untested code, {{there is}} no way to assess the quality or impact of the third-party code...An examination of Online Crash Analysis (OCA) data at Microsoft shows that system crashes commonly result from both malicious and <b>non-malicious</b> software that patches the kernel.|$|E
50|$|An XSS worm, {{sometimes}} referred to as a cross site scripting virus, is a malicious (or sometimes <b>non-malicious)</b> payload, usually written in JavaScript, that breaches browser security to propagate among visitors of a website in the attempt to progressively infect other visitors. They were first mentioned in 2002 in relation to a cross site scripting vulnerability in Hotmail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-malicious</b> {{shrinkage}} {{can result}} {{from a number of}} operational failures within the business structure. The processing of returned and/or damaged stock, for example, can cause articles to be removed from inventory and discarded (which contributes directly to shrinkage) rather than sold at a discount, donated, returned to vendors for credit, or otherwise removed from inventory in a manner that minimizes financial loss.|$|E
50|$|A white hat hacker breaks {{security}} for <b>non-malicious</b> reasons, either {{to test their}} own security system, perform penetration tests or vulnerability assessments for a client - or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term is generally synonymous with ethical hacker, and the EC-Council, among others, have developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} malware may {{intentionally}} corrupt files {{as part of}} their payloads, usually by overwriting them with inoperative or garbage code, while <b>non-malicious</b> viruses may also unintentionally corrupt files when it accesses them. If a virus or trojan with this payload method manages to alter files critical to the running of the computer's operating system software or physical hardware, the entire system may be rendered unusable.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>non-malicious</b> bots {{are popular}} for their {{entertainment}} value. However, as {{technology and the}} creativity of bot-makers improves, so does the potential for Twitterbots that fill social needs. @tinycarebot is a Twitterbot that encourages followers to practice self care, and brands are increasingly using automated Twitterbots to engage with customers in interactive ways. One anti-bullying organization has created @TheNiceBot, which attempts to combat the prevalence of mean tweets by automatically tweeting kind messages.|$|E
5000|$|Faults where {{a replica}} sends {{different}} values {{in different directions}} (for instance, the correct Output to some of its fellow replicas and incorrect Outputs to others) are called Byzantine Failures. [...] Byzantine failures may be random, spurious faults, or malicious, intelligent attacks. 2F+1 replicas, with non-cryptographic hashes suffices to survive all <b>non-malicious</b> Byzantine failures (with high probability). Malicious attacks require cryptographic primitives to achieve 2F+1 (using message signatures), or non-cryptographic techniques can be applied {{but the number of}} replicas must be increased to 3F+1.|$|E

50|$|Trojan: Unlike worms, a Trojan horse always {{requires}} {{user interaction}} to be activated. This kind of virus is usually inserted into seemingly attractive and <b>non-malicious</b> executable files or applications that are downloaded to the device and {{executed by the}} user. Once activated, the malware can cause serious damage by infecting and deactivating other applications or the phone itself, rendering it paralyzed after {{a certain period of}} time or a certain number of operations. Usurpation data (spyware) synchronizes with calendars, email accounts, notes, and any other source of information before it is sent to a remote server.|$|E
50|$|The {{narrative}} style {{relies on}} Jugni landing up unexpectedly in diverse places and, wide-eyed, learning something new. Jugni makes her comments {{in three or}} four well wrought verses {{which may or may not}} rhyme but can always be sung in a rudimentary Punjabi folk style. The object could be a city, a state, a market place, a school, a religious place or a saloon, Jugni's <b>non-malicious</b> commentary catches the essence of the place and produces in the listener a chuckle and sometimes a lump in the throat. Alam Lohar is the writer or introducer of this term from reading Baba Bulleh Shahs writing, in a spiritual Sufi theme.|$|E
5000|$|This {{definition}} of space safety includes human on-board, personnel {{directly involved in}} system integration and operation, personnel not directly involved but co-located, as well as general public. For unmanned systems such as robotic satellites, damages due to <b>non-malicious</b> external causes that translates into degradation or loss of mission objectives is {{also included in the}} {{definition of}} safety. For example unwanted collision of a satellite with another satellite, or with a space debris. Fig.1 shows the various fields of space safety, their national, international or global scope of interest, and the principal means for achieving safety (by design, or operations), although a mixture would be generally used.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{thoughts}} {{that come to}} mind when one thinks of the word “nuclear”, whether it be basic chemistry or highly complex explosives; nuclear accidents, nuclear incidences or nuclear terrorism are definitely a threat to the community or the world in that matter. But what is nuclear terrorism exactly? A [...] "nuclear accident, incident, or act of terrorism is an unpredictable, unusual and unwanted event involving radiation and/or radioactive materials." [...] To specifically distinguish between the three, nuclear accidents are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. Nuclear incidents on the other hand are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally <b>non-malicious</b> and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement or wrong information.” ...|$|E
50|$|With Convergence, however, {{there was}} a level of redundancy, and no single point of failure. Several notaries could vouch for a single site. A user could choose to trust several notaries, most of which would vouch for the same sites. If the notaries {{disagreed}} on whether a site's identity was correct, the user could choose {{to go with the}} majority vote, or {{err on the side of}} caution and demand that all notaries agree, or be content with a single notary (the voting method was controlled with a setting in the browser addon). If a user chose to distrust a certain notary, a <b>non-malicious</b> site could still be trusted as long as the remaining trusted notaries trusted it; thus there was no longer a single point of failure.|$|E
5000|$|Nuclear {{incident}} are {{causes that}} include deliberate actions {{but these are}} “generally <b>non-malicious</b> and non-violent; {{may be due to}} poor judgement or wrong information.” [...] A Secondary example would be the Johnston Atoll Incident that occurred on July 25, 1962. They decided to conduct the experiment at Christmas Island on Johnson Atoll, where they set of 36 nuclear explosions. One of the missile launches went wrong as it malfunctioned when trying to launch. The leaders decided to detonate the missile before it launched. When it detonated the entire island was covered with radioactive plutonium. The witnesses claimed that 85% of the people suffered from radioactive contamination that created cancer and other radioactive related diseases. Plus those who were present {{at the site of the}} explosion suffered from infertility, and other body deformations.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a solution of this kind may be out of reach because it is algorithmically impossible in the general case to analyze any arbitrary code to determine if it is malicious, as such an analysis reduces to the halting problem over a linear bounded automaton, which is unsolvable. It is, however, unnecessary to address the general case (that is, to sort all programs into the categories of malicious or <b>non-malicious)</b> under most circumstances in order to eliminate a wide range of malicious behaviors. It suffices to recognize the safety of a limited set of programs (e.g., those that can access or modify only a given subset of machine resources) while rejecting both some safe and all unsafe programs. This does require the integrity of those safe programs to be maintained, which may prove difficult {{in the face of a}} kernel level exploit.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} content, section 2 of the Act (as it became when it {{received}} royal assent on 27 August 1881) {{introduced a new}} defence for newspaper proprietors {{in cases where the}} libel stemmed from a fair, accurate and <b>non-malicious</b> report of a publicly held meeting. This extension of qualified privilege was then [...] "amplified" [...] by the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, which in doing so repealed section 2 of the 1881 Act. Repealed at the same time was section 3 ("No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General"). The Act also benefited newspaper owners insofar as it instituted provisions (section 4, 5 and 6) for the quicker (and hence cheaper) resolution of newspaper libel cases. Contrary to expectations, however, the passage of the Act correlated with an increase, rather than decrease, in the number of defamatory libel (criminal) actions being brought against newspapers. Whether the two were causally linked is not known, however.|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} of Jim {{was based upon}} Kevin S. Tenny himself, as Tenny was a sarcastic yet <b>non-malicious</b> person. While many actors had come in for the role for Jim, the role was given to Todd Allen as Tenny found his sarcastic characteristics funny which {{was what he was}} aiming for. When Allen went into the audition, he recalled sitting in the room auditioning and {{in the corner of his}} eye, seeing Tenny with the producer of the casting director and began cracking up. Todd at first worried that he messed up for the role, but Kevin Tenny had wrote the role to be fairly close to himself, and he believed that he made him crack up because of how it reminded of the way the director acted and said things in reality. Once he got cast for the role, he got the benefit of being able to go back in with the producers and Kevin S. Tenny to read the actresses that signed up for the role of Linda. While Allen had never met Tawny Kitaen, she had read the role when he wasn't there.|$|E
