5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is <b>not</b> <b>important</b> to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are <b>not</b> <b>important</b> for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E

But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, {{foraging}} {{in trees}} {{and on the}} ground. The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, but these are <b>not</b> <b>important</b> sources of food.|$|E

5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is <b>not</b> <b>important,</b> as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E
5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was <b>not</b> <b>important</b> enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E
25|$|Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas {{atoms and}} {{molecules}} with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is <b>not</b> <b>important</b> in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also <b>not</b> <b>important</b> in diffuse ionized medium {{due to the}} low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.|$|E

25|$|Despite the bridge, the {{settlement}} of Pons Aelius was <b>not</b> <b>important</b> among the northern Roman settlements. The most important stations were those on the highway of Dere Street running from Eboracum (York) through Hadrian's Wall and to the lands north of the Wall. Corstopitum (Corbridge), being a big arsenal and supply centre, was much larger and populous than Pons Aelius.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing, known as a continuous-wave radar (CW radar), by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency. CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a target's velocity. CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure vehicle speed quickly and accurately where range is <b>not</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
