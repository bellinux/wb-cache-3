25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of a high-throughput sequencing methodology with computational methods to capture and quantify transcripts present in an RNA extract. The nucleotide sequences generated are typically around 100 bp in length, but can range from 30 bp to over 10,000 bp, depending on the sequencing method used. RNA-Seq leverages deep sampling of the transcriptome with many short fragments from a transcriptome to allow computational reconstruction of the original RNA transcript by aligning reads to a reference genome or to each other (de novo assembly). The typical dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude for RNA-Seq is a key advantage over microarray transcriptomes. In addition, input RNA amounts are much lower for RNA-Seq (<b>nanogram</b> quantity) compared to microarrays (microgram quantity), which allowed finer examination of cellular structures, down to the single-cell level when combined with linear amplification of cDNA. Theoretically, there is no upper limit of quantification in RNA-Seq, and background signal is very low for 100 bp reads in non-repetitive regions.|$|E

The samples were taken when the shoots had elongated about 30, 70, and 95 % of the final shoot length and 17 days after elongation had terminated. The concentration of putative GA 9 -conjugate, estimated by GCSIM of GA 9 after cellulase hydrolysis of the highly water soluble fraction, was 33 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in the needles of both heat and drought- and cool and wet-treated plants sampled just after bud burst. The concentration gradually decreased to a final value of 13 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in the heat and drought-treated grafts and 6 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in the cool and wet-treated grafts. The stems contained no detectable putative GA 9 conjugate. Free GA 9 was highest in heat and drought-treated material. For plants subjected to this treatment, GA 9 increased from 22 to 32 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in needles and from 1 to 22 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in stems during the rapid stem elongation phase. By day 17, after cessation of shoot elongation, GA 9 had decreased to 12 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in needles and 9 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in the shoot stems. The cool and wet-treated material also showed an increase in GA 9 concentration during shoot elongation. However, the concentration was not as high and was also delayed compared with heat and drought-treated material. By day 17, after cessation of shoot elongation, GA 9 concentration was 9 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in needles and 5 <b>nanograms</b> per gram fresh weight in stems for cool and wet treatment plants. The concentration of GA 4 was very low in tissue from both treatments. Fluctuation in concentration of the more polar gibberellins, GA 1 and GA 3, showed the same pattern as fluctuations {{in the content of}} GA 9. However, the heat and drought-treated material had lower amounts of GA 1 and GA 3 during the later phases of shoot elongation, than the cool and wet-treated material. These results imply differential metabolism between clones treated with conditions inductive and noninductive for flowering. Higher concentrations of putative GA 9 conjugate and free GA 9 in the hot and dry treatment indicate a higher capacity of synthesizing, for flowering, the physiologically important GA 4 in the heat and drought-treated material. This synthesis does not, however, result in a buildup of the GA 4 pool, probably because of a high turnover rate of GA 4. The cool and wet-treated material had higher amounts of GA 1 and GA 3, indicating that the differentiation was preferentially directed toward vegetative growth...|$|R
