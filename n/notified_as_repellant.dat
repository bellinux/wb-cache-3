40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the “diagnosis changed ” rate in patients <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> tuberculosis (TB) on the Korean TB surveillance system (KTBS). Methods: A total of 1, 273 patients <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> TB cases on the KTBS in one private tertiary hospital in 2011 {{were enrolled in the}} present study. Patients were classified into three groups: “diagnosis maintained”, “diagnosis changed ” (initially <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> TB, but ultimately diagnosed as non-TB), and “administrative error ” (<b>notified</b> <b>as</b> TB due to administrative errors). Results: Excluding 17 patients in the “administrative error ” group, the “diagnosis maintained ” and “diagnosis changed” groups included 1, 097 (87. 3 %) and 159 patients (12. 7 %), respectively. Common causes of “diagnosis changed ” were nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease (51. 7 %, 61 / 118), and pneumonia (17. 8 %) in cases <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> pulmonary TB, and meningitis (19. 5 %, 8 / 41) and Crohn’s disease (12. 2 %) in cases <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> extrapulmonary TB. Being older than 35 years of age (odds ratio [OR], 2. 18) and a positive acid-fast bacilli stain (OR, 1. 58) were positive predictors and a TB-related radiological finding (OR, 0. 42) was a negative predictor for a “diagnosis changed ” result via multivariate logistic regression analysis in pulmonary TB cases. Conclusion: Because of a high “diagnosis changed ” rate in TB notifications to the KTBS, the TB incidence rate measured by the KTBS may be overestimated. Considering the worldwide trend toward increased NTM disease, the “diagnosis changed ” rate may increase over time. Thus, when reporting the annual TB notification rate in Korea, the exclusion o...|$|R
