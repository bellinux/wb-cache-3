5|$|Corals' {{many colors}} give it appeal for <b>necklaces</b> and other jewelry. Intensely red coral is prized as a gemstone. Sometimes called fire coral, {{it is not}} the same as fire coral. Red coral is very rare because of overharvesting.|$|E
5|$|From 28 February onwards the Spanish {{expedition}} {{was repeatedly}} approached by hostile Itzas, who sometimes shot arrows {{in the direction}} of the intruders but inflicted no casualties. At the same time, small groups of curious Itzas mingled freely with the Spanish and received trinkets from them such as belts, <b>necklaces</b> and earrings.|$|E
50|$|A k-ary bracelet, also {{referred}} to as a turnover (or free) <b>necklace,</b> is a <b>necklace</b> such that strings may also be equivalent under reflection. That is, given two strings, if each is the reverse of the other then they belong to the same equivalence class. For this reason, a <b>necklace</b> might also be called a fixed <b>necklace</b> to distinguish it from a turnover <b>necklace.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Necklace</b> of the Stars is {{a famous}} diamond <b>necklace.</b> It was {{commissioned}} by Queen Maria Pia of Savoy, the Consort of King Luís I.

5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass <b>necklaces</b> that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides <b>necklaces</b> made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>necklaces</b> {{features}} lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. <b>Necklaces</b> of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with <b>necklaces,</b> earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry. Their many-folded dresses were {{fastened}} by a brooch at one shoulder. Their headdresses {{also featured}} a veil which was draped backwards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA knotted <b>necklace</b> {{of pearls}} is a <b>necklace</b> whose string forms a nontrivial knot. We {{assume that all}} pearls are balls of the same size, and any two {{consecutive}} pearls in a knotted <b>necklace</b> are tangent to each other. How many pearls are necessary to make a knotted <b>necklace,</b> say a trefoil knot? We show that 15 pearls are sufficient, and that to make a knotted <b>necklace</b> which can {{be put in the}} shallowest-possible show-case (a box with a glass-lid), 16 pearls are necessary and sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Based on finite-difference-time domain methods (FDTD), we have numerically {{directly}} {{investigated the}} dynamical effects of <b>necklace</b> {{states on the}} transmission for one-dimensional (I D) random systems with pulsed incidence in time domain. The <b>necklace</b> state propagation property, which is faster than the common localized modes, is demonstrated directly. From the instantaneous decay coefficient kappa(t) and the instantaneous transmittance spectrum T(tau, omega), we have constructed a dynamical picture for the random systems with <b>necklace</b> states. In the picture, we have explained the high plateau on the kappa(t) curves by the properties of <b>necklace</b> states, and then defined the time range of high plateau as the "effective time range" of <b>necklace</b> states effects. Further more, we have confirmed the dynamical picture by the ensemble study of random configurations. For the different length, we show {{that the effects of}} <b>necklace</b> states will be stronger if the system is longer. Besides these, we also introduce the instantaneous decay coefficient and the instantaneous transmittance spectrum to study the dynamical effects of <b>necklace</b> states. This theoretical study of <b>necklace</b> states can be helpful not only for the deeper physical understanding of <b>necklace</b> states, but also for the experimental observation of <b>necklace</b> states.

5|$|For some Native American tribes, dragonflies {{represent}} swiftness and activity; for the Navajo, they symbolize pure water. They are {{a common}} motif in Zuni pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in Hopi rock art and on Pueblo <b>necklaces.</b> They {{have been used in}} traditional medicine in Japan and China. In Indonesia, adults are caught on poles made sticky with birdlime, then fried in oil as a delicacy.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} <b>necklace</b> was the <b>necklace</b> seen {{throughout the}} film. This <b>necklace</b> {{has a large}} London-blue stone cut into a trillion/cleftless heart surrounded by white round cut cubic zirconias set in white gold. The chain is composed of a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white cubic zirconias. The bail on this <b>necklace</b> was a heart cut white cubic zirconia attached to a white round cut stone which {{was attached to the}} cage on the main stone. The <b>necklace</b> is owned today by a private collector, and is currently being lent to James Cameron to display next to props from his other films.

5|$|The Crown Jewels {{are only}} worn at coronations (StEdward's Crown {{being used to}} crown the monarch) and the annual State Opening of Parliament (the Imperial State Crown). At other formal occasions, such as banquets, the Queen wears the {{jewellery}} in her collection. Elizabeth owns more than 300 items of jewellery, including 98 brooches, 46 <b>necklaces,</b> 37 bracelets, 34 pairs of earrings, 15 rings, 14 watches and 5 pendants, the most notable of which are detailed in this article.|$|E
5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} little {{to suggest that}} culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south {{during this period of}} improved climatic conditions. Some finds nonetheless indicate the presence of relatively large and well-organised hunter-gatherer societies. No Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered in Scotland to date. Substantial finds at the village of Dunragit were announced in 2014 including arrowheads, urns and bead <b>necklaces</b> from the Mesolithic. Initial press reports provided no firm dates for these artefacts.|$|E
5|$|All the {{jewellery}} in the hoard is gold, and all gold {{items in}} the hoard, other than coins, are jewellery. None of the jewellery is unequivocally masculine, although several pieces, like the rings, might have been worn by either gender. There is one body chain, six <b>necklaces,</b> three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold jewellery is about , and the average metal content of the jewellery pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 carat), with small proportions in the metal of silver and copper.|$|E

Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and <b>necklaces,</b> with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions. Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received {{a reputation for being}} casual, practical and lacklustre. However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.|$|E
