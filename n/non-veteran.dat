40|$|INTRODUCTION: Little {{is known}} about {{hysterectomy}} and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), which are associated with both health risks and benefits, among women Veterans. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To compare the prevalence of hysterectomy with or without BSO, and early hysterectomy, between postmenopausal Veterans and <b>non-Veterans.</b> DESIGN AND METHODS: We used baseline data from the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative Clinical Trial and Observational Study. Multinomial logistic regression models examined differences in the prevalence of hysterectomy (neither hysterectomy nor BSO, hysterectomy without BSO, and hysterectomy with BSO) between Veterans and <b>non-Veterans.</b> Generalized linear models {{were used to determine}} whether early hysterectomy (before age 40) differed between Veterans and <b>non-Veterans.</b> Analyses were stratified by birth cohort (3 ̆c 65, 3 ̆e /= 65 years at enrollment).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} {{is the first to}} use nationally {{representative}} data to compare rates of food insecurity among households with veterans of the US Armed Forces and <b>non-veteran</b> households. DESIGN: We used data from the 2005 - 2013 waves of the Current Population Survey - Food Security Supplement to identify rates of food insecurity and very low food security in veteran and <b>non-veteran</b> households. We estimated the odds and probability of food insecurity in veteran and <b>non-veteran</b> households in uncontrolled and controlled models. We replicated these results after separating veteran households by their most recent period of service. We weighted models to create nationally representative estimates. SETTING: Nationally representative data from the 2005 - 2013 waves of the Current Population Survey - Food Security Supplement. SUBJECTS: US households (n 388 680). RESULTS: Uncontrolled models found much lower rates of food insecurity (8 · 4 %) and very low food security (3 · 3 %) among veteran households than in <b>non-veteran</b> households (14 · 4 % and 5 · 4 %, respectively), with particularly low rates among households with older veterans. After adjustment, average rates of food insecurity and very low food security were not significantly different for veteran households. However, the probability of food insecurity was significantly higher among some recent veterans and significantly lower for those who served during the Vietnam War. CONCLUSIONS: Although adjusting eliminated many differences between veteran and <b>non-veteran</b> households, veterans who served from 1975 and onwards may be at higher risk for food insecurity and should be the recipients of targeted outreach to improve nutritional outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{military}} service on the social status attainment of World War II veterans has been studied since the 1950 s; however, the research has failed to come to any consensus {{with regard to the}} level of their attainment. Analyses have generally focused on cross-sectional data or longitudinal data without considering the effects {{of military service}} over the life course. In this study I argue that World War II veterans had greater social attainment over their lifetimes; that black World War II veterans attained more than white World War II veterans relative to their <b>non-veteran</b> peers; that veterans who served in the latter years of the World War II mobilization attained more than those who served in the earlier years; and that veterans born in cohorts with large proportions of veterans attained more than veterans born to cohorts with smaller proportions of veterans. Social status is measured in terms of education, income, and Duncan Socio-Economic Index. In order to test these hypotheses I use data from the 1950 through 2000 Public Use Microdata Sample. Military service clearly afforded veterans significant advantages through their early and middle working years; however, their <b>non-veteran</b> peers eventually did catch up. Black veterans attained more social status than their non veteran peers throughout their lives. Furthermore, the magnitude of the difference in social status attainment is greater for black veterans relative to their <b>non-veteran</b> peers than the difference for white-veterans relative to their <b>non-veteran</b> peers until very late in the life course. Additionally, peak mobilization phase veterans receive advantage although it is relatively short lived...|$|E

40|$|Background: Oral {{health care}} {{provision}} for aged-care facility residents remains problematic worldwide, with both institutional and professional barriers preventing regular provision of this service. Purpose: To identify factors affecting the oral {{health status of}} elderly war veterans which {{are different from those}} reported for <b>non-veteran</b> aged-care facility residents. Methods and Materials: A small pilot study of 30 aged-care facility residents was performed at a dedicated rest home and hospital for war veterans in Dunedin, New Zealand. The study included data collection and a clinically-based head, neck and oral examination for each of the participating residents to establish a base-line. Oral health data were then integrated with the general medical notes and recommendations for each resident were given in terms of oral health maintenance with appropriate referrals for treatment needs. A literature review was performed using web-based on-line search engines to compare the oral health needs of these veterans with other <b>non-veteran</b> aged-care facility residents. Results: The oral health status and needs of elderly war veterans are no different to other aged-care facility residents in terms of oral hygiene needs, edentulism, dental caries and periodontal disease. Common medical conditions and medications affect both veteran and <b>non-veteran</b> aged-care facility residents in a similar manner. However, poor oral health status was strongly associated with significant mental illness which may be more prevalent in a veteran population and include depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse. Conclusion: The oral health care needs of a veteran population do not differ greatly from the needs of other <b>non-veteran</b> aged-care facility residents but greater consideration should be given during assessment for possible service-related oral conditions and mental illness issues including PTSD and alcohol abuse.

40|$|Objective: To examine {{employment}} patterns from 2005 to 2008 among homeless veterans with co-occurring {{mental health}} and substance use disorders relative to national trends in veteran and <b>non-veteran</b> populations. Methods: Unemployment rates for homeless veterans (N = 328) with co-occurring disorders were compared to national veteran and <b>non-veteran</b> unemployment rates using Current Population Survey data. Results: From 2005 to 2008, unemployment among the homeless veteran sample with co-occurring disorders increased from 47 % to 66 %. While unemployment decreased for Current Population Survey comparison groups from 2006 to 2007, homeless veterans with co-occurring disorders experienced a 35. 62 % increase in unemployment. Conclusions: Homeless veterans with co-occurring disorders were disproportionately affected by the 2007 recession. This increase in unemployment, relative to comparison group data, indicates {{the need for more}} comprehensive and integrated vocational supports aimed at obtaining competitive employment upon program discharge. Future research should monitor the impact of economic fluctuations on placement and employment sustainability for homeless veterans with co-occurring disorders...|$|E

We compared the peripheral vascular function of veterans and <b>non-veterans</b> with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and claudication. The circulation of the lower extremities was assessed under rest and reactive hyperemia conditions in 413 veterans and in 83 <b>non-veterans.</b> Veterans had more severe PAD as measured by a lower ankle/ brachial index (p< 0. 001). Following the occlusive test, veterans had a greater relative percentage decrease in ankle systolic blood pressure (p= 0. 015), a greater percentage decrease in calf transcutaneous oxygen tension (p= 0. 035), and a blunted percentage increase in calf blood flow (p= 0. 031). After adjustment for current smoking status, these measures were no longer statistically different between the veterans and <b>non-veterans.</b> We conclude that veterans with PAD and claudication have greater impairments in macrovascular and microvascular function of the lower extremities, and greater severity of PAD than compared to <b>non-veterans,</b> and that these factors were primarily associated with their higher prevalence of smoking. The greater compromise in peripheral vascular measures in veterans is particularly noteworthy given that the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were no...|$|R
