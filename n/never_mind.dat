5|$|The Sex Pistols were an English {{punk rock}} band formed in London in 1975. Although they {{initially}} lasted just {{two and a}} half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they have been called one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk and alternative rock musicians.|$|E
5|$|The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, {{the soundtrack}} album for the still-uncompleted film, was {{released}} by Virgin Records on 24 February 1979. It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the Sex Pistols: There are the new recordings with vocals by Jones, Vicious, Cook, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as Edward Tudor-Pole, briefly considered as a permanent replacement for Rotten. McLaren himself takes the mic {{for a couple of}} numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album is completed by a couple of tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols classics. Four Top Ten singles were culled from the Swindle recordings, one more than had appeared on <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Bollocks.|$|E

25|$|Tunstall {{has also}} a been a {{panelist}} on the BBC Two comedy music show <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Buzzcocks, first on series 21 episode 8 (2008), and on series 24 episode 10 (2012).|$|E
25|$|The overall style {{employing}} {{a mix of}} music and comedy {{is similar to the}} British show <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Buzzcocks and fellow Australian TV show RocKwiz, but the question formats and show style (Satirical vs. Family vs. Pub Quiz) are different.|$|E

25|$|The {{dream of}} {{bringing}} back the glory era to City, set out by Shinawatra just a year before, now seemed doomed, but {{what was about to}} unravel was something Hughes and the Manchester City supporters could probably never have even imagined, <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> anticipated – as within the coming months Hughes would find himself placed in a financial position which would become the envy of many a football manager and one which would hopefully change the course of Manchester City's inconsistent history for good.|$|E

25|$|Continuing {{the theme}} of the retro Elvis Presley-inspired London Calling LP cover, the single sleeve (front and back) is based on old Columbia 78rpm sleeves. The cover artwork was {{designed}} by Ray Lowry and is identical to the Columbia sleeve with the exception of changing the blank 78 covers that the young teenage cover models are listening to classic Rock and Punk LP sleeves. From left to right they are, The Beatles' debut Please Please Me, <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, The Rolling Stones debut, The Clash debut, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited and finally the Elvis Presley debut LP.|$|E
25|$|I {{afterwards}} travelled {{much with}} him, and have now only {{to speak of}} him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... <b>Never</b> <b>mind</b> his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
25|$|TalkBack became {{particularly}} {{well known for}} its comedy output, which included such shows as The Day Today (BBC Two, 1994), Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (BBC Two, 1994), They Think It's All Over (BBC One, 19952006), <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Buzzcocks (BBC Two, 19962015), I'm Alan Partridge (BBC Two, 1997 and 2002), Smack the Pony (Channel 4, 19992003) and Da Ali G Show (Channel 4, 2000). Fincham served as executive producer on many of these programmes. He also helped to establish TalkBack as a noted producer in other genres, with the company moving into drama with Stephen Poliakoff's Shooting the Past (BBC Two) in 1999. In 2001, Fincham was given an Indie Award for outstanding contribution to the independent production sector.|$|E

60|$|But Uncle John <b>never</b> <b>minded.</b> He was {{not even}} as meek and humble as usual, but laughed and chatted with the freedom of a boy just out of school, which made Patsy think the new clothes had {{improved}} him {{in more ways than}} one.|$|R
25|$|That same year, Roth {{published}} his first young adult novel, <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Goldbergs, through Scholastic's PUSH imprint. While {{the book was}} written in six months, it took two years to edit, and Roth encountered difficulty finding a publisher for the book due to its unusual tone and subject matter. Upon release, the book garnered mixed reception but received the American Library Association Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults award and the New York Public Library Best Book for the Teen Age award. A release party was held on January 20, 2005 at La Tazza 108 in Philadelphia with musical performances by Juez and E.D. Sedgwick. Roth subsequently published two more young adult novels, Candy in Action in 2007 and Losers in 2008, on PUSH and Soft Skull Press, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, {{when you look at the}} fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit a far cry from the 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E

60|$|On {{the whole}} {{he got on}} well enough with the girls. They thought him a little queer; but his club-foot seemed to excuse his not being like the rest, and they found in due course that he was good-natured.

500|$|Although the Sex Pistols {{were not}} the first punk band, the few {{recordings}} that were released during the band's brief initial existence were singularly catalytic expressions of the punk movement. The releases of [...] "Anarchy in the U.K.", [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Bollocks are counted {{among the most important}} events in the history of popular music. <b>Never</b> <b>Mind</b> the Bollocks is regularly cited in accountings of all-time great albums: In 2006, it was voted No.28 in Q magazine's [...] "100 Greatest Albums Ever", while Rolling Stone listed it at No.2 in its 1987 [...] "Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years". It has come to be recognised as among the most influential records in rock history. An AllMusic critique describes it as [...] "one of the greatest, most inspiring rock records of all time".|$|E
500|$|Hugh Montgomery of Q {{magazine}} {{noted that}} the singer's [...] "imaginative reach" [...] was [...] "complemented by a winning pop savviness", while Luke O'Neil from The Phoenix stated that [...] "he likes of Kate Nash and company have flitted through this piano siren/exuberant dance-diva territory, but <b>never</b> <b>mind,</b> because this gorgeous genre starts now." [...] Leonie Cooper from NME rated the album {{nine out of ten}} stars, finding flaw only in the titles of [...] "Shampain" [...] and [...] "Hermit the Frog".|$|E
