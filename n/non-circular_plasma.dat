A number of improvements to the design {{are now part of}} the [...] "advanced tokamak" [...] concept, which includes <b>non-circular</b> <b>plasma,</b> internal diverters and limiters, often superconducting magnets, and operate in the so-called [...] "H-mode" [...] island of increased stability. Two other designs have also become fairly well studied; the compact tokamak is wired with the magnets {{on the inside of the}} vacuum chamber, while the spherical tokamak reduces its cross section as much as possible.|$|E
5000|$|DIII-D {{was built}} {{on the basis of the}} earlier Doublet III, the third in a series of {{machines}} built at GA to experiment with tokamaks with <b>non-circular</b> <b>plasma</b> cross sections. This work demonstrated that certain shapes strongly suppressed a variety of instabilities in the plasma, which led to much higher performance. DIII-D is so-named because the plasma is shaped like the letter D, a shaping that is now widely used on modern designs, and has led to the class of machines known as [...] "advanced tokamaks". Advanced tokamaks are characterized by operation at high plasma Î² through strong plasma shaping, active control of various plasma instabilities, and achievement of current and pressure profiles that produce high performance.|$|E
40|$|This lecture {{treats the}} {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) equilibrium of axisymmetric plasmas, {{as given by}} the Grad-Shafranov equation. In a brief introduction, equilibrium parameters such as the q-profile, the internal inductance, and the poloidal beta are introduced. The properties of these quantities will be illustrated {{in the case of}} the tokamak, by applying the large aspect ratio tokamak approximation. The properties of a <b>non-circular</b> <b>plasma</b> cross-section and the role of the vertical field will also be discussed in this approximation. Some attention is given to the (numerical) problem of solving the equilibrium equation and of reconstructing a plasma equilibrium from external measurements. The numerical methods themselves are presented in [1]...|$|E
40|$|The {{toroidal}} {{machine has}} been designed appropriate to do the experiments leading to the breakthrough in researches of plasma turbulence and turbulent transport. The proposed new device can realize high accessibility and flexibility for performing physics experiments, particularly for realizing super multiple computer tomography (SMCT) that is the major diagnostics newly developed in this proposal. The diagnostics can observe wide range of different scales of fluctuations and cover the whole plasma cross-section. The proposal of this new device with the ambitious diagnostics is based on quite different concept that includes Japanese original ideas. Among toroidal machines tokamak will be appropriate for the experiment. The following machine parameters might be required as a rough target to obtain the plasma parameter required for diagnostics: the magnetic field strength of about 1 Tesla, the plasma major and minor radii of about 1 m and 30 cm, respectively, and the plasma current of about 150 kA. The top priority in designing the machine is put on versatility and flexibility of ports to enable detailed measurements of plasma parameters. Characteristic {{point is that the}} machine is equipped with diagnostics ports on the high field side. The shape of the toroidal field coil is not circular but D-shape-like to produce <b>non-circular</b> <b>plasmas,</b> which allows {{for the study of the}} influence of magnetic geometries and the realization of high plasma performance. There are two ways to energize the coils in a quasi-steady state: one is to use flywheel, motor-generator and thyristor stacks, and the other one is to use condenser banks. Here the priority is put on the condenser bank. Arbitrary waveforms of the coil current can be obtained by using IGBT as a switching element, of which characteristics are of higher frequency (several to 10 kHz) than that of thyristors with rectification of about 1 kHz. The high frequency characteristics result in low voltage ripple on the coil because high frequency noises are relatively easily removed with filters. Low level of noises will be essentially important for detailed measurements of fluctuations...|$|R

Predictive simulations of EAST reversed shear configuration are carried out using the 1. 5 D equilibrim evolve codes. The reversed shear plasmas are sustained by off-axis LHCD profiles.

Based on these simulations, a novel control scheme was proposed and tested for control of the safety factor profile which is very useful in real time profile control in tokamak experiments...|$|R
40|$|A {{centrifugal}} injector {{was used}} to inject deuterium pellets (with 3 [...] 5 x 10 {sup 19 } atoms) at approx. equal 600 m/s into current-less, nearly shear-less plasmas in the Wendelstein 7 -AS (W 7 -AS) stellarator. The D pellet was injected horizontally at a location where the <b>non-circular</b> and non-axisymmetric <b>plasma</b> cross section is nearly triangular. Visible-light TV pictures usually showed the pellet as a single ablating mass in the plasma, although the pellet occasionally broke in two or splintered into a cloud of small particles. The density evolution following pellet injection {{and the effect of}} pellet injection on energy confinement and fluctuations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} Experimental Plan for the DIII-D tokamak facility {{for the fiscal}} year 1989. The long-range DIII-D 5 yr plan is directed ultimately at the goal of achieving good confinement at high beta in a plasma with non-inductively driven current. This is important to the design of a steady-state reactor. This program may be thought of as occurring in two phases. In {{the first phase of the}} program we axe separately investigating high beta plasma confinement in inductively-driven plasmas, and non-inductive current drive. In the second phase we will combine these two elements to investigate high beta plasma confinement with non-inductive current drive. The FY 89 plan continues the first phase of the DIII-D experimental effort that contains a strong focus on beta and confinement in <b>non-circular</b> <b>plasma</b> configurations and in the divertor configuration in particular. Important work also continues in the development of rf heating systems for heating, profile control, and current drive. This research is coupled to theoretical efforts at General Atomics. The FY 89 research program outlined herein is diverse and multifaceted. However, it is also characterized by a greater synthesis of techniques toward a common goal. An example is the application of ECH for sawtooth suppression that would improve the low q confinement and allow higher {beta} to be obtained. We believe this research program will provide a solid foundation for the continued development of the tokamak toward high beta steady-state reactor application. The DIII-D FY 89 research program will provide results that will help resolve many CIT and ITER Physics R&D issues. In addition, DIII-D confinement studies will be an important input to the newly formed National Transport Task Force...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of current}} studies {{aimed at the}} {{development}} of low activity blankets for Tokamak experimental power reactors are presented. First wall loadings {{in the range of}} 0. 5 to 1. 0 MW(th) /m$sup 2 $ have been assumed. Blanket designs are developed for both circular plasma reactors (R = 6. 25 m, a = 2. 1 m) and <b>non-circular</b> <b>plasma</b> reactors (R = 4. 0 m, a = 1. 0 m, b = 3. 0 m). For each of these two reactor choices, two blanket options are described. 1) In the first option, the blanket is thick graphite block structure (approximately 50 cm thickness) with SAP coolant tubes carrying helium imbedded deep within the graphite to minimize radiation damage. The neutron and gamma energy deposited in the graphite is radiated along internal slots to the coolant tubes where approximately 80 percent of the fusion energy is carried off by He at 380 $sup 0 $C. The remaining 20 percent of the fusion energy is removed by a separate He stream at a slightly lower temperature. The maximum graphite surface temperature is relatively low (approximately 1700 $sup 0 $C at 1 MW(th) /m 2). 2) In the second blanket option, the blanket is composed of aluminum modules. The aluminum shell (5000 series alloy) is maintained at a low temperature (approximately 200 $sup 0 $C) by a water coolant stream. Approximately 40 percent of the fusion energy is removed in this circuit. The remaining 60 percent of the fusion energy is deposited in a thermally insulated hot interior (SiC and B$sub 4 $C) where it is transferred to a separate He coolant, with exit temperature of 700 $sup 0 $C.

40|$|ASDEX Upgrade {{tries to}} match the {{physical}} requirements of a poloidal field divertor to technical reactor needs. The plasma configuration fits present day reactor concepts (INTOR, ITER) on smaller scale. The aims of the AUG include two technical problems: Control of the <b>non-circular</b> bulk <b>plasma</b> configuration {{and control of the}} plasma boundary or divertor configuration respectively. For these purposes an exact measurement and adjustment of magnetic fields is required. Axial symmetry can be assumed for all plasma equilibria with a toroidal field component B_#phi# and two poloidal field components B_r and B_z. The measurements of field components in a vertical plane containing the axis are sufficient. Axissymmetry may be destroyed by eddy currents in metallic structure and stable or unstable plasma disturbances. Their investigations require measurements also in planes of different toroidal angles. Mode analysis of plasma disturbances can be detected by a selected numbers of signals on a poloidal circumference and on a toroidal circumference. With this so called Mirnov mode analysis, a determination of the poloidal mode number 1 <m< 20 and toroidal mode number n< 3 is possible. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract: EAST Superconducting Tokamak is a <b>non-circular</b> {{advanced}} steady-state <b>plasma</b> experimental device, {{which will}} be build at ASIPP in next year. Tokamak plasmas with highly elongated cross sections are subject to a vertical displacement event (VDE). For long duration steady state operation of EAST, {{it would be very}} crucial to maintain the plasma radial and vertical positions accurately. For designing the position controller in EAST we have adopted 1. 5 D equilibrim evolve control model. While the vertical position instability is slowed down by a set of passive stabilizers placed closed to the plasma edge, a pair of in- vessel active feedback coils can adequately control vertical position perturbations of up to 2 cm. The parameters of both vertical and radial position control coils and their power supplies are determined based on the simulations. 1...|$|R
