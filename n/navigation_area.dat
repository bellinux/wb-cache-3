50|$|The {{location}} of banner {{has been shown}} to have important effect on the user seeing the ad. Users generally go through a web page from top left to bottom right. So that suggests, having ads in this path will make them more noticeable. Ads are primarily located in the top or right of the page. Since viewers ignore ads when it falls into their peripheral vision, the right side will be ignored more. Banner ads just below the <b>navigation</b> <b>area</b> on the top will get more fixations. Especially when viewers are involved a specific task, they might attend to ads on the top, as they perceive the top page as containing content.

The village is well protected from wind and water behind large sand dunes and green dikes.

There are shops, artisans, art galleries, cafés and restaurants and of course Sønderho Kro, one of the oldest guesthouses in Denmark, from 1722. Nearby in Nordby there was an artist colony from same time as Skagen. This is reflected most clearly at the Fanø Art Museum, which is located in the village.|$|E

If a certain {{area of the}} ship is damaged by an enemy attack, the player can still access the screen, but {{all or part of}} the {{functions}} of that screen may be unresponsive. For example, if any of the weapons are damaged, they may not fire at all, or they may still fire but may not be able to be properly aimed. Damage to the <b>navigation</b> <b>area</b> causes the ship to sail uncontrollably in random headings. As battles progress, repairs—over which the player has no control—may restore functions. Some weapons have certain limitations that if reached could cause damage as well; anti-aircraft guns, for example, can overheat if fired continuously for too long, rendering them inoperable until they cool down. If the ship was to sustain too much damage in the course of a mission (or in certain other circumstances, such as running aground on an island), the ship was deemed sunk and the mission was a failure. Players also had the option of sending an [...] "abandon ship" [...] message, but in terms of gameplay, the result was the same as a sunken ship.|$|E

5000|$|Until 1880 Houston had {{a smaller}} Jewish {{population}} than Galveston Island, then the cultural {{center of the}} state. In 1844, a plot of land in Houston had been purchased for a Jewish cemetery. In 1850, the Jewish community in Houston had 17 adults and in 1854, the Orthodox Beth Israel Congregation opened in a former house that had been converted to a synagogue. By 1860 the number of Jewish adults grew to 68, and that year there were 40 Jewish children. In the 19th Century the Jewish population moved into the First and Second wards and later settled in the Third Ward.

40|$|The {{development}} of an <b>area</b> <b>navigation</b> program and the implementation of this software on a microcomputer-based Loran-C receiver to provide high-quality, practical <b>area</b> <b>navigation</b> information for general aviation are described. This software provides range and bearing angle to a selected waypoint, cross-track error, course deviation indication (CDI), ground speed, and {{estimated time of arrival}} at the waypoint. The range/bearing calculation, using an elliptical Earth model, provides very good accuracy; the error does not exceed more than -. 012 nm (range) or 0. 09 degree (bearing) for a maximum range to 530 nm. The alpha-beta filtering is applied {{in order to reduce the}} random noise on Loran-C raw data and in the ground speed calculation.

40|$|Objectives. The {{movement}} {{of a ship}} in shallow water at both constant and variable depths of a <b>navigation</b> <b>area</b> is considered in  the article. With {{the deterioration of the}} navigation conditions, the  ship's handling is reduced; this is explained in terms of the influence  of disturbing factors, among which shallow water has the strongest  impact. Based on the analysis of existing mathematical models of  ship movement in deep and shallow water – and taking into account  their shortcomings – the task is to develop a mathematical model of  ship movement in shallow water at a constant and variable navigation area depth, as well as its implementation in software. Methods. One way to improve the accuracy of a manoeuvre is to  obtain a mathematical model, taking into account the analytical  dependencies of the shallow water effect on the hydrodynamic  coefficients on the hydrodynamic equations of the ship, defined {{as a function of the}} ratio of the ship draft to the depth of the water area. Results.   Mathematical models of ship movement in shallow water at variable navigation depths, which differ from the existing ones, are developed: the coefficients of variable hydrodynamic equations are not constant values, but variables obtained by approximating the shallow water impact curves onto hydrodynamic coefficients in the form of third-order polynomials. Conclusions. The developed mathematical models and their implementation present a number of advantages, which consist in the conducted studies contribution to the development of a new approach in modelling ship movements in shallow water when operating at variable <b>navigation</b> <b>area</b> depths, as well as when simulating ship movements in shallow waters at variable <b>navigation</b> <b>area</b> depth according to a given curvilinear trajectory.  The software implementation of mathematical models and algorithms for ship movement in shallow waters with variable depth of the <b>navigation</b> <b>area</b> can be used for further studies on the dynamic characteristics of ships in shallow waters having variable depths, as well as for the analysis and assessment of skipper-induced accidents in maritime transport. </p...|$|E
