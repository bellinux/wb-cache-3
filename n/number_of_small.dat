The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow {{was the only one}} which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Following Alexander's {{death in}} 323 BC, Anatolia was {{subsequently}} divided into a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> Hellenistic kingdoms, {{all of which}} {{became part of the}} Roman Republic by the mid-1st century BC. The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander's conquest accelerated under Roman rule, and by the early centuries of the Christian Era, the local Anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct, being largely replaced by ancient Greek language and culture. From the 1st century BC up to the 3rd century CE, large parts of modern-day Turkey were contested between the Romans and neighbouring Parthians through the frequent Roman-Parthian Wars.|$|E

Too small and slow for the post-war environment, Unrivalled was scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{unsuccessful}} conference in Persia, Tiribazus returned to Susa to report on events, and a new general, Struthas, was sent out to take command. Struthas pursued an anti-Spartan policy, prompting the Spartans to order their commander in the region, Thibron, to attack him. Thibron successfully ravaged Persian territory for a time, but was killed along with a number of his men when Struthas ambushed one of his poorly organized raiding parties. Thibron was later replaced by Diphridas, who raided more successfully, securing a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> successes and even capturing Struthas's son-in-law, but never achieved any dramatic results.|$|E
