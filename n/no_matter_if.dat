They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated that one reason for Wilfrid's exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert.|$|E

It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way.

A month later, the SCB chairman voiced his belief that the North Carolinas and South Dakotas would be excellent additions to task forces—if they could be faster. The Bureau of Ships then considered and discarded designs that would move these ships at , four knots faster than their current attainable speed. In order for a North Carolina to obtain 31knots, [...] would be required. This, in turn, would necessitate the installation of an extremely large power plant, one which would not fit into the ship even if the third turret was removed.

500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary, Tim Long and Ron Hauge. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween,1999. [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf.

[...] Lukwiya silenced the nurses, most of whom he had trained himself, by stating that if the hospital closed he would leave Gulu and never return.
