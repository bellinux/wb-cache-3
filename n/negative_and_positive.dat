He {{goes on to say that}} the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} SSTBoost, a predictive classification methodology {{designed to}} target the accuracy of a modified boosting algorithm towards required sensitivity and specificity constraints. The SSTBoost method is demonstrated in practice for the automated med- ical diagnosis of cancer {{on a set of}} skin lesions (42 melanomas and 110 naevi) described by geometric and colorimetric features. A cost-sensitive variant of the AriaBoost algorithm is combined with a procedure for the automatic selection of optimal cost parameters. Within each boost- ing step, different weights are considered for errors on false <b>negatives</b> <b>and</b> false <b>positives,</b> <b>and</b> differently updated for <b>negatives</b> <b>and</b> <b>positives...</b>|$|R

Intervention was based on Ainsworth's sensitive responsiveness components, namely perceiving a signal, interpreting it correctly, selecting an appropriate response and implementing the response effectively.|$|E

25|$|Non-Euclidean {{geometry}} considers spaces where Euclid's parallel postulate fails. Saccheri first studied such geometries in 1733 but sought only {{to disprove}} them. Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevsky independently discovered them 100 years later. Their research uncovered {{two types of}} spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space; these gave rise to hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to Riemannian manifolds with constant <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> curvature, respectively.|$|E

Zero plus a positive number is the positive number and negative number plus zero is a negative number etc. The Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as {{was done by the}} Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.|$|E
25|$|Early test {{screenings}} for {{the film}} did not go well; Lynch estimated that 80 people {{walked out of the}} first test screening and 100 in the next. At the time of its release, the film received mixed critical reviews and was a moderate success at the US box office, grossing USD$14 million, above its $10 million budget. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, at which it received both <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> attention from its audience. Diane Ladd was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. It has since received some positive re-evaluation from critics.|$|E
25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe) {{systems are}} usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense {{structures in the}} soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions {{about the condition of}} the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive).</b> CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.|$|E

25|$|Human's {{attention}} on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. <b>Negative</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> words are better recalled than neutral {{words that are}} spoken. Many different ways that {{attention is focused on}} hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter's voice in a sad, content, frustrated sound or in the use of words that are close to the hear. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} {{in the theory of}} marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal private and social costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their profit maximization goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but also any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> externalities, of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.|$|E
25|$|The term magic {{comes from}} the Old Persian magu, a word that applied {{to a form of}} {{religious}} functionary about which little is known. During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, this term was adopted into Ancient Greek, where it was used with negative connotations, to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional, and dangerous. This meaning of the term was then adopted by Latin in the first century BCE. The concept was then incorporated into Christian theology during the first century CE, where magic was associated with demons and thus defined against religion. This concept was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, although in the early modern period Italian humanists reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to establish the idea of natural magic. Both <b>negative</b> <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> understandings of the term were retained in Western culture over the following centuries, with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word.|$|E
