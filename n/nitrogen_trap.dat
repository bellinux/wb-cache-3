During the operation, nitrogen oxides are stored on the surfaces of lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>traps,</b> and regeneration of lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>traps</b> is required for proper operation. In this paper, two in-cylinder combustion strategies for regeneration of lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>traps</b> were assessed for a high-speed direct-injection diesel engine. In particular, a delayed and extended main strategy and a premixed compression ignition strategy were studied through experiments and simulations. The experimental {{data were collected from}} a 1. 5 l diesel engine to analyze its combustion, exhaust temperature, fuel consumption, and emission characteristics resulting from either the delayed and extended main strategy or the premixed compression ignition strategy. The results indicated that the premixed compression ignition strategy offered a better fuel economy and lower soot and nitrogen oxide emissions, while the delayed and extended main strategy offered a hotter exhaust temperature and higher production rates of reductant species. In addition, a one-dimensional numerical lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>trap</b> model was designed and validated to study the efficiency of the surface adsorbents on lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>traps</b> for each of these two strategies in terms of a reduction in the nitrogen oxide emissions. The simulation results revealed that both strategies can reach a lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>trap</b> efficiency rate of 100 % when the exhaust gas recirculation rate was equal to 30 % but that the lean <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>trap</b> efficiency rate drops when lower exhaust gas recirculation rates were applied.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of a wetsuit, the suit is {{designed}} to minimise heat loss. Wetsuits are usually made of foamed neoprene that has small closed bubbles, generally containing <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>trapped</b> in it during the manufacturing process. The poor thermal conductivity of this expanded cell neoprene means that wetsuits reduce loss of body heat by conduction to the surrounding water. The neoprene, and to a larger extent the nitrogen gas, function as an insulator. The effectiveness of the insulation is reduced when the suit is compressed due to depth, as the nitrogen filled bubbles are then smaller and the compressed gas conducts heat better. The second way in which wetsuits can reduce heat loss is to trap the water which leaks into the suit. Body heat then heats the trapped water, and provided the suit is reasonably well-sealed at all openings (neck, wrists, ankles, zippers and overlaps with other suit components), this water remains inside the suit and is not replaced by more cold water, which would also take up body heat, and this helps reduce the rate of heat loss.
