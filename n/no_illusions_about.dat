500|$|At {{his meeting}} with Mulgrave, Cochrane was asked to explain a plan of attack on Basque Roads which he had drawn up some years previously. Cochrane enthusiastically {{described}} his intention to use fireships and massive floating bombs to destroy a fleet anchored in the roads. When he had finished, Mulgrave announced that the plan was going ahead and that Cochrane was to command it. Cochrane was in poor health, and under <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> Mulgrave's intentions: should the attack fail Cochrane would be blamed and his political career damaged. In addition, Cochrane was also {{well aware of the}} fury this decision would provoke in the naval hierarchy; the appointment of a relatively junior officer in command of such an important operation was calculated to cause offense. Cochrane refused, even though Mulgrave pleaded that he had been the only officer to present a practical plan for attacking Allemand's fleet. Again Cochrane refused the command, but the following day Mulgrave issued a direct order: [...] "My Lord you must go. The board cannot listen to further refusal or delay.

[...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and I wish he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me."

500|$|I Corps assumed {{responsibility}} for the front in Cyrenaica on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent on the expedition to Greece. Blamey has been criticised for allowing this when {{he knew it was}} extremely hazardous, after he was told that Menzies had approved. He insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won. He was under <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> the odds of success, and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation. His foresight and determination saved many of his men, but he lost credibility when he chose his son Tom to fill the one remaining seat on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece. The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army's training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the Libyan Campaign. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier William Bridgeford were extremely critical of Blamey's performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held. Wavell reported that [...] "Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{moved on}} {{longtime}} scientific research mission to Italy, {{at the turn}} of the decades Tejada was getting increasingly detached from daily Carlist politics. Within the Secretariat and numerous cultural outposts he was also getting dominated by a new breed of young activists forming the entourage of prince Carlos Hugo. Though he knew some, especially their leader Ramón Massó, from the Academia Vázquez de Mella years of the 1940s, Tejada developed grave doubts about Carlist orthodoxy and genuine intentions of the hugocarlistas, suspecting them of pursuing a hidden agenda. Co-operation deteriorated into crisis and then open conflict in the early 1960s, when Don Carlos Hugo started to sidetrack most hard-line Traditionalists. Unlike Valiente and other older militants harboring <b>no</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>about</b> Don Javier potentially confronting his progressist son, in July 1962 Tejada decided to break with the Borbón-Parmas, though some authors claim that he was expulsed. He declared to Don Carlos Hugo that he could not make him king, but could prevent him from becoming one. In 1963 Tejada already referred to Don Carlos Hugo as [...] "este aventurero francés de sangre bastarda".|$|R

[...] H. L. Mencken in 1925 deemed Borah [...] "the Great Sham", and the one most responsible for stopping reform in its tracks. Harold L. Ickes wrote, most likely after the 1928 campaign, that progressives in the Senate, with <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> left <b>about</b> Borah, called him [...] "our spearless leader".

500|$|The {{campaign}} turned personal {{during the}} second of two debates between the two candidates when McConnell charged that the Iroquois Hunt Club, to which Beshear belonged, had no African-American members and was racially discriminatory. Beshear denied that the club was discriminatory and fired back that a prominent McConnell supporter from Louisville was [...] "virulently anti-women." [...] McConnell countered that Beshear had taken money from a labor union group that was under investigation for links to organized crime. After the debate, {{it was revealed that}} the Pendennis Club, of which McConnell had been a member, was under investigation for discriminatory membership practices; McConnell claimed he had resigned his membership in the club after perceiving that it practiced discrimination, but did not express his reasons for resigning to the club's membership or leadership. Ultimately, none of Beshear's arguments gained much traction, and he lost the race by a 724,794 votes (55.5%) to 560,012 (42.9%). At the time, it was the largest victory margin of McConnell's career. In a 2009 biography of McConnell, author John David Dyche wrote that Beshear [...] "had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> his chance of success , but {{for the sake of his}} party, and hoping to ride the coattails of President Clinton's likely re-election, he got in the race."

500|$|The [...] "national legions" [...] were {{attached}} to the Waffen-SS, and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943. Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland, authorised by Hitler {{at the end of}} 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the Freikorps Danemark, Legion Niederlande and Legion Norwegen, supplemented by transfers from SS-Division Wiking, new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion Flandern was broken up and used as replacements in a number of Waffen-SS formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the [...] "national legion" [...] recruits were motivated by [...] "political or ideological idealism", but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the [...] "anti-communist" [...] cause out of idealism. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the Waffen-SS. However, by mid-1942 onwards, the Waffen-SS faced increasing difficulties with these [...] "Germanic" [...] recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into [...] "pan-Germanic" [...] formations such as SS-Division Wiking. For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.|$|E

His tide had ebbed, not flowed; if he had “forgiven” Acton Hague, that {{forgiveness}} was a motive with a broken spring. The very fact of her appeal for a material sign, a sign that should make her dead lover equal there with the others, presented the concession to her friend as too handsome for the case. He had never thought of himself as hard, but an exorbitant article might easily render him so. He moved round and round this one, but only in widening circles—the more he looked at it the less acceptable it seemed. At the same time he had <b>no</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>about</b> the effect of his refusal; he perfectly saw how it would make for a rupture. He left her alone a week, but when at last he again called this conviction was cruelly confirmed. In the interval he had kept away from the church, and he needed no fresh assurance from her to know she hadn’t entered it. The change was complete enough: it had broken up her life. Indeed it had broken up his, for all the fires of his shrine seemed to him suddenly to have been quenched. A great indifference fell upon him, the weight of which was in itself a pain; and he never knew what his devotion had been for him till in that shock it ceased like a dropped watch. Neither did he know with how large a confidence he had counted on the final service that had now failed: the mortal deception was that in this abandonment the whole future gave way.|$|R

It is one of the masterpieces of novelistic literature of the 18th century, which explores the amorous intrigues of the aristocracy. It has inspired a large number of critical and analytic commentaries, plays, and films.|$|E

The American generals Eisenhower and Marshall, for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir John Dill, and Joseph Stalin. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy.

He returned to Sydney and continued to write for the Bulletin which, in 1892, paid for an inland trip where he experienced the harsh realities of drought-affected New South Wales. He also worked as a roustabout in the woolshed at Toorale Station. This resulted in his contributions to the Bulletin Debate and became a source for many of his stories in subsequent years.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the experience to}} date with the implementation and application of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), some ten years after its entry into force. One striking observation is the smooth functioning of the Agreement, which has created far less tensions and frictions, including at Ministerial Meetings, than its difficult negotiating history might have suggested. This is {{due in large part}} to a high degree of flexibility at several levels: Members have more scope than under the GATT to depart from common horizontal obligations, in particular the MFN principle; they are able to adjust the breadth and depth of their trade commitments (market access and national treatment) to particular sector conditions; and they face less constraints, if any, in the use of trade-related policies such as subsidies, export restrictions, or domestic regulatory interventions. An additional source of flexibility is the uncertainty still surrounding a few core concepts of the Agreement and their sometimes daring application in individual schedules. While the ongoing negotiations also provide an opportunity for technical corrections of scheduling problems, the basic (built-in) flexibility elements of the Agreement - including the bottom-up approach of undertaking sector commitments and the possibility of inscribing limitations under individual modes - will, of course, persist. (Their actual relevance may, nevertheless, differ significantly between 'old' Members and countries negotiating their accession to the WTO.) Given the broad reach of of the Agreement in terms of membership, sector application, and modal coverage, flexibility may be considered a conditio sine qua non. There is little reason to believe that a more rigid structure would have been acceptable to Uruguay Round participants and, even if so, that it would have proven stable and resilient over time. However, flexibility may come at a cost: lack of meaningful obligations across a reasonably broad range of service sectors. Vested interests may find it far easier than under the GATT to defend their privileges and defy more rational and harmonized trading conditions. While the paper discusses formula-based approaches that have been proposed to improve the quantity and/or quality of sector commitments within the existing framework of GATS, there should be <b>no</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>about</b> the scope for technical solutions to what constitutes a political and institutional challenge...|$|R
2500|$|The IRA {{under its}} new Chief of Staff, Stephen Hayes, now {{regarded}} Ryan as its [...] "representative" [...] in Germany. Ryan felt that, through circumstances beyond his control, {{he was the}} only European representative of the IRA. However, [...] "he had <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> his old friends or his new friends". In a coded letter that was smuggled to Gerald O'Reilly, a member of Clan na Gael in the Bronx, New York, in May 1941, the writer (which O'Reilly understood was Ryan) explained the situation: despite their differences over the previous six years, he had been happy to meet Sean Russell; before his death, Russell had entrusted him with important papers that should be returned to the IRA; that he had a [...] "free hand and was fully trusted"; that success (for the IRA) would depend on the left wing of the IRA working with the leadership, and that if this happened the IRA would emerge stronger after the war. A few weeks later O'Reilly was arrested by the FBI (they were looking for Sean Russell, who had skipped bail) who obtained the letter. They said they were aware of Ryan's [...] "anti-Fascist credentials" [...] and although due to his contacts and knowledge of languages would be useful to [...] "the enemy" [...] (the US was not yet in the war), they did not yet believe he would work for Fascism.

Lloyd George [...] "read [...] all night", and mentioned it to Churchill, who wrote in 1928 that it held [...] "a permanent place in war literature", and described it as [...] "one of those cries of pain wrung from the fighting troops ... like the poems of Siegfried Sassoon [...] should be read in each generation, so {{that men and women}} may rest under <b>no</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>about</b> what war means". H. A. L.

Other reviews described it as [...] "the best book published about life in the trenches" [...] (New Statesman) and [...] "one of the most interesting and moving English war books" [...] (Athenæum). However, it was not a commercial success. The war was not the most popular of themes among the reading public in 1919, and the book saw only limited sales; it was not reissued for another five years, with a second edition appearing in January 1924. Assisted by Herbert's growing popularity as a writer, it gained in popularity during the war novel boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s – five editions between 1928 and 1936 – but never reached the fame that many of its supporters feel it deserved.

Executing the rapprochement policy he did not believe in its success and was getting increasingly frustrated by Franco’s rejection of the Carlist offer. However, he readily engaged in new formats of activity, now permitted by the regime: Tejada was active in the Carlist publishing house Ediciones Montejurra and became its director, animated the elitist Traditionalist periodical Reconquista, contributed to new periodicals like Azada y Asta and especially threw himself into organizing Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella, a semi-official Carlist institutional network.

Their deep but practical interest in the Indians found expression in scores of books, which fall roughly into three groups.

Such are Mary Rowlandson's The Sovereignty and Goodness of God and John Williams's The Redeemed Captive, both famous in their day, and still of lively interest. In the third group are the fighting stories, such as John Mason's History of the Pequot War. The adventures and hairbreadth escapes recorded as sober facts in these narratives were an excellent substitute for fiction during the Colonial period. Moreover, they furnished a motive and method for the Indian tales and Wild West stories which have since appeared as the sands of the sea for multitude.|$|R
