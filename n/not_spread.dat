5|$|The nor'easter struck {{about two}} months after the {{destructive}} Perfect Storm, and preceded another damaging storm in December 1992. The storm produced strong winds and high surf during a new moon, which resulted in astronomically high tides. Such tides caused coastal flooding and damage to dune systems. Due to its small size, the storm's impact was highly localized and did <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> far {{to the north of the}} Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did <b>not</b> <b>spread.</b> The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor.

5|$|Ectomycorrhizal, Amanita muscaria forms {{symbiotic}} {{relationships with}} many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, A.muscaria is the fungal {{equivalent of a}} weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under silver birch (Betula pendula) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal.|$|E

Nos 12 and 13 Groups in the Midlands and north of Britain, with {{a third of the}} serviceable fighters between them, put up 129 (or only 15 per cent) of the day sorties, and of these only three made contact with the enemy. No. 11 Group put up one-third of the serviceable fighters in 600 sorties, or {{more than two-thirds of the}} total; on average. Each of the serviceable Spitfires and Hurricanes flew 1.7 operational sorties. No. 43 squadron flew the most sorties: 63 operations including five each from the 13 serviceable at the beginning of the day.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living sapwood, though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> as it would have done on dead wood. Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing white rot. However, the species had little effect on the cambium, and was mostly limited to the ends of branches.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E

5|$|The {{sight of}} the burning wrecks in the night once again spread panic {{throughout}} the French fleet, the grounded ships opening a heavy fire on the scuttled ships in the assumption that they were fireships. Captain Lacaille of Tourville was so unnerved that he immediately ordered his crew to abandon ship {{and set it on}} fire. The evacuation was so hasty however that the fires did <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> effectively, and the following morning the ship was found to still be intact, the crew returning to their prematurely abandoned vessel. There they found that the ship's quartermaster Eugéne-Joseph-Romain Bourgeois had remained aboard, unconvinced by Lacaille's order, and had single-handedly driven off an attempt by a British boat to board and capture the ship. During the night about 30 sailors had joined him, keeping Touville in French hands until dawn came {{and the rest of the}} crew returned.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E
5|$|The Maltese {{position}} {{had already}} been severely weakened by {{the large number of}} Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused en masse to take up arms against Bonaparte. The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources. On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards Crete. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean. To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did <b>not</b> <b>spread</b> ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria. On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible, which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers. From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse, joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore, sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.|$|E
