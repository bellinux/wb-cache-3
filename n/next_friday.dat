5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The <b>next</b> <b>Friday</b> night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason has again been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he ruptures the tank and freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The <b>next</b> <b>Friday</b> the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>Friday,</b> 23 August, {{thousands}} of Arab villagers streamed into Jerusalem {{from the surrounding}} countryside to pray on the Temple Mount, many armed with sticks and knives. Harry Luke requested reinforcements from Amman. Towards 09:30 Jewish storekeepers began closing shop and at 11:00, 20–30 gunshots were heard on the Temple Mount, apparently to work up the crowd. Luke telephoned the Mufti to come and calm a mob that had gathered under his window near the Damascus Gate, but the commissioner's impression was that the religious leader's presence was having the opposite effect. By midday friction had spread to the Jewish neighborhood of Mea She'arim where two or three Arabs were killed. The American consulate documented the event in detail, reported that the killings had taken place between 12:00 and 12:30. The Shaw report described the excited Arab crowds {{and that it was}} clear beyond all doubt that at 12:50 large sections of these crowds were bent on mischief if not on murder. At 13:15, the Arabs began a massacre of the Jews.|$|E

Stewie comes to collect, but Brian laughs him off and tells him he will have the money in 24 hours. After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian {{says he does not}} have it and to give him until <b>next</b> <b>Friday.</b> Stewie reveals that he is serious about {{settling}} the bet and, on two occasions, brutally beats up Brian (using such means as a golf club, shooting him in both knees with a pistol, and a flamethrower) to coerce him into paying up. Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's bet is satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one [...] "free revenge shot" [...] to make up for all the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian. After biding his time and making Stewie worry about what could happen, Brian—while the Griffins are in London, leaving the Patriots-Silly Nannies game—nonchalantly shoves Stewie in front of a moving bus.|$|E

She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy says in a talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing the shabby clothing and making himself smell of alcohol {{in order to make}} everyone believe that he is doing poorly. [...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the <b>next</b> <b>Friday.</b> Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, puts his arm around Andy and says to the office, [...] "It's been a great year." ...|$|E

2500|$|You scold {{me so much}} in {{the nice}} long letter which I have this moment {{received}} from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after <b>next</b> <b>Friday,</b> on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which he did when he was wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Anguish {{over the}} death of his son of scarlet fever in September 1860 pushed Huxley to the brink, from which Kingsley rescued him by a series of letters. Huxley put his fury {{over the death}} into {{composing}} a paper which violently assaulted Owen's ideas and professional reputation. It was published in January 1861 in the first issue of Huxley's relaunched Natural History Review magazine, and presented citations, quotations and letters from leading anatomists to attack Owen's three claims, aiming to prove him [...] "guilty of wilful and deliberate falsehood" [...] by citing Owen himself, and (with less clear cut justification) the anatomists whose illustrations Owen had used in the 1857 paper. While readily agreeing that the human brain differed from that of apes in size, proportions and complexity of convolutions, Huxley played the significance of these features down, and argued that to a lesser extent these also differed between the [...] "highest" [...] and [...] "lowest" [...] human races. Darwin congratulated Huxley on this [...] "smasher" [...] against the [...] "canting humbug" [...] Owen. From February to May Huxley delivered a very popular series of sixpenny lectures for working men at the School of Mines where he taught, on [...] "The Relation of Man to the Rest of the Animal Kingdom".
