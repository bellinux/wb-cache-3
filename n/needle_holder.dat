5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a <b>needle</b> <b>holder</b> or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E

When the needle is screwed into the {{translucent}} plastic <b>needle</b> <b>holder,</b> the rubber needle is inside the holder, and the exposed needle will be inserted into the vein. When a Vacutainer tube is inserted into the holder, its rubber cap is punctured by the inner needle and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess whether}} {{the use of}} needle {{guidance}} devices can reduce fluoroscopy time and operator hand dose during cone-beam computed tomography-guided needle interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The freehand technique was compared with techniques employing two distinct <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> and a ceiling-mounted laser guidance technique. Laser guidance was used either alone or in combination with <b>needle</b> <b>holders.</b> Four interventional radiologists were instructed to reach predetermined targets in an abdominal phantom using these techniques. Each operator used all six techniques three times. Fluoroscopy time, procedure time, operator hand dose, and needle tip deviation were obtained for all simulated needle interventions. All data are presented as median (ranges). RESULTS: All procedures were successfully completed within 2 - 4 minutes, resulting in a deviation from target of 0. 8 mm (0 - 4. 7). In freehand procedures, the fluoroscopy time to reach the target was 50 seconds (31 - 98 s). Laser guidance, used alone or in combination with <b>needle</b> <b>holders,</b> reduced fluoroscopy time to 31 seconds (14 - 68 s) (P<. 02). The operator hand dose in freehand procedures was 275 μSv (20 - 603 μSv). Laser guidance alone or in combination with <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> resulted in a reduction of the hand dose to< 36 μSv (5 - 82 μSv) per procedure (P<. 001). There were no statistically significant effects on hand dose levels or fluoroscopy time when the <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> were employed alone. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the freehand technique, all three tested needle guidance devices performed with equivalent efficiency in terms of accuracy and procedure time. Only the addition of laser guidance was found to reduce both fluoroscopy time and operator hand dose...|$|R

30|$|Discussion: Ambidexterity during {{laparoscopic surgery}} {{facilitates}} quick effective suturing of the myoma bed using two <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> and standard suture material. The multi-layered continuous closure suturing technique achieves excellent haemostasis and minimizes blood loss. It minimizes adhesion formation avoiding {{exposure of the}} suture within the pelvis.|$|R
30|$|The SUTT {{model has}} been {{developed}} to train and test more complex and fine LPS like needle manipulation, intracorporeal knotting, cutting and tissue approximation using both dominant and non-dominant hands. These exercises are performed in a pelvic trainer with a 0 ° 10 -mm optic and two <b>needle</b> <b>holders.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in two identical stations fitted with a Telepack (monitor, camera, and light source), 10  mm 0 º optic, 5  mm Kelly forceps, 5  mm Koh <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> with right and left curvature, and a Szabo trainer box (Karl Storz, Tutlingen, Germany). The working stations were mounted with the materials required for the relevant laparoscopic tasks.|$|R

30|$|Concept: We made a webcam based {{laparoscopy}} simulator costing £ 15.00. Compared {{to other}} simulators {{available in the}} market, it is cheaper, {{can be used on}} a home computer and is quick and easy to set up. If cheap instruments such as graspers, <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> and scissors are developed solely for the purpose of dry lab training, then the cost of training will be much reduced.|$|R

50|$|The {{parts of}} a simple <b>needle</b> <b>holder</b> are the jaws, the joint and the handles. Most needle holders also have a clamp {{mechanism}} that locks the needle in place, allowing the user to maneuver the needle through various tissues.

30|$|Upon exerting {{exterior}} {{pressure on}} both sutures at the suprapubic level, the bladder remained immobile and {{fixed to the}} abdominal wall. After this procedure had been carried out, we introduced one 5 -mm trocar for viewing and three 3 -mm trocars for mini-laparoscopy (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). A rigid 30 ° scope (Karl Storz) was introduced for an intravesical view. All instruments that were introduced through the trocars were 3  mm in diameter (scissors, clamps, <b>needle</b> <b>holders,</b> and bipolar coagulation forceps) (Karl Storz).|$|R
50|$|A {{hemostat}} (also {{called a}} hemostatic clamp, arterial forceps, or pean after Jules-Émile Péan) is a surgical tool {{used in many}} surgical procedures to control bleeding. For this reason, it is common in the initial phases of surgery for initial incision to be lined with hemostats which close blood vessels awaiting ligation. Hemostats belong {{to a group of}} instruments that pivot (similar to scissors, and including <b>needle</b> <b>holders,</b> tissue holders and various clamps) where the structure of the tip determines the function.|$|R
30|$|We {{developed}} {{a tool for}} training in laparoscopic knots without the {{need to use a}} rigid box, camera, TV-monitor or expensive software. It consists of two wooden boards on a fixed angle, two metal hooks and a metal ring to simulate the trocar. Along {{with the use of a}} knot pusher they can be used for training in extracorporeal knots. For practicing intracorporeal knots two of these devices are used in conjunction, along with laparoscopic <b>needle</b> <b>holders.</b> We demonstrate its assembly and use in video.|$|R
50|$|Locking forceps, {{sometimes}} called clamps, {{are used to}} grasp and hold objects or tissue. When {{they are used to}} compress an artery to forestall bleeding they are called hemostats. Another form of locking forceps is the <b>needle</b> <b>holder,</b> used to guide a suturing needle through tissue. Many locking forceps use finger loops to facilitate handling (see illustration, below, of Kelly Forceps). The finger loops are usually grasped by the thumb and middle or ring fingers, while the index finger helps guide the instrument.|$|E

50|$|Autoclaves {{are found}} in many medical settings, laboratories, and other places that need to ensure the {{sterility}} of an object. Many procedures today employ single-use items rather than sterilizable, reusable items. This first happened with hypodermic needles, but today many surgical instruments (such as forceps, <b>needle</b> <b>holders,</b> and scalpel handles) are commonly single-use rather than reusable items (see waste autoclave). Autoclaves are of particular importance in poorer countries due to the much greater amount of equipment that is re-used.

40|$|Introduction: The {{challenges}} in laparoscopic suturing include need to expertise to suture. Laparoscopic <b>needle</b> <b>holder</b> is a” key” instrument {{to accomplish this}} arduous task. Instrument: The objective of this new invention {{was to develop a}} laparoscopic <b>needle</b> <b>holder</b> which would be adapted to avoid any wobble (with a shaft diameter same as a 5 mm port), ensure accurate and dexterous suturing not just in adult patients but pediatric patients alike (with a short shaft diameter) and finally ensure seamless throw of knots with a narrow tip configuration. Validation: We did an initial evaluation to evaluate the validity of the prototype <b>needle</b> <b>holder</b> and its impact on laparoscopic suturing skills by experienced laparoscopic surgeons and novice laparoscopic Surgeons. Both the groups of surgeons performed two tasks. The first task was to grasp the needle and position it in an angle deemed ideal for suturing. The second task was to pass suture through two fixed points and make a single square knot. At the end of the tasks each participant was asked to complete a 5 - point Likert's scale questionnaire (8 items; 4 items of handling and 4 items of suturing) rating each <b>needle</b> <b>holder.</b> In expert group, the mean time to complete task 1 was shorter with prototype 3 / 5 laparoscopic <b>needle</b> <b>holder</b> (11. 8 sec Vs 20. 8 sec).

40|$|Background: Because {{of ethical}} and medico-legal aspects {{involved}} in the training of cutaneous surgical skills on living patients, human cadavers and living animals, it is necessary the search for alternative and effective forms of training simulation. Aims: To propose and describe an alternative methodology for teaching and learning the principles of cutaneous surgery in a medical undergraduate program by using a chicken-skin bench model. Materials and Methods: One instructor for every four students, teaching materials on cutaneous surgical skills, chicken trunks, wings, or thighs, a rigid platform support, <b>needled</b> threads, <b>needle</b> <b>holders,</b> surgical blades with scalpel handles, rat-tooth tweezers, scissors, and marking pens were necessary for training simulation. Results: A proposal for simulation-based training on incision, suture, biopsy, and on reconstruction techniques using a chicken-skin bench model distributed in several sessions and with increasing levels of difficultywas structured. Both feedback and objective evaluations always directed to individual students were also outlined. Conclusion: The teaching of a methodology for the principles of cutaneous surgery using a chicken-skin bench model versatile, portable, easy to assemble, and inexpensive is an alternative and complementary option to the armamentarium of methods based on other bench models described. © Indian Journal of Dermatology 2013...|$|R
40|$|Background/Purpose: There {{are many}} {{techniques}} available for laparoscopic hernia repair in infancy and childhood.

30|$|However, {{some issues}} are of concern. Strassman’s metroplasty is {{technically}} quite challenging when performed through the laparoscopic route [5]. Precise suturing to achieve good approximation of the anterior and posterior walls {{is difficult and}} tiresome. Manipulation of the <b>needle</b> <b>holders</b> while suturing {{the base of the}} posterior uterine wall can be extremely difficult [5]. Bleeding through the cut edges of the uterine wall can interfere with the suturing process. The laparoscopic metroplasty procedure differs somewhat from conventional abdominal metroplasty. Fewer sutures were used to approximate the uterine walls than are needed in conventional metroplasty. The authors used no. 0 Vicryl, which is thicker and stronger than finer sutures that are otherwise used, as these sutures tend to break easily during intracorporeal knot tying. While suturing the uterine walls, interrupted inverting sutures were used. The needle was first passed into the myometrium adjacent to the endometrial lining, to exit just below the serosa, on the left horn. The needle then passed through the myometrium of the right horn, first subserosally and exited adjacent to endometrium. On tying this suture intracorporeally, the endometrial edges were apposed perfectly, and the knot was buried in the myometrium. Inverting the myometrium in this way prevents growth of endometrial glands in the uterine scar [5, 9]. Placing all knots within the cavity or on the serosa of the uterus would aggravate formation of intrauterine synechiae and external adhesions, respectively.|$|R
