5|$|Edward Robinson {{visited in}} 1838, {{and noted that}} the khan, which Maundrell commented on, was for the {{accommodation}} of the caravans passing on the great road between Egypt and Damascus which Lajjun comes over the hills from the western plain along the coast and enters that of Esdraelon. When the British consul James Finn visited {{the area in the}} mid-19th century, he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> village. The authors of the Survey of Western Palestine also noticed a khan, however, south of the ruins of Lajjun in the early 1880s.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|CNN {{reported}} {{that at least}} two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves. They did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> child among the self-immolators. The CNN crew began filming the events from a distance, but were quickly intercepted by military police, who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. The authorities then put out the flames consuming the other four people's clothing. A police van came to collect the badly burnt man, and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four. The square was completely closed, and security was tight the next day, the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Police monitored public access to the square for the New Year celebrations, had fire extinguishers ready, and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners.|$|E

5|$|From 1927 to 1928, Agârbiceanu, a {{recipient}} of the National Prize for Literature, headed the Cluj chapter of Astra and edited Transilvania. It was in this magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of eugenics, calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his participation was somewhat incongruous, but Agârbiceanu did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws. From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congresses and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries {{in places such as}} Aleșd.|$|E
5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E

25|$|The {{advocates of}} this anti-systematic {{interpretation}} do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> contradiction between Plato's criticism {{of writing and}} the notion that he communicated his entire philosophy to the public in writing. They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues are not like this but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.|$|E

25|$|Alford’s most {{speculative}} idea is {{that the}} King’s Chamber generated low frequency sound via its ‘airshafts’, the purpose being to re-enact the sound of the earth splitting open at the time of creation.
