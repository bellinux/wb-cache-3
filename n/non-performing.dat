In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of <b>non-performing</b> assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} arises {{as to why}} any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach. The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages {{as a result of}} the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)). If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral executory contract with <b>non-performed</b> duties on both sides. Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.|$|R

This paper was based on speeches concerning the 'ludic' terminology, regarding the leisure field, in recent initiatives for systematizing its use in the academic field. The starting point for developing this investigation were the encyclopedia entries describing such terminology and theme. Counting on discourse analysis to provide theoreticalmethodological support, we attempted to evidence the stabilizations generated by such speeches, in order to understant 'ludic' terminology in its discursivity, under the light of discourse analysis. Discourse Analysts perceive that the lack of debates about the relationship regarding ludic and leisure contribute greatly to sustain the effect of evidence of such property in the area. Since such a phenomenon is not installed anywhere but, in fact, occurs in the relationships among subjects, it works in a discursive way as the <b>non-performed</b> part of the leisure movement, that is, its non-pre-built characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Secure {{integration}} of third-party code {{is one of}} the prime challenges for securing today’s web. Recent empirical studies give evidence of pervasive reliance on and excessive trust in third-party JavaScript, with no adequate security mechanism to limit the trust or the extent of its abuse. Information flow control is a promising approach for controlling the behavior of third-party code and enforcing confidentiality and integrity policies. While much progress has been made on static and dynamic approaches to information flow control, only recently their combinations have received attention. Purely static analysis falls short of addressing dynamic language features such as dynamic objects and dynamic code evaluation, while purely dynamic analysis suffers from inability to predict side effects in <b>non-performed</b> executions. This paper develops a value-sensitive hybrid mechanism for tracking information flow in a JavaScript-like language. The mechanism consists of a dynamic monitor empowered to invoke a static component on the fly. This enables us to achieve a sound yet permissive enforcement. We establish formal soundness results with respect to the security policy of noninterference. In addition, we demonstrate permissiveness by proving that we subsume the precision of purely static analysis and by presenting a collection of common programming patterns that indicate that our mechanism has potential to provide more permissiveness than dynamic mechanisms in practice.

40|$|The Swedish National Rail Administration {{has changed}} in the past decade, from its origin after a less {{dramatic}} separation from the Swedish State Railways to becoming an authority with its own identity. Today the National Rail Administration is a large organisation with several different departments, each with its own unique function. To operate train services the railway needs to be “in shape”, leading to a need for maintenance, reinvestments and new investments. For this purpose, the National Rail Administration carries out public procurement where contractors, who are able to perform maintenance and new construction, submit tenders. Careful planning is required to avoid delays on transport operators as a consequence of railway work. Construction work that requires track closure has the effect that transport operators need to fit changes into their operating schedules. Work requiring lengthy closures need to be negotiated between concerned parties beforehand, so that the closure or re-routing will not come as a shock. It is therefore important that planning is done well in advance and that all concerned parties are heard. The National Rail Administration is supported by a main process with various sub-processes to facilitate the planning of the work. The local track district within Banverket initiates the process and then the result is handed in to Banverket Rail Traffic for follow-up of the requested work. The follow-up often is a time-demanding task since there are no specially designed tools for this purpose. Banverket Rail Traffic has therefore extended its work process in order to allow for some follow-up. All scheduled work is entered into a customized Excel sheet. The sheet contains information of where and when the work is to be done and what kind of measures are to be taken. This is necessary in order for train dispatchers to be able to direct the trains in a safe way, for passengers as well as for railway workers. When Banverket Rail Traffic has approved or rejected the requested work, the sheet is forwarded to all concerned parties so that those who intend to perform the work can plan the actual implementation. The planning process is time demanding since it involves several different departments and entrepreneurs. A complicated procedure is started where it is difficult to follow the flow of scheduled work, which in turn leads to errors and that approved work is not being performed. Too often, closures and redirections are done without any work being in progress. The problem with scheduled, but <b>non-performed</b> work is a long known fact and Banverket Rail Traffic is working on various solutions. A common system where all concerned parties would {{be able to see the}} planning status is recommended. Today this is not possible since the Excel sheet from Banverket Rail Traffic has to be forwarded between the departments or e-mail or telephones have to be used. A system common for all parties would probably reduce the share of <b>non-performed</b> work and enable for a higher degree of coordinated planning in order to make train services run smoothly...|$|R

25|$|China's banking {{sector is}} {{dominated}} by four large state-owned banks, which are largely inefficient and monopolistic. China's largest bank, ICBC, is the largest bank in the world. The financial sector is widely seen as a drag on the economy due to the inefficient state management. <b>Non-performing</b> loans, mostly made to local governments and unprofitable state-owned enterprises for political purposes, especially the political goal of keeping unemployment low, are a big drain on the financial system and economy, reaching over 22% of GDP by 2000, with a drop to 6.3% by 2006 due to government recapitalization of these banks. In 2006, {{the total amount of}} <b>non-performing</b> loans was estimated at $160billion. Observers recommend privatization of the banking system to solve this problem, a move that was partially carried out when the four banks were floated on the stock market.

40|$|An 8 -year-old {{girl was}} {{admitted}} {{for a simple}} closure of echocardiographically diagnosed Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). During the operation the right pulmonary veins orifices were not detected in the left atrium and attempt to localize them led {{to the discovery of}} three additional anomalies, namely Interrupted Inferior Vena Cava (IIVC), Scimitar syndrome, and systemic arterial supply of the lung. Postoperatively these finding were confirmed by CT angiography. This case report emphasizes the need for adequate preoperative diagnosis and presents a very rare constellation of four congenital anomalies that {{to the best of our}} knowledge is not reported before. Background The need for adequate preoperative diagnosis in the field of congenital heart surgery cannot be overemphasized. To this end many centers routinely use Intraoperative Trans-Esophageal Echocardiography (ITEE). Mayo clinic group in a study of 1002 congenital heart disease patients demonstrated that ITEE had major impact in 13. 4 % of cases defined as revealing any undetected pre or intaoperative information requiring an otherwise <b>non-performed</b> procedure during the surgery; however, the ASD secundum subset (67 cases) was the only primary diagnosis in this study that ITEE had zero major impact on and routine ITEE did not seem to be cost effective in this group [1]. In our experience also a comprehensive preoperative Trans-Thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is considered adequate for delineation of simple cardiac defects such as ASD secundum unless the cardiologist is not satisfied with the quality of the study in which case preoperative TEE, cardiac MRI or ITEE is considered. In contrast to what was just mentioned the following case report serves as an example of inadequate TTE that failed to detect other major concomitant congenital heart defects accompanying an ASD secundum in an 8 -year-old girl which had major impact on her operation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Early {{mobilisation}} is part {{of standard}} postoperative care after abdominal surgery. Nevertheless no consensus exists {{on the content of}} early mobilisation. Impartial information on the mobility of patients can contribute to better treatments. The use of ambulant accelerometrics as applied in the VitaMove system enables a detailed assessment of patient mobility in terms of body postures and movements. Until now, the VitaMove has not been applied in clinical, inpatient settings. Objective: Primary objective is to determine if the VitaMove is feasible for measuring mobility of patients after abdominal surgery, admitted to the hospital. The secondary objective is to examine the face validity i. e. whether the VitaMove measures the clinically relevant aspects of mobility after surgery. Methods: Five patients, admitted to the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam for elective whipple operation, were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 85 years and no limitations for early postoperative mobilisation. The mobility was measured during the first, third, seventh and ninth day after surgery. Criteria for feasibility were: wearing time, burden for patients, influencing nursing staff during daily care and missed activities. The VitaMove is considered feasible when all four endpoints are met. The VM was examined on face validity in three ways: the VM-reports were checked on obvious errors and the observation of recovery of mobility. Further the activity detection was examined in detail, with focus on sub-categories of mobility and optimization of settings. Results: The average wearing time of the VitaMove is 85 %, 18 % of the patients reported complaints on wearing the VitaMove, 0 % of the nursing staff reported to be influenced by the VitaMove during daily care and in 13 % of the days, more than 2 activities were missed. Face validity: with all patients the posture ‘prone’ was measured although after abdominal surgery patients never take this posture. This is an obvious error. On the other hand recovery of mobility was observed correctly and two subcategories could be distinguished: sitting upright and backwards. Conclusion: The use of the VitaMove does not meet two out of four endpoints. Therefore the VM is not feasible for measuring mobilisation with patients staying in hospital after abdominal surgery. With adjustments of study protocol concerning wearing time and placement by nursing staff, the VM will probably be assessed as feasible. The face validity is ambiguous: the VM measures recovery of mobility correctly, {{but on the other hand}} <b>non-performed</b> activities were detected...|$|R

However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed out to the public sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a <b>non-performing</b> loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them.

25|$|In 2006, {{after the}} {{controversial}} 2004 BCCI election scandal involving Sharad Pawar's defeat to {{election to the}} office of president of the board at the hands of Agashe, the bank business started having financial troubles. Many sources claimed Agashe's actions may have been deliberate. Some sources also claimed that Agashe's business supposedly failed as backlash for thwarting Pawar's ambitions for presidency. In September of that same year, the cooperative bank was put under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India. The board of directors for the bank was superseded soon after. In 2007, following the order of moratorium, the State Department of Cooperation appointed Mukund Ghaisas as administrator at the bank. Many of the bank's depositors held demonstrations at Agashe's Aundh residence and threatened criminal actions against the Agashe family, after which a speedy merger was promised by Agashe. Initial NPAs totaled Rs. 125 crore, 13% against the seven per cent maximum allowable under the RBI norms. After the <b>non-performing</b> assets of the bank grew to more than 43%, account holders and depositors held a day long token fast to protest against the misinformation provided in regards to the alleged duped loans. In 2008, the RBI gave the bank permission to pay interest on deposits made from January to June 2008; Agashe mortgaged personal property worth Rs. 200 crore in lieu of the recovery of the deposits worth Rs. 725 crore. Hotel Ranjeet, a hotel owned by Agashe was auctioned off for the same reasons. Cosmos Bank planned to acquire the bank after it hit this roadblock with the RBI and the subsequent announcement of the proposed merger with Cosmos led to large-scale panic withdrawals by Suvarna customers.|$|E
25|$|Just {{how long}} the {{trajectory}} could continue, however, remained unclear. According to the 11th five-year plan, China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of central planning and winning them {{to the cause of}} reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the banking sector and launching the beginnings of a real capital market. According to an article in Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China. This process, however, would not be easy. As of 2004, China's state-owned enterprises were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in <b>non-performing</b> loans, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid.
