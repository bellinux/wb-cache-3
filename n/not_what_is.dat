25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a live rail, also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public not to touch it. In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, {{but it is not}} a preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing with the need for a driver; however, such systems are <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> generally thought of as light rail, crossing over into rapid transit. Automatic operation is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E

In Characters of Shakespear's Plays, {{he makes no}} mention at all of any stage performances, treating the play as one primarily meant to be read. What strikes him as most notable about it is its character of a [...] "pastoral drama", one that presents an [...] "ideal" [...] world—that is, a world of thought and imagination, not action. And {{though it is a}} comedy, its interest derives not so much from in our being made to laugh at any particular human follies, but rather, [...] "more out of the sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations. It is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> done, but what is said, that claims our attention." ...|$|E

2500|$|Formal or sober {{clothing}} is typically worn beneath the gown so, for example, men would often wear {{a dark suit}} with {{a white shirt and}} a tie, or clerical clothing, military or civil uniform, or national dress, and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as subfusc) to be worn under the gown. Though some universities are relaxed about what people wear under their gowns, it is nevertheless considered bad form to be in casual wear or the like during graduation ceremonies, and a number of universities may bar finishing students from joining the procession or the ceremony itself if not appropriately dressed (though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress and <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> worn beneath it, if unseen). [...] In the Commonwealth, gowns are worn open, while in the United States, it has become common for gowns to close at the front, as did the original roba.|$|E

2500|$|Lord, {{through his}} pseudonym, responded {{in his own}} defense, stating that [...] "Roman Catholic institutions, {{charitable}} if they please to call them so" [...] are <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> opposed by Protestants, only {{the fact that the}} state legislature is [...] " [...] not a public hospital but a Roman Catholic one," [...] and were [...] "willing to do for the Papists what they have never done for their own religious institutions." [...] He accused the government of being in collaboration with the Catholic Church, arguing that the funding was illegal. He warned that Sisters of Charity Hospital would make [...] "citizens become subjects of Romish magic," [...] and asked [...] "are Roman Catholics to be almoners of Protestant charities to the poor and destitute?" [...] In another letter, he asserted that the hospital funding was illegal because [...] "not a single Protestant is in the Corporation or has any supervision of its affairs." [...] In the Christian Advocate, a Protestant newspaper at which Lord was editor, he questioned why anyone who defends the Constitution [...] "will be willing to be taxed to build up an institution the control of which is beyond the votes of a free republican people." [...] Vicar General Fr.

2500|$|GameInformers Lix Lanier {{stated that}} no villain, male or female, has {{the charm of}} GLaDOS: [...] "If she's not trying to kill Chell, she's likely belittling her with passive-aggressive {{comments}} {{that would make a}} sorority girl proud. Even with her robotic voice, it's clear that 'You look great by the way, very healthy' is no compliment." [...] GamePros Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an [...] "archetypal villain", she is a [...] "prototypical bound woman". He added that [...] "A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> interesting to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself". He wrote [...] "GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society" [...] and that [...] "by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear" [...] and making her [...] "far more dangerous". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is [...] "dutiful and does every task assigned of her", GLaDOS is [...] "aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society". He also described Chell as a [...] "domestic icon" [...] while he described GLaDOS as a [...] "progressive, intelligent working woman" [...] and that by killing her, [...] "Chell {{can be seen as the}} dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices.|$|E

One day, he hurries to save Peyton from Internet stalker [...] "Psycho Derek", and becomes {{considerably}} closer to her afterward. He also helps Karen, who is pregnant with Keith's baby, and plans on going to the University of North Carolina when he graduates {{so that he can}} be close to home in case she needs him. Dan also helps Karen with her pregnancy, wanting to make amends for Keith's death. After talking with Dan, Karen persuades Whitey to let Lucas play 15 minutes a game, so as not to let him miss out on something he loves. Brooke and Lucas try dating each other again, but realize that it is not what they truly want and is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> meant to be, prompting Peyton to confess her feelings for Lucas. Lucas then discovers that Nathan is planning to throw the state championship game because of his debts. Lucas plans to prevent this and deliberately fails to take his heart medication in order to play better, but Nathan is inspired by learning {{that he is going to}} have a son and they win, with Lucas making the winning shot. During the celebration, Lucas, after receiving Brooke's blessing, sees Peyton and tells her that she is the girl he has been meant for. The two then share a long-awaited kiss. They become a couple at the after-party, but their happiness is short-lived when Haley gets hit by a car and Lucas tries to tell the paramedics what happened only to suffer a heart attack. As he is in the hospital, Lucas dreams that he is visited by Keith, who shows Lucas what life would have been like if he had been a lesser person. In the end, Lucas realizes that he has to go back to his life because he never told Peyton that he loves her. Lucas wakes up and begins a relationship with Peyton. After the failed attempt of prom in Tree Hill High, the group go on a rescue mission to save Mouth who has become stranded in Honeygrove. They all then crash the local Prom, where he and Peyton have sex with each other for the first time. He begins to investigate Keith's death, as the Keith in his dream suggested that Jimmy did not kill him, but he also starts getting closer to Dan, who tells Karen he wants a bigger part in Lucas's life. Lucas discovers the truth about Dan thanks to witness Abby Brown. He attacks Dan after walking in on him and Karen kissing and tells Karen that Dan killed Keith, but Dan convinces Karen that Lucas is delusional and needs help. Lucas then steals Deb's gun and confronts Dan in front of Karen, having set him up by sending him a message from [...] "Abby". Karen collapses and Lucas fires a warning shot at Dan, telling him not to touch her. Karen is rushed to hospital with eclampsia and has an emergency c-section. Lucas is given a half-sister, who is named Lily Roe Scott when Karen regains consciousness. Later, Dan turns himself in for Keith's murder. Lucas graduates and gets, as a reward, his book (An Unkindness of Ravens) from his mother. That same day, he becomes an uncle with the birth of Nathan and Haley's son, James Lucas Scott, partly named after him. Lucas is named the godfather of James and announces that he will be assisting Whitey as Nathan's college basketball coach.|$|E
