50|$|During {{the night}} of the 17-18 May, {{elements}} of the Gurkha battalion, a company of RAF Assyrian Levies, RAF Armoured Cars and some captured Iraqi howitzers crossed the Euphrates using improvised cable ferries. They crossed the river at Sin el Dhibban and approached Falluja from the village of Saqlawiyah. During {{the early hours of the}} day, one company of the 1st battalion KORR were air transported by 4 Valentias and landed on the Baghdad road beyond the town near <b>Notch</b> <b>Fall.</b> A company of RAF Assyrian Levies, supported by artillery from Kingcol, was ordered to secure the bridge across the river. Throughout the day the RAF bombed positions in the town and along the Baghdad road, avoiding a general bombardment of the town because of the civilian population. On 19 May 57 aircraft began bombarding Iraqi positions within and around Fallujah before dropping leaflets requesting the garrison to surrender; no response was given and further bombing operations took place. The RAF dropped ten tons of bombs on Fallujah in 134 sorties.|$|E

50|$|In most {{locomotives}} (in {{addition to}} a warning lamp or buzzer being sounded) the master controller undergoes auto-regression, with the <b>notches</b> <b>falling</b> to zero rapidly as the locomotive's motive power is switched off. The guard may also notice the loss of brake pressure (although he/she may not know it {{is due to the}} pulling of the alarm chain) and is expected to apply their brakes immediately as well. It is possible for a driver to override the alarm-chain pull; this is done where it is known that miscreants resort to pulling the emergency chain solely to get the train to stop at a point convenient for themselves. However, such an act by the driver (or guard) of deliberately ignoring an indication of alarm-chain pulling is a serious matter.|$|R
40|$|The Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) is a {{well-known}} design method allowing the strength of notched/crack components to be estimated accurately by directly post-processing the entire linear elastic stress fields damaging the material {{in the vicinity of}} the stress raisers being designed. By taking full advantage of the TCD’s unique features, in this thesis, the TCD is reformulated to make it suitable for predicting the strength of notched metallic materials subjected to dynamic loading by post-processing both linear elastic and elastoplastic stress distributions. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed reformulation of the linear elastic TCD were checked against a number of experimental results generated by testing, under different loading/strain/displacement rates, notched cylindrical samples of aluminium alloy 6063 -T 5, titanium alloy Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, aluminium alloy AlMg 6, and an AlMn alloy. To further validate the proposed design method also different data sets taken from the literature were considered. Such an extensive validation exercise allowed us to prove that the proposed reformulation of the TCD is successful in predicting the dynamic strength of <b>notched</b> metallic materials <b>falling</b> within an error interval of ± 20 %. Such a high level of accuracy is certainly remarkable, especially in light of the fact that it was reached without the need for explicitly modelling the stress vs. strain dynamic behaviour of the investigated ductile metals. Additionally, the FEM with Simplified-Johnson Cook elastoplastic material model was used to predict the dynamic strength of <b>notched</b> metallic material <b>falling</b> within an error interval of ± 20 %. Moreover, the elastoplastic TCD was also provided to be capable of predicting the dynamic strength of <b>notched</b> metallic materials <b>falling</b> within an error interval of ± 6 %...|$|R

Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive techniques that measures relative blood volume changes in the blood vessels close to the skin. This instrument was specially designed for the analysis healthy, diabetes an arthritis person. Many problems were created while designing PPG instrument such as light source, skin thickness of fingertip, signal amplification, storing of signals, heart rate and respiratory rate. We present the results of analysis of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal for healthy and patient with cardiovascular disorder (diabetes and arthritis). PPG signal of 21 subjects were recorded from the fingertip. The analysis indicates the content of PPG signal is different for healthy and cardiovascular patients. We also investigated heart rate and respiratory rate using PPG signal.

40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} was to study the elastic {{properties}} of vascular tree noninvasively in human subjects as a function of aging using the shape of peripheral pulse wave. We used 21 subjects in two age groups, 22 - 30, 37 - 72 years. The peripheral pulse has a steep rise and a <b>notch</b> on the <b>falling</b> slope in the younger subjects. With older subjects a more gradual rise and fall and no pronounced dicrotic notch were observed. The analyzing program calculated ratios t 2 /t 1, P 2 /P 1 and V/P 1. As a result, the ratios t 2 /t 1 (p< 0. 002) and V/P 1 (p< 0. 02) were significantly different between the groups. Two of them could provide a simple, noninvasive means for studying changes in the elastic properties of the vascular system, depending on the age and disease...|$|R
40|$|Experimentation at the micron level {{requires}} specific {{tools and}} methods. It will be illustrated {{how some of}} these tools have to be combined to achieve this goal. Because the determination of strains at the micron and nanoscales has been explored {{with the aid of}} probe microscopy, attention needs to be devoted to the limitations of digital image correlation. In this context it is illustrated how the results of the correlation method are affected by several process parameters, such as subset size, out-of-plane deformation, displacement gradients and scanning noise introduced in measurements. We also present measurements of material fracture on small, elliptically perforated (MEMS) specimens under tension via specially constructed equipment. Of particular interest is how the failure strength of polycrystalline silicon (grain size 0. 3 lm) is influenced by the magnitude of the notch radius (1 – 8 lm) and the stress concentration factor (3 – 10). It is demonstrated that when the <b>notch</b> radius <b>falls</b> below 3 lm, the strength of the material is no longer governed by the critical stress criterion that controls failure initiation for larger radii (e. g. 8 lm or larger). In fact, the stress gradient plays {{a significant role in the}} failure process, which is explained in terms of the statistical spatial distribution of small flaws or cracks and the size of the zone at the notch tip under high stress. Failure stresses increase by a factor of two or more at a characteristic size of 1 lm...|$|R
40|$|Abaca fibre {{reinforced}} PP composites were fabricated {{with different}} fibre loadings (20, 30, 40, 50 wt% {{and in some}} cases 35 and 45 wt%). Flax and jute fibre reinforced PP composites were also fabricated with 30 wt% fibre loading. The mechanical properties, odour emission and structure properties were investigated for those composites. Tensile, flexural and Charpy impact strengths were found to increase for fibre loadings up to 40 wt% and then decreased. Falling weight impact tests were also carried out and the same tendency was observed. Owing to the addition of coupling agent (maleated polypropylene -MAH-PP), the tensile, flexural and falling weight impact properties were found to increase in between 30 to 80 % for different fibre loadings. When comparing jute and flax fibre composites with abaca fibre composites, jute fibre composites provided best tensile properties but abaca fibre polypropylene composites were shown to provide best <b>notch</b> Charpy and <b>falling</b> weight impact properties. Odours released by flax fibre composites were smaller than jute and abaca fibre composites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- An {{effective}} control scheme for three-phase three-wire active power filter is proposed in this paper. Conventionally, {{the majority of}} existing APF control strategies in literature adopts feed-forward control scheme, which results in switching <b>notches</b> (sharp-rising or <b>falling</b> ripples) in the source-side currents at conduction instants of diode/thyristor rectifier load. The proposed method utilizes feedback control plus feed-forward control structures to achieve a smooth filtering performance. The feedback loop minimizes the steady-state error using two separate PI regulators in d-axis and q-axis respectively. The feed-forward loop serves the purpose of load disturbance rejection and it significantly enhances performance of active power filter by using synchronous frame adaptive neural network (SADALINE) algorithm. The proposed method overwhelms many existing compensation schemes in terms of simplicity, robustness and ease of implementation using DSP. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme has been substantially confirmed by experimental results. Key-Words:- harmonic contamination, active filter, power quality, SADALINE...|$|R
60|$|The Australian blacks use the flower-stem of the grass-tree, {{which is}} of a tough pithy nature, and about one inch in diameter. The {{operation}} of making the fire is assisted {{by the use of}} a little charcoal-powder, which, in Australia, is found on the bark of almost every tree, from the constant passage of grass-fires over the ground. The process is as follows:--One piece of the stick is notched in the middle, fig. 1, and the notch slightly hollowed out; another is roundly pointed at one end. The black fellow, being seated on the ground, holds down one end of the notched stick with each foot, fig. 2, and placing the point of the other stick into the notch, twirls it rapidly and forcibly between the palms of his hands. In doing this his hands gradually slip down the stick, and he has to shift them rapidly up again, which loses time: but two people, seated opposite, can alternately take up the rubbing, and more easily produce fire. A little of the above-mentioned powdered charcoal is dropped into the notch during the operation. In a very few minutes red-hot powdery ashes commence to work up out of the <b>notch,</b> which <b>falling</b> on a small heap of tow, or of dry tow-like bark, or lint, or cotton stuff, is quickly blown into a flame. The Africans carry the drill-stick, which in shape and size is like an arrow, in a quiver with their arrows, and the fire-block--a stick three inches long and one in diameter, of a different wood--as a pendant to their necklace.|$|R

40|$|Adrenoceptor {{stimulation}} enhances repolarising and depolarising membrane currents {{to different}} extents in cardiac myocytes. We investigated the opposing {{effects of the}} repolarising Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) and depolarising L-type Ca(2 +) current (I(Ca,L)) on the action potential configuration of sheep ventricular myocytes stimulated with noradrenaline. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings revealed that noradrenaline accelerated and prolonged phase- 1 repolarisation. We define the minimal potential {{at the end of}} phase- 1 repolarisation as "notch level". Noradrenaline (1 microM) caused the <b>notch</b> level to <b>fall</b> from 14 +/- 2. 6 to 7. 8 +/- 2. 8 mV (n = 24), but left action potential duration, resting membrane potential or action potential amplitude unaffected. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings showed that 1 microM noradrenaline increased both I(Ca,L) and I(Cl(Ca)), but it had no significant effect on the principal K(+) currents. Blockage of I(Cl(Ca)) by 0. 5 mM 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid (DIDS) in both the absence and the presence of noradrenaline abolished phase- 1 repolarisation. In the presence of noradrenaline, DIDS caused elevation of the plateau phase amplitude and an increase in the action potential duration. In conclusion, elevation of the plateau phase amplitude and action potential prolongation associated with an increased I(Ca,L) upon adrenoceptor stimulation is prevented by an increased I(Cl(Ca)) in sheep ventricular myocytes.
