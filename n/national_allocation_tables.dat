50|$|X Band Satellite Communication {{operates}} {{in the part}} of the X band or Super High Frequency (SHF) spectrum which is designated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for satellite communication, which is those frequencies in the range 7.25 GHz to 7.75 GHz (Space to Earth) and 7.9 GHz to 8.4 GHz (Earth to Space). The ITU Frequency allocation defines the primary use of this spectrum as Fixed satellite service (FSS) and a portion to Mobile Satellite Services (MSS), primarily used for ship based satellite communications. UK Frequency <b>Allocation</b> <b>Table</b> (UK FAT) along with other NATO countries and some other countries’ (but not all) <b>national</b> frequency <b>allocations</b> <b>tables,</b> have an additional note detailing the primary allocation for government use.

Most new machines with Windows pre-installed use NTFS, leaving FIPS obsolete for its intended purpose of resizing existing Windows installations to install Linux. In addition, FIPS cannot grow partitions due to technical limitations with the design, and partitions shrunk with it have some wasted space since {{it does not}} shrink the File <b>Allocation</b> <b>Table.</b> The filesystem to be shrunk must also be defragmented before FIPS is run - since FIPS does not move data, any data {{near the end of}} the partition prevents it from being resized.|$|R

Based on the well known fact that suitable allocation of user spreading codes {{can be used as a}} PAPR reduction tool, we  in this contribution, investigate the PAPR property of a recently proposed spreading code set called “Orthogonal Binary User (OBU) Codes”. Considering different levels of active user densities, we present code <b>allocation</b> <b>table</b> consisting of selected OBU code combinations yielding low PAPR. On the basis of analytical and simulation results, we show that the presented  code <b>allocation</b> <b>table</b> is capable of making the system perform better than the well known Walsh-Hadamard codes from both PAPR and BER perspectives...|$|R
40|$|Space-variant {{preprocessing}} {{combines the}} best of space and transform domain compression techniques so that energy packing efficiency can be higher than by conventional transform techniques. The fast Cas-Cas transform (FCCT) provides improved speed of computation as a transform method. A new symmetrical bit <b>allocation</b> <b>table</b> method is presented to compress efficiently all full frame transformed coefficients. The preprocessing approach combined with the Cas-Cas transform and the new symmetrical bit <b>allocation</b> <b>table</b> method yields improved performance over conventional methods when applied to modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI), Ultrasound, and plain film X-ray. Overall space-variant preprocessing was found to significantly improve all transform based compression schemes tested, and provided around 10 : 1 compression ratios with no data loss other than quantization errors. ...|$|R
