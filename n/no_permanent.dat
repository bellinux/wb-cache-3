The Newfoundland National War Memorial is on the waterfront in St. John's, at the purported site of Gilbert's landing and proclamation.|$|E
5|$|The ECSC {{was founded}} by the Treaty of Paris in 1951; however, there was no {{decision}} on where to base {{the institutions of the}} new community.

Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still <b>no</b> <b>permanent</b> set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E
5|$|In late 1974, the CFA {{decided to}} {{schedule}} a special championship.

5|$|SvalRak is the world's northern-most {{rocket launch}} site, and {{is located at}} the 79th {{parallel}} north. This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup. It is also used for studying the Magnetopause and aurora borealis, for which Ny-Ålesund is the most convenient location because of its ease of access. It is owned by Andøya Rocket Range, which is owned by the Norwegian Space Center (90 percent) and the Kongsberg Group (10 percent). SvalRak has <b>no</b> <b>permanent</b> staff in Ny-Ålesund. The main users are American and Japanese and to a less extent Norwegian.|$|E

Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, {{decided to}} send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and the Seniors, proved {{successful}} there.

After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to a condom in their living quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had cut off power to their room).|$|E
5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold <b>no</b> <b>permanent</b> {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It {{was only a matter of}} time before it was generally acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of that institution.|$|E
25|$|After the Lucayans became extinct, {{there were}} <b>no</b> known <b>permanent</b> {{settlements}} in the Bahamas—including Andros Island—for approximately 130 years.

Understanding Anicca and Anatta are steps in the Buddhist’s spiritual progress toward enlightenment.|$|R
