6000|$|In {{the savage}} state every family owns a shelter {{as good as}} the best, and {{sufficient}} for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for this outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax, the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage's. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars (these are the country rates) entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fire-place, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a poor civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man--and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages--it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this <b>neighborhood</b> <b>costs</b> perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer's life, even if he is not encumbered with a family--estimating the pecuniary value of every man's labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;--so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms? ...|$|E

Internalizing environmental and social costs of urban automobile use could reduce prices and increase capacity utilization in walkable shops in more densely populated local areas. Many common combinations of planning and pricing tools fail to internalize important costs, and may actually subsidize driving to shop, but a combination of planning and the pricing (through taxation) of retail parking could effectively internalize the relevant costs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} neighborhoods, social capital and economic success.

An understudied part of these relationships is the existence of endogeneity among the key variables. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, this study uses structural equation modeling to test the model empirically and find that social capital and economic success are endogenous, but while social capital increases economic success, economic success decreases social capital, ceteris paribus. I also find that social capital is highly dependent on neighborhood levels of social capital.

In {{this paper}} we analyze urban spatial {{segregation}} phenomenon {{in terms of}} the income distribution over a population, and inflationary parameter weighting the evolution of housing prices. For this, we develop a discrete, spatially extended model based in a multi–agent approach. In our model, the mobility of socioeconomic agents is driven only by the housing prices. Agents exchange location in order to fit their status to the cost of their housing. On the other hand, the price of a particular house changes depends on the status of its tenant, and on the <b>neighborhood</b> mean lodging <b>cost,</b> weighted by a control parameter. The agent’s dynamics converges to a spatially organized configuration, whose regularity we measured by using an entropy–like indicator.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{elevated}} rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems in Detroit, Michigan compared {{to state and}} national averages. Using 47 in-depth interviews of African American residents in two Detroit neighborhoods, this dissertation examines the challenges participants face and the strategies they devise to get food and physical activity. I explore the interplay between agency, social structure and community context. Interviewees discussed numerous shortcomings with the grocery stores in their <b>neighborhoods,</b> including <b>cost,</b> quality and availability. However, many devised strategies {{to address these issues}}, including carefully examining food before purchase, using multiple food sources to meet different needs, and sharing transportation to get to food sources in other areas. Participants also discussed numerous barriers to physical activity, including concerns about crime, deteriorating sidewalks and parks, and shortcomings with local recreational facilities. Strategies to address these issues included devising home exercise regimens, and sharing equipment and other resources within social networks. Overall, the potential to enact strategies varied, in part, according to community contextual factors, such as the availability of resources within neighborhoods and in surrounding areas. After exploring these barriers and strategies, I compare scholarly understandings of health behaviors with the lived experiences of participants. Many obtained significant amounts of physical activity from walking for transportation, employment, childcare and other forms physical labor, suggesting that the focus of health scholars on “leisure-time” physical activity in studies of low-income populations may be misguided. Participants also demonstrated nuanced and sophisticated understandings of nutrition, calling into question the wisdom of policymakers who promote nutritional education, as opposed to addressing lack of access to high-quality food sources. Improvements to structural factors, neighborhoods and health policies are necessary but insufficient steps toward improving eating and exercise behaviors. The importance of agency, social context, and the variation within and between communities suggests a theoretical framework that avoids both individualism and causal determinism. Structural improvements and health interventions must connect with the daily realities and potential of the individuals that they target...|$|R

The suburb, along with other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment such as Fraser Town, Cox Town, Richmond Town, and Langford Town, has seen dynamic changes over last few years with large British Raj era bungalows being demolished to build luxury apartments.
