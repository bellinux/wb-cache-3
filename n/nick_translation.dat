25|$|Flap {{endonuclease}} 1 (FEN1) {{is responsible}} for processing Okazaki fragments. It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an Okazaki fragment and can remove the 5' ribonucleotide and 5' flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during lagging strand synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1's function is necessary to Okazaki fragment maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.|$|E
25|$|Aminoallyl NTPs {{are used}} for {{indirect}} DNA labeling in PCR, <b>nick</b> <b>translation,</b> primer extensions and cDNA synthesis. These labeled NTPs are helpful because of their application in molecular biology labs where {{they do not have}} the capacity to handle radioactive material. For example, 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-Uridine(AA-UTPs) are more effective for high density labeling of DNA than pre-labeling the DNA. After the enzymatic addition of the NTPs, amine reactant fluorescent dyes can be added for detection of the DNA molecule. When incorporated into DNA or RNA molecules by DNA/RNA polymerase, 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP provide a reactive group for the addition of other chemical groups. Thus aminoallyl modified DNA or RNA can be labeled with any compound which has an amine-reactive group.|$|E

It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, DNA Pol I is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5' to 3' exonuclease activity {{in addition to its}} polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called <b>nick</b> <b>translation.</b> Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.|$|E

Focusing extensively on the lengthy and uncertain publication process surrounding the original [...] "proems," [...] Osmond attempts to organize the works into distinct groups, establishing some definitive order. Because no one truly knows how Rimbaud intended them to be arranged in a collective work, this decision is left up to the translator. As Osmond suggests, different ordering gives rise to different meaning in the poems. Thus, ordering provides another mechanism through which translators {{have the ability to}} formulate the message they wish to convey in their particular piece of literature.|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{associated}} with pathological fibroproliferation represent {{a major cause}} of morbidity and mortality. Despite the importance of this class of disorders, current therapy is of limited value, and no therapy is available to reduce the fibroblast population size within existing fibrotic lesions. In this regard, constitutive expression of growth-promoting genes can sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that lovastatin potently induces apoptosis in fibroblasts constitutively expressing Myc, and that lung fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic lesions constitutively express growth-promoting genes. In this study, we sought to determine if nontransformed lung fibroblasts would manifest susceptibility to lovastatin-induced apoptosis similar to that observed in fibroblasts ectopically expressing Myc. Here we show that clinically achievable concentrations of lovastatin induce apoptosis in normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts in vitro, as evidenced by acridine orange staining, terminal transferase <b>nick</b> end <b>translation</b> (TUNEL), and DNA laddering. Apoptosis of human lung fibroblasts was dose- and time-dependent, and blocked by exogenous mevalonic acid. Furthermore, apoptosis was {{associated with}} decreased levels of mature Ras, a molecule directly implicated in fibroblast rescue from apoptosis. The ability of lovastatin to induce fibroblast apoptosis in vivo was examined using a guinea pig wound chamber model. Lovastatin (5 �M, 8 d) reduced granulation tissue formation in the wound chambers by 64. 7 %, with associated ultrastructural evidence of fibroblast apoptosis. These findings support further study of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl–coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors as potential therapy for patients with fibroproliferative disorders...|$|R

50|$|<b>Nick</b> <b>translation</b> (or head translation), {{developed}} in 1977 by Rigby and Paul Berg, is a tagging technique in molecular biology in which DNA Polymerase I {{is used to}} replace some of the nucleotides of a DNA sequence with their labeled analogues, creating a tagged DNA sequence {{which can be used}} as a probe in fluorescent in situ hybridization or blotting techniques.

50|$|In DNA, this {{spontaneous}} deamination is corrected for by {{the removal}} of uracil (product of cytosine deamination and not part of DNA) by uracil-DNA glycosylase, generating an abasic (AP) site. The resulting abasic site is then recognised by enzymes (AP endonucleases) that break a phosphodiester bond in the DNA, permitting the repair of the resulting lesion by replacement with another cytosine. A DNA polymerase may perform this replacement via <b>nick</b> <b>translation,</b> a terminal excision reaction by its 5'-->3' exonuclease activity, followed by a fill-in reaction by its polymerase activity. DNA ligase then forms a phosphodiester bond to seal the resulting nicked duplex product, which now includes a new, correct cytosine. Base excision repair.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nick</b> <b>translation</b> is a {{biological}} {{process in which}} a single stranded DNA nick serves as the marker for DNA polymerase to excise and replace possibly damaged nucleotides. At {{the end of the}} segment that DNA polymerase acts on, DNA ligase must repair the final segment of DNA backbone in order to complete the repair process. In a lab setting, this concept can be applied in that scientists can purposefully induce site-specific, single stranded nicks in DNA in vitro and then introduce the nicked DNA to an environment rich in DNA polymerase and fluorescently or chemically tagged nucleotide. The DNA polymerase will replace the DNA nucleotides with the tagged ones starting at the single stranded nick (site specific).|$|E

50|$|CISH probes are {{approximately}} 20 nucleotides {{in length and}} are designed for DNA targets. They are complementary to the targeted sequence and bind to it after a denaturation and hybridization step. Only a few CISH probes are available commercially, so for most applications {{they have to be}} extracted, amplified, sequenced, labelled and mapped from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). BACs were developed during the Human Genome Project as it was necessary to isolate and amplify short fragments of human DNA for sequencing purposes. Nowadays, BACs can be selected and positioned on the human genome using public databases such as the UCSC Genome Browser. This ensures optimal complementarity and sequence specificity. DNA is extracted from the BAC clones and amplified using a polymerase-based technique, such as degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP)-PCR. Next, the clones are sequenced and their position on the genome is verified. Probe labelling can be carried out by using either random priming or <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> to incorporate biotin or digoxigenin.|$|E
5000|$|This {{process is}} called <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> because the DNA to be {{processed}} is treated with DNase to produce single-stranded [...] "nicks". This is followed by replacement in nicked sites by DNA polymerase I, which elongates the 3' hydroxyl terminus, removing nucleotides by 5'-3' exonuclease activity, replacing them with dNTPs. To radioactively label a DNA fragment {{for use as a}} probe in blotting procedures, one of the incorporated nucleotides provided in the reaction is radiolabeled in the alpha phosphate position. Similarly, a fluorophore can be attached instead for fluorescent labelling, or an antigen for immunodetection. When DNA polymerase I eventually detaches from the DNA, it leaves another nick in the phosphate backbone. The nick has [...] "translated" [...] some distance depending on the processivity of the polymerase. This nick could be sealed by DNA ligase, or its 3' hydroxyl group could serve as the template for further DNA polymerase I activity.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of cDNA libraries usually involves multiple steps, such as isolation of poly A+ mRNA, synthesis of cDNA, cloning of cDNA into plasmid, and amplification of cloned plasmid. The last step, the amplification of insert DNA fragment after cloned in dephosphorylated plasmid vector, {{is done in}} either of two ways. The recombinant DNA can be extracted after amplification in host cells, or the amplification of insert DNA {{can be done by}} the PCR using primers complementary to both ends of the insertion site of the vector. However, the ligation of dephosphorylated nicks or <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> beyond the primer sites is essential in the latter case prior to the PCR (see step 1 in Figure 1 (B)). Taq DNA polymerase, by virtue of its 5 ' to 3 ' exonuclease activity (Ref 1), may be utilized for <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> instead of E. coli DNA polymerase 1.

40|$|Directly labeled {{fluorescent}} DNA probes {{have been}} made by <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> and PCR using dUTP attached to the fluorescent label, Cy 3, with different length linkers. With preparation of probes by PCR we find that linker length affects the efficiency of incorporation of Cy 3 -dUTP, the yield of labeled probe, and the signal intensity of labeled probes hybridized to chromosome target sequences. For <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> and PCR, both the level of incorporation and the hybridization fluorescence signal increased in parallel when the length of the linker arm is increased.

40|$|Human {{metaphase}} chromosomes {{were isolated}} and digested in situ with HaeIII restriction enzyme to detect cytosine and guanine-rich sequences (CpG islands), which {{are known to}} be associated with most of the mammalian genes. Digested DNA was reconstructed by in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> employing digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides. The DNA sequences were revealed by antibodies conjugated either with fluorescein isothiocyanate or 1 -nm colloidal gold. DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide. A sensitive, high resolution method for visualizing three signals, simultaneously excited by a single argon laser line of 488 nm has been developed. The green fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate was detected in combination with the red fluorescence of propidium iodide, and the third signal was imaged by employing the reflectance mode of the confocal microscope after silver enhancement of the gold beads. The high reflectance intensity, the accurate localization and the non-fading properties of colloidal gold made the reaction a valuable tool for the detection of antigens and, as a consequence, of specific DNA sequences in chromosome preparations. Overlaying of three signals allowed the simultaneous observation of distinct structures: total DNA, as well as fluorescein- and gold-labeled sequences after in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation,</b> or total DNA and centromeric sequences of two different chromosome pairs (17 and X) after in situ hybridization. The use of HaeIII restriction enzyme that cut CpG islands combined with in situ <b>nick</b> <b>translation</b> identified the chromosome sites where active, inactive or housekeeping genes can be located. In chromosomes, the fluorescent reaction pattern showed large areas of labeling, while a more defined staining, often organized in spot pairs that resembled an R-like banding, was detected when the reflected mode was used. These results are confirmed by the observation that R-like bands actually are multiple symmetrical spots localized on sister chromatids. In addition, some chromosomes, and in particular 1 and 9, displayed a C-negative banding due to the negativity of the centromeric areas.

Focal accumulations of cells with DNA fragmentation occurred in the fibrous cap, at sites of rupture, close to lipid deposits and necrosis and was always accompanied by the presence of inflammatory cells. Electrophoretic separation of DNA isolated from part of plaques, where the presence of DNA fragmentation had previously been demonstrated by in situ DNA <b>nick</b> <b>translation,</b> resulted in multiple ladders of 180 - 200 base pairs characteristic of apoptosis.
