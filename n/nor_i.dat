The final contract was made with Reinertsen on 20 April 2000, and other involved investors included Fokus Bank, Gjensidige <b>NOR,</b> <b>I.</b> K. Lykke, Eiendomspar, Siemens and Trondheims Næringsbygg. The club received a 47% share of the stadium company, while the municipality received 14% {{in exchange for the}} company taking over the ownership of the land and existing structure. As compensation for losing Lerkendal as an athletics venue, the municipality spent NOK32 million upgrading Øya stadion as the city's new main athletics stadium. NOK20 million was financed by Rosenborg, while the remainder was spent using public funds.|$|E

He compared her to Snooki {{of the reality}} television series Jersey Shore {{and said that the}} show has fallen under Jersey Shores [...] "drunken spell". He wrote: [...] "Regardless of who portrayed the character—because I have absolutely nothing against DeGarmo—why does Y need yet another big name stunt cast?" [...] Additionally, he said: [...] "every time I read something about the new character I find myself asking myself why, just why?" [...] DeGarmo said: [...] "Angelina <b>nor</b> <b>I</b> need to watch ‘Jersey Shore’ for pointers. But we are fans. Definitely Snooki is someone we look up to." ...|$|E

I fully accept in letter and in spirit your summary of the suggested arrangement—subject of course to personnel." [...] But Asquith's mind was already turning to rejection of the Sunday compromise and outright confrontation with Lloyd George.|$|E

Reinforcing these perceptions, Stegner's deputy Richard Scowcroft later recalled that [...] "neither Wally <b>nor</b> <b>I</b> {{thought he had a}} particularly important talent." [...] According to Stone, Stegner [...] "saw Kesey... as a threat to civilization and intellectualism and sobriety" [...] and continued to reject Kesey's Stegner Fellowship applications for the 1959–60 and 1960–61 terms.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 September 1859 the Radical MP Richard Cobden visited Gladstone, who {{recorded}} {{it in his}} diary: [...] "... further conv. with Mr. Cobden on Tariffs & relations with France. We are closely & warmly agreed". Cobden was sent as Britain's representative to the negotiations with France's Michel Chevalier for a free trade treaty between the two countries. Gladstone wrote to Cobden: [...] "... the great aim—the moral and political significance of the act, and its probable and desired fruit in binding the two countries together by interest and affection. [...] Neither you <b>nor</b> <b>I</b> attach for the moment any superlative value to this Treaty {{for the sake of}} the extension of British trade. ...

2500|$|The {{promoter}} became violently {{angry and}} [...] "sailed into us, barehanded", threatening {{to stop the}} fight. Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, [...] "I might kill that skinny guy." [...] The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as [...] "Jack Dempsey", the future champion downed Copelin six times {{in the first round}} and twice in the second. From there, it was a battle of attrition ("Neither Bernie <b>nor</b> <b>I</b> had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek."), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. Dempsey: [...] "In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move." [...] This trial by fire carried with it a $100.00 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, [...] "...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucian Boia {{believes}} that Marghiloman's {{rise to power}} in early 1918 was Ferdinand's compromise with the moderate Germanophiles: [...] " [...] had not turned more German than the Germans, as Carp had done. He had not spoken out against the dynasty, although he let it be understood that the king might reconsider the situation and abdicate. [...] In circumstances where defeat was being acknowledged, Marghiloman {{seemed to be the}} one solution. Carp was too old, too intransigent and too isolated." [...] Moreover, before becoming Premier, Marghiloman had categorically denounced the Pantahuza conspiracy. In Carp's view, Marghiloman's separate peace of 1918 was scandalous, because (he claimed) the territorial demands of Romania's lesser adversaries had taken precedence over Germany's long-term projects. Reputedly, he and Beldiman worked hard to undermine Marghiloman's reputation with the German side. Carp's refusal to participate in the 1918 Parliament was another sign of dissatisfaction. According to his political ally Nenițescu: [...] "Neither Carp <b>nor</b> <b>I</b> shall be taking part in parliamentary procedures. This legislature is a sham. They elected many Liberals and [...] who have fled to Marghiloman's camp." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Nick Clegg registered a formal complaint about Huhne's conduct to Chris Rennard, the party's Chief Whip and returning officer. Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: [...] "the politics of innuendo, mounting false challenges {{and running a}} campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents." [...] Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg {{on a number of}} policy and political issues and was titled [...] "Calamity Clegg". When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it. Asked how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied: [...] "It's quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office... But I can assure you that's not had my authorization." [...] After Clegg complained about what he called [...] "dirty tricks" [...] and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an [...] "over-zealous researcher" [...] and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release. [...] "The document title had not been approved before the document was sent out and neither Chris <b>nor</b> <b>I</b> were aware of it." ...|$|E
