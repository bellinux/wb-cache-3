40|$|Using a {{state-of-the-art}} chemistry-climate model, we analyzed the atmospheric responses {{to increases in}} sea surface temperature (SST). The results showed that increases in SST and the SST meridional gradient could intensify the subtropical westerly jets and significantly weaken the northern polar vortex. In the model runs, global uniform SST increases produced a more {{significant impact on the}} southern stratosphere than the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> while SST gradient increases produced a more significant impact on the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The asymmetric responses of the northern and southern polar stratosphere to SST meridional gradient changes were found to be mainly due to different wave properties and transmissions in the northern and southern atmosphere. Although SST increases may give rise to stronger waves, the results showed that the effect of SST increases on the vertical propagation of tropospheric waves into the stratosphere will vary with height and latitude and be sensitive to SST meridional gradient changes. Both uniform and non-uniform SST increases accelerated the large-scale Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), but the gradient increases of SST between 60 °S and 60 °N resulted in younger mean age-of-air in the stratosphere and a larger increase in tropical upwelling, with a much higher tropopause than from a global uniform 1. 0 K SST increase. © 2014 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of black carbon (soot) aerosol (BCA) {{in the atmosphere}} is of interest for several reasons: (1) Because BCA has the highest absorption cross section of any compound known, it can absorb solar radiation to cause atmospheric warming. (2) Because it is a strong adsorber of gases, it can catalyze heterogeneous reactions to change the chemical composition of the atmosphere. (3) If aircraft are {{a major source of}} BCA, it is an important tracer of aircraft emissions. Analysis for BCA of impactor samples from Arctic and Antarctic deployments, utilizing particle morphology of scanning electron microscopy images, permits the following conclusions: (1) The BCA concentration in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> varies between 0 and 2. 6 ng m- 3 averaging 0. 6 ng/cu m. (2) This BCA loading is commensurate with estimated fuel consumptions in the stratosphere by the current commercial fleet and an emission index E= 0. 03 g BCA per kg fuel burnt which was measured in jet exhaust at al titude. Thus, most stratospheric BCA in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> results from aircraft emissions. The background BCA concentration in the southern stratosphere varies between 0 and 0. 6 ng cu m averaging 0. 1 ng/cu m. This strong meridional gradient implies that stratospheric BCA residence time- is shorter than are mixing times between hemispheres. Projected annual fuel consumption of a future supersonic commercial fleet is 7 E 13 g. This fleet would increase stratospheric BCA loadings by a factor of 2 - 3, because almost all fuel would be burnt above the tropopause. An improved EI(BCA) by a factor of ten would result in an increase of stratospheric BCA loadings by approximately 50 %...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the atmosphere is chaotic by nature and thus has a finite limit of predictability. The chaotic divergence of initial conditions and the predictability are explored here {{in the context of}} the whole atmosphere (from the ground to the thermosphere) using the NCAR Whole Atmo-sphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). From ensemble WACCM simulations, it is found that the early growth of differences in initial conditions is associated with gravity waves and it becomes apparent first in the upper atmosphere and progresses downward. The differences later become more profound on increasingly larger scales, and the growth rates of the differences change in various atmospheric regions and with seasons—corresponding closely with the strength of planetary waves. For example, in December– February the growth rates are largest in the northern and southern mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> while smallest in the southern stratosphere. The growth rates, on the other hand, are not sensitive to the altitude where the small differences are introduced in the initial conditions or the physical nature of the differences. Furthermore, the growth rates in the middle and upper atmosphere are significantly reduced if the lower atmosphere is regularly reinitialized, and the reduction depends on the frequency and the altitude range of the reinitialization. 1...|$|E

40|$|The quasibiennial {{oscillation}} (QBO) {{dominates the}} variability of the equatorial stratosphere and also affects the circulation and temperature of the extratropical region. In this paper we review previous work showing that the mid- to high-latitude circulation is weaker (stronger) when QBO easterlies (westerlies) dominate in the low equatorial stratosphere. The accepted explanation for the extratropical QBO signature {{is based on the}} QBO modulation of upward propagating planetary Rossby waves. This mechanism is consistent with the strong seasonality observed in the extratropical QBO. The largest QBO signature in the northern extratropical stratosphere occurs during winter when the dominating westerly wind allows the penetration of planetary waves in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> However, during the southern winter, planetary waves do not disrupt the southern stratospheric vortex and the largest QBO signature is found during the late spring (November). To further illustrate these mechanisms, we analyze the QBO signature on the mid- to high-latitude circulation of the stratosphere using data from the ERA- 40 reanalysis. The extratropical signature in both hemispheres is evaluated {{as a function of the}} latitude-height structure of the zonal wind in the tropical region in order to determine how the extratropical response depends on the vertical phase structure of the tropical QBO. We also analyze the QBO impact on planetary wave activity in order to determine how this modulation can explain the observed extratropical QBO signal...|$|E
40|$|Interest in the {{distribution}} of black carbon (soot) aerosol (BCA) in the atmosphere is warranted for the following reasons: (1) BCA has the highest absorption cross section of any compound known, thus it can absorb solar radiation to cause atmospheric warming; (2) BCA is a strong adsorber of gases, thus it can catalyze heterogeneous chemical reactions to modify the chemical composition of the atmosphere; (3) If aircraft emission is the major source of atmospheric BCA, it can serve as an atmospheric tracer of aircraft exhaust. We collect BCA particles {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 02 micrometer diameter by wires mounted on both the DC- 8 and ER- 2 aircraft. After return to the laboratory, the wires are examined with a field emission scanning electron microscope to identify BCA particles by their characteristic morphology. Typically, BCA exists in the atmosphere as small particles of complex morphology. The particle sizes at the source are measured in tens of Angstrom units; after a short residence time in the atmosphere, individual particles coalesce to loosely packed agglomerates of typical dimensions 0. 01 to 0. 1 micrometer. We approximate the size of each BCA aggregate by that of a sphere of equivalent volume. This is done by computing the volume of a sphere whose diameter is the mean between averaged minimum and maximum dimensions of the BCA particle. While this procedure probably underestimates the actual surface area, it permits us to compare BCA size distributions among themselves and with other types of aerosols. When statistically justified, we fit lognormal distributions to the data points to determine number concentrations, geometric mean radii, standard deviations, BCA surface areas and volumes. Results to date permit the following conclusions: (1) BCA concentration in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> averages 0. 6 ng per cubic meters. This amount is one part in 10 (exp 4) after a volcanic eruption (e. g., Pinatubo) increasing to about one percent during volcanic quiescence. In the northern troposphere, BCA concentration averages 3. 2 ng per cubic meters, or 0. 3 percent of the background aerosol. (2) Applying an BCA emission index EI(BCA) = 5 x 10 (exp - 5), measured in the exhaust wake of a Concorde supersonic jet aircraft, to realistic estimates of fuel burnt by the current and projected fleets permits us to conclude that: (i) Most BCA in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> results from aircraft emissions; (ii) Most BCA in the northern troposphere results from other sources than aircraft; (iii) A projected supersonic fleet will increase the northern stratospheric BCA concentration by one order of magnitude, unless the emission index is substantially reduced. (3) A strong gradient between the northern and southern hemispheres indicates that mixing across the equator is greatly inhibited in relation to atmospheric residence times of BCA. (4) The single scatter albedo of BCA/"background" aerosol mixtures suggests a cooling effect for most of the globe; an exemption is the Arctic because of the high surface albedo of the snow/ice covered earth's surface...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of the {{kinematics}} of {{the lower}} stratospheric Arctic vortex {{during the winter of}} 1991 - 1992 using the contour advection with surgery technique reveal three distinct events in which there was substantial intrusion of midlatitude air into the vortex, in apparent contradiction of the view that the polar vortex constitutes an isolated air mass. Two of these events, in late January and mid-February, were well documented. They were predicted in high-resolution forecasts by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, most clearly in experimental forecasts with reduced diffusion. Direct confirmation of the presence of the intrusions and of their calculated locations was provided by aerosol observations from the airborne differential absorption laser lidar aboard the NASA DC- 8, taken as part of the second Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition campaign; aerosol-rich air of midlatitude origin was seen in the expected position of the intrusions. The reality of the February event was also confirmed by in situ measurements from the NASA ER- 2. Such events may be significant for the chemical processes taking place within the winter vortex. The intrusions were evidently related to the meteorology of the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> during this winter and in particular to persistent tropospheric blocking over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and western Europe and concomitant ridging into the lower stratospheric vortex in this region. Nevertheless, preliminary investigations have indicated that such events are not uncommon in other northern hemisphere winters, although no such events were found in the southern hemisphere during the Antarctic winter of 1987...|$|E

However, direct evidence of this interaction {{has yet to be}} observed. Using observations from the South Pole meteor radar (SPMR) system we can unam- biguously determine the structure of the non-migrating semidiurnal tide in the meridional wind field.

Experiments are performed using data from four years, 1982 - 84 and 1986. Numerical solutions are found for the structures of zonal wavenumbers 1 to 3 throughout the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere.</b> In one series of experiments, a linear model is employed, with forcing only by stationary waves at the lower boundary. This model reproduces the gross features of the stratospheric stationary waves, but the wave amplitudes are much less than those observed in nature. In a second series of experiments, the January means of the transient vorticity and heat flux divergences are calculated using observed data, and applied as an additional forcing term in the model, along with the lower boundary forcing. The model yields significantly larger wave amplitudes, closer to those observed in nature, when forcing by transients is included. In a third series of experiments, a model which includes the nonlinear interactions among the stationary waves is employed, with forcing only by the waves at the lower boundary. This yields somewhat better results than the linear model, but {{the change in the}} wave structure due to the inclusion of nonlinear interactions among the stationary waves is smaller than that due to the inclusion of forcing by transients.

40|$|Planetary wave {{breaking}} through {{the depth of the}} <b>Northern</b> Hemispheric <b>stratosphere</b> is observed in daily ERA- 40 reanalysis data. Strong wave breaking along the vortex edge is objectively diagnosed by noting the large-scale overturning of potential vorticity contours on isentropic surfaces spanning the stratospheric vortex. Breaking events show distinctly different climatologies depending on whether they occur along the upper or lower portion of the stratospheric vortex. During early winter there is a strong negative correlation between the frequency of breaking events in these two regions. Frequent wave breaking in the lower stratosphere in early winter appears to both shield the upper portion of the vortex from wave disturbances and reduce the net upward wave activity flux into the troposphere, thereby allowing the vortex to strengthen into mid-winter...|$|R
40|$|The winter {{polar vortex}} on Saturn's largest moon Titan has {{profound}} effects on atmospheric circulation and chemistry {{and for the}} current northern midwinter season is the major dynamical feature of Titan's stratosphere and mesosphere. We use 2 years of observations from Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer to determine cross sections of five independent chemical tracers (HCN, HC 3 N, C 2 H 2, C 3 H 4, and C 4 H 2), which are then used to probe dynamical processes occurring within the vortex. Our results provide compelling evidence that the vortex acts as a strong mixing barrier in the stratosphere and mesosphere, effectively separating a tracer-enriched air mass in the north from air at lower latitudes. In the mesosphere, above {{the level of the}} vortex jet, a tracer-depleted zone extends away from the north pole toward the equator and enrichment is confined to high northern latitudes. However, below this level, mixing processes cause tongues of gas to extend away from the polar region toward the equator. These features are not reproduced by current general circulation models and suggest that a residual polar circulation is present and that waves and instabilities form a more important part of Titan's atmospheric dynamics than previously thought. We also observe an unexpected enrichment of C 4 H 2 in the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> which suggests photochemical polymerization of C 2 H 2. Our observations provide stringent new constraints for dynamical and photochemical models and identify key polar processes for the first time.

40|$|The Lagrangian model ATTILA (atmospheric tracer {{transport}} in a Lagrangian model) {{has been}} developed to treat the global-scale transport of passive trace species in the atmosphere {{within the framework of}} a general circulation model (GCM). ATTILA runs online within the GCM ECHAM 4 and uses the GCM produced wind field to advect the centrois of 80. 000 to 180. 000 constant mass air parcels into which the model atmosphere is divided. Each trace constituent is thereby represented by a mass mixing ratio in each parcel. ATTILA contains state-of-the-art parameterizations of convection, turbulent boundary layer mixing, and interparcel transport and provides an algorithm to map the tracer concentrations from the trajectories to the ECHAM model grid. We use two experiments to evaluate the transport characteristics of ATTILA against observations and the standard semiLagrangian transport scheme of ECHAM. In the first experiment we simulate the distribution of the short-lived tracer Radon (" 2 " 2 " 2 Rn) in order to examine fast vertical transport over continents, and long-range transport from the continents to remote areas. In the second experiment, we simulate the distribution of radiocarbon (" 1 " 4 C) that was injected into the <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere</b> during the nuclear weapon tests in the early 60 ties, in order to examine upper tropospheric and stratospheric transport characteristics. ATTILA compares well to the observations and in many respects to the semiLagrangian scheme. However, contrary to the semiLagrangian scheme, ATTILA shows a greatly reduced meridional transport in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, and a reduced downward flux from the stratosphere to the troposphere, especially in midlatitudes. Since both transport schemes use the same model meteorology, we conclude that the often cited enhanced meridional transport and overestimated downward flux in ECHAM as described above is rather due to the numerical properties of the semiLagrangian scheme than due to an incorrect meteorology. Furthermore, since ATTILA is a numerically nondiffusive scheme, it is able to maintain steep gradients, which compare better to the observations than the rather smooth gradients produced by the semiLagrangian scheme. In the uppermost model domain, on the other hand, ATTILA exhibts a faster transport than the semiLagrangian scheme. (orig.) 66 refs.

40|$|The age of {{stratospheric air}} is {{calculated}} over 22 yr of the ERA-Interim reanalysis using an off-line Lagrangian transport model and heating rates. At low and mid-latitudes, {{the mean age}} of air is in good agreement with observed ages from aircraft flights, high altitude balloons and satellite observations of CO 2 and SF 6 . The mid-latitude age spectrum in the lower stratosphere exhibits a long tail with a peak at 0. 5 yr, which is maximum {{at the end of the}} winter, and a secondary flat maximum between 4 and 5 yr due to the combination of fast and slow branches of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the reinforced barrier effect of the jet. At higher altitudes, the age spectrum exhibits the footprint of the annual modulation of the deep Brewer-Dobson circulation. The variability of the mean age is analysed through a decomposition in terms of annual cycle, QBO, ENSO and trend. The annual modulation is the dominating signal in the lower stratosphere and in the tropical pipe with amplitude up to one year. The phase of the oscillation is opposite in both hemisphere beyond 20 &deg; and is also reversed below and above 25 km with maximun arising in mid-March in the Northern Hemisphere and in mid-September in the Southern Hemisphere. The tropical pipe signal is in phase with the lower southern stratosphere and the mid <b>northern</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The maximum amplitude of the QBO modulation is of about 0. 5 yr and is mostly concentrated within the tropics between 25 and 35 km. It lags the QBO wind at 30 hPa by about 8 months. The ENSO signal is small and limited to the lower northen stratosphere. The trend is significant and negative, of the order of − 0. 3 to − 0. 5 yr dec&minus; 1 , within the lower stratosphere in the Southern Hemisphere and under 40 &deg; N in the Northern Hemisphere below 25 km. It is positive (of the order of 0. 3 yr dec&minus; 1 ) in the mid stratosphere but there is no region of consistent significance. This suggests that the shallow and deep Brewer-Dobson circulations may evolve in opposite directions. It is however difficult to estimate a reliable long-term trend from only 22 yr of data. For instance, a positive trend is found in the lower stratosphere if only the second half of the period is considered in agreement with MIPAS SF 6 data excepted in the northern polar region and at high altitude. Finally, it is found that the long lasting influence of the Pinatubo eruption can be seen on the age of air from June 1991 until the end of 1993 and can bias the statistics encompassing this period. In our analysis, this eruption shifts the trend towards negative values by about 0. 2 to 0. 3 yr dec&minus; 1 ...|$|E

When the wavenumber 1 10 -mb height data are projected onto the phase plane defined by the 10 -mb zonal-mean winds and wavenumber 1 100 -mb heights, three preferred regimes are evident. The small-amplitude mode separates into a strong zonal wind-weak wave regime and a weak zonal wind-weak wave regime. The large-amplitude mode is an intermediate zonal wind-strong wave regime. Transitions between the large-amplitude regime and the weak zonal wind-weak wave regime are found to be associated with major stratospheric warmings.

(2009) for most of the Northern mid-latitudes, the middle stratosphere in the tropics, and parts of the Southern mid-latitudes, {{as well as for the}} Southern polar upper stratosphere. Multi-year decrease of age of air was found for the lowermost and the upper stratospheric tropics, for parts of Southern mid-latitudes, and for the Northern polar regions. Analysis of the amplitudes and phases of the seasonal variation shed light on the coupling of stratospheric regions to each other. In particular, the <b>Northern</b> mid-latitude <b>stratosphere</b> is well coupled to the tropics, while the <b>Northern</b> lowermost mid-latitudinal <b>stratosphere</b> is decoupled, confirming the separation of the shallow branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation from the deep branch. We suggest an overall increased tropical upwelling, together with weakening of mixing barriers, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, as a hypothetical model to explain the observed pattern of linear multi-year increase/decrease, and amplitudes and phase shifts of the seasonal variation...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we aim to}} {{reconstruct}} a new database of monthly zonal mean distribution of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at global scale extending from the upper-troposphere (UT) to the stratosphere (S). This product {{can be used for}} models validation in the UT/S, in particular, their ability to reproduce the plausible feature of the CO 2 inversion gradient occurring in the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere lowermost <b>stratosphere</b> during summer. To do so, we investigate the ability of reanalysis-driven TRACZILLA trajectory model to construct the variability of CO 2 in the UT/S. Using 10 year backward trajectories and tropospheric observations of CO 2, we reconstruct upper-tropospheric and stratospheric CO 2 over the 2000 - 2010 period. The inter-comparisons of the calculated CO 2 with mid-latitude vertical profiles measured in situ from aircraft and balloons and,as well as, with reanalysis-driven CLaMS trajectory model exhibit a remarkable agreement. That demonstrates the potential of the TRACZILLA and CLaMS models {{to reconstruct}} CO 2 in the UT/S. The zonal mean distribution exhibits relatively large CO 2 in the tropical lower stratosphere due to the seasonal variation of the tropical upwelling of Brewer-Dobson circulation. During winter and spring, the tropical band is relatively isolated but is less confined during summer and autumn. Thus, high CO 2 values are more readily transported out of the tropics to the mid and high latitude <b>stratosphere</b> into the <b>northern</b> lowermost <b>stratosphere</b> around 15 km during summer and autumn. The shape of the vertical profiles suggests that relatively high CO 2 above 20 km altitude mainly enters the stratosphere through tropical upwelling. CO 2 mixing ratio is relatively low in the polar and tropical regions above 25 km. On average the CO 2 mixing ratio decreases with altitude by 6 - 8 ppmv from the UT to stratosphere (e. g. up to 35 km) and is nearly constant above 35 km...|$|R
40|$|Ozone and {{temperature}} {{profiles of the}} satellite microwave limb sounder Aura/MLS are used for the derivation of the middle atmospheric response to the geomagnetic superstorm of 9 November 2004. We find a destruction of the tertiary ozone layer at 0. 022 hPa (77 km) in the northern winter hemisphere lasting for about one week. This effect is surely due to the solar proton event (SPE) of November 2004. At the same time, the zonal mean temperature is enhanced by 5 – 10 K in the northern polar mesosphere. On the other hand, the zonal mean temperature is decreased by 5 – 10 K in the <b>northern</b> polar <b>stratosphere.</b> We {{do not think that}} the strong temperature perturbations are directly related to the SPE. It seems that the polar vortex was moved by the geomagnetic storm, and this vortex movement caused the strong temperature variations in the zonal mean. However, internal variability of temperature in the polar middle atmosphere in winter without any significant link to the geomagnetic storm cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the <b>Northern</b> polar <b>stratosphere</b> has been established from observations and atmospheric modeling. Here a systematic inter-comparison of {{the sensitivity of the}} modeled stratosphere to ENSO in Chemistry Climate Models (CCMs) is reported. This work uses results from a number of the CCMs included in the 2006 ozone assessment. In the lower stratosphere, the mean of all model simulations reports a warming of the polar vortex during strong ENSO events in February–March, consistent with but smaller than the estimate from satellite observations and ERA 40 reanalysis. The anomalous warming is associated with an anomalous dynamical increase of column ozone north of 70 � N that is accompanied by coherent column ozone decrease in the Tropics, in agreement with that deduced from the NIWA column ozone database, implying an increased residual circulation in the mean of all model simulations during ENSO. The spread in the model responses is partly due to the large internal stratospheric variability and it is shown that it crucially depends on the representation of the tropospheric ENSO teleconnection in the models...|$|R
40|$|Global {{simulations}} {{with the}} Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) using artificial tracers of air mass origin {{are used to}} analyze transport mechanisms from the Asian monsoon region into the lower stratosphere. In a case study, the transport of air masses from the Asian monsoon anticyclone originating in India/China by an eastward-migrating anticyclone which broke off from the main anticyclone on 20 September 2012 and filaments separated at the northeastern flank of the anticyclone are analyzed. Enhanced contributions of young air masses (younger than 5 months) are found within the separated anticyclone confined at the top by the thermal tropopause. Further, these air masses are confined by the anticyclonic circulation and, on the polar side, by the subtropical jet such that the vertical structure resembles a bubble within the upper troposphere. Subsequently, these air masses are transported eastwards along the subtropical jet and enter the lower stratosphere by quasi-horizontal transport in a region of double tropopauses most likely associated with Rossby wave breaking events. As a result, thin filaments with enhanced signatures of tropospheric trace gases were measured in the lower stratosphere over Europe during the TACTS/ESMVal campaign in September 2012 in very good agreement with CLaMS simulations. Our simulations demonstrate that source regions in Asia and in the Pacific Ocean {{have a significant impact}} on the chemical composition of the lower <b>stratosphere</b> of the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere. Young, moist air masses, in particular at the end of the monsoon season in September/October 2012, flooded the extratropical lower <b>stratosphere</b> in the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere with contributions of up to [*]≈[*]  30  % at 380  K (with the remaining fraction being aged air). In contrast, the contribution of young air masses to the Southern Hemisphere is much lower. At the end of October 2012, approximately 1. 5  ppmv H 2 O is found in the lower <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere <b>stratosphere</b> (at 380  K) from source regions both in Asia and in the tropical Pacific compared to a mean water vapor content of [*]≈[*]  5  ppmv. In addition to this main transport pathway from the Asian monsoon anticyclone to the east along the subtropical jet and subsequent transport into the <b>northern</b> lower <b>stratosphere,</b> a second horizontal transport pathway out of the anticyclone to the west into the tropics (TTL) is found in agreement with MIPAS HCFC- 22 measurements...|$|R
40|$|Chemistry-climate models (CCMs) project {{an earlier}} return of {{northern}} mid-latitude total column ozone to 1980 values {{compared to the}} southern mid-latitudes. The chemical and dynamical drivers of this hemispheric difference are investigated in this study. The hemispheric asymmetry in return dates is a robust result across different CCMs and is qualitatively independent of the method used to estimate return dates. However, the differences in dates of return to 1980 levels between the southern and northern mid-latitudes can vary between 0 and 30 yr across the range of CCM projections analyzed. An attribution analysis performed with two CCMs shows that chemically-induced changes in ozone are the major driver of the earlier return of ozone to 1980 levels in northern mid-latitudes; transport changes are of minor importance. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} fact that the spread in the simulated hemispheric difference in return dates across an ensemble of twelve models is only weakly related to the spread in the simulated hemispheric asymmetry of trends in the strength of the Brewer–Dobson circulation. The causes for chemically-induced asymmetric ozone trends relevant for the total column ozone return date differences are found to be (i) stronger increases in ozone production due to enhanced NOx concentrations in the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere lowermost <b>stratosphere</b> and troposphere, (ii) stronger decreases in the destruction rates of ozone by the NOx cycle in the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere lower <b>stratosphere</b> linked to effects of dynamics and temperature on NOx concentrations and (iii) an increasing efficiency of heterogeneous ozone destruction by Cly in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes as a result of decreasing temperatures...|$|R

It is found that while wave 1 oscillates in response to wave-mean flow interactions, the oscillations in the amplitude of wave 2 are driven primarily by wave-wave interactions. Experiments with a barotropic model reveal that the timing of the strongest wave-wave interactions is determined by the wave 1 interaction with the mean flow...|$|R
