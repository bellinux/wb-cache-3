5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in the Telegraph, Michael Hogan <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Thursday's hour long {{episode was}} slow and stagey to reveal Jane as the killer. Hogan <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the reveal was the [...] "marquee event of a masterfully managed anniversary week;" [...] and loved the nostalgic touches {{throughout}} the week. He also <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> despite being 88 June Brown was still superb, but felt {{that there were a}} few too many sub plots and that although Kathy Beale's return was gasp out loud it was superfluous to the story. Brendan O'Neill <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Thursday's reveal was a thrilling return to form for the show.

Hogan <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> thankfully nothing went wrong in Friday's live episode and instead we got a [...] "triumphant, heartbreaking half-hour of television." [...] Hogan <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the acting was faultless and singled out Woodyatt, Brett and Dyer <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> they were superb and stated that he was impressed with the younger members of the cast (Hardy, Hill, Carrington and Keene).|$|R

Krohn <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E

Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar.
