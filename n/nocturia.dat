25|$|Validated {{questionnaires}} {{such as the}} American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), {{and more}} recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and <b>nocturia)</b> are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Early {{prostate}} cancer usually has no clear symptoms. Sometimes, however, {{prostate cancer}} does cause symptoms, often {{similar to those}} of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination, <b>nocturia</b> (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, hematuria (blood in the urine), and dysuria (painful urination). A study based on the 1998 Patient Care Evaluation in the US found that about a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had one or more such symptoms, while two-thirds had no symptoms.|$|E
25|$|People {{are asked}} to observe, record and measure when and how much their child voids and drinks, as well as {{associated}} symptoms. A voiding diary {{in the form of}} frequency volume chart records voided volume along with time of each micturition for at least 24 hours. Frequency volume chart is enough for patients with complaint of <b>nocturia</b> and frequency only. If other symptoms are also present then a detailed bladder diary must be maintained. In a bladder diary, times of micturition and voided volume, incontinence episodes, pad usage and other information such as fluid intake, the degree of urgency and the degree of incontinence are recorded.|$|E
500|$|Bladder: Symptomatology of the {{urinary tract}} {{is common in}} MS. Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for <b>nocturia</b> and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder.|$|E

5000|$|A {{significant}} number of <b>nocturia</b> cases occur {{from a combination of}} causes. Mixed <b>nocturia</b> is more common than many realize and is a combination of nocturnal polyuria and decreased NBC. In a study of 194 <b>nocturia</b> patients, 7% were determined to have simple nocturnal polyuria, 57% had decreased NBC, and 36% had a mixed cause of the two. [...] The cause of <b>nocturia</b> is multifactorial and often unrelated to an underlying urological condition. Mixed <b>nocturia</b> is diagnosed through the maintenance and analysis of bladder diaries of the patient. Assessment of cause contributions are done through formulas.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{show that}} 5-15% {{of people who}} are 20-50 years old, 20-30% {{of people who are}} 50-70 years old, and 10-50% of people 70+ years old, urinate at least twice a night. <b>Nocturia</b> becomes more common with age. More than 50 percent of men and women over the age of 60 have been {{measured}} to have <b>nocturia</b> in many communities. Even more over the age of 80 are shown to experience symptoms of <b>nocturia</b> nightly. <b>Nocturia</b> symptoms also often worsen with age. Although <b>nocturia</b> rates are about the same for both genders, data shows that there is a higher prevalence in younger women than younger men and older men than older women.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs that}} are often used to treat <b>nocturia</b> include oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, and other antimuscarinic agents. These drugs are {{especially}} used in {{patients who suffer from}} <b>nocturia</b> due to an overactive bladder and urgency incontinence because they help bladder contractility.|$|E
50|$|If {{the cause}} of <b>nocturia</b> {{is related to the}} {{obstruction}} of the prostate or an overactive bladder, surgical actions may be sought out. Transurethral prostatectomy/incision of the prostate and surgical correction of the pelvic organ prolapse, sacral nerve stimulation, clam cystoplasty, and detrusor myectomy are both treatment options and can help alleviate the symptoms of <b>nocturia.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{there is}} no cure for <b>nocturia,</b> there are many actions people can take to manage their symptoms. Prohibiting the intake of {{caffeine}} and alcohol has helped some individuals with the disorder. Compression stockings may be worn through the day to prevent fluid from accumulating in the legs, unless heart failure or another contraindication is present. Drugs that increase the passing of urine can help decrease the third spacing of fluid, but they could also increase <b>nocturia.</b> A common action patients take is to not consume any fluids hours before bedtime, which especially helps people with urgency incontinence. However, a study on this showed that it reduced voiding at night by only a small amount and is not ideal for managing <b>nocturia</b> in older people. For people suffering from nocturnal polyuria, this action does not help at all because of irregular AVP levels and the inability to respond with the inhibition of increased voiding. Fluid restriction also does not help people who have <b>nocturia</b> due to gravity-induced third spacing of fluid because fluid is mobilized when they lie in a reclining position.|$|E
50|$|The {{two primary}} causes of <b>nocturia</b> are hormone {{imbalances}} and vesical problems. It is also tied to circadian biology.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms, {{less likely}} in chronic obstruction, are pain {{radiating}} to the T11 to T12 dermatomes, anuria, <b>nocturia,</b> or polyuria.|$|E
50|$|A {{frequent}} need {{to urinate}} at night is called <b>nocturia.</b> Frequent urination is {{strongly associated with}} frequent incidents of urinary urgency.|$|E
50|$|A {{quality of}} life test for people who {{experience}} <b>nocturia</b> was published in 2004. The pilot study was conducted only on men.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>nocturia</b> is little-known to {{the general}} public, some {{research}} suggests that more than 60% of people are negatively affected by it. The resulting insomnia and sleep deprivation can cause exhaustion, changes in mood, sleepiness, impaired productivity, fatigue, increased risk of accidents, and cognitive dysfunction. [...] 25% of falls that older individuals experience happen during the night, of which 25% occur while waking up to void. In addition, <b>nocturia</b> may also increase risk of mortality and morbidity.|$|E
50|$|Flavoxate is {{indicated}} for symptomatic relief of interstitial cystitis, dysuria, urgency, <b>nocturia,</b> suprapubic pain, frequency and incontinence as may occur in cystitis, prostatitis, urethritis, urethrocystitis/urethrotrigonitis.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} a {{constellation}} of irritative bladder symptoms (also sometimes referred to as lower urinary tract symptoms), which includes <b>nocturia</b> and urinary frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Prevalence {{increases}} with age. The prevalence of <b>nocturia</b> in older men is about 78%. Older {{men have a}} higher incidence of LUTS than older women.|$|E
5000|$|Overactive bladder is {{characterized}} by a group of four symptoms: urgency, urinary frequency, <b>nocturia,</b> and urge incontinence. Urge incontinence is not present in the [...] "dry" [...] classification.|$|E
50|$|Desmopressin {{has some}} benefit in {{adults who have}} {{problems}} with night time urination (known as <b>nocturia).</b> The FDA approved this use for those who make excess urine in 2017.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nocturia,</b> a {{frequent}} {{need to get}} up and urinate at night. It differs from enuresis, or bed-wetting, in which the person does not arouse from sleep, but the bladder nevertheless empties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nocturia</b> {{has four}} major {{underlying}} causes: global polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, bladder storage disorders, or mixed cause. The first two processes {{are due to}} irregular levels of AVP or ANH. The third process is a vesical problem.|$|E
50|$|Urinary urgency is a sudden, {{compelling}} urge to urinate. It is often, {{though not}} necessarily, associated with urinary incontinence, polyuria, <b>nocturia,</b> and interstitial cystitis. It tends to increase with age. When uncontrollable, it causes urge incontinence.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosing <b>nocturia</b> {{requires}} {{knowing the}} patient's nocturnal urine volume (NUV). The ICS defines NUV as “the total volume of urine passed {{between the time}} the individual goes to bed {{with the intention of}} sleeping and the time of waking with the intention of rising.” Thus, NUV excludes the last void before going to bed, but includes the first morning void if the urge to urinate woke the patient. Although not every patient needs treatment, most people seek treatment for severe <b>nocturia,</b> waking up to void more than 2-3 times per night. The amount of sleep a patient gets, and the amount they intend to get, are also considered in a diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nocturia,</b> polyuria, and {{polydipsia}} from reduced urinary concentrating capacity (i.e. nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) {{as can be}} seen in hypercalcemia, medullary nephrocalcinosis of any cause, or {{in children}} with Bartter syndrome in whom essential tubular salt reabsorption is compromised.|$|E
50|$|Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder {{syndrome}} (IC/PBS) is {{a condition}} where patients struggle with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, pressure and/or pain, as well as <b>nocturia</b> (frequent urination at night), dyspareunia (painful intercourse), pain and/or discomfort while sitting in a car, while driving and/or traveling. PPS, as Elmiron, is the only oral medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} IC. Elmiron is available as pills or as a direct infusion into the bladder. A review of four placebo-controlled studies concluded that PPS was significantly more effective than placebo for pain, urgency and frequency of urination, but not different from placebo for <b>nocturia</b> (needing to urinate during the night).|$|E
50|$|Validated {{questionnaires}} {{such as the}} American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), {{and more}} recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and <b>nocturia)</b> are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Bladder outlet {{obstruction}} (BOO) can {{be caused}} by BPH. Symptoms are abdominal pain, a continuous feeling of a full bladder, frequent urination, acute urinary retention (inability to urinate), pain during urination (dysuria), problems starting urination (urinary hesitancy), slow urine flow, starting and stopping (urinary intermittency), and <b>nocturia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Nocturia</b> (derived from Latin nox, night, and Greek τα ούρα, urine), {{also called}} nycturia (Greek νυκτουρία), {{is defined by}} the International Continence Society (ICS) as “the {{complaint}} that the individual has to wake at night one or more times for voiding (i.e. to urinate).” Its causes are varied and, in many patients, difficult to discern.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nocturia</b> is {{a symptom}} where the person {{complains}} of interrupted sleep because of an urge to void and, like the urinary frequency component, is affected by similar lifestyle and medical factors. Individual waking events are not considered abnormal, one study in Finland established two or more voids per night as affecting quality of life.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{symptoms}} include cardiac arrhythmias, especially in those taking digoxin, fatigue, nausea, vomiting (emesis), anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, & paralytic ileus. If renal impairment occurs as a result, manifestations can include polyuria, <b>nocturia,</b> and polydipsia. Psychiatric manifestation can include emotional instability, confusion, delirium, psychosis, & stupor. Limbus sign seen in eye due to hypercalcemia.|$|E
50|$|The 7 {{symptoms}} questions include {{feeling of}} incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining and <b>nocturia,</b> each referring to {{during the last}} month, and each involving assignment of a score from 1 to 5 {{for a total of}} maximum 35 points. The 8th question of quality of life is assigned a score of 1 to 6.|$|E
50|$|Prostatic artery {{embolization}} {{is primarily}} {{used as an}} alternative therapy to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland that results in numerous symptoms, {{many of which are}} related to the urinary system. Some of the most common urinary symptoms are <b>nocturia,</b> weak stream, increased urinary frequency and sense of incomplete bladder emptying.|$|E
5000|$|Nocturnal {{polyuria}} {{is defined}} as an increase in urine production during the night but with a proportional decrease in daytime urine production that results in a normal 24-hour urine volume. With the 24-hour urine production within normal limits, nocturnal polyuria can be translated to having a nocturnal polyuria index (NPi) greater than 35% of the normal 24-hour urine volume. NPi is calculated simply by dividing NUV by the 24-hour urine volume. [...] Similar to the inability of control urination, a disruption of arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels has been proposed for <b>nocturia.</b> Compared with the normal patients, <b>nocturia</b> patients have a nocturnal decrease in AVP level. Other causes of nocturnal polyuria include diseases such as congestive heart failure, nephritic syndrome and liver failure; or lifestyle patterns such as excessive nighttime drinking. The increased airway resistance {{that is associated with}} obstructive sleep apnea may also lead to nocturnal polyuria. Obstructive sleep apnea sufferers have shown to have increases in renal sodium and water excretion that are mediated by elevated plasma ANH levels.|$|E
50|$|Urinary urgency often {{occurs as}} a result of {{irritation}} and/or inflammation of the bladder wall (urothelium). In interstitial cystitis, urinary frequency and urgency are the hallmark symptoms, in addition to <b>nocturia</b> and dyspareunia. In many cases, however, these symptoms are often exacerbated by the consumption of certain foods and/or beverages such as caffeine, particularly coffee, regular tea, green tea, soda, diet soda and fruit juice. Cranberry juice, for example, often causes extreme urgency in patients.|$|E
