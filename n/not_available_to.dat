In 2010, United States government stated that he had died on 2 September 1994.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – {{at the time they}} were <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> buy in England. He would wear the customized boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate that he got through countless pairs every season.|$|E

5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E

5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> an enemy alien. They are also <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E

Although the main house was restored in 1996, funding was <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> restore the smaller buildings until 2006, with construction completed in spring 2007. The rancho is on State Route 126, but little is visible from the highway.|$|E

Stu was originally designed as a withered, old, John Travolta-esque figure and was to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, Hartman was <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> dub the voice and so Hank Azaria took over the role.|$|E

Many songs from the original recording were omitted because of copyright issues with the original artists, including the R group Destiny's Child.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|Norcross was afforded {{a privileged}} {{education}} that was <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> many young ladies of her generation. At 16 years of age, {{she graduated from}} Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The nature of her essays {{provide insight into the}} woman she would become: one who would successfully operate in a male-oriented society, had an interest in bettering the plight of others, and appreciated historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E

5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> certain civilizations.|$|E
5|$|The Crystarium is a {{leveling}} system {{consisting of}} six crystals and resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. Each crystal in the Crystarium {{represents one of}} the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies. The full Crystarium is <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the player {{at the beginning of the}} game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.|$|E
