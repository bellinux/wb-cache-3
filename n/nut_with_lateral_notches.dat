50|$|Recent {{excavations}} have unearthed what {{is thought}} to be the tombs of Shield Jaguar and Lady Xoc within Structure 23. Discovered in association with the female burial attributed to Lady Xoc were 146 prismatic obsidian blades, each <b>with</b> two <b>lateral</b> <b>notches</b> on the edges. These were located in what is known as Element 21 in Room 1 of Structure 23 at Yaxchilan. Due to the association with Lady Xoc’s burial in Room 2, these have been interpreted as being depicted on Lintel 24. The original interpretation of the studded rope was that there were thorns attached, but this new evidence in context has caused the interpretation to shift. We now know that it was a rope studded with obsidian blades used in the ritual, and may have the very physical shards depicted themselves. Lady Xoc’s burial is known as Tomb 3. Shield Jaguar’s remains lay not far, in Room 3. This is referred to as Tomb 2. Elaborate grave goods were found in association with both burials.|$|R
40|$|Anisotropy of {{fracture}} toughness characteristics of an orthotropic plastically prestrained material under uniaxial cyclic loading is studied experimentally. The study {{was carried out}} using flat specimens <b>with</b> a <b>lateral</b> <b>notch.</b> The specimens are cut out from the rolled strip of titanium alloy at different angles to an anisotropy axis. As the {{fracture toughness}} characteristics, a number of cycles to failure, critical crack size, critical value of a stress intensity factor, and crack growth rate on the interval of crack stable propagation are used. It is shown that the more strong crack strength is observed, if the crack propagates perpendicularly to the direction of rolling. Such regularity is attributed {{to the fact that}} in the case under consideration the crack necessitates to cross the additional number of grain boundaries compared with the case, when it propagates along the rolling direction. Prestraining the sheet strip in the range of small plastic strains under uniaxial tension in the rolling direction leads to deterioration of the anisotropy of the fracture toughness characteristics. If the specimen axis is oriented at an angle to the anisotropy axis, the crack propagates not along the normal to the load applied, but at the angle to it. The value of such deviation depends on the load orientation relative to anisotropy axes. In this case fracture occurs by combination of opening and transverse-shear modes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the issue}} of defect nucleation due to fatigue loading in notched components where cracks occur in {{the proximity of the}} zone where the major stress gradient occurs. On the basis of recent experimental results where the defects do not nucleate at the notch tip, the effective stress evaluated by means of the implicit gradient approach, can explain the reasons for this apparent discrepancy. Furthermore, in order to find a kind of notch that underlines the nucleation outside the maximum stress zone, rectangular <b>lateral</b> <b>notches</b> have been investigated. Rectangular notches could provide an interesting theoretical and experimental benchmark or reference case in order to validate effective stress definitions. The linear elastic stress field at edges, corners and in the surrounding material of rectangular, sharp or rounded <b>lateral</b> <b>notches</b> has been analysed by means of the implicit gradient approach.

Pistachio (Pistacia vera) <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> {{shell and}} kernel defects detract from {{consumer}} acceptance and, in some cases, {{may be more}} prone to insect damage, mold decay, and/or aflatoxin contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop imaging algorithms to improve sorting of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> the following shell defects: oily stains, dark stains, adhering hull, and the following kernel defects: navel orangeworm (NOW) damage, fungal decay, and Aspergillus molds, all of which indicate risk of aflatoxin contamination. Imaging algorithms were developed to distinguish normal nuts from those <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> oily stains, dark stains, and adhering hull as well as nuts having kernel defects. Image algorithm testing on a validation data set showed that nuts having oily stain, dark stain, or adhering hull could be distinguished from normal <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> an accuracy of 98 %.

40|$|Background: Exposure of the {{insertion}} {{site of the}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is important for appropriate tunnel placement in ACL reconstruction surgery. However, observing the femoral ACL insertion site via the standard anterolateral portal is sometimes difficult. In this study, we compared views of the femoral ACL insertion site between 30 -degree and the 45 -degree arthroscopes. Methods: We first inserted the 30 -degree and the 45 -degree arthroscope into the anterolateral portal of a knee simulator in which we had drawn a lattice pattern on the <b>lateral</b> intercondylar <b>notch</b> based on the quadrant method. Next, we compared the arthroscopic views provided by the 30 -degree and 45 -degree arthroscopes during ACL reconstruction surgery by measuring {{the area of the}} <b>lateral</b> intercondylar <b>notch</b> visible through each of the arthroscopes. Results: In the knee simulator, the 45 -degree arthroscope showed the entire area of the <b>lateral</b> intercondylar <b>notch,</b> whereas the 30 -degree arthroscope had to be introduced more deeply to show the most superior and posterior quadrant, where the attachment of the anteromedial bundle of ACL is located. During the ACL reconstruction, the area of the <b>lateral</b> intercondylar <b>notch</b> in the field of view was larger through the 45 -degree arthroscope than through the 30 -degree arthroscope.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to determine the optimal entry points and trajectories for cervical pedicle screw insertion into C 3 – 7. The study involved 40 patients (M:F =  20 : 20) with various cervical diseases. A surgical simulation program was used to construct three-dimensional spine models from cervical spine axial CT images. Axial, sagittal, and coronal plane data were simultaneously processed to determine the ideal pedicle trajectory (a line passing {{through the center of}} the pedicle on coronal, sagittal, and transverse CT images). The optimal entry points on the lateral masses were then identified. Horizontal offsets and vertical offsets of the optimal entry points were measured from three different anatomical landmarks: the <b>lateral</b> <b>notch,</b> the center of the superior edge and the center of lateral mass. The transverse angle and sagittal angles of the ideal pedicle trajectory were measured. Using those entry points and trajectory results, virtual screws were placed into the pedicles using the simulation program, and the outcomes were evaluated. We found that at C 3 – 6, the optimal entry point was located 2. 0 – 2. 4  mm medial and 0 – 0. 8  mm inferior to the <b>lateral</b> <b>notch.</b> Since the difference of 1  mm is difficult to discern intra-operatively, for ease of remembrance, we recommend rounding off our findings to arrive at a starting point for the C 3 – 6 pedicle screws to be 2  mm directly medial to the <b>lateral</b> <b>notch.</b> At C 7, by contrast, the optimal entry point was 1. 6  mm lateral and 2. 5  mm superior to the center of lateral mass. Again, for ease of remembrance, we recommend rounding off these numbers to use a starting point for the C 7 pedicle screws to be 2  mm lateral and 2  mm superior to the center of lateral mass. The average transverse angles were 45 ° at C 3 – 5, 38 ° at C 6, and 28 ° at C 7. The entry points for each vertebra should be adjusted according to the transverse angles of pedicles. The mean sagittal angles were 7 ° upward at C 3, and parallel to the upper end plate at C 4 – 7.
