25|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>Beam</b> Injection An {{external}} source of hydrogen is ionized and accelerated by an electric field {{to form a}} charged beam which is shone through a source of neutral hydrogen gas towards the plasma which itself is ionized and contained in the reactor by a magnetic field. Some of the intermediate hydrogen gas is accelerated towards the plasma by collisions with the charged beam while remaining neutral: this <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> is thus unaffected by the magnetic field and so shines through it into the plasma. Once inside the plasma the <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> transmits energy to the plasma by collisions {{as a result of}} which it becomes ionized and thus contained by the magnetic field thereby both heating and refuelling the reactor in one operation. The remainder of the charged beam is diverted by magnetic fields onto cooled beam dumps.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL {{proposed}} an alternate {{arrangement of the}} magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak: a Spherical tokamak. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing {{through the hole in}} the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2. The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. However, it was being proposed during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called [...] "Glidcop". However, they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine, [...] "STX". Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a test machine built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the Spherical tokamak layout. Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of Derek Robinson, of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority fusion center at Culham. Robinson was able to gather together a team and secure funding on the order of 100,000 pounds to build an experimental machine, the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak, or START. Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> injector from ORNL. Construction of START began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991.|$|E

40|$|The {{injection}} of fast <b>neutral</b> <b>beams</b> into plasmas {{is thought to}} be the most promising way for the fusion plasma heating. Fast <b>neutral</b> <b>beams</b> are obtained by injecting fast ions into a neutralizer cell, in which ions are neutralized through charge exchange collisions with the ambient gas. However, the neutralization efficiency in the neutralizer cell is so low that the net power may not be extracted from a fusion reactor unless the energy of the ions being not neutralized in the cell is recovered. The present paper describes some problems associated with the electrostatic direct energy recovery of fast ion beams for this purpose. The titanium and molybdenum were tested as the direct converter electrode materials, and {{it was found that the}} conversion efficiency and the conditioning process of the converter electrode depended strongly on the electrode material. The effect of secondary electrons emitted from the electron repeller on the conversion efficiency was also made clear in the present experiments...|$|R

50|$|Later that decade, Goldston {{produced}} {{physical evidence}} that fast ions circulating in toroidal magnetically confined plasmas {{such as the}} tokamak configuration slowed down in good agreement with classical collision theory, thus providing a physical underpinning for the further development of the powerful <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> systems which have heated and driven electric current in successive generations of tokamaks and other magnetic plasma confinement devices such as stellarators. Over the following two decades, Goldston led several experimental efforts studying the physics and efficacy of heating tokamak plasmas with neutral beams, discovering along the way a type of instability that could eject energetic beam ions if the <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> system was aimed too orthogonally {{with respect to the}} tokamak plasma. He also explored a number of other loss mechanisms for energetic ions. This proved crucial in determining the range of angles over which future <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> systems could access toroidal plasma configurations.|$|E

5000|$|Neutral-beam {{injection}} {{involves the}} introduction of high energy (rapidly moving) atoms (molecules) into an ohmically heated, magnetically confined plasma within the tokamak. The high energy atoms (molecules) originate as ions in an arc chamber before being extracted through a high voltage grid set. The term [...] "ion source" [...] is used to generally mean the assembly consisting {{of a set of}} electron emitting filaments, an arc chamber volume, and a set of extraction grids. The extracted ions travel through a neutralizer section of the beamline where they gain enough electrons to become neutral atoms (molecules) but retain the high velocity imparted to them from the ion source. Once the <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> enters the tokamak, interactions with the main plasma ions occur which significantly heat the bulk plasma and bring it closer to fusion-relevant temperatures. Ion source extraction voltages are typically of the order 50-100 kV, and high voltage, negative ion sources (-1 MV) are being developed for ITER. The ITER <b>Neutral</b> <b>Beam</b> Test Facility in Padova will be the first ITER facility to start operation. While <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> injection is used primarily for plasma heating, it can also be used as a diagnostic tool and in feedback control by making a pulsed beam consisting of a string of brief 2-10 ms beam blips. Deuterium is a primary fuel for <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> heating systems and hydrogen and helium are sometimes used for selected experiments.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{installation}} of the ITER-like wall (ILW) at JET, carbon has been replaced by beryllium and tungsten as the main core plasma impurity. Simultaneously, the <b>neutral</b> <b>beams</b> have been upgraded to achieve higher heating power.

In this work we report numerical simulations which study the effect of the upgraded JET NBI and tungsten impurity content on beam deposition. We compare the deposition from the old and the upgraded beam configurations in plasmas with the C-wall and the ILW. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of an asymmetrically distributed tungsten impurity on beam stopping. We use the orbit-following code ASCOT, coupled to the JETTO transport code, to calculate the beam deposition including the slowing-down and pitch and scattering of the beam ions. To take into account the effect of tungsten, ASCOT has been updated to use the ADAS database to obtain effective beam stopping coefficients. The results of ASCOT are compared with the PENCIL code, in order to determine the significance of fast ion orbit effects...|$|R
