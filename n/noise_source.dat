50|$|Sonic {{characteristics}} of marine species - Noise {{in the ocean}} is of utmost importance for ocean explorations, oceanographic as well as fisheries studies, sonar operations, etc. The wide range of systems for ocean research demands the need for characterizing the <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> in the ocean. The ambient noise in the ocean is composite in nature, with components emanating {{from a variety of}} <b>noise</b> <b>sources.</b> The problem of identification of <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> in the ocean is of prime importance because of its diverse practical applications. In view {{of the importance of the}} area of identification of <b>noise</b> <b>sources,</b> there is a need and requirement for characterizing the <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> in the ocean which are of both man made and biological in origin.|$|R
25|$|This method {{starts to}} fail when the <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> {{is close to}} the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more {{strongly}} and the common-mode rejection of the receiver will fail to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. One pair can induce crosstalk in another and it is additive {{along the length of the}} cable. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged.|$|E
25|$|Although the A-weighting curve, in {{widespread}} use for noise measurement, {{is said to}} have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a <b>noise</b> <b>source.</b> However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1kHz and a downward tilt below 1kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss in divers is a known {{problem and}} has many factors, {{one of which}} is noise exposure. Open circuit divers produce a high level of {{breathing}} noise by airflow through the regulator during inhalation and bubble noise during exhalation. The primary <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> is exhaust bubbles which can exceed 95dB(A). Voice communications and free-flow demisting push these levels above 100db(A), as communications need to be about 15dB above background to be intelligible. Free-flow helmet noise levels are generally higher than demand systems, and are comparable with demisting noise levels. Rebreather and reclaim systems are significantly quieter, as there is no bubble noise most of the time. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood provides substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet sensitivity is similar to in surface air, as hearing sensitivity is not significantly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure.|$|E

2500|$|In amplifying faint signals, it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to minimize electronic noise, particularly {{in the first stage}} of amplification. [...] As a dissipative element, even an ideal resistor naturally produces a randomly fluctuating voltage, or noise, across its terminals. [...] This Johnson–Nyquist noise is a fundamental <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> which depends only upon the temperature and resistance of the resistor, and is predicted by the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Using a larger value of resistance produces a larger voltage noise, whereas a smaller value of resistance generates more current noise, at a given temperature.|$|E

2500|$|Noise is also {{generated}} by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation {{of the background}} surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so [...] "cold" [...] that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by kB T B, where T is temperature, B is bandwidth (post matched filter) and kB is Boltzmann's constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface {{it would appear that}} then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Plank spectrum) this <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.|$|E
50|$|One way {{to perform}} the {{measurement}} is described on the Y-factor page. A noise-figure meter could automate that procedure as follows: A gated broadband <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> (such as an avalanche diode) drives the device under test. A measurement is made with the <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> on; another measurement with the <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> off. From those measurements and {{the characteristics of the}} <b>noise</b> <b>source,</b> the noise figure can be calculated.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{noise figure}} meters need a {{calibrated}} broadband <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> -- a noise generator. Several methods {{are used to}} generate broadband noise. Some methods require two sources: a [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cold" [...] source. For high frequency measurements, the <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> will be embedded in a transmission line.|$|E
30|$|The seismic noise-based methods {{described}} above all rely on strong assumptions concerning the <b>noise</b> <b>sources.</b> For tomography applications, <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> should be homogeneously distributed (Lobkis and Weaver 2001; Roux et al. 2005). Under this assumption, only the sources {{located in a}} narrow area along {{the continuation of the}} path joining the two stations contribute to the recovered Green's function (Roux et al. 2004; Sabra et al. 2005 c; Larose 2005; Gouédard et al. 2008). For applications that monitor time-dependent perturbations of the medium, <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> may be inhomogeneously distributed, but in this case, they must be repeatable. If the seismic <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> move too much over time, the resulting changes in the signal could be mistaken for perturbations of the medium (Hadziioannou et al. 2009; Weaver et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{discusses the}} noise generated within op amps, not the external noise {{which they may}} pick up due to magnetic and electric coupling. Minimizing this external noise is also important, but in this section we are concerned solely with op amp internal noise. There {{are a number of}} <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> within an op amp (resistor noise, current noise, KT/C noise, etc.), but it is customary to model them externally as a voltage noise which appears differentially across the two inputs and two current <b>noise</b> <b>sources,</b> one in each input. These three <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> are shown externally to the ideal "noiseless " op amp. The simple voltage noise op amp model is shown in Figure 1 below. The three <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> are effectively uncorrelated (independent of each other). There is a slight correlation between the two noise currents, but it is too small to need consideration in practical noise analyses. In addition to these three internal <b>noise</b> <b>sources,</b> it is necessary to consider the Johnson noise of the external gain setting resistors that are used with the op amp...|$|R
40|$|Neural-network {{models of}} brain {{function}} often {{rely on the}} presence of noise [1, 2]. Yet the biologicalorigin of this noise remains unclear. In computer simulations and in neuromorphic hardware [3, 4], the num-ber of <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> (random-number generators) is limited. In consequence, neurons in large functionalnetwork models have to share <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> and are therefore correlated. It is largely unclear how shared-noise correlation affect the performance of functional network models. Further, so far there is no solutionto the problem of how a limited number of <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> can supply a large number of functional units withuncorrelated noise. Here, we first demonstrate that the performance of two functional network models, attractor networks [5]and neural Boltzmann machines [2], is substantially impaired by shared-noise correlations resulting from alimited number of <b>noise</b> <b>sources.</b> Secondly, we show that this problem can be overcome by replacing thefinite pool of independent <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> by a (finite) recurrent neural network. As shown recently, inhibitoryfeedback, abundant in biological neural networks, serves as a powerful decorrelation mechanism [6, 7]. Shared-noise correlations are actively suppressed by the network dynamics. By exploiting this effect, thenetwork performance is significantly improved. Finally, we demonstrate the decorrelating effect of inhibitoryfeedback in a heterogeneous network implemented in an analog neuromorphic substrate [8]. In summary,we show that recurrent neural networks can serve as natural finite-size <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> for functional neuralnetworks, both in biological and in synthetic neuromorphic substrates...|$|R
