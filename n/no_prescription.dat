60|$|The peasants, in all probability, are the {{descendants}} of these ancient proprietors, Romans or Gauls. But if they fail, in any degree, in the titles which they make {{on the principles of}} antiquaries and lawyers, they retreat into the citadel of the rights of men. There they find that men are equal; and the earth, the kind and equal mother of all, ought not to be monopolized to foster the pride and luxury of any men, who by nature are no better than themselves, and who, if they do not labor for their bread, are worse. They find, that, by the laws of Nature, the occupant and subduer of the soil is the true proprietor,--that there is <b>no</b> <b>prescription</b> against Nature,--and that the agreements (where any there are) which have been made with the landlords during the time of slavery are only the effect of duresse and force,--and that, when the people reëntered into the rights of men, those agreements were made as void as everything else which had been settled under the prevalence of the old feudal and aristocratic tyranny. They {{will tell you that the}}y see no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade and an idler in a cowl or in a rochet. If you ground the title to rents on succession and prescription, they tell you from the speech of M. Camus, published by the National Assembly for their information, that things ill begun cannot avail themselves of prescription,--that the title of those lords was vicious in its origin,--and that force is at least as bad as fraud. As to the title by succession, they will tell you that the succession of those who have cultivated the soil is the true pedigree of property, and not rotten parchments and silly substitutions,--that the lords have enjoyed their usurpation too long,--and that, if they allow to these lay monks any charitable pension, they ought to be thankful to the bounty of the true proprietor, who is so generous towards a false claimant to his goods.|$|E

60|$|I have {{therefore}} been decidedly of opinion, {{with our}} declaration at Whitehall {{in the beginning}} of this war, that the vicinage of Europe had not only a right, but an indispensable duty and an exigent interest, to denunciate this new work, before it had produced the danger we have so sorely felt, and which we shall long feel. The example of what is done by France is too important not to have a vast and extensive influence; and that example, backed with its power, must bear with great force on those who are near it, especially on those who shall recognize the pretended republic on the principle upon which it now stands. It is not an old structure, which you have found as it is, and are not to dispute of the original end and design with which it had been so fashioned. It is a recent wrong, and can plead <b>no</b> <b>prescription.</b> It violates the rights upon which not only the community of France, but those on which all communities are founded. The principles on which they proceed are general principles, and are as true in England as in any other country. They who (though with the purest intentions) recognize the authority of these regicides and robbers upon principle justify their acts, and establish them as precedents. It is a question not between France and England; it is a question between property and force. The property claims; and its claim has been allowed. The property of the nation is the nation. They who massacre, plunder, and expel the body of the proprietary are murderers and robbers. The state, in its essence, must be moral and just: and it may be so, though a tyrant or usurper should be accidentally at the head of it. This is a thing to be lamented: but this notwithstanding, the body of the commonwealth may remain in all its integrity and be perfectly sound in its composition. The present case is different. It is not a revolution in government. It is not the victory of party over party. It is a destruction and decomposition of the whole society; which never can be made of right by any faction, however powerful, nor without terrible consequences to all about it, both in the act and in the example. This pretended republic is founded in crimes, and exists by wrong and robbery; and wrong and robbery, far from a title to anything, is war with mankind. To be at peace with robbery is to be an accomplice with it.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} way in which the European Union (EU) legal order interacts—or maybe rather ‘collides’—with the world of arbitration.

Arbitrators, in turn, take great liberty in defining the legal rules to which they will adhere. This article offers <b>no</b> <b>prescriptions</b> on how both worlds should ideally coexist but rather examines how and why they continue to operate as two distinct and almost antagonistic legal orders. It also points to the potential consequences of this stand-off for both legal orders. The article focuses on consumer regulation/arbitration. The case-law ensuing from the Directive 93 / 13 on unfair terms in consumer contracts offers a particularly useful starting point for this inquiry...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of manuterges. One serves the needs of the sacristy. The priest uses this at the washing of hands before mass, before distributing Communion outside of Mass, and before {{administering}} baptism. It can also be used for drying the hands after they have been washed on occasions not prescribed by the rubrics, but still customary after Mass. There are <b>no</b> <b>prescriptions</b> as to material and form for the towel used in the sacristy. It is usual to have it hanging over a roller, the two ends being sewn together so as to make it into a circular band. The custom of washing the hands before Mass may date from Early Christian tradition since the ceremony is expressly mentioned in the sacramentaries of the ninth and tenth centuries.|$|R
