5|$|Several {{of the new}} medium's biggest attractions {{came from}} {{vaudeville}} and the musical theater, where performers such as Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Jeanette MacDonald, and the Marx Brothers were accustomed {{to the demands of}} both dialogue and song. James Cagney and Joan Blondell, who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930. A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Bebe Daniels, William Powell, Norma Shearer, the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and the incomparable Charlie Chaplin, whose City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects. Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless Seventh Heaven and Sunrise, as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar Our Dancing Daughters (1928). Greta Garbo was the one <b>non–native</b> <b>English</b> speaker to retain Hollywood stardom {{on both sides of the}} great sound divide. Silent film extra Clark Gable, who had received extensive voice training during his earlier stage career, went on to dominate the new medium for decades. The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists, journalists, and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue. Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were Nathanael West, William Faulkner, Robert Sherwood, Aldous Huxley, and Dorothy Parker.|$|E

25|$|Foreign (non-US citizen) {{students}} applying {{from another}} country form a large and growing percentage of applicants (including accepted applicants) to American universities. According to Andover counseling director Sean Logan, applications to American universities from foreign students have increased dramatically in the past decade. International applications are typically similar to domestic ones but with additional complications. Most international applicants do not receive a GPA score or transcript from their school. Most will not normally take SAT or ACT exams, so these must be arranged. Most American universities are happy to accept international and foreign qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or IB, or British A Levels, although it is often up to the applicant to elaborate {{on the meaning of}} these qualifications. <b>Non-native</b> <b>English</b> speakers may be asked to provide English language qualifications. If a university requires or offers an interview, these can normally be conducted over the phone or with alumni residing in the applicant's country, according to Uni in the USA, a guide book catering to the growing number of British students seeking to study in the United States. International applicants often must cope with higher tuition fees and less available financial aid, although this varies significantly by college. Further, international applicants also have to apply for a student visa, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.|$|E

2500|$|María Ruiz de Burton was {{a native}} of the Mexican state of Baja California. During the Mexican–American War, Ruiz de Burton {{witnessed}} the American invasion of La Paz that began in 1846. In 1847, she met an American military officer, Colonel Henry S. Burton, in Baja. He had been ordered to invade La Paz to suppress a Mexican uprising where the Mexicans there gave little resistance. When the war ended two years later, California was split into two; Baja California remained Mexican territory while Alta California became American territory. During the American Civil War, Burton served the Union Army. The two were married in 1849, a year after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed. They lived in the newly claimed American territory and later moved to the East Coast, where Ruiz de Burton observed the economic, social and political turmoil wrought by the war and its aftermath. Despite 10 years of living in Eastern cities, as a Latin-American Catholic, Ruiz de Burton was considered an outsider in Union territory. She transformed her experiences living along the predominantly Protestant Eastern Coast, where Irish Catholics were poorly paid and discriminated against, into the novel Who Would Have Thought It?. [...] The book was published anonymously in 1872; Ruiz de Burton feared that if it became known that a <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> speaker had written the work that it would undergo greater scrutiny for grammatical errors.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates 43 Korean adults’ {{attitudes towards}} native and <b>non-native</b> {{varieties}} of <b>English</b> {{in relation to}} the perspective of EIL (English as an international language). This study addresses three research questions: 1) do Korean adults prefer certain varieties of English? 2) do Korean adults at least accept <b>non-native</b> varieties of <b>English?,</b> and 3) are Korean adults aware of different varieties of English? In order to examine participants’ language attitudes, this study employed both a verbal guise test as an indirect approach and a qualitative questionnaire as a direct approach. For the verbal guise test, six varieties of English were selected to measure participants’ perceptions of native and <b>non-native</b> varieties of <b>English</b> based on Kachru’s (1985) circles of English use: American and British English in the inner circle, Hong Kong and Indian English in the outer circle, and Korean and Taiwanese-accented English in the expanding circle. The main findings present important insights into Korean adults’ perspectives on EIL: 1) they preferred American English as a model for guidance and did not discriminate native and <b>non-native</b> varieties of <b>English,</b> 2) they regarded English as an international language to communicate not only with native speakers but also with <b>non-native</b> speakers of <b>English,</b> and showed positive attitudes to <b>non-native</b> varieties of <b>English,</b> and 3) they were not well aware of varieties of English. This finding implies that English language teaching in Korea should emphasize learners’ awareness of varieties of English in order that they can command EIL without difficulty. This study suggests that further comprehensive investigations into changes in Koreans’ language attitudes and their needs as L 2 learners be made because they should be reflected in English language teaching which has emphasized EFL rather than EIL...|$|R

They obtained 89. 3 %, and 87. 9 % rise tune respectively. The study concluded that the overwhelming preference for rise tune in Nigerian English in these syntactic structures is not unconnected with the fact that many Nigerian speakers of English have difficulty in producing complex intonation tunes due to unavailability of this tune type in their linguistic repertoire. It is hoped that this study shall widen the scope of research on the characterisation and description of Nigerian English...|$|R
