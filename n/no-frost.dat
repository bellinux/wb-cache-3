40|$|AbstractThe {{operating}} performance and indoor thermal {{comfort of the}} sensible heat storage {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) system were analyzed by detailed experiments and numerical calculation in this paper. The data field trial lasted for two months in Changsha, China. Specifically, the indoor temperature distributions in both the defrosting and <b>no-frost</b> outdoor conditions were investigated respectively through experiments. And the comparative analysis with the VRV system was conducted. Predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percent dissatisfied (PPD) were used to evaluate indoor thermal comfort. Experimental results and the calculated evaluation indexes depict that the sensible heat storage system can achieve improved indoor thermal comfort and lower energy consumption compared with the VRV system. The system is promising and suitable for residential heating in central-south China...|$|E
40|$|The air-to-refrigerant {{evaporator}} {{placed in}} <b>no-frost</b> refrigerators {{is a critical}} component because of its simultaneous treatment of both cooler and freezer air streams, which implies a strong drying process on the cooler air flow, and the corresponding intense and non-uniform frost formation process. This paper presents a numerical model developed to analyse fin-and-tube heat exchangers in general {{and this kind of}} evaporators in particular. This is a distributed model which gives a very detailed picture of the nonuniform heat exchanger behaviour in terms of heat and mass transfer, considering local effects (frost formation, fin density, in-flow state, etc.). The mathematical formulation and the numerical methodology are presented, showing the model capabilities and level of analysis. Afterwards, illustrative computational results show the potential of the model as a design tool for this application. Validation studies are included in an accompanying paper.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the thermal resistances of two components of a thermoelectric ice maker installed in a <b>no-frost</b> refrigerator, in order to optimize the ice production. This study is conducted via a computational model developed by the Thermal and Fluids Research Group from Public University of Navarre, explained and validated in previous papers. Firstly, three dissipaters with different space between fins are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics Fluent to study their influence on both the ice production and the performance of the refrigerator. The computational model predicts a maximum production of 2. 82 kg/day of ice with less than 7 W of extra electric power consumption, though these values depend to a great extent on the cooling and freezing power of the refrigerator. Secondly, this work focuses on reducing the size of the components in order to save raw material and reduce the cost of the device. The computational model predicts that the last design produces 2. 42 kg/day of ice, saves 65 % of raw material and reduces to the half the expenses assigned to the thermoelectric modules...|$|E
40|$|Capillary tube-suction line heat {{exchangers}} (CT-SLHX) introduce complex phenomena due to simultaneous 2 -phase flow expansion and heat transfer such as: reverse heat transfer, flow hysteresis and flow oscillations. Some {{of the negative}} consequences of these phenomena are: noise due to re-condensation, which is becoming an important quality issue; and reduction of the SLHX effectiveness, which also affects the global efficiency. Studies about how to solve the noise problem show that it disappears when there is enough subcooling at the capillary tube inlet. This fact also supports the idea that two-phase flow at the capillary tube inlet contributes to re-condensation phenomenon in the CT-SLHX. Different reasons may explain it, e. g. the small compressor capacity compared the expansion device capacity of the capillary tube used. Another important consequence would be wasting condenser surface due to the two-phase outlet. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to assess experimentally the actual conditions taking place at the capillary tube inlet and find a solution to the problems mentioned above. An innovative test bench has been designed in order to visualize and analyze the phenomena occurring at the condenser outlet, along the filter and at the capillary tube inlet. This experimental bench test is connected to an A+++ <b>no-frost</b> household refrigerator equipped with a fin-and-tube evaporator, a tube and wire condenser and a variable-speed 7. 24 cmÂ³ hermetic reciprocating compressor. The refrigerant used is isobutane (R 600 a). In order to determine the refrigerant temperature, a set of thermocouples has been placed along the refrigerant loop, while a pressure transducer is installed at the condenser outlet. The mass flow rate is measured with a Coriolis meter installed at the compressor discharge line. The final part of the condenser and the filters were built with PFA (Perfluoroalkoxy) transparent pipes. Three different positions of identical filters were tested to analyze their influence on the flow configuration. The first filter is horizontally oriented, second and third ones are in a vertical position but with opposite flow directions. A system composed of three manual solenoid valves enables to test each of the three configurations independently from the two others. The transparent filters make possible the visualization of the refrigerant flow pattern at the capillary inlet. An adjustable system has been designed to modify the length of the capillary inside the filters. The set of experiments were tested in steady conditions, by using electrical heaters inside the cabinets to keep the setting point constant. Results show the description of the flow pattern at the capillary tube inlet and condenser outlet with the different capillary tubes and filter arrangements. The condenser outlet conditions were analyzed and the energy efficiency of the refrigerator was compared with a system with actual subcooled outlet conditions. Once characterized the refrigerant flow at the condenser outlet, a configuration has been proposed to ensure an effective subcooling and thus an improvement of the refrigerator performance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at unifying two {{distinct}} branches of {{work within the}} Heat Transfer Technological Center (CTTC). On one side, extensive experimental {{work has been done}} during the past years by the researchers of the laboratory. This experimental work has been complemented with numerical models for the calculation of fin and tube heat exchangers thermal and fluid dynamic behavior. Such numerical models can be referred to as fast numerical tool which can be used for industrial rating and design purposes. On the other hand, the scientists working at the research center have successfully developed a general purpose multi-physics Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code (TermoFluids). This high performance CFD solver has been extensively used by the co-workers of the group mainly to predict complex flows of great academic interest. The idea of bringing together this two branches, comes from the necessity of a reliable numerical platform with detailed local data of the flow and heat transfer on diverse heat exchanger applications. Being able to use local heat transfer coefficients as an input on the rating and design tool will lead to affordable and accurate prediction of industrial devices performance, by which the center can propose enhanced alternatives to its industrial partners. To accomplish these goals, several contributions have been made to the existing TermoFluids software which is in continuous evolution {{in order to meet the}} competitive requirements. The most significant problematics to adequately attack this problem are analyzed and quite interesting recommendations are given. Some of the challenging arising issues involve the generation of suitable and affordable meshes, the implementation and validation of three dimensional periodic boundary condition and coupling of different domains with important adjustments for the study of cases with different flow physics like time steps and thermal development. Turbulence is present in most of engineering flows, and refrigeration evaporator heat exchangers are not an exception. The presence of many tubes (acting like bluff bodies for the flow) arranged in different configurations and the fact that the flow is also confined by fins, create complex three dimensional flow features that have usually turbulent or transition to turbulent regime. Therefore, three dimensional turbulent forced convection in a matrix of wall-bounded pins is analyzed. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are performed in order to assess the performance of three different subgrid-scale models, namely WALE, QR and VMS. The Reynolds numbers of the study were set to 3000, 10000 and 30000. Some of the main results included are the pressure coefficient around the cylinders, the averaged Nusselt number at the endwalls and vorticity of the flow. The final part of the thesis is devoted to study the three dimensional fluid flow and conjugated heat transfer parameters encountered in a plate fin and tube heat exchanger used for <b>no-frost</b> refrigeration. The numerical code and post processing tools are validated with a very similar but smaller case of a heat exchanger with two rows of tubes at low Reynolds for which experimental data is available. The next analysis presented is a typical configuration for <b>no-frost</b> evaporators with double fin spacing (for which very few numerical data is reported in the scientific literature). Conjugated convective heat transfer in the flow field and heat conduction in the fins are coupled and considered. The influence of some geometrical and flow regime parameters is analyzed for design purposes. In conclusion, the implementations and general contributions of the present thesis together with the previous existent multi-physics computational code, has proved to be capable to perform successful top edge three dimensional simulations of the flow features and heat transfer mechanisms observed on heat exchanger devices. Esta tesis tiene como objetivo unificar dos ramas de trabajo dentro del Centro TecnolÃ³gico de Transferencia de Calor (CTTC). Por un lado, se ha realizado un amplio trabajo experimental durante los Ãºltimos aÃ±os. Este trabajo experimental se ha complementado con modelos numÃ©ricos para el estudio de intercambiadores de calor de tipo aleta-tubo. Tales modelos numÃ©ricos pueden considerarse una herramienta numÃ©rica de bajo coste empleada con propÃ³sitos de diseÃ±o principalmente. Por otro lado, los cientÃ­ficos que trabajan en el centro han desarrollado con Ã©xito un cÃ³digo de DinÃ¡mica de Fluidos Computacionales (TermoFluids). Este cÃ³digo de alto rendimiento ha sido ampliamente utilizado principalmente para predecir flujos complejos de gran interÃ©s acadÃ©mico. La idea de unir a estas dos ramas, proviene de la necesidad de una plataforma numÃ©rica fiable con datos locales propios del flujo y de la transferencia de calor en diversas aplicaciones de intercambiadores de calor. Ser capaz de generar coeficientes locales de transferencia de calor para abastecer con datos propios los modelos existentes de bajo coste, permitirÃ¡ la correcta predicciÃ³n del rendimiento de dichos dispositivos. Para lograr estos objetivos, se han hecho varias contribuciones al cÃ³digo TermoFluids que estÃ¡ en continua evoluciÃ³n. Algunas de las mayores cuestiones que se plantean implican la generaciÃ³n de mallas adecuadas y asequibles, la implementaciÃ³n y validaciÃ³n de la condiciÃ³n de contorno periÃ³dica tridimensional y el acoplamiento de los diferentes dominios para el estudio de casos con diferentes comportamientos fÃ­sicos, como desarrollo transitorio e inercia tÃ©rmica. La turbulencia estÃ¡ presente en la mayorÃ­a de los flujos de ingenierÃ­a, y los intercambiadores de calor de evaporadores para refrigeraciÃ³n no son una excepciÃ³n. La presencia de muchos tubos (que actÃºan como obstÃ¡culos para el fluido) colocados en diferentes configuraciones y el hecho de que el flujo tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ confinado por aletas, crean caracterÃ­sticas de flujo tridimensionales complejas que tienen generalmente rÃ©gimen turbulento o en transiciÃ³n. Por lo tanto, se analiza la convecciÃ³n forzada turbulenta en una matriz de pines delimitados por paredes. simulando las grandes escalas de turbulencia y modelando las pequeÃ±as (LES) con el fin de evaluar el desempeÃ±o de los tres modelos seleccionados, a saber WALE, QR y VMS. Los nÃºmeros de Reynolds establecidos para el estudio son 3000, 10000 y 30000. Algunos de los principales resultados que se incluyen son el coeficiente de presiÃ³n alrededor los cilindros, el nÃºmero de Nusselt promedio en las paredes y la vorticidad del flujo. La parte final de la tesis se dedica a estudiar el flujo tridimensional y los parÃ¡metros de transferencia de calor encontrados en un intercambiador de calor de tipo aleta-tubo utilizado para la refrigeraciÃ³n domÃ©stica en equipos de 'no-escarcha'. Las implementaciones del cÃ³digo y el postproceso numÃ©ricos se validan en un caso muy similar para un intercambiador de calor con dos filas de tubos a bajos Reynolds para el cual se dispone de datos experimentales. El siguiente anÃ¡lisis que se presenta es una configuraciÃ³n tÃ­pica para evaporadores 'no-escarcha' con paso de aleta doble (para el que se tiene muy poca informaciÃ³n numÃ©rica en la literatura). Se considera el acoplamiento conjugado de la transferencia de calor convectiva entre fluido y sÃ³lido y conductiva dentro de la aleta. La influencia de algunos parÃ¡metros geomÃ©tricos y de rÃ©gimen de flujo se analizan con propÃ³sitos de diseÃ±o. En conclusiÃ³n, las contribuciones generales de esta tesis junto con el cÃ³digo computacional ya existente, ha demostrado ser capaz de realizar con Ã©xito simulaciones tridimensionales para predecir las caracterÃ­sticas del flujo y los mecanismos responsables de la transferencia de calor en intercambiadores de calor de tipo aleta-tuboPostprint (published version...|$|E
