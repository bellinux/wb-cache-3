With an overall theme around Egyptian mythology, the ride is named after the god of war Montu, a man depicted {{with the head of}} a hawk. When the ride was first launched, a <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile</b> exhibit was located underneath the first section of the ride. These animals were later relocated to the park's main animal habitat.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{was first}} classified by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the American alligator shares this genus with the Chinese alligator. They are grouped {{in the family}} Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are {{more closely related to}} the American alligator than to either the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile</b> or the gharial.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile,</b> and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are an {{invasive}} species in North America, and several specimens have been recently captured in southern Florida, {{though there are}} not yet signs that the population is reproducing in the wild. Genetic studies of <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> captured in the wild in Florida have revealed that the specimens are all closely related to each other, suggesting a single source of the introduction. This source remains unclear, as their genetics do not match samples collected from captives at various zoos and theme parks in Florida. When compared to <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> from their native Africa, the Florida wild specimens are most closely related to South African <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> It is unknown how many <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are currently at large in Florida. It {{is likely that the}} animals were either brought there to be released, or that they are escapees.|$|R

40|$|Wild <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus niloticus) {{of various}} size classes were {{captured}} in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Blood was collected from the post occipital sinus and used for the determination {{of a wide range}} of haematological and biochemical parameters. These values were compared between the sexes and between 3 size classes. The values were also compared with the limited data available from farmed <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> as well as from other wild <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> The Okavango crocodiles were comparatively anaemic, and had comparatively low total protein and blood glucose levels. There was a high prevalence of Hepatozoon pettiti infection, however, there was no significant difference in haematological values between the infected and uninfected crocodiles. The values reported here will be useful in diagnostic investigations in both zoo and farmed <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> Articl...|$|R
5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile.</b> Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on both natural and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile</b> has a {{reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.|$|E

25|$|The larger {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} are very dangerous to humans, {{mainly because of}} their ability to strike before the person can react. The saltwater crocodile and <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile</b> are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa.

25|$|The zoo sees {{its primary}} goal as the {{conservation}} of endangered species. These include animals mentioned in the Bible which are now extinct in Israel, such as the Asian lion, the Syrian brown bear, the Asiatic cheetah, the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile,</b> and the Persian fallow deer. It also includes endangered species worldwide, such as the Asian elephant, rare species of macaw, the cockatiel, the ibis, and the golden lion tamarin.|$|E
25|$|Bull {{sharks are}} apex predators and seldom {{have to fear}} being {{attacked}} by other animals. Humans are their biggest threat. Larger sharks, such as the tiger shark and great white shark, may attack them. Crocodiles may {{be a threat to}} bull sharks in rivers. Saltwater crocodiles have been observed preying on bull sharks in the rivers and estuaries of Northern Australia, and a <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile</b> was reported as consuming a bull shark in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the broader}} snout of fully grown S. imperator when {{compared}} to the living gharial and other narrow-snouted crocodiles, along with a lack of interlocking of the smooth and sturdy-crowned teeth when the jaws were closed, Sereno et al. hypothesized that S. imperator had a generalized diet {{similar to that of the}} <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile,</b> which would have included large terrestrial prey such as the abundant dinosaurs that lived in the same region.|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> i.e. {{at least}} 3.05 m, are apex predators. While adults {{can and will}} consume nearly all types of prey {{consumed}} by the younger specimens, as adult crocodiles gain bulk they lose much of the necessary maneuverability to capture agile prey like fish nor are likely to meet their dietary needs by consuming small prey and may expel unnecessary amounts of energy, so take them secondarily to larger prey. Primates of various sizes may be taken by sub-adult or adult crocodiles. In some areas, some number of baboons are taken, such as in Okavango Delta where chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) are eaten and Uganda where olive baboons (Papio anubis) are taken. There are no records of them hunting apes (other than humans) but based on a strong reluctance to cross waters with crocodiles and a violent reaction to the visual stimuli of crocodiles, {{it is thought that}} chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla beringei) consider <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> a serious threat. Few details are known about the dietary habits of <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> living in Madagascar, although they are considered potential predators of several lemur species. Other non-ungulate prey known to be attacked by <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> includes aardvarks (Orycteropus afer) and African manatees (Trichechus senegalensis).|$|R
50|$|Like all {{crocodiles}} {{they are}} sexually dimorphic, with the males up to 30% {{larger than the}} females, though the difference is considerably less compared to some species, like the saltwater <b>crocodile.</b> Male <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are about 30 to 50 cm longer on average at sexual maturity and grow more so than females after becoming sexually mature, especially expanding in bulk after exceeding 4 m in length. Adult male <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> usually range in length from 3.3 to 5 m long, at these weights, an average sized male may weigh from 150 to 700 kg. In Limpopo, South Africa, males reportedly average 527 kg. Very old, mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more in length (all specimens over 5.5 m from 1900 onward are cataloged later). Mature female <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> typically measure 2.2 to 3.8 m, at which lengths the average female specimen would weigh 40 to 250 kg.|$|R

25|$|The Oxford English Dictionary gives a {{derivation}} from Old French cocatris, from medieval Latin calcatrix, {{a translation}} of the Greek ichneumon, meaning tracker. The twelfth century legend {{was based on a}} reference in Pliny's Natural History that the ichneumon lay in wait for the crocodile to open its jaws for the trochilus bird to enter and pick its teeth clean. An extended description of the cockatriz by the 15th-century Spanish traveller in Egypt, Pedro Tafur, makes it clear that this refers to the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile {{is a large}} and opportunistic hypercarnivorous apex predator. Most prey are ambushed and then drowned or swallowed whole. It is capable of prevailing over almost any animal that enters its territory, including other apex predators such as sharks, varieties of freshwater and marine fish including pelagic species, invertebrates such as crustaceans, various reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans. Due to their size, aggression and distribution, {{saltwater crocodile}}s are regarded as the most dangerous extant crocodilian to humans, alongside the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The park houses {{many species}} of {{crocodiles}} such as the gharial, the marsh crocodile, the salt water crocodile and the American spectacled caiman. Except the Cuban crocodile, the park has all other six major varieties, namely, Indo-Pacific or the salt water crocodile, swamp crocodile, <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodile</b> of Africa, Orinoco crocodile, Morelet's crocodile and American crocodile. The eight enclaves for crocodiles comprise about 220 individuals, including 125 adult specimens belonging to the six varieties. This includes two pairs of adult fresh water crocodiles. Many of the species also breed here.|$|E

50|$|An annex {{contains}} aquariums and terrariums. The largest aquarium {{represents a}} river landscape with typical fish {{of the river}} Elbe. Collections also include <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> turtles, and piranhas.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> have a dark bronze {{colouration}} above, with faded blackish {{spots and}} stripes variably appearing {{across the back}} and a dingy off-yellow on the belly, although mud can often obscure the crocodile’s actual colour. The flanks, which are yellowish-green in colour, have dark patches arranged in oblique stripes in highly variable patterns. There is some variation relative to environment; specimens from swift-flowing waters tend to be lighter in colour than those dwelling in murkier lakes or swamps, which provides camouflage that suits their environment, an example of clinal variation. <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> have green eyes. The colouration also helps to camouflage it; juveniles are grey, multicoloured, or brown, with dark cross-bands on the tail and body. The underbelly of young crocodiles is yellowish green. As it matures, the <b>Nile</b> <b>crocodiles</b> becomes darker and the cross-bands fade, especially those on the upper-body. A similar tendency is coloration change during maturation has been noted in most crocodile species.|$|R
