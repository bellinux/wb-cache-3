40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the influence of different implant placement techniques on the early bone healing response in an animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, 24 cylindrical-screw-type implants with a diameter of 4. 2 mm (Dyna(R)) were installed, using three different surgical techniques; (1) 5 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4 mm; (2) 15 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 6 mm; and (3) 25 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. After 3 weeks of implantation period, the peri-implant bone response was histologically evaluated and the percentage of bone-implant contact (%BIC) calculated. RESULTS: New bone formation was more pronounced for implants placed with the 5 % undersized or 15 % undersized technique, as compared with implants installed with the 25 % undersized technique. Histomorphometrical data corroborates these findings as the %BIC was significantly higher for implants inserted with the 5 % undersized (47. 7 +/- 11. 1) or 15 % undersized protocol (47. 5 +/- 9. 5) as compared with implants inserted with the 25 % undersized technique (32. 1 +/- 9. 7). No significant difference in %BIC could be observed between the 5 % undersized and 15 % undersized installed implants. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of the present study, it was concluded that excessive compression of the host bone, when a discrepancy between implant and final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> more than 15 %, can result in an inferior tissue response in the early stage of healing.

Bone temperatures are measured with thermocouple with reaction time < 0. 1 s and accuracy of 0. 1 oC. Drilling were conducted on pig bones with 3 -axis mini milling machine Flexmatic FA 530 S. [...] - Results. Bone temperatures of all analysed combinations of parameters with internal cooling were below critical 47 oC (p= 0. 05). Cooling fluid flow was low (0. 1 dcl/min = 0. 16 cm 3 /s) and did not cause damage to bone and surrounding soft tissue. Highest temperatures were detected using 4. 5 mm drill (40. 5 oC). Statistical influence on bone temperature was detected. Statistically significant effect other than cooling was detected with the <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> and feed. <b>Drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 4 mm with internal cooling developed maximum temperature of 38. 5 oC and without cooling 46. 3 oC. For the same conditions <b>drill</b> with <b>diameter</b> of 4. 5 mm obtained temperatures 40. 5 oC and 55. 7 oC respectively. Effect of feed is inversely proportional to the increase in bone temperature.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} different surgical techniques on the primary and secondary implant stability using trabecular bone of goats as an implantation model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the iliac crest of eight goats, 48 cylindrical-screw-type implants with a diameter of 4. 2 mm (Dyna((R)); Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands) were installed, using three different surgical techniques: (i) 5 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4 mm; (ii) 15 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 6 mm; and (iii) 25 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. Peak insertion torque values were measured by a Digital((R)) (MARK- 10 Corporation, New York, NY, USA) torque gauge instrument during placement. At 3 weeks after implantation, removal torque was measured. Histomorphometrically, the peri-implant bone volume was measured in three zones; the inner zone (0 - 500 mum), the middle zone (500 - 1000 mum) and the outer zone (1000 - 1500 mum). RESULTS: Evaluation of the obtained data demonstrated {{no statistically significant difference}} between different surgical techniques regarding removal torque values. With respect to the percentage peri-implant bone volume (%BV), also no significant difference could be observed between all three applied surgical techniques for both the inner, middle and outer zone. However, irrespective of the surgical technique, it was noticed that the %BV was significantly higher for the inner zone as compared to middle and outer zone (P < 0. 05) around the implant. CONCLUSION: At 3 weeks after implant installation, independent of the used undersized surgical technique, the %BV in the inner zone (0 - 500 mum) peri-implant area was improved due to both condensation of the surrounding bone as also the translocation of host bone particles along the implant surface. Surprisingly, no mechanical beneficial effect of the 25 % undersized surgical technique could be observed as compared to the 5 % or 15 % undersized surgical technique to improve primary or secondary implant stability...|$|R

An internally cooled drill (3. 4 mm and 4. 5 mm) and a two-step drill (2. 5 / 3. 4 and 3. 4 / 4. 5 mm) were used in combination with feed rates of (0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 10, 0. 16 and 0. 18 mm/rev) and cutting speeds (1. 18, 10. 68, 33. 61, 56. 55 and 66. 05 m/min) with and without cooling with water of 24 °C. Bone temperatures were measured with thermocouples. Drilling was performed on pig diaphyses with a three-axis mini milling machine.
