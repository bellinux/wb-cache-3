40|$|Offsetting is {{a policy}} {{instrument}} intended to provide flexibility for development. We developed a simple calculator to predict when <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible using biodiversity offsetting. Assuming offset ratios ≤ 10 : 1 are indicative of operational feasibility and employing a discount rate of 3 %, we predicted that <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible where biodiversity can be restored within 55 years, which restricts the impacts on biodiversity that can be offset using restoration. Alternatively, <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible by avoiding loss to biodiversity that is declining under the counterfactual {{at an annual rate}} ≥ 6 %. However, this is considerably higher than typical background rates of biodiversity loss so restricts where avoided-loss offsets are feasible. <b>No</b> <b>net</b> loss is theoretically feasible in the broadest range of circumstances if biodiversity gains are provided in advance of development. However, these gains are procured by restoration or avoided loss, so constraints presented by these approaches also apply. We concluded that <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible in a limited range of development scenarios unless offset ratios greater than 10 : 1 are more widely tolerated...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effects of net {{neutrality}} on media diversity. We show that in the net neutrality regime, media firms al- ways provide media diversity, whereas in the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime, the equilibrium of the model depends on the relation between net- work capacity and network traffic. If the network capacity is large relatively to network traffic, the equilibrium of the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime {{is similar to the}} one under the net neutrality regime. However, if network capacity is small relative to network traffic, under the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime media firms do not provide media diversity. The reason is that when network capacity is small relative to network traf- fic, the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime hinders competition. In other words, with <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, the media firm with priority sees its hinter- land more protected from its rival than under net neutrality, and the contrary for the firm with no priority. As a result, while the media firm with priority has less need to provide media diversity to attract demand and as such advertising revenues, the media firm with no pri- ority finds it more difficult to use media diversity to attract demand and advertising revenues...|$|R

To satisfy this mandate, sellers and buyers (including importers) of tobacco were assessed equally to build a capital account that was drawn upon to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for any losses of principal and interest resulting from nonrecourse loan operations. Other provisions of this law provided for reducing the level of support for tobacco and made various modifications to the marketing quota and acreage allotment programs. <b>No</b> <b>net</b> cost assessments ended when price support was terminated after the 2004 crop.|$|R

5|$|The {{dusky shark}} is {{considered}} to be potentially dangerous to humans because of its large size, though little is known of how it behaves towards people underwater. As of 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists it as responsible for six attacks on people and boats, three of them unprovoked and one fatal. However, attacks attributed to this species off Bermuda and other islands were probably in reality caused by Galapagos sharks. Shark nets used to protect beaches in South Africa and Australia entangle adult and larger juvenile dusky sharks in some numbers. From 1978 to 1999, an average of 256 individuals were caught annually in <b>nets</b> <b>off</b> KwaZulu-Natal; species-specific data is not available for <b>nets</b> <b>off</b> Australia. Young dusky sharks adapt well to display in public aquariums.|$|R
