25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
500|$|As {{more troops}} were evacuated, more {{were ordered to}} {{withdraw}} from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed [...] "Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us." [...] Mifflin explained that he had been told that {{it was his turn to}} evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.|$|E
500|$|The next session, {{according}} to John Payne, occurred {{early in the}} morning, {{but it did not}} work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. [...] "It just didn't happen'" [...] says Payne. [...] "It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think {{that by the end of}} that session we all knew that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be used. They just said, let's forget it." [...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That was the whole album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.|$|E

2500|$|According to Friedkin {{cited by}} Kachmar, his artistic {{intent was to}} shoot the entire film without [...] "sentiment" [...] or [...] "melodrama", {{rendering}} it completely devoid of [...] "heartfelt moments". [...] Friedkin's oeuvre has been frequently noted by critics for its lack of [...] "clear-cut heroes or villains", and the director himself admitted that he believes in neither. Thus, he envisioned all four principal characters to be anti-heroes and [...] "hard to 'root for'". Friedkin felt very confident about himself at the time, thinking he was [...] "bulletproof [...] <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to stop [...] ", and felt he [...] "could take an audience through this with not the most likable people on Earth." [...] The director also stated that the line [...] "action is character" [...] from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby served as an inspiration for him in all the movies he made, including Sorcerer.|$|E

6000|$|There {{may have}} been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in Canada or the United States at that moment, but I doubt it. Every snip of the scissors, as rose and peony and {{bluebell}} fell, seemed to chirp, [...] "Mrs. Morgan is coming today."

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Steve that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> right these days. Here was he, chafing at his {{inability}} to open his heart to Mamie. Here was Kirk, obviously in trouble. And--a smaller thing, but of interest, as showing how universal the present depression was--there was Bailey Bannister, equally obviously much worried over something or other.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{well with}} him. Lady Arabella would allow nothing near him or around {{him to be}} well.

60|$|The {{place where}} they {{extracted}} the saccharine matter was under an immense shed of bamboos. Here we saw several clumsy pieces of machinery for breaking the cane; also great kettles for boiling the sugar. But, at present, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. Two or three natives were lounging {{in one of the}} kettles, smoking; the other was occupied by three sailors from the Leviathan, playing cards.|$|E
50|$|Act 2 {{opens with}} Squire Wouldbe reading {{the letter that}} he has written to Urina asking for her love. When his wife, Dowdy, enters, he hides the letter from her. She {{does not believe that}} <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, as he says, and begins to cry. After an {{argument}} about their marriage and trust, he convinces her that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on and that he should go on with his business for the day. After he leaves Mrs. Beldam, Dowdy's mother, comes, upset with her son-in-law for the way he treats her daughter, and then departs on her own business for the day. In a different part of town, Sir Charles and Sir Roger talk and sing about the women that they love or have yet to love. Charlotte and Juliana enter the park dressed in men's clothes discussing the matter at hand with their love lives. In a tavern, Freedman, Urina, and Doll prepare the meal for the guests while discussing their lives and the problem with trust in the relationship between Freedman and Urina. Freedman leaves Urina alone with her troubles.|$|R

5000|$|My red skirt is hitched {{up to my}} waist, {{though no}} higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is {{the lower part of}} my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate, because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on here that I haven't signed up for.|$|R
6000|$|I {{tried to}} find out what they cost, but the shopman did not heed me.

Presently I saw with a qualm of distrust and something very like jealousy that Gip had hold of this person's finger as usually he has hold of mine. No doubt the fellow was interesting, I thought, and had an interestingly faked lot of stuff, really good faked stuff, still---- ...|$|E
60|$|Nas Ta Bega {{returned}} to {{the shade of the}} cedars and, lying down on his blankets, covered himself and went to sleep. The fact seemed to bring bitter reality to Shefford. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. The valley was to be the same this night as any other night. Shefford accepted the truth. He experienced a kind of self-pity. The night he had thought so much about, prepared for, and had forgotten had now arrived. Then he threw another blanket round him, and, cold, dark, grim, he faced that lonely vigil, meaning to sit there, wide-eyed, to endure and to wait.|$|E
60|$|In another quarter {{we found}} six Italians {{engaged in a}} violent quarrel. They danced {{fiercely}} about, gesticulating with their heads, their arms, their legs, their whole bodies; they would rush forward occasionally with a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each other's very faces. We lost half an hour there, waiting to help cord up the dead, but they finally embraced each other affectionately, and the trouble was over. The episode was interesting, but {{we could not have}} afforded all the time to it if we had known <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to come of it but a reconciliation. Note made--in Italy, people who quarrel cheat the spectator.|$|E

[...] He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that if the trees can be protected from logging then the Lorax and all the animals may return.|$|R
60|$|Both {{as being}} diffident, and, {{in a manner}} at home, Norman was not as {{constantly}} her cavalier as was Mr. Ogilvie to his sister; and, when supplanted, his wont was either to pioneer for Flora, or, {{if she did not}} need him, to walk alone, grave and abstracted. There was a weight on his brow, when <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on to drive it away, and whether it were nervousness as to the performance in store for him, anxiety about Harry, or, as Mr. Ogilvie said, too severe application; some burden hung upon him, that was only lightened for the time by his participation in the enjoyment of the party.|$|E
60|$|Reddy {{looked at}} him sharply, but there wasn't a trace of a smile on Unc' Billy's face, and Reddy couldn't tell whether Unc' Billy was making fun of him or not. So, there being nothing else to do, he went on. He reached {{the foot of the}} hill without seeing or hearing a thing out of the usual. The Green Forest seemed just as it always had seemed. Redeye the Vireo was pouring out his little song of gladness, quite as if {{everything}} was just as it should be. Reddy's courage began to come back. Nothing had happened, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Of course not! It was all some of Peter Rabbit's foolishness. Some day he would catch Peter Rabbit {{and put an end to}} such silly tales.|$|E
60|$|The good Forlivesi {{could not}} {{understand}} it: {{they were looking for}} signs and miracles, and behold! they came not. Each day they said to themselves that this would be one to be remembered {{in the history of the}} town; that to-day Girolamo would surely leave his hesitations; but the day wore on quite calmly. Everyone took his dinner and supper as usual, the sun journeyed from east to west as it had done on the previous day, the night came, and the worthy citizen went to his bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace till the following sunrise. Nothing happened, and it seemed that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. The troubled spirits gradually came to the conclusion that there was nothing to be troubled about, and the old quiet came over the town; there was no talk of new taxes, and the world wagged on.... Checco and Matteo and the Moratini resigned themselves to the fact that the sky was serene, and that they had better pursue their way without troubling their little heads about conspiracies and midnight daggers.|$|E

60|$|Amy and {{her mother}} comforted {{themselves}} with a good quiet cry, that was not exactly sorrowful, {{and came to the}} conclusion that Guy was the most considerate person in the world, and they would do whatever best suited him and papa. So, when Mr. Edmonstone came home, he was rewarded for putting off the letter by finding every one willing to let the marriage take place whenever he pleased. There were various conferences in the dressing-room, and Guy and Amy both had burning faces when they came down to dinner. Laura beheld them with a throbbing heart, while she mechanically talked to Dr. Mayerne, as if <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. She was glad there was no singing that evening, for she felt incapable of joining; and when at night Charles and his father talked of sitting up to write to Philip, the misery was such that she had no relief till she had shut herself in her room, to bear or to crush the suffering as best she might.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the most}} absurd contention. The show-people had set out {{a certain number of}} benches, and all who sat upon them were to pay a couple of sous for the accommodation. They were always quite full--a bumper house--as long as <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> forward; but let the show-woman appear with an eye to a collection, and at the first rattle of her {{tambourine}} the audience slipped off the seats, and stood round on the outside with their hands in their pockets. It certainly would have tried an angel's temper. The showman roared from the proscenium; he had been all over France, and nowhere, nowhere, [...] "not even on the borders of Germany," [...] had he met with such misconduct. Such thieves and rogues and rascals, as he called them! And every now and again the wife issued on another round, and added her shrill quota to the tirade. I remarked here, as elsewhere, how far more copious is the female mind in the material of insult. The audience laughed in high good-humour over the man's declamations, but they bridled and cried aloud under the woman's pungent sallies. She picked out the sore points. She had the honour of the village at her mercy. Voices answered her angrily out of the crowd, and received a smarting retort for their trouble. A couple of old ladies beside me, who had duly paid for their seats, waxed very red and indignant, and discoursed to each other audibly about the impudence of these mountebanks; {{but as soon as the}} show-woman caught a whisper of this, she was down upon them with a swoop: if mesdames could persuade their neighbours to act with common honesty, the mountebanks, she assured them, would be polite enough: mesdames had probably had their bowl of soup, and perhaps a glass of wine that evening; the mountebanks also had a taste for soup, and did not choose to have their little earnings stolen from them before their eyes. Once, things came as far as a brief personal encounter between the showman and some lads, in which the former went down as readily as one of his own marionnettes to a peal of jeering laughter.|$|E
50|$|Tiz {{said in an}} {{interview}} that she wrote the song about a darker period in her life where she felt like <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> her way, but her brother was there to tell her to chin up, keep moving, and never give up.
