5|$|Degsastan appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the first}} battle between Áedán and the Bernicians. The {{death of his}} son Domangart {{in the land of}} the Saxons is {{mentioned}} by Adomnán, and it is presumed that Bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle.|$|E
5|$|England {{whitewashed}} Bangladesh in {{both the}} Test and ODI series, maintaining their record as the only Test-playing nation <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> beaten by the Bangladeshis. England gave debuts to five players during the series, including South African-born Craig Kieswetter, which drew criticism over the number of foreign-born players in the England team, particularly from former England captain Michael Vaughan.|$|E
5|$|In January 1764 one barge {{experimentally}} carried one load of coal {{from the}} Thames at Oxford up the River Cherwell to Islip and thence {{up the old}} course of the River Ray to Arncott. The coal was landed at Arncott Bridge and delivered thence by wheelbarrows to Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet at Ambrosden House. However, the experiment seems <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> repeated and did not establish a regular freight trade on the river.|$|E

5|$|It is believed, {{based on}} the {{ecological}} conditions, that C.maenas could eventually extend its range to colonise the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California to Alaska. Similar ecological conditions {{are to be found}} on many of the world's coasts, with the only large potential area <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> invaded yet being New Zealand; the New Zealand government has taken action, including the release of a Marine Pest Guide in an effort to prevent colonisation by C.maenas.|$|E
5|$|On June 29 the FIA World Motorsport Council {{found the}} teams guilty {{on the first}} two counts, that is, of not being in {{possession}} of suitable tyres for the event, but with strong mitigating circumstances, and that of wrongfully refusing to allow their cars to start the race. The teams were found not guilty of the other three counts. The punishment, however, was not decided, and was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> announced until September 14.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{are known}} to have been eaten by theropods. In the 1 July 2004 edition of Nature, {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut discusses an early Cretaceous fossil of three cervical vertebrae of a pterosaur with the broken tooth of a spinosaur, most likely Irritator, embedded in it. The vertebrae are known <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eaten and exposed to digestion, as the joints are still articulated.|$|E

25|$|However, by {{the autumn}} of 1978 the economy was showing signs of {{recovery}} – although unemployment now stood at 1,500,000, economic growth was strong and inflation had fallen below 10%.

A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65% have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder; 21% have been diagnosed with major depression; 7% have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder; and 7% have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> limited to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|Early in October 1835, Yagan's {{head and}} the {{panoramic}} view were returned to Dale, then living in Liverpool. On 12 October he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution, where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the Liverpool Museum; it is thought <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> put on display there. By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head. They were buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 stillborn babies and two infants who died soon after birth.|$|E

5|$|He {{spend much}} of his fortune on {{political}} activism, and was nearly bankrupt {{by the time of}} his death. In February 1790, despite his objections, he was pressured, through general public demand, into reelection for a second (yearly) term of office as the mayor of Warsaw. It is likely that major reasons he preferred <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elected were his ailing business operations and his worsening health. He led his last public debate on 31 April 1790, and withdrew from politics afterward. He died on 4 October 1790 in Warsaw. He was buried in St. John's Archcathedral, and his large funeral was paid for by the City of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American science-fiction {{adventure}} {{film and}} the third installment in the Jurassic Park film series. The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It is the first film in the series <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> directed by Steven Spielberg, nor based on a book by Michael Crichton (though numerous scenes in the film were ultimately taken from Crichton's novels Jurassic Park and The Lost World). The film takes place on Isla Sorna, off Central America's Pacific coast, the island featured in the , where a divorced couple has tricked Dr. Alan Grant into going {{in order to help}} them find their son.|$|E
5|$|Sheerness has {{had four}} windmills. They were the Little Mill, a smock mill that was {{standing}} before 1813 and burnt down on 7 February 1862; The Hundred Acre Mill, a small tower mill which was last worked in 1872 and demolished in 1878 leaving a base which remains today; The Great Mill, a smock mill, {{the building of}} which was started in 1813 and completed in 1816, which was demolished in 1924 leaving the base, upon which a replica mill body is being built to serve as flats. On 23 January 2008 a fire started in the mill tower. The fire was declared <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a case of arson; Little is known of the fourth windmill, {{said to have been}} a vertical axle windmill designed by Stephen Hooper.|$|E

5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aware that they were being carried out.|$|E
5|$|The king's {{disintegrating}} {{authority over}} his army was also {{manifested in the}} invasion of Frankish Burgundy which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following Mummolus' victory at Embrun. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and {{opening the door to}} an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by Guntram in about 571. Alboin is generally thought <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually {{have been involved in the}} offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of Austrasia, Sigebert I. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as Chris Wickham.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, reigning European monarchs are {{admitted}} to the Order as Strangers. Constantine II, King of the Hellenes has not succeeded his father Paul of Greece {{as a member of}} the Order, neither during his short reign nor after being deposed. Similarly, Albert II, King of the Belgians and his son and successor Philippe are the only Belgian monarchs to date <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{admitted to the}} Order. For a time, both Juliana, Queen of the Netherlands and her successor, Queen Beatrix were concurrently members of the Order as Stranger Ladies of the Garter. Juan Carlos I of Spain and his successor Felipe VI of Spain are concurrently Stranger Knights of the Garter.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E
5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept in touch with her exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E
5|$|Nhu summoned 7 of the 10 generals to Gia Long Palace on August 20 for consultations. They {{presented}} their request for martial law and discussed how to disband {{the groups of}} monks and their supporters from the temples in Saigon. Nhu sent the generals to see Diem. The president listened {{to the group of}} seven, led by General Trần Văn Đôn. The group also included Army Chief General Trần Thiện Khiêm and General Nguyễn Khánh, commander of the II Corps in the Central Highlands. Khiêm and Khánh were two of the officers who were responsible for helping to put down the attempted coup against Diệm in 1960. Also present was Đôn's brother-in-law, General Đỗ Cao Trí, commander of I Corps, which oversaw the northernmost region around Huế, and General Lê Văn Kim, head of the military academy. Trí and Kim were favorites of the Diệm regime. General Tôn Thất Đính, a brash paratrooper, who was also South Vietnam's youngest-ever general, commanded the III Corps surrounding Saigon. General Huỳnh Văn Cao was the commander of the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta and {{the only one of the}} septet who would prove <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> involved in the later plotting against Diệm. Đính and Cao controlled the two corps regions closest to Saigon and therefore the two areas most crucial in the success or failure of a coup. Cao had used the Seventh Division of his IV Corps to storm the capital in 1960 to save Diệm.|$|E
