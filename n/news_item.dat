In what the <b>news</b> <b>item</b> said was the first full load of cargo leaving Buenos Aires in nearly a year, West Corum carried 107,000 animal hides, estimated to be enough for 1,000,000 pairs of shoes, along with consignments of wool and linseed. The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} that exploits audio and video features to automatically segment <b>news</b> <b>items.</b> Integration of audio and visual analysis can overcome {{the weakness of the}} approach only using the image analysis techniques. It brings our approach with more adaptation to variable existence situations of <b>news</b> <b>items.</b> The proposed approach identifies silence segments in accompanying audio, and integrates with shot segmentation results, as well as anchor shot detection results, to determine boundaries between <b>news</b> <b>items.</b> Experiments show that the integration of audio and video features is effective {{to solve the problem of}} automatic segmentation of <b>news</b> <b>items.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|News {{can be an}} {{important}} source of information to support decision making, the emergence of the internet made more and more news sources and consequently <b>news</b> <b>items</b> available. However only a very small subset of all these <b>news</b> <b>items</b> are relevant for the decision to be made. Therefore decision makers need an information system that is capable of extracting a set of relevant <b>news</b> <b>items</b> automatically, as it is impossible to sort out the huge amount of <b>news</b> <b>items</b> manually. This paper proposes a solution that provides decision makers with the ability to extract a set of <b>news</b> <b>items</b> related to specific concepts of interest, that aid them in the process of making a decision. This is accomplished by creating a knowledge base and developing a system that classifies news with respect to the knowledge base. This knowledge based is then visualized through an innovative graph representation, which can be used for retrieving relevant <b>news</b> <b>items.</b> A characteristic feature of our approach is the consideration of both concepts and concept relationships for the retrieval of relevant sets of news-items. As the time aspect of <b>news</b> <b>items</b> is {{an important}} facet, for example to build historic overviews or to take only recent developments into account, our solution will also be able to cope with that. ...|$|R

One incident was reported by the Los Angeles Times in August 1936. The <b>news</b> <b>item</b> reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Comos {{celebrated their}} silver wedding anniversary {{with a family}} trip to Italy. On the {{itinerary}} was an audience with Pope Pius XII. Como, who sat in a side wing of the Long Island church where he attended Sunday Mass {{in an effort to}} avoid attracting attention, was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world. A thorough check of both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a <b>news</b> <b>item</b> only after Archbishop Fulton J.

40|$|Nowadays, {{news feeds}} provide Web users {{with access to}} an {{unlimited}} amount of <b>news</b> <b>items,</b> however only a subset of them is relevant.

Although keyword search engines provide users with the ability to filter <b>news</b> <b>items,</b> they lack the power of understanding the domain where the <b>news</b> <b>items</b> reside. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a solution that provides users with the ability to ask for <b>news</b> <b>items</b> related to specific concepts they are interested in. This is accomplished by creating an ontology, developing a classifying system that populates the ontology by making use of a knowledge base, and providing an innovative graph representation of the ontology to retrieve relevant <b>news</b> <b>items.</b> A characteristic feature of our approach is the consideration of both concepts and concept relationships for the retrieval of user-relevant items. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Health {{news that}} appears in the press is of controvertial {{scientific}} quality. Moreover, many physicians believe that the press coverage of physicians, negatively affects their image. Methods: In this study press reports of health news reports for May and June of 2006 and 2008 were investigated. These <b>news</b> <b>items</b> were classified as health policy news, health information news, and news about physicians. News about physicians was further classified as positive or negative and health information news as with or without references. Results: In May and June of 2006 a total 3155 health-related <b>news</b> <b>items</b> were found. 913 (28. 9 %) were about health policies, 1126 were health information news (35. 6 %) and 112 (3. 5 %) were about physicians. Of the health information news 81. 4 % of the items had references while 18. 6 % did not. 83. 9 % of <b>news</b> <b>items</b> about doctors were regarded as positive, whereas 16. 1 % consisted of negative news. In 2008, 3543 health <b>news</b> <b>items</b> were found. 699 (19. 7 %) were related to health policies, 1824 (51. 4 %) were health information news and 122 (3. 4 %) were about physicians. 45. 9 % of the <b>news</b> <b>items</b> about physicians were positive whereas 54. 1 % were negative. Conclusion: The number of health-related <b>news</b> <b>items</b> are increasing {{in the two years}} studied here and show a significant increase in negative news about the physicians while health policy <b>news</b> <b>items</b> are declining...|$|R
