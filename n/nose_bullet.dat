50|$|Bullet shape {{does not}} factor in these methods either. Example: A solid, wide flat <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet,</b> may create more impact damage, than a solid, pointed or round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet</b> {{of the same}} caliber at the same velocity.|$|R
5000|$|All {{iterations}} of the AR-7 {{from the}} Armalite to the Henry U.S. Survival rifle use a bolt and dual recoil springs that are heavy compared to most other [...]22 semiautomatics. The AR-7 requires high velocity ammunition for reliable functioning. The manufacturers recommend use of 40 grain round <b>nose</b> <b>bullets</b> in high velocity loadings. It {{is possible to}} manually load a single round into the firing chamber, allowing use of flat <b>nosed</b> <b>bullets</b> or low velocity or subsonic ammunition.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{a pointed}} {{projectile}} {{will have a}} better drag coefficient (Cd) or ballistic coefficient (BC) than a round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet,</b> and a round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet</b> {{will have a better}} Cd or BC than a flat point bullet. Large radius curves, resulting in a shallower point angle, will produce lower drags, particularly at supersonic velocities. Hollow point bullets behave much like a flat point of the same point diameter. Projectiles designed for supersonic use often have a slightly tapered base at the rear, called a boat tail, which reduces air resistance in flight. Cannelures, which are recessed rings around the projectile used to crimp the projectile securely into the case, will cause an increase in drag.|$|R
5000|$|Although the [...]32 S&W's round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> {{was less}} than optimal for defense, it did offer {{significant}} improvement over these other common handgun calibers of the day.|$|E

50|$|Also in England, KYNOCH the {{well-known}} cartridge manufacturer, produced ammunition, {{referring to the}} 9.3×62mm as the '9.3 mm Mauser'.

50|$|Currently only Ruger makes limited runs of revolvers in this caliber for {{overseas}} sales, {{and only}} a few companies still manufacture ammunition. The majority that do offer it in only a 145 gr g lead round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet,</b> though Fiocchi still markets FMJ rounds. Some companies such as Buffalo Bore manufacture self-defense or hunting variants.|$|E
50|$|Long {{after the}} {{discontinuation}} of the Schmidt-Rubin Model 1889 rifle in the Swiss Armed Forces the GP90/03 round was updated in 1923 {{and called the}} GP90/23, for use in shooting competitions. The GP90/23 discarded the paper patching around the bullet and was loaded with a full metal jacket non heeled round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet.</b> The PC 88 propellant shape was changed to square flakes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{trajectory}} of the [...]500 Nitro Express {{is similar to that}} of the [...]30-30 Winchester cartridge with a 170 gr g Flat <b>Nose</b> <b>bullet.</b> The Hornady DGX and DGS ammunition which has the performance characteristics of typical [...]500 NE ammunition has an MPBR (maximum point blank range) of 197 yd. For these reasons the [...]500 Nitro Express should be considered a short range cartridge.|$|E
5000|$|Danish 8×58mmR, a 7.87 mm (0.31 in) rimmed round. Early rounds had a 15.3 grams (236 grains) long round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet,</b> and {{was loaded}} {{so that it}} {{produced}} a muzzle velocity of about 580 m/s (roughly 1900 ft/s), while later rounds had a 12.8 grams (198 grains) spitzer bullet and gave a muzzle velocity of 823 m/s (2740 ft/s).|$|R
5000|$|The round {{was given}} the {{designation}} 8mm M.88 scharfe Patrone (8mm M88 Sharp Cartridge). It was loaded with a 244gr round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet</b> and a 62gr charge of compressed black powder. This gave the bullet an approximate velocity of 1750 ft/s out of the M.88's 30" [...] barrel. Many M.86 rifles were converted to accommodate this new cartridge, creating the M.86/88 and M.86/90.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacture}} of spitzer style bullets in the [...]45 caliber {{has generally been}} a recent trend. These bullets provide better ballistic coefficients than the more common round nose or flat <b>nosed</b> <b>bullets</b> available in this caliber. The better ballistic coefficients translate to better longer range performance. Loaded with lighter bullets with better ballistic coefficients at higher velocities the [...]458 Lott {{can be used as}} a medium-range plains game rifle cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|Wadcutter (WC): Similar to the FNL, but {{completely}} cylindrical, in {{some instances}} with a slight concavity in the nose. This bullet derives its name from its popularity for target shooting, because the form factor cuts neat holes in paper targets, making scoring easier and more accurate and because it typically cuts a larger hole than a round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet,</b> a hit centered at the same spot can touch the next smaller ring and therefore score higher.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier [...]257 Weatherby Magnum rifles had a {{twist rate}} of 1 {{rotation}} in 12 in, which is {{too slow to}} stabilize long for caliber bullet. These bullets include most Barnes' bullets over 110 gr g and any conventional spitzer bullet of over 115 gr g. Hornady's 117 gr g round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> is made for such firearms which have the slower spin rate. Norma loads this bullet in the Weatherby's H257117RN ammunition for owner of such rifles who require a heavier bullet.|$|E
5000|$|Although the [...]22 Long Rifle has {{surpassed the}} [...]22 Short {{in the market}} place, many {{ammunition}} companies still produce [...]22 Shorts, and in a fairly wide variety. Most makers utilize the standard [...] solid round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> and [...] hollow point bullet weights for the [...]22 Short. Several types are made by CCI: a CB Short at 727 ft/s, target Shorts at 830 ft/s, their standard Short round with plated round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> at 1080 ft/s, and a high speed hunting load with plated hollow point bullet at 1105 ft/s. The [...]22 Short high-velocity exceeds {{the performance of the}} [...]22 Long (with the exception of CCI's High Velocity 1217fps Long loading), and the [...]22 Short has displaced the [...]22 Long as an alternate to the [...]22 Long Rifle for many [...]22 shooters. Fiocchi makes their Exacta Compensated Super Match SM200 with lead round nose at 650 ft/s. Remington produces a high velocity plated round nose at 1095 ft/s. Aguila makes both a match lead round nose at 1095 ft/s, and a [...] "high speed" [...] round with plated bullet also listed at 1095 ft/s. Also available is the RWS R25 match ammunition at 560 ft/s. Eley also makes their rapid fire match cartridge at 750 ft/s.|$|E
5000|$|... 6.5×55mm, a 6.5 mm (0.256 in) rimless round. Most {{variations}} {{are loaded}} for a chamber pressure of 350 MPa (roughly 51000 lbf/in²). Early rounds, with a 10.1 grams (156 grains) long round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet</b> (B-projectile) had a muzzle velocity of around 700 m/s (roughly 2300 ft/s), while later rounds with a 9 grams (139 grains) spitzer bullet (D-projectile) offered a muzzle velocity up to 870 m/s (2854 ft/s).|$|R
50|$|A wadcutter has a flat {{or nearly}} flat front that is {{typically}} {{as wide as}} the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter. Because the flat <b>nosed</b> <b>bullet</b> is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially designed semi-automatic pistols, although this is not always the case as some wadcutters may have rounded <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> profiles.|$|R
50|$|This {{ballistic}} crack {{depends on}} {{the speed of sound}}, which in turn depends mainly on air temperature. At sea level, an ambient temperature of 70 F, and under normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of sound is approximately 1140 ft/s. Bullets that travel near the speed of sound are considered transonic, which means that the airflow over the surface of the bullet, which at points travels faster than the bullet itself, can break the speed of sound. Pointed bullets which gradually displace air can get closer to the speed of sound than round <b>nosed</b> <b>bullets</b> before becoming transonic.|$|R
50|$|The Ag m/42 rear sight has two {{bullet drop}} {{compensation}} options, one calibrated for spitzer m/41 ammunition {{and one for}} round nose m/94 ammunition. Which one is installed can be seen between the sight screw and the range window. The bullet image (spitzer or round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet)</b> should match the ammunition used. With a hand adjustable elevation screw the rear sight can be adjusted for bullet drop in 100 m increments. From 100 to 800 m with m/41 spitzer ammunition, or 100 to 600 m m with m/94 round nose ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|... 7.5 mm Swiss {{cartridges}} {{have been}} in Swiss Army service since 1889 in their Schmidt-Rubin Model 1889 rifles. Originally using PC 88 ("powder composition-88") rauchschwacher (literally [...] "low smoke") cut tubular smokeless single-base powder relying on nitrocellulose as its propellant ingredient it {{was known as the}} Gewehrpatrone 1890 (GP90). The GP90 was loaded with a paper patched lead hollow based heeled steel capped round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet.</b> Starting {{from the rear of the}} nose section the bullets were wrapped around by 2 turns of paper, much like cotton patches were placed around the bullet of a musket. This paper patching was supposed to aid in the gas seal of the bullet and reduce metallic fouling of the barrel.|$|E
5000|$|The 8 mm M/88 {{cartridge}} {{which was}} introduced in 1888 and loaded with an 8.08 mm (.318 in) 14.6 g (226 gr) round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> was replaced on 3 April 1903 by the 7.92×57mm Mauser S Patrone (S ball cartridge) which was loaded with a new 8.20 mm (.323 in) 9.9 g (154 gr) spitzer bullet. The ammunition conversion was indicated by a small [...] "S" [...] stamped above the chamber and on the barrel {{at the back of}} the rear sight base. This was done since the 1888 pattern M/88 cartridge and 1903 S-bore pattern cartridge are two different non interchangeable chamberings. Since the new IS cartridge had a flatter trajectory the Lange Visier rear sight had to be changed with an [...] "S"-adapted Lange Visier.|$|E
40|$|Detector shape {{optimization}} study was camed {{out for the}} high resolution 4 x 4 array BGO-PMT coupling scheme to be employed in the spherical positron emission tomograph [11. To improve the light collection efficiency in the BGO detector array, we have employed <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> shape BGO crystal in the front side {{as well as in}} the back side of detector the latter to be coupled to PMT's photocathode. First, it is believed that the smooth and round front side <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> shape could eliminate the sharp comers of the crystal thereby improves the light collection efficiency. Secondly, the <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> shape at the back side of crystal which to be coupled to PMT will provide optimal coupling between the crystal and PMT by the focusing property of the <b>bullet</b> <b>nose</b> shape of the crystal. Computer simulations and experimental study were carried out and results are reported...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} round had {{a copper}} case and a round <b>nose</b> lead <b>bullet.</b> In 1871, and again 1878, the bullet {{was replaced with}} an improved paper patched round. Despite improvements, bullet performance changed very little.|$|R

Curiously, Kynoch lists loads for the 9.5mm Mannlicher-Schoenauer with a 45 grain charge of smokeless propellant (for a muzzle velocity of 2200 fps) and the [...] ".375 Rimless Nitro Express" [...] with a reduced 43 grain charge (for a muzzle velocity of 2100 fps). This may have reflected the differences in the regulation of the sights by the respective manufacturers and distributors, between Westley Richards for the higher powered Mannlicher-Schoenauer loading and the trade rifles with the generic [...]375 Rimless Nitro Express loading.|$|E
5000|$|While {{some writers}} in the 1960s {{considered}} the [...]351 SL inadequate as a deer round, its killing power {{is very similar to}} the original loadings of the 30-30 and has similar energy at the muzzle as 35 Remington does at approximately 75 yards—pushing a 180 grain largish diameter (35 caliber) jacketed soft <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> at nearly 1900 fps. It has had some popularity in the jungle, where its lack of long-range power or accuracy are less important. When first introduced, many found the [...]351 SL to be a good deer cartridge at ranges under 200 yards, at least in comparison to the many low-pressure cartridges of the black powder era. Some of the things leading to the commercial death of the cartridge were its unusual bullet diameter (.351 vs all the other 20th century 35 caliber rifle and handgun cartridges which are [...]357 or [...]358) and the unusual rebated rim design of the case.|$|E
5000|$|The basic SWC design {{consists}} of a roughly conical nose, truncated with a flat point (called a meplat), sitting on a cylinder (A at right). The base of the cone is slightly smaller in diameter than the cylinder, leaving a sharp shoulder. The flat nose punches a clean hole in the target, rather than tearing it like a round <b>nose</b> <b>bullet</b> would, and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly, allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target. The SWC design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter, as its conical nose produces less drag than the flat cylinder. A typical modification is to alter the conical section to make the sides concave, to reduce the bullet mass, or convex, to increase it. B shows a concave sided SWC, typical of a lightweight [...]45 ACP bullet used in [...] bullseye shooting. The concave sides reduce the bullet weight, and thus the recoil, while keeping the overall length of the bullet long enough to feed reliably in a semi-automatic pistol such as the M1911 commonly found in bullseye competitions.|$|E
