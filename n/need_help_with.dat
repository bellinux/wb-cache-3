40|$|Purpose: There is an {{increased}} focus on supporting patients with cancer to actively {{participate in their}} healthcare, an approach commonly termed 'self-management'. Comparing unmet self-management needs across cancer types may reveal opportunities to adapt effective self-management support strategies from one cancer type to another. Given that breast and colorectal cancers are prevalent, and have high survival rates, we compared these patients' recent <b>need</b> for <b>help</b> <b>with</b> self-management. Method: Data on multiple aspects of self-management were collected from 717 patients with breast cancer and 336 patients with colorectal cancer attending one of 13 Australian medical oncology treatment centres. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between the proportion of patients with breast or colorectal cancer who reported a <b>need</b> for <b>help</b> <b>with</b> at least one aspect of self-management. Patients with breast cancer were significantly more likely to report <b>needing</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> exercising more, while patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to report <b>needing</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> reducing alcohol consumption. When controlling for treatment centre, patients who were younger, experiencing distress or had not received chemotherapy were more likely to report <b>needing</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> at least one aspect of self-management. Conclusion: A substantial minority of patients reported an unmet need for self-management support. This indicates that high-quality intervention research is needed to identify effective self-management support strategies, as well as implementation trials to identify approaches to translating these strategies into practice. Future research should continue to explore whether self-management support strategies could be adapted across cancer types...|$|R
