500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E

[...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it as a negative.

2500|$|Zeman {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} visit Moscow for the 2015 Victory Day celebrations and the 70th anniversary of the liberation from Nazi Germany. He said that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at military equipment, but rather to honour the soldiers who had sacrificed their lives. He described his visit to Moscow as an [...] "expression of thankfulness that we in this country don't have to speak German, if we would have become submissive collaborators of Aryan origin", and that [...] "we don't have to say Heil Hitler, Heil Himmler, Heil GÃ¶ring, and eventually Heil Heydrich, that would have been particularly interesting". Most other EU leaders declared that they would not attend the events due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro criticized the decision, saying that it would [...] "be awkward" [...] if Zeman was the only politician from the EU at the ceremony. Zeman responded by banning him from the Prague Castle.|$|E

What sort of Moslem paradise would quiet the terrible fury of moral {{repulsion}} and cowed resistance which, like an eating pain intensifying into torture, concentrates the mind in that poisonous misery?

5000|$|Progress on {{the album}} was delayed again with the {{recording}} and release of her second covers album Jukebox in 2008, and later by her relationship with Giovanni Ribisi. Following the tour in support of Jukebox, Marshall resumed recording at The Boat Studio in Silverlake, California, where she began work on newly written, electronic material, with Marshall claiming, [...] "I had no fucking idea what to do, but I knew I was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> even <b>look</b> at a piano or touch a guitar. So I {{started out with a}} weird synthesizer. Eventually I had these skeletons of songs, but then I felt like a failure because I thought, 'This is not fucking good, I don't know what I'm doing.' And I didn't know what I was doing. I had lyrics and a beat and notes, but I didn't have anything else. It sounded like a naked, shivering alien." [...] This period of inactivity placed a strain on Marshall's relationship with her label Matador who, concerned by the lack of progress, began pressuring Marshall to work with a producer. Marshallâwho hadn't worked with a producer since Ed Douglas recorded both Dear Sir and Myra Lee on the same day in December 1994âresisted, stating [...] "Telling musician they need a producer is like telling someone that they need a nose job.

Sharon remembered her brutal honesty and her one-of-kind hats. Devon recalled that before Dru came into his life, {{no one had ever}} believed in him, and how she forced him through her love to believe in himself.

60|$|As J----- and I were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the Jewel-room, we loitered {{about in}} the open space, before the White Tower, while the tall, slender, white-haired, gentlemanly warder led {{the rest of the}} party into that apartment. We found what one might take for a square in a town, with gabled houses lifting their peaks on one side, and various edifices {{enclosing}} the other sides, and the great White Tower,--now more black than white,--rising venerable, and rather picturesque than otherwise, the most prominent object in the scene. I have no plan nor available idea of it whatever in my mind, but it seems really to be a town within itself, with streets, avenues, and all that pertains to human life. There were soldiers going through their exercise in the open space, and along {{at the base of the}} White Tower lay a great many cannon and mortars, some of which were of Turkish manufacture, and immensely long and ponderous. Others, likewise of mighty size, had once belonged to the famous ship Great Harry, and had lain for ages under the sea. Others were East-Indian. Several were beautiful specimens of workmanship. The mortars--some so large that a fair-sized man might easily be rammed into them--held their great mouths slanting upward to the sky, and mostly contained a quantity of rain-water. While we were looking at these warlike toys,--for I suppose not one of them will ever thunder in earnest again,--the warder reappeared with his ladies, and, leading us all to a certain part of the open space, he struck his foot on the small stones with which it is paved, and told us that we were standing on the spot where Anne Boleyn and Catharine Parr were beheaded. It is not exactly in the centre of the square, but on a line with one of the angles of the White Tower. I forgot to mention that the middle of the open space is occupied by a marble statue of Wellington, which appeared to me very poor and laboriously spirited.|$|E

That lady knew that the vote was lost, lost unless she would denounce the man whom Rachel loved; and she determined at once {{that she would not}} denounce him. There are many things which such a woman will do to gain such an object. She could smile when Tappitt was offensive; she could smile again when Mrs. Tappitt talked like a kitchenmaid. She could flatter them both, and pretend to talk seriously with them about Jews and her own Church feelings. She could have given up to them Luke Rowan,--if he had stood alone. But she could not give up the girl she had chaperoned, and upon whom, during that chaperoning, her good-will and kindly feelings had fallen. Rachel had pleased her eye, and gratified her sense of feminine nicety. She felt that a word said against Rowan would be a word said also against Rachel; and therefore, throwing her husband over for the nonce, she resolved to sacrifice the vote and stand up for her friend. [...] "Well, yes; I do," [...] said she, meeting Tappitt's eye steadily. She was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> out of countenance by Mr. Tappitt.|$|R

But he could <b>not</b> help <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> again at the dark opening between the little trees. He walked back and again the cold breath blew against his face; he felt in it the icy coldness of the water. It drew him in; he separated the little trees on either side. He walked on as if a hidden power urged him. And now the path became less clear; trees and bushes grew in the way and hindered him, brambles and long creeping plants twisted about his legs and pulled him back. But the wind with its coldness of the black water drew him on.... The birds of the air were hushed, and not one of the thousand insects of the wood uttered a note. Great trees above him hid the light. The silence was ghastly; he felt as if he were the only person in the world.|$|R

Obviously, administrators behind their desks have no inkling of what dedicated botanists (and zoologists) are doing in the forest. Especially when the scientists come from the so-called ârichâ countries the civil servants ask themselves why anybody would like to exchange a nice chair in an air-conditioned office with a lot of paper work for a most uncomfortable, hard log under a leaky fly in an insect-infested, humid, scary forest. Since they themselves certainly are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take a <b>look</b> there for themselves, they suspect other motives, and until they find out what these are, scientists are under suspicion and should be kept on a leash.
