5|$|Until 1999, Metro ended {{service at}} midnight every night, and weekend service began at 8 am. That year, WMATA began late <b>night</b> <b>service</b> on Fridays and Saturdays until 1 am. By 2007, with {{encouragement}} from businesses, that closing {{time had been}} pushed back to 3 am, with peak fares in effect for entries after midnight. There were plans floated to end late <b>night</b> <b>service</b> due to costs in 2011, but they were met with resistance by riders.|$|E
5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late <b>night</b> <b>service</b> is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to <b>night</b> <b>service,</b> with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
5|$|NSB also {{operates}} {{intercity services}} from Trondheim to Bodø on the Nordland Line. These consist of two daily through trains, {{one day and}} one <b>night</b> <b>service,</b> with an additional service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. Stjørdal and Steinkjer are the only stations along the line which remain manned. NSB uses a combination of Class 93 diesel multiple units and Di4-hauled trains.

50|$|In 1936, 152 and 153 {{were sold}} for further {{use on the}} Ballarat and Bendigo {{networks}} respectively. Numbers 151, 174-176 were rebuilt to operate all <b>night</b> <b>services</b> in 1937 and in this role travelled across the network. They were withdrawn after all <b>night</b> <b>services</b> ceased in 1957.|$|R
5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, <b>night</b> <b>service</b> was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2006, the MTA Bus Company {{took over}} the {{operations}} of the Green Lines routes as part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes. On February 20, 2006, the city {{took over the}} operations of Triboro Coach. Shortly after the takeover, in April 2006, the Q53 nonstop express was converted to a standard limited-stop service, with the MTA adding six stops along Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. In January 2007, the Q53 was routed away from the 63rd Drive subway station, running the entire length of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. On August 31, 2008, the Q21 was extended north along Woodhaven Boulevard. These service changes led to an increase in ridership along the corridor. Due to the shift in ridership patterns, late <b>night</b> <b>service</b> on the Q11 after midnight was truncated to Pitkin Avenue on September 12, 2010. Q21 service was also adjusted to run for longer during the evenings.|$|E
5|$|Tuska {{reformed}} {{services at}} B'nai Israel, removing piyyutim (liturgical poems) in 1861, adding an organ and mixed-gender choir in 1862, and confirmation ceremonies in 1863. He also shortened the prayer book (adopting Wise's Minhag America version), added a late Friday <b>night</b> <b>service,</b> and created patriotically themed services for Thanksgiving and National Fast Day. When more pews {{were required to}} accommodate the worshipers, they were first added to the men's and women's sections, then family pews were added {{where men and women}} could sit together.

He was also involved in the broader Memphis community, and participated in interfaith services.|$|E

25|$|By 1967, {{all other}} ferries in New York City had closed due to {{competition}} by automobile traffic, and the St. George to Whitehall route {{was the only}} ferry in the city. It remained as such until the 1980s, when other ferry routes were restarted. Off-peak service was reduced in 1967, but two months later that service was restored. However, due to the city's mid-1970s financial crisis, <b>night</b> <b>service</b> ended on July 1, 1975, with alternate service being provided by the Fourth Avenue subway. <b>Night</b> <b>service</b> was restored in the 1980s after two boats, comprising the current Austen class, were ordered specifically for overnight voyages.
