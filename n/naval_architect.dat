5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} saddled the Royal Navy {{with a pair}} {{of ships}} that could not operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction. The <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although they cost about two-thirds as much.|$|E
5|$|Henri IV was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy {{built to}} test {{some of the}} ideas of the prominent <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Louis-Émile Bertin. She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She was sent to reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} Chaoyong was advertised by its designer, British <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Sir George Wightwick Rendel, {{as an example}} of a {{low-cost}} cruiser able to withstand larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships.|$|E

Kerr had a younger brother, Edmund ("Teddy"), who became a journalist. He was killed in a road rage incident in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Norman Selfe (9 December 1839– 15 October 1911) was an Australian engineer, <b>naval</b> <b>architect,</b> inventor, urban planner and outspoken {{advocate}} of technical education. After emigrating to Sydney {{with his family}} from England as a boy he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and transport systems. For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel cantilever bridge across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.|$|E

5|$|Dupuy de Lôme was an {{armoured}} cruiser {{built for}} the French Navy (Marine Nationale) during the late 1880s and 1890s. She is considered {{by some to be}} the world's first armoured cruiser and was intended to attack enemy merchant ships. The ship was named after the <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Henri Dupuy de Lôme. Dupuy de Lômes completion was delayed by almost two years by problems with her boilers, but she was finally commissioned in 1895 and assigned to the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord), based at Brest, for most of her career. The ship made a number of visits to foreign ports before she began a lengthy reconstruction in 1902. By the time this was completed in 1906, the cruiser was regarded as obsolete and Dupuy de Lôme was placed in reserve, aside from one assignment in Morocco.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{strategy}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy {{was based on the}} radical Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, as promoted by French military advisor and <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Emile Bertin. This emphasised cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built s by the Imperial Chinese Beiyang Fleet in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government to acknowledge that the IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured s ordered from France would not suffice, despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.|$|E
5|$|Laid {{down at the}} Thames Ironworks {{shipyard}} in London, England in 1865, {{the ship}} was originally ordered by the Ottoman Empire as the Fatikh. The ship was built to a design created by the British <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Edward Reed. Before her launch, the Prussian Navy purchased the ship on 6 February 1867 and initially renamed it Wilhelm I. On 14 December 1867, the ship was renamed again, as König Wilhelm. She was launched on 25 April 1868 and commissioned {{less than a year}} later, on 20 February 1869. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See Ludwig von Henk. The ship was the largest and most powerful vessel in the Prussian fleet, and served as its flagship. Indeed, König Wilhelm remained the largest German vessel until 1891. This was in part {{due to the fact that}} Germany laid down only one small ironclad between 1876 and 1888; the four s, launched in 1891 and 1892, were the first ships to surpass König Wilhelm in size.|$|E

5|$|The IJN began reevaluating the Nagato {{design in}} light of {{lessons learned from the}} Battle of Jutland in May 1916, {{experiments}} evaluating armor protection, and newly acquired information on the protective schemes of British and American capital ships. These lessons highlighted the need for better protection of the main gun turrets and magazines, as well as thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire. Existing methods of defense against mines and torpedoes had also proved to be inadequate and needed improvement. Eleven new designs were rejected between October and early 1917 before Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, superintendent of shipbuilding and the <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> in charge of the fundamental design of the ships of the Eight-Eight Fleet, presented a heavily modified version of the Nagato design, A-125, to be built in lieu of the second ship of the class, Mutsu, on 12 June 1917, well before she was actually laid down.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Japan and China {{heightened}} {{after the}} former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation {{of the murder}} of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan. The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥3.9–4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad. No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain. This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one armored frigate and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British <b>naval</b> <b>architect</b> Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.|$|E
