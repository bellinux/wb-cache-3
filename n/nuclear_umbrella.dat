Three bombers resulted from OR229: the Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, known as the V bombers. The high priority accorded to the atomic bomb programme was not shared by the V bomber programme. Vickers was given the first production order for 25 Valiants on 9 February 1951, and they were delivered on 8 February 1955. The Vulcan and Victor followed, entering service in 1956 and 1957 respectively. Thus, when the first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to the Bomber Command Armaments School at RAF Wittering on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them. For the time being, the United Kingdom remained dependent on the American <b>nuclear</b> <b>umbrella.</b>|$|E

25|$|Firstly, it {{appeared}} increasingly problematic to {{find room for}} a nuclear weapons program in the defense economy; secondly, the situation was proving that future wars would be likely waged with conventional weapons (especially, after studying the NATO's flexible response doctrine); thirdly, it was decided (yet unclear how) that Sweden was covered by the US <b>nuclear</b> <b>umbrella.</b> Just before the Government's position became known, the Defense Ministry announced that Sweden's security would be undermined if the country joined the non-proliferation agreement, because the treaty addressed small countries that hadn't acquired any nuclear weapons yet, while the US and the Soviet Union's nuclear possessions remained untouched. Thus, Sweden was under risk to yield its Freedom of action to nothing in return, while the nuclear threat against the country would remain.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear arms have {{revolutionized}} the ways by which {{human beings are}} able to harm one another. Omnipresent in {{the status quo is}} a nuclear tension, and whether subtly or more overtly, this tension underlies a great many international relationships. While Westphalian paranoia and neorealist power perceptions encourage populations to continue placing their faith in <b>nuclear</b> <b>umbrellas</b> and deterrence strategies, scholars and activists increasingly claim that without the realization of universal disarmament, humanity concedes to the inevitability of future nuclear detonation. New disarmament initiatives concentrate heavily on the implications of nuclear weaponry in a sense that supersedes the security of only particular sovereign populations. Rooted in constructivist theory that stresses the importance of processes and relationships to the international system, these new initiatives seem to be gaining momentum. As the world continues to globalize, transnational cultural interactions may be stimulating the development of increasingly worldly identities more prone to support disarmament campaigns. Not only are we witnessing a pivot toward a more holistic devotion to the global good and global identities, but we are also seeing increasingly frequent normative attacks on nuclear legitimacy and a transition toward international collective security architecture, both of which seem to manifest {{as a result of the}} identity shifts themselves. The following research utilizes a qualitative, interview-based model and will discuss the future feasibility of disarmament initiatives with a particular concentration on constructivist perceptions of the international system...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear weapons pose an {{increased}} international threat to {{security in the}} modem era. Cheap transportation {{and the opening of}} national borders for trade have made it easy for nuclear materials to cross national boundaries. Informal networks have sprouted up, facilitating the proliferation and exchange of nuclear materials and the technology required to turn those materials into weapons. Advances in technology have made it easier to enrich uranium, instilling concerns of increased nuclear weapons proliferation. These changes in technology, the development of informal nuclear networks, and lax security in safeguarding weapons by states such as Russia and Pakistan have fueled global fears that more states and even terrorist organizations could build nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the international community has not developed a regulatory regime capable of handling modern nuclear threats. The several bodies of international law that do currently regulate nuclear weapons oscillate between promoting the goals of nonproliferation and disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the centerpiece of the international regulatory regime and focuses heavily on nonproliferation, but also purports to work towards the nonbinding goal of disarmament. The NPT, however, has failed {{to prevent the spread of}} nuclear weapons and has not adequately promoted disarmament. The treaty was adopted during the Cold War and addresses Cold War fears of proliferation by states outside the United States 2 ̆ 7 and Soviet Union 2 ̆ 7 s <b>nuclear</b> <b>umbrellas.</b> It codifies a nuclear monopoly that has lost legitimacy over time, does not address current regional hotspots, and is silent about the threat of terrorism. The United Nations Security Council has passed several resolutions responding to direct nuclear threats from specific actors but has never attempted to provide a framework for the global regulation of nuclear weapons. Security Council Resolution 1887 on nuclear nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament represents a potential shift in emphasis for the regulation of nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War era. Unlike the NPT, this resolution emphasizes disarmament as its primary mission, though it also continues to reaffirm the principle of nonproliferation. The Security Council 2 ̆ 7 s unanimous adoption of Resolution 1887 indicates a willingness by international leaders to fully eliminate global nuclear stockpiles. It also recognizes that disarmament will limit regional proliferation fears and diminish the threat from terrorists. Resolution 1887, however, has several problems. It tries to salvage the framework of the NPT when it could have served better as a starting point for a new international regime. The resolution also should call for a stronger enforcement mechanism-specifically targeted, automatic sanctions. To address these problems, Resolution 1887 needs some amendment in its scope to effectively address the threat of nuclear weapons. This Note analyzes the successes and shortcomings of Resolution 1887...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{underwater}} tests was to detect the radiation contamination of the ships after an underwater nuclear explosion. This meant that the contaminated ships required unique [...] "radsafe" [...] preparations so that the data could be quickly accounted for. After the data on the damage and radiation was recorded, the ships needed decontamination work completed before repairs could be completed. The Radiological and Decontamination Unit consisting of 200 enlisted and one officer was created for task of decontamination. After decontamination, the target ships were repaired {{for use in a}} second underwater nuclear weapons test. The amount of radiation exposure was debated {{for the safety of the}} crews. Roentgens (R) were used to gage the gamma radiation that affected the units working on the nuclear tests. For the underwater test crew, a limit of 5 R per blast along with 10 R per operation was referenced as the limit for exposure. These initial limits were rejected and maximum permissible exposure standards (MPE) were solidified by commanders for the crews working on the decontamination unit. Due to the fast recovery of ships, high contamination values were expected by commanders and set the standard to four roentgens per hour (R/hr). An excess of 4 R/hr was designated off limits of recovery units. Personnel were given special breathing equipment to work in the interior of ships with an R/hr higher than one. High numbers of personnel working the tests were used to keep individuals within the MPE. Times were calculated to keep the total exposure below two roentgens for the personnel working on the ships. A floating decontamination facility was created on board a transport ship for the Wahoo and <b>Umbrella</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests. This allowed important data analysis and an increase in recovery efficiency.|$|R

2500|$|The United States was {{concerned}} {{with the prospect of}} a nuclear Sweden, which jeopardized the world with further nuclear proliferation. In 1956, the United States and Sweden signed an agreement on civilian nuclear energy cooperation. The two parties agreed to exchange information regarding the construction, operation and development of research reactors. The Swedish government committed itself to providing the AEC with information regarding nuclear energy developments in Sweden. The deal also implied that the US <b>nuclear</b> <b>umbrella</b> would protect Sweden, and so {{there was no need for}} any nuclear arms. In May 1956, the National Federation of Social Democratic Women in Sweden took a stand against nuclear weapons, which heretofore had not been a major public issue in Sweden. Swedlund's position became the focal point for an intense debate in the media during 1957. The FOA's chief director, Hugo Larsson, also helped to energize the debate with an interview in Dagens Eko in 1957, in which he said that Sweden had the resources to build nuclear weapons, which could be completed in 1963-1964. [...] Among the proponents of Swedish nuclear weapons program was Dagens Nyheters chief editor, Herbert Tingsten, and former Social Democratic Defense Minister Per Edvin Sköld. Even the prospective leader of the Liberal People's Party, Per Ahlmark, was an advocate of Swedish nuclear weapons. Many of opponents of Swedish nuclear weapons development were found on the cultural left. The nuclear weapons issue would appear frequently in the press cultural pages. Meanwhile, among the opponents were Inga Thorsson, Ernst Wigforss, and Östen Unden. The editor of Folket i Bild, Per Anders Fogelström, advocated against Swedish nuclear weapons in the magazine, and published a book “Instead of the Atomic Bomb” together with Social Democratic student politician, Roland Morell. In 1957, they launched a petition against Swedish nuclear weapons, that was signed by 95,000 people and was handed over to Tage Erlander in February 1958.|$|E

The shift therefore required a reassessment of omnidirectional diplomacy.|$|E
