40|$|The {{advantages}} {{obtained by}} the use of the new rapid scanners have made computer tomography the method of choice for the investigation of kidney lesions. In fact, the benefits of the second generation of scanners, which were already of excellent quality, have been even furthur increased {{by the use of}} the rapid scanners which can be used to study the vascularization of renal lesions, for which traditional <b>nephrotomography</b> has been employed for a long period. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{arteriography}} and <b>nephrotomography</b> {{are useful}} in distinguishing between renal neoplasmas and cysts. In {{the great majority of}} cases the well-vascularized neoplasm is readily identified. However, the arteriographic diagnosis of an “avascular lesion” is incomplete. These lesions make up a widely heterogeneous group, including the common simple renal cysts, avascular and degenerated neoplasms and congenital malformations. Percutaneous puncture of these “avascular” lesions under image-amplified fluoroscopy is a safe and simple means of obtaining further diagnostic information, often of decisive value...|$|E
40|$|To {{document}} the severity {{and degree of}} renal injury multiple studies may be necessary, including excretory urography, <b>nephrotomography,</b> arteriography and ultrasonographic examination. Even these extensive studies fail at times to provide sufficient information for treatment of the injury. However, the parenchymal injuries and extrarenal hematomas are depicted more accurately by computed tomography (CT). Moreover, dynamic CT can assess parenchymal enhancement during the capillary phase. Therefore, dynamic CT is useful in assessing the renal contusion and hematoma. In addition, {{it appears to be}} highly reliable and relatively noninvasive means of diagnosing renal trauma...|$|E
40|$|The idea {{of using}} {{intravenously}} injected radiopaque con-trast media to perform arteriography has occurred to many investigators {{over the past several}} decades because of its potential to demonstrate arterial anatomy in a relatively noninvasive manner. However, attempts to use this ap-proach for angiography have been only partially successful until very recently. In 1938, Robb and Steinberg [1, 2] were the first to propose and carry out intravenous angiocardiog-raphy. This approach was relatively successful but became obsolete after introduction of direct injection into the cardiac chambers by means of catheters. Evans and Poker [3] deserve credit for the development of <b>nephrotomography.</b> In some of their original publications the arterial phase was recorded by means of tomographic cuts taken at the level of the aorta and renal arteries. Thi...|$|E
40|$|Pheochromocytoma is an {{uncommon}} tumor in childhood. The simultaneous occurrence of adrenal and cervical pheochromocytomas {{is a rare}} phenomenon; to our knowledge, this combination {{has been reported in}} the literature only once. Cervical pheochromocytomas are more accurately termed "aorticosympathetic paragangliomas. " In children, 50 % of pheochromocytomas are bilateral, multiple, or extra-adrenal. An increased familial incidence in the form of simple mendelian dominance is also noted in the pediatric age group. Bolus <b>nephrotomography</b> is extremely effective in identifying adrenal pheochromocytomas in children. To prepare the patient for surgery, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agent is administered from 7 to 10 days before operation and a beta-blocking agent is administered 3 days before. A transabdominal approach is essential because of the frequent extra-adrenal sites and multicentricity of the tumor in children...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of pheochromocytoma rests primarily on {{determination of the}} 24 -hour urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. In most cases <b>nephrotomography</b> and selective arteriography or venography, or both, are sufficient to localize the tumour. Selective venous catheterization and the assay of plasma catecholamines should be considered for pheochromocytoma localization in: (a) patients in whom standard techniques fail to localize the tumour; (b) patients who exhibit idiosyncratic reactions to the angiographic contrast materials; (c) young patients or patients with familial pheochromocytoma, including those with multiple neurofibromatosis or multiple endocrine adenomatosis, type 2; (d) patients with recurrent, malignant, or suspected multicentric or extra-adrenal tumours; and (e) patients excreting only norepinephrine in the urine. The validity of the results is particularly dependent on the skill with which venous catheterization is carried out...|$|E
40|$|Nephrectomy {{has been}} carried out in 34 {{patients}} with hypertension associated with unilateral parenchymal renal disease (28 with unilateral pyelonephritis, 3 tuberculosis, 2 hypoplasia, and 1 adenocarcinoma). In 13 of the patients the blood pressure was corrected, in four it was improved, and in 17 it was unaffected. The intravenous pyelogram (by the infusion technique with <b>nephrotomography</b> if necessary) and renogram give adequate information in most patients with unilateral parenchymal renal disease but may need to be supplemented by aortography, or retrograde pyelography, or divided renal function studies in a few special circumstances. When the function of the damaged kidney is less than 25 % of the total (which is well maintained), and the contralateral kidney is intact, nephrectomy is recommended provided the hypertension is significant; success is more likely in younger patients with a short history of hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{cases of}} renal cell {{carcinoma}} were clinically studied. Symptoms: Initial symptom was hematuria in seven patients, and gastro-intestinal disorder or general malaise in two patients. No patient had complete set of triad-hematuria, mass and pain. Pyrexia seen in three cases disappeared after nephrectomy. Diagnosis: Renoscintigram was more useful than pyelogram when a tumor was relatively small and located near the capsule. <b>Nephrotomography</b> was helpful for differential diagnosis from cyst. Treatments: As a rule, transperitoneal approach was taken. In two cases of big renal tumor weighing more than 1000 grams, nephrectomy was successfully performed under general hypothermic anesthesia. All the cases received postoperative radiation therapy, and two received preoperative irradiation with clinical effect. As to chemotherapy, continuous infusion of 5 -fluorouracil into the renal artery was tried for 13 days in one patient. Prognostic factors: Out of factors affecting prognosis, intravenous invasion or thrombosis of the tumor was considered most significant...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} some {{structures}} or {{features such as}} the "inter-renuncular septum", the "echogenic triangle" and the "echogenic line" have been described to support {{the concept of a}} kidney resulting from the fusion of two masses or renunculi. To clarify this concept and to understand the meaning of the above echographic features better, the authors have examined prospectively by sonography the kidneys of 50 children, 200 adults with a single collecting system, 25 adults with a duplicated collecting system and 32 cadavers. Furthermore, to help explain the sonographic features, we have examined 32 cadaver kidneys with sonography and 10 cadaver kidneys with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The sonographic, MRI and anatomical correlations have shown that the "echogenic triangle" and the "echogenic line" are not renuncular residuals, but simply an extension of the hilar fat visible when the renal sinus is rather deep. The intermediate cortical mass is not a septum dividing the kidney into an upper and lower renunculus, but a column of parenchymal tissue crossing the renal sinus, which, from an anatomical point of view, is an accessory renal lobe. The presence of two renunculi, suggested in a previous study with cortical <b>nephrotomography,</b> has not been confirmed...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty-three urinary tract {{injuries}} were experienced during {{ten years of}} 1958 to 1967, and statistical observation of them was done along with discussions on some present-day problems. 1. Statistics. 1) 0. 8 % of total out-patients had urinary tract injury, and 0. 5 % had injury of genital organ. 2) As to location of 88 urinary tract injuries, 36 (40. 9 %) had the upper and 52 (59. 1 %) had the lower tract injury being 1 1 / 2 times as frequent as the former. 3) Kidney injury showed a peak in 1966. Injury to the urethra and that to the genital organs have been yearly increasing. 4) As to age the third decade was the first victim with striking increase of the second decade in recent years. 5) Cause of the injuries could be tabulated as follows: 6) Degree of injuries could be summarized as follows: i) Kidney-light 47. 2 % moderate 27. 8 % severe (complete fissure of the parenchyma) 25. 0 % All of them were closed and non-penetrating injuries. ii) Urethra-complete rupture 30. 6 % incomplete rupture 32. 3 % partial rupture 14. 3 % iii) Genitalia-testicular contusion 30. 6 % peno-scrotal contusion 29. 1 % ruptured tunica albuginea of testis 18. 2 % laceration of testis 9. 1 % genital skin ablation 3. 6 % 7) Urethral injuries could be tabulated as follows: 8) Associated injuries frequent in renal injury were fracture of rib, mesenteric hematoma, and pelvic fracture in order. Fracture of the pelvis was most common in injury to the bladder and urethra. 9) As to treatment, renal injuries were treated by nephrectomy in 36. 1 %, conservative surgery in 11. 1 % and non-operatively in 52. 8 %. Urethral injuries were treated by pull-through operation in 34. 7 %, urethrorrhaphy in 30. 6 %, and conservatively in 26. 5 %. 10) As late complications of the urethral injury, stricture of the urethra (S) and impotence (1) were seen in the incidence as follows: II. A few problems in urinary tcact injury. 1) In order to determine degree of traumatic shock, blood pH, pC 02, p 02, hematocrit, circulating blood volume, electrolytes, base excess, BUN, lactic/pyruvic acid ratio, O 2 deficit, extra-cellular fluid volume, and central venous pressure should be measured. Lactic/pyruvic acid ratio over 20 or O 2 deficit below 120 ml/kg might indicate an irreversible shock. 2) In this article, usefulness of diagnostic methods for renal injury were discussed, particularly on those we routinely perform as KUB, IVP, drip infusion pyelography, renal angiography, drip infusion <b>nephrotomography,</b> and ultrasonic study. 3) Anyone of the following conditions was regarded as indication for operative treatment of injured kidney. a) Marked gross hematuria continuing more than 24 hours. b) Abdominal mass progressively increasing in size or presence of urine infiltration. c) Low blood pressure not improved by repeated blood transfusion. d) Marked deformity on IV pyelogram and presence of massive extravasated dye. e) Gross injury of the renal pedicle or intrarenal vessels revealed by renal arteriography and/or drip infusion tomography. Severe fissure or laceration disclosed by the same study. f) Open injury or possible presence of associated injury of other abdominal organs. g) Infection or traumatic renal infarction. III. Experimental study on the change of leucine amino-peptidase (LAP) {{at the time of}} renal injury showed that LAP in the kidney tissue got released into blood within a few, hours after injury and LAP-activity of the dissected renal tissue was lowered with course of time. Further study on LAP isozymes might be necessary. IV. In a case of impotence of organic cause after injury, a new prosthesis, similar to that developed by Pearman (1966), was surgically placed with success...|$|E
