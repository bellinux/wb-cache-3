50|$|In the US, <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimates</b> are {{detailed}} analyses, {{typically in}} the tens to hundreds of pages, produced once a reasonable consensus is reached. These documents may contain dissenting footnotes, also called reclamas, documenting a disagreement by a particular organization or specialists. NIEs are typically associated with standing task groups.

5000|$|Another function, however, was {{preparing}} [...] "estimates", which try {{to predict the}} future.

Special <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimates</b> (SNIE) were quick-response publications, often providing guidance in a crisis, but were still interagency consensus rather than CIA alone.|$|R

25|$|In August, a <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate,</b> {{produced}} by the CIA, predicted that the Communists, legitimized by the Geneva agreement, would take quick control of the North, and plan to take over all of Vietnam. The estimate went on that Diệm's government was opposed both by Communist and non-Communist elements. Pro-French factions were seen as preparing to overthrow it, while Viet Minh would take a longer view.

25|$|Intellipedia {{was created}} to share {{information}} {{on some of the}} most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce. It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged weapons programs. A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> on Nigeria.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000s, {{the revelation}} of Iran's clandestine uranium {{enrichment}} program raised concerns {{that it might be}} intended for non-peaceful uses. The IAEA launched an investigation in 2003 after an Iranian dissident group revealed undeclared nuclear activities carried out by Iran. In 2006, because of Iran's noncompliance with its NPT obligations, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. In 2007, the United States <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> (NIE) stated that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 1964, as Pathet Lao troops {{moved to}} isolate the Neutralist garrisons at Muong Phan and Muong Kheung, a revolt against Kong Le broke out within FAN. His armored commander, Colonel Sourideth, encircled Kong Le's {{headquarters}} with a dozen tanks. The next day, BP 4 went over to Deuane's Patriotic Neutralists. One company of the latter was fighting in an offensive against Royalist regiment Groupement Mobile 17 (Mobile Group 17). Kong Le withdrew FAN from the Plain in good order, except for an inconsequential loss of small arms. However, in June, his armored force of 23 vehicles had to be abandoned at Muong Kheung. However, the American Special <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> of 5 August 1965 credited the Patriotic Neutralists as an ineffectual force of 2,600 men.|$|E

500|$|This {{case was}} blunted by a 1995 <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> (NIE), which stated that no country besides the five major nuclear powers {{was capable of}} {{acquiring}} missiles that could reach Canada or the contiguous United States within the ensuing 15 years. Republican lawmakers intent on funding a defensive shield criticized the report and the Clinton administration for inaccurate assessments and distorted intelligence.

500|$|While {{the report}} was being prepared, in August 1957 the Soviets {{launched}} their R-7 Semyorka (SS-6) ICBM, and followed this up with the successful launch of Sputnik 1 in October. Over the next few months, a series of intelligence reviews resulted in ever increasing estimates of the Soviet missile force. <b>National</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> (NIE) 11-10-57, issued in December 1957, stated that the Soviets would have perhaps 10 prototype missiles in service by mid-1958. But after Nikita Khrushchev claimed to be producing them [...] "like sausages", the numbers began to rapidly inflate. NIE 11-5-58, released in August 1958, suggested there would be 100 ICBMs in service by 1960, and 500 by 1961 or 1962 at the latest.|$|E

The United States Air Force issued General Operational Requirement-170 on 19 June 1958 ordering the development of a system that was capable of destroying a satellite. Then the United States Air Force and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) commissioned studies by the Space Technology Laboratories and the Radio Corporation of America. The plan for development of the system formulated by the Air Force was shown to the National Security Council on 5 February 1960. On 17 March 1961, the Radio Corporation of America received a grant to develop Project SAINT.|$|E

500|$|In 1967 {{when the}} Israeli nuclear program was nearing completion, Teller {{informed}} Neeman {{that he was}} going to tell the CIA that Israel had built nuclear weapons, and explain that it was justified by the background of the Six-Day War. After Neeman cleared it with Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, Teller briefed the head of the CIA's Office of Science and Technology, Carl Duckett. It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained nuclear capability; the information then went through CIA Director Richard Helms to the president at that time, Lyndon B. Johnson. [...] Teller also persuaded them to end the American attempts to inspect the Negev Nuclear Research Center in Dimona.

When asked if he had a problem with oil companies making a profit, Gilmore stated that he saw no problems with it and that he believed this was [...] "an appropriate thing to do." [...] He later confirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol because it [...] "was going to basically just transfer money directly to Russia for nothing" [...] and that it must include [...] "every nation of the world in this entire project...includ China and India" [...] to meet his approval. But at the end of the debate when asked if he believed a conservative could include conservationist principles, he answered that he believed it could be a part of the platform because [...] "energy independence...is a national security issue" [...] which serves the interests of Conservatives by preserving a [...] "clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation." ...|$|E
