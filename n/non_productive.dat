40|$|Cancer is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. It is thought that up to 20 % of cancers are caused by infectious agents, and an oncogenic role of several viruses has been established for certain tumours. Increasing evidence implies that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with a number of malignancies. Several studies have suggested different mechanisms by which HCMV could modulate the tumour environment and dysregulate several key pathways relevant in tumour development and progression. However, the role of HCMV in cancer has remained h ighly controversial. The studies in this thesis investigated the possible role of HCMV in certain types of cancers. Additionally, they address ed the question of whether HCMV targeted therapy {{could be used as a}} treatment option for cancer patients. In study I, we found that HCMV proteins were abundantly expressed in all breast cancer specimens examined and in 94 % of sentinel lymph node specimens with metastases. HCMV infections were mostly confined to the neoplastic cells, while some inflammatory cells were also HCMV positive in 60 % of lymph nodes without metastases. In study II, we investigated brain metastases and paired primary tissue samples of breast and colon cancer patients for HCMV proteins and nucleic acids. Interestingly, HCMV proteins were abunda ntly expressed in the majority (98. 7 %) of brain metastases and paired primary breast and colorectal cancer specimens. Patients with high grade HCMV infection tended to have shorter time to tumour progression and shorter survival, both after primary tumour di agnosis, as well as after establishment of brain metastases. In study III, we found that the majority of primary medulloblastomas and medulloblastoma cell lines were infected with HCMV. HCMV infection induced expression of cyclooxygenase - 2 (COX - 2) activi ty and prostaglandin - E 2 (PGE 2) production in vitro. Additionally, expression of HCMV proteins and COX - 2 were strongly correlated in primary tumours as well as in meduloblastoma xenografts. Targeting viral replication using an anti - viral drug and a COX - 2 inhibitor prevented HCMV replication in vitro, inhibited PGE 2 prod uction and reduced medulloblastoma tumour cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. In study IV, we discovered a novel genetic variant of HCMV, which lacks a gene segment in a regulatory gene. This viral strain was frequently detected in cancers of different origins and was associated with <b>non</b> - <b>productive</b> infection and expression of splice variant immediate early proteins. In contrast, this variant was less frequently detected in healthy donors, and in patients with HCMV viremia or myocardial infarction. We is olated this variant from 3 out of 110 clinical isolates. Thus, our results demonstrate a high prevalence of this novel genetic variant of HCMV in cancer patients; this virus variant may be tumour promoting virus for cancers of different origin. Understandi ng molecular pathways modulated by this virus is therefore highly necessary to further understand the behaviour of this unique HCMV variant, and its possible role in cancer development or progression...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe Statfjord {{field is}} one of the oldest and largest oil and gas {{producing}} fields on the Norwegian continental shelf. It is currently at its late life production period with pressure depletion as the main production mechanism. Gas released from the residual oil contributes a large portion to the field reserves. At this period of production, all sources of pressure support are important and should be included in modeling of pressure drop in reservoir. <b>Non</b> <b>productive</b> zones, which contain "dirty sand" and clay, are traditionally not included in numerical reservoir simulation models as they are believed to have a negligible impact on the production performance. However, in this project, when the pressure reduction is large and over a long time, the <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zones can act as an external pressure support by produce water into the reservoir. Additionally, the gas dissolved in such water will be released as pressure of the reservoir drops. The gas is liberated under the form of small bubbles and the bubbles are believed to be immobile – they block the pore and act as a factor of pore volume reduction. This helps increasing effective compressibility of the formation. Both of the mentioned effects can contribute significantly to total reservoir pressure drop. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the pressure contribution from <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone to total pressure drop by calculating induced water volume from the zone into reservoir and to develop methods for including the impact of such zones in conventional reservoir simulation models. The thesis involves in building reservoir simulation models with basic fluid and rock properties data from Brent formation of Statfjord field and different combinations of parameters of <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone permeability, thickness, compressibility, field depletion time and reservoir pressure drop to evaluate the correlations between those parameters with induced water volume from the zone into reservoir. Reservoir simulator Eclipse is utilized for simulating the flow of fluids and pressure inside the zone and reservoir. For the impact of dissolved gas in water liberation on effective compressibility of rock, ROCKTAB keyword, which traditionally used for rock compaction/expansion scenario, is utilized. It has been observed in the simulation results that for a specific combination of parameters for <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone, there is a value of thickness such that no matter how thicker than that value the <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone is, the volume of induced water does not change dramatically. For a specific zone, optimum grids thickness should be used in building simulation models to save time and resources for having to run with finer grid sizes. Grids thickness distribution for the <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone seems not to have a large impact on the simulating results. Different correlating equations between induced water volume and the other parameters have been found for the cases where the thickness of <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone is higher than the effective value and that of <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> zone less than the effective value. The equations may generally be used to estimate induced water volume for other formation rather than for Brent formation only. ROCKTAB keyword is useful when being used to simulate the impact from dissolved gas releasing. The result data fit well with the data calculated from correlating equation mentioned above. This thesis is merely a primary study on the matter. More works on running simulation models which integrate combinations of parameters should be carried out in order to confirm the obtained correlating equations as well as the application of such equations on general formation cases...|$|E
40|$|Protein kinase C-theta (PKCθ) is a {{key enzyme}} in T lymphocytes, where it plays an {{important}} role in signal transduction downstream of the activated TCR and the CD 28 costimulatory receptor. TCR/CD 28 engagement triggers the translocation of the cytosolic PKCθ to the plasma membrane, where it localizes at the center of the immunological synapse (IS), which forms at the contact site between an antigen-specific T cell and antigen-presenting cells (APC). The cellular redistribution of PKCθ in resting versus activated T cells has been thoroughly investigated, but the mechanisms governing its translocation to the center of the IS, and how this unique localization relates to the biological activity of PKCθ have remained unclear until recently. A very recent study has shown that the unique V 3 (hinge) domain of PKCθ is essential and sufficient for its localization at the IS, where it is anchored to the cytoplasmic tail of CD 28 via an indirect mechanism, involving the Lck as an intermediate. Furthermore, the PKCθ-CD 28 complex, which forms upon antigen stimulation, is localized at a newly recognized, TCRlow subregion of the central IS, where it forms an outer ring around the very center, TCRhigh subregion. Importantly, the association of PKCθ with CD 28 is also essential for PKCθ-mediated activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the transcription factors NF-κB and NF-AT, which are sine qua <b>non</b> for the <b>productive</b> activation of T lymphocytes. Indeed, the use of V 3 -altered PKCθ mutants or the isolated V 3 domain as a negative dominant mutant demonstrated that strategies, which disrupt the interaction between PKCθ and CD 28, block T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation into pathogenic Th 2 and Th 17 (but not Th 1) effector helper T cells. The recent progress made in understanding of the mechanism of recruitment and regulation of PKCθ activity at the IS is likely to facilitate the development of PKCθ-based therapeutic modalities for T cell-mediated diseases...|$|R
