40|$|The {{decision}} of Greppo v Jam-Cal Bundaberg Pty Ltd [2015] QCA 131 illustrates a defect in s 128 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) which gives {{a right to}} a lessee to apply for relief against forfeiture against loss of a right to exercise an option to renew. The defect arises because the legislation does not adequately deal with breaches that occur after the exercise of the option but before the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the lease. Most commercial leases of all kinds have a standard provisions, as the lease in this case, as a conditions of the exercise of the option to renew that the lessee will have given <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> exercise within the time specified to the lessor and will have up to the date <b>of</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the lease paid all rent and observed all lessee’s covenants. The difficulties occur because invariably an option must be exercised before the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the lease when a lessee may not be in breach of the lease but may later prior to the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the lease fall into breach. As this decision indicates,at least in Queensland, that the lessee who desires to challenge the lessor’s right to enforce those conditions can neither seek relief under s 128 against forfeiture of the right to exercise the option,or indeed, under s 124 of the Property Law Act 1974 to preserve the agreement for lease brought about by the otherwise regular exercise of the option to renew. The decision cries out for legislative reform along the lines of s 133 E of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) which was amended in 2001 to meet this contingency...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{discussion}} about fiscal stimulus focuses on the multiplier of government spending on impact. In this paper we shift the focus to the multiplier at the end, i. e. to {{the period in which}} a deficit spending program terminates. We show that recent time series analyses as well as economic models of different schools of thought predict that the multiplier turns negative before spending expires. This means that aggregate output at the time <b>of</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> fiscal stimulus is predicted to be lower than it could be without deficit spending. We set up a simple model that explains this phenomenon. Using phase diagram analysis we prove that the aggregate capital stock at the time <b>of</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> fiscal stimulus is lower than it would be without the deficit spending program. This fact explains why aggregate output is below its laissez faire level as well. We then calibrate an extended version of the model for the US and demonstrate how fiscal stimulus slows down recovery from a recession in the medium-run...|$|R
