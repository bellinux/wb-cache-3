40|$|Networks {{modeling}} bilaterally-cleared and centrally-cleared derivatives {{markets are}} shown to yield economically different price impact, volatility and contagion {{after an initial}} bankruptcy. A large bankruptcy in bilateral markets may leave a counterparty unable to expectationally prevent bankruptcy (checkmate) or make counterparties push markets and profit from contagion (hunting). In distress, bilateral markets amplify systemic risk and volatility versus centralized markets and are more subject to crises with real effects: contagion, unemployment, reduced tax revenue, higher transactions costs, lower risk sharing, and reduced allocative efficiency. Pricing distress volatility may suggest when to transition to central clearing.

40|$|We model contagions and cascades of {{failures}} among organizations linked through {{a network of}} financial interdependencies. We identify how the network propagates discontinuous changes in asset values triggered by failures (e. g., bankruptcies, defaults, and other insolvencies) and use that to study the consequences of integration (each organization becoming more dependent on its counterparties) and diversification (each organization interacting with a larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparties).</b> Integration and diversification have different, nonmonotonic effects {{on the extent of}} cascades. Initial increases in diversification connect the network which permits cascades to propagate further, but eventually, more diversification makes contagion between any pair of organizations less likely as they become less dependent on each other. Integration also faces tradeoffs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments. We explore some strategic implications: failing organizations can only be saved by unfair trades, and moral hazard issues arise from incentives to seek such bailouts.

40|$|Defining futures {{contracts}} as {{substitutes for}} associated cash transactions enables {{a discussion of}} the evolution of controls over contract nonperformance risk. These controls are incorporated into exchange methods for clearing contracts. Three clearing methods are discussed: direct, ringing and complete. The incidence and operation of each are described. Direct-clearing systems feature bilateral contracts with terms specified by the counterparties to the contract. Exchanges relying on direct clearing system chiefly serve as mediators in trade disputes. Ringing is shown to facilitate contract offset by increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>counterparties.</b> Ringing settlements reduce counterparty credit risk by reducing the accumulation of dependencies as contracts are offset. Ringing settlements also lower the cost of maintaining open contract positions, chiefly by lowering the amount or required margin deposits. Exchanges employing ringing methods generally adopted a clearinghouse to handle payments. Complete clearing interposes the clearinghouse as counterparty to every contract. This measure ensures that contracts are fungible with respect to both the underlying commodity and counterparty risk. Contracts; Futures; Clearinghouses (Banking) ...|$|R

We provide information on the number of insurers using various types of derivatives contracts and the volume of transactions in terms of notional amounts and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparties.</b> Life insurers are most active in interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, while property-casualty insurers tend to be active in trading equity option and foreign exchange contracts. Using a multivariate probit analysis, we explore the factors that potentially influence the existence of OBS activities. We also investigate questions relating to whether certain subsets of OBS transactions (e. g., exchange traded) are related to such things as interest rate risk measures, organizational form, and other characteristics that may discriminate between desired risk/return profiles across a cross-section of insurers. We find evidence consistent with the use of derivatives by insurers to hedge risks posed by guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and other sources of financial risk.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in depth microstructure {{analysis of the}} euro money market by taking a network perspective. Banks are the nodes of the networks; unsecured overnight loans form the links connecting the nodes. Daily interbank networks verify the same stylised facts documented for many real complex systems: they are highly sparse, far from being complete, exhibit the small world property and a power-law distribution of degree (the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparties</b> each bank establishes credit relationships with). On the other hand, the tendency of banks to cluster, i. e. to form groups where ties are relatively denser, is much lower than in other real networks. The time patterns of some network statistics provide interesting insights into {{the evolution of the}} potential for financial contagion; the partition of the network into smaller connected subnetworks documents a move against market integration; heterogeneous developments across banks of different size offer insights into banks’ behaviour. An analysis of banks’ prominence in the market is undertaken using centrality measures: the various indicators suggest that the biggest banks are also the most connected before the onset of the crisis; however, medium/small and very small banks’ centralities increase progressively after August 2007 as these banks increase their “influence” as liquidity providers. The rich set of measures described in this paper represents a key input for future research. Network analysis; Network centrality indicators; Money market; Financial crisis...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{proposal}} to consider the collection and analysis of stresses among systemic financial institutions. The “ 10 -by- 10 -by- 10 ” labeling suggests the general approach. A regulator would collect and analyze information concerning the exposures of N significant entities to M defined stress tests. For each stress, an entity would report its gain or loss, in total, and with respect to its contractual positions {{with each of the}} K entities for which the exposure, for that scenario, is among the K greatest in magnitude relative to all counterparties. Those counterparties would be identified, stress by stress. The headline version takes each of N, M, and K to be 10. In practice, however, the set of N reporting institutions is likely to be similar to the set of financial institutions that have been identified by a regulator as systemically important, for example {{in the sense of the}} Dodd-Frank Act or the set of globally important financial institutions that have been identified by the Financial Stability Board.

40|$|Hedge {{funds have}} {{attracted}} increased attention in recent years. In part, {{this is because}} investment in hedge funds is becoming “mainstream”. A wider range of investors has sought exposure to these investment vehicles, {{and this has been}} associated with rapid growth in both the number of funds and the volume of assets under management. In part, too, greater attention has been the result of worries that hedge funds could in some circumstances exert a destabilizing infl uence. With the growth in the market share of hedge funds, and their greater “visibility” in the market place, concerns have been expressed about the consequences of limited transparency and lack of regulation of the industry. Despite the recent focus on hedge funds, their origins can be traced back more than fifty years. The first such fund is generally considered to have been established in the United States in 1949 by Alfred Winslow Jones. The term “hedge fund”, which was coined only later, was applied because the investment style of the original funds was designed to be neutral to general market movements, by combining short and long positions. In this way, funds could pursue absolute returns, in varying market conditions. More recently, however, the term “hedge fund” has been applied to any privately offered, collective investment vehicle for “sophisticated” investors that is lightly regulated and employs leverage. Since the 1950 ’s, the number of hedge funds has grown steadily, as has the volume of assets under management. Precise statistics are not available, given the lack of reporting requirements, and difficulty in defining the population of institutions that should be covered. The most rapid growth, however, seems to have occurred in the period since about 1990, with an interruption in 1998 - 99 following the much-publicised near-failure of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) (Chart 1). Regulatory attention can be dated back some ten years, to the LTCM episode, and the Asian financial crisis that occurred at roughly the same time. The problems encountered by LTCM demonstrated both the size of some hedge funds, and their capacity, through their leveraged position-holding across a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparties,</b> to generate system-wide repercussions. The Asian crisis was thought by some to show that the market power of hedge funds could in some circumstances undermine offi cial policies. Following these episodes, there was a spate of offi cial reports on hedge fund activities and the issues involved in deciding whether and how to regulate them. In this paper, I will begin by analyzing the characteristics that distinguish hedge fund from other investment vehicles. I will go on to consider recent trends in the industry and potential future developments. Then I will assess some of the regulatory concerns that have been expressed and conclude with some remarks on alternative regulatory approaches. ...|$|E

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this study is to didactically {{demonstrate}} the factors shaping the currency swap stock of domestic banks prior to the crisis and to provide a descriptive analysis of how the structure and the functioning of the market changed during the crisis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. In addition to the wide ranging applicability of the transaction, the rise in the currency swap stock of domestic credit institutions is also attributable to macroeconomic factors. The bulk of the exchange rate risk resulting from the high external borrowing requirement and rising external debt was carried by the domestic private sector, while the foreign sector shared a decreasing portion of the risk. The rapid increase in the swap stock was also due to the fact that the synthetic production of foreign currency funds with currency swaps was often more successful than the direct inflow of foreign currency funds. On the basis of the decomposition of the domestic banking system’s on-balance sheet foreign currency position, we can state that it increased mainly as a result of items that also increased the balance sheet total. Following the outbreak of the global financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the conditions for ensuring foreign currency liquidity deteriorated significantly, which had a substantial effect on implied forint yields, and the turnover and structure of the swap market. While the total average turnover of the domestic FX swap market did not drop radically when the crisis was spreading, market liquidity did decline significantly for a few days and access to foreign currency liquidity became limited. The active role assumed by parent banks and shortening maturities contributed to moderating the decline in turnover. Anecdotal information relating to the tightening <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> limits vis-a-vis domestic banks is supported by the decline in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-resident <b>counterparties.</b> The crisis also contributed to changes in the structure of the swap stock. The average remaining maturity of the gross stock began to decline directly after the Lehman bankruptcy, at the time of global dollar liquidity problems, followed by a rise starting from early 2009, principally owing to transactions concluded with parent banks. Domestic subsidiary banks managed to increase maturity primarily through cross-currency swap transactions concluded with intra-group counterparties, but non-group counterparties also concluded transactions with longer maturity with domestic banks.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that Commodities futures and forward prices, in principle, agree under some simplifying assumptions.

40|$|The global {{over-the-counter}} derivatives market {{reached a}} staggering 14. 5 trillion US dollars in gross market value {{at the end}} of December 2007. Although OTC derivatives are extremely useful and versatile in transferring risks, {{it appears to be a}} double-edged sword. For every derivative transaction concluded in the OTC market, there are two parties involved – each of which is exposed to the other defaulting on the agreed terms and conditions <b>of</b> the contract. <b>Counterparty</b> credit risk is defined as the loss that will be incurred in the event that a counterparty fails to honour its financial obligations. This dissertation provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk measurement from a theoretical point of view and puts an emphasis on the demonstration of the current solutions used in practice to address this problem. The author applies a bottom up approach to the problem by defining counterparty credit risk exposure on a contract (single-trade) level and expands this definition on a step-by-step basis to incorporate portfolio effects, such as correlation among underlying market variables as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as netting and collateral agreements, in measuring counterparty credit risk exposure on a counterparty level. The author also discusses related concepts which impact counterparty credit risk such as wrong-way risk and proposes an enhancement to the framework introduced by Finger (2000) for incorporating wrong-way risk into existing measures <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk exposure. Finger‟s framework is enhanced by the introduction of a structural model approach which can be used in establishing a functional and intuitive relationship between the probability of default <b>of</b> the <b>counterparty</b> and the underlying market variable to the derivative contract under consideration. This approach is also applied to a typical South African situation through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The topic <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk modelling is a very relevant topic in modern finance, especially since the advent of Basel 2 which this dissertation also touches on in terms of the applications <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk modelling and how this relates to the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by bank regulators.
