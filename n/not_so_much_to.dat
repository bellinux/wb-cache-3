5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> house people as to destroy them.|$|E

25|$|The wing {{was fixed}} to the {{fuselage}} at three points. There was a pivot at the centre {{of a pair of}} turntable rings, one on the fuselage, and one on the wing underside and just under 3ft (890mm) in diameter, plus two L-shaped locking bolts. Before the wings could be rotated, the flat-topped decking on the rear fuselage had to be swung out on hinges to hang down along the fuselage sides, then with these bolts removed, the wing could be swung through almost 90° so that one trailing edge, with its aileron raised vertically, lay close to the fin. The resulting storage planform was narrower than that of a typical folding aircraft, but longer. The aim of the rotating wing was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> save space as to make folding a one-man, rather than a two-man task.|$|E
25|$|Still later, wind-tunnel {{testing was}} applied to automobiles, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} aerodynamic forces per se but more to determine {{ways to reduce the}} power required to move the vehicle on roadways at a given speed. In these studies, the interaction between the road and the vehicle plays a significant role, and this interaction must be taken into consideration when interpreting the test results. In an actual situation the roadway is moving relative to the vehicle but the air is stationary relative to the roadway, but in the wind tunnel the air is moving relative to the roadway, while the roadway is stationary relative to the test vehicle. Some automotive-test wind tunnels have incorporated moving belts under the test vehicle in an effort to approximate the actual condition, and very similar devices are used in wind tunnel testing of aircraft take-off and landing configurations.|$|E

25|$|Morley's {{particular}} {{passion was}} {{the study of}} the Maya calendar and its related inscriptions, and in this respect, he made useful expositions that have withstood later scrutiny. His talent was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> make innovations, but rather to publicise and explain the workings of the various systems. He was particularly proficient at recovering calendar dates from well-worn and weathered inscriptions, owing to his great familiarity with the various glyphic styles of the tzolk'in, haab' and Long Count elements. Yet in his focus on calendric details, he would often overlook or even neglect the documentation of other non-calendric aspects of the Maya script; the comprehensiveness of some of his publications suffered much as a result. Some leading figures from a later generation of Mayanists would come to regard his publications as being inferior in detail and scope to that of his predecessors, such as Teoberto Maler and Alfred Maudslay — poorer quality reproductions, omitted texts, sometimes inaccurate drawings.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} of the good order of the house during the time of Richard de Morins; he would {{scarcely}} have been chosen twice to visit other houses unless he had ruled his own with care and diligence. During his forty years of office canons of Dunstable were at least five times elected priors to other monasteries of the order—at Caldwell, St. Frideswide's, Ashby and Coldnorton. Bishop Grosseteste visited the house once in 1236, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> inquire into the daily life of the priory as to investigate its title to several appropriate churches; but he exacted an oath on this occasion from all the canons individually, and one of them fled to Woburn rather than submit to it. The bishop came again in 1248, while Geoffrey of Barton was prior; when the cellarer, accused by many, fled before his coming to Merivale; but he {{does not seem to have}} found fault with the convent in general, and his next visit in 1250 was for purposes of his own. Archbishop Boniface came in 1253, but made no complaint. In 1274 Bishop Gravesend sent a canon of Lincoln to visit Dunstable, who left his corrections in writing; and in Advent of the same year he made a personal visitation. In November 1279 Bishop Sutton came and discharged his office 'strictly and without respect of persons.' The sub-prior and certain others were removed from their charge, and forbidden to hold office in future, and certain 'less useful members' of the household expelled; in May of the following year he deposed the prior, William le Breton, from all pastoral care. It seems most likely that these depositions were on account of mismanagement rather than for any personal failings; the great necessity and heavy debts of the house called for stringent measures, and William le Breton had shown himself (like Abbot Richard of Woburn in a similar case) unable to meet the difficulty. There is no sign of any other grave faults having been committed, nor of anything like luxurious living. The new prior, according to the bishop's advice, set himself to limit the expenses of the whole house and assigned a fixed income to the kitchen for the future; the deposed prior had a proper maintenance assigned to him at Ruxox. The canons seem to have borne no ill-will to Bishop Sutton for his corrections, and were ready on his next visit to their church (which was made not officially but only in passing) to praise him for his excellent sermon. Other visitations of his are mentioned in 1284, 1287, 1288, and 1293; the last was only to confer orders. Archbishop Peckham came in 1284, but found all well ('as the bishop had been there quite lately,' the chronicler naively remarks); and Archbishop Winchelsea in 1293. The only serious charge that could be laid to the door of the canons all through the thirteenth century was their inability to keep clear of debt; and the record shows that this was often quite as much their misfortune as their fault. There are many incidental remarks of the chroniclers which serve to show that the tone of the house was thoroughly religious, and that the canons were faithful in keeping their rule. It will suffice to instance, early in the century, the generous treatment of the two young canons (one only a novice), who escaped by night through a window and went to join the Friars Minor at Oxford. They were indeed solemnly excommunicated and compelled to return; but after they had done their penance in the chapter house and had been absolved, they were allowed a year to consider the matter, and if after that time they preferred the stricter order, they were granted permission to depart; if not, they might remain at Dunstable. A good deal later than this, in 1283, the apologetic way in which the chronicler relates how the prior went out to dinner with John Durant is sufficient to show that the ordinary rules and customs of the order were not commonly broken.|$|E
500|$|Much of Longfellow's work is {{categorized}} as lyric poetry, but he experimented with many forms, including hexameter and free verse.

500|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} in architectural criticism {{have investigated the}} relationship between architecture and the body, sexuality, sex, power, and place. Feminists in particular, such as Margrit Kennedy, perceive high-rise phallic-like buildings on the urban landscape as [...] "phallic symbols of male domination, power and rational instrumentality." [...] Esther M. K. Cheung believes the form of monumental high-rise building which grew up in 20th century America can [...] "be read as a phallic symbol of power". [...] The present trend symbolises [...] "Science and technology over nature, [...] incorporating all the maleness which that with sci-fi utopias." [...] Elizabeth Grosz, however, offers a counter argument to phallocentrism in urban design theories, saying [...] "not so much {{the dominance of the}} phallus as the pervasive unacknowledged use of the male or masculine to represent the human. The problem, then, is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> eliminate as to reveal the masculinity inherent in the notion of the universal, the generic human, or the unspecified subject."

500|$|Goya {{abandons}} colour in the series, {{believing that}} light, shade and shadow {{provide for a}} more direct expression of the truth. He wrote, [...] "In art {{there is no need}} for colour. Give me a crayon and I will 'paint' your portrait." [...] He uses line <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> delineate shape but, according to art historian Anne Hollander, [...] "to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them, as a squinting, half blind eye might apprehend them, to create the distorting visual detritus that shudders around the edge of things seen in agonized haste.... This 'graphic' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged." [...] The immediacy of the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man's nature. He was not the first to work in this manner; Rembrandt had sought a similar directness, but did not have access to aquatint. William Blake and Henry Fuseli, contemporaries of Goya's, produced works with similarly fantastical content, but, as Hollander describes, they muted its disturbing impact with [...] "exquisitely applied linearity... lodging it firmly in the safe citadels of beauty and rhythm." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} has been {{described}} as heralding [...] "a new era of experimentalism" [...] for Bowie. [...] "Station to Station" [...] was in two parts: a slow, portentous piano-driven march, introduced by the sound of an approaching train juxtaposed with Earl Slick's agitated guitar feedback, followed by an up-tempo rock/blues section. In 1999 Bowie told UNCUT magazine, [...] "Since Station To Station the hybridization of R and electronics had been a goal of mine". Despite the noise of a train in the opening moments, Bowie says that the title refers <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> railway stations as to the Stations of the Cross, while the line [...] "From Kether to Malkuth" [...] relates to mystical places in the Kabbalah, mixing Christian and Jewish allusions. Fixation with the occult was further evident in such phrases as [...] "white stains", the name of a book of poetry by Aleister Crowley. The lyrics also gave notice of Bowie's recent drug use ("It's not the side effects of the cocaine / I'm thinking that it must be love"). With its krautrock influence, it was the album's clearest foretaste of Bowie's subsequent ''.|$|E
