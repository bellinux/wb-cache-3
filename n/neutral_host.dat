A series of polymerizable bis-imidazolium and urea hosts were evaluated as cationic and <b>neutral</b> <b>hosts</b> for phosphates and phosphonates, the latter used as mimics of the phospholipid head groups. The bis-imidazolium hosts interacted with the guests in a cooperative manner leading to the presence of tight and well defined 1 : 2 ternary complexes.

Presence of the aforementioned ternary complexes during polymerization resulted in imprinting of lipid dimers - the latter believed to crudely mimic the endotoxin Lipid A motif. The polymers were characterized with respect to template rebinding, binding affinity, capacity and common structural properties, leading to the identification of polymers which were thereafter subjected to an industrially validated endotoxin removal test.

30|$|Providing indoor {{coverage}} and capacity {{has been a}} challenge {{since the start of}} mobile networking. Femtocell solutions [5 – 7] based on short-range low-cost low-power base stations are generally used to fulfill indoor capacity needs. Unfortunately, these systems only work correctly for small deployments, because cell planning and radio coordination become unmanageable when the number of cells increases [8]. For medium-to-large buildings, venues, and areas, macrocell features like coordination, seamless mobility, and interference management are needed. For the last two decades, these needs have been overcome by distributed antenna systems (DAS) [9 – 11], where a cell’s antenna is divided into several antennas covering the same area with a higher power efficiency, but still defining only one cell. This solution is still considered for multi-operator cases and <b>neutral</b> <b>host</b> applications. However, this approach becomes limited when new requirements for higher capacity and more advanced services appear, which is typically the case of medium-to-large buildings. In response to these new requirements, a promising solution is the deployment of small cells [12].|$|E
