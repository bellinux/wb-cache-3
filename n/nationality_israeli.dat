50|$|According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, the Arab {{population}} in 2013 {{was estimated at}} 1,658,000, representing 20.7% of the country's population. The majority of these identify themselves as Arab or Palestinian by <b>nationality</b> and <b>Israeli</b> by citizenship. Many have family ties to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, {{as well as to}} Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Negev Bedouins and the Druze tend to identify more as Israelis than other Arab citizens of Israel.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>Israeli</b> <b>Nationality</b> Law {{was passed}} on the 14 July 1952. From the time that Israel was created to July 1952, Palestinians were [...] "stateless." [...] Israeli courts {{rendered}} the former Palestinian citizenship, given by the British administration to Jews, Arabs and other inhabitants of the region, [...] "devoid of substance," [...] "not satisfactory and is inappropriate to the situation following the establishment of Israel". The <b>Israeli</b> <b>Nationality</b> Law effectively denationalized Palestinians. It granted every [...] "Jew" [...] who immigrated to Israel, or, following the 1971 amendment, even expressed the desire to immigrate to Israel, [...] "immediate" [...] Israeli citizenship without taking any formal steps. It retroactively altered the Palestinian Citizenship Orders, stating {{that they had to}} be [...] "repealed with effect from the day of the establishment of the State".|$|R

He serves {{as a member of the}} Knesset (the Israeli Parliament) since 1999, and currently serves as one of ten Deputy Speakers of the Knesset, representing the Arab Israeli MK block. Tibi was acknowledged as a figure in the Israeli-Palestinian arena after serving as a political advisor to the late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat (1993-1999). He describes himself as Arab-Palestinian in <b>nationality,</b> and <b>Israeli</b> in citizenship.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{practice}} in contemporary academic literature {{is to identify}} this community as Palestinian as it is how the majority self-identify (See Self-Identification below for more). Terms preferred by most Arab citizens to identify themselves include Palestinians, Palestinians in Israel, Israeli Palestinians, the Palestinians of 1948, Palestinian Arabs, Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel or Palestinian citizens of Israel. There are, however, individuals from among the Arab citizenry who reject the term Palestinian altogether. A minority of Israel's Arab citizens include [...] "Israeli" [...] in some way in their self-identifying label; the majority identify as Palestinian by <b>nationality</b> and <b>Israeli</b> by citizenship.|$|R

50|$|An {{amendment}} to the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Nationality</b> Law was passed in 1968.

50|$|Israel's Declaration of Independence {{was made}} on 14 May 1948, {{the day before the}} British Mandate was due to expire {{as a result of the}} United Nations Partition Plan. The Israeli {{parliament}} created two laws regarding immigration, citizenship and naturalization: the Law of Return and the <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality</b> law. The Law of Return, enacted on July 15, 1950, gives Jews living anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel. This right to immigrate did not and still does not grant citizenship. In fact, for four years after Israel gained independence, there were no Israeli citizens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality</b> law {{defines the}} {{criteria}} under {{which a person}} can be granted citizenship of Israel. It also deals with the Right of Return for Jewish diaspora. In general, Israel's nationality follows jus sanguinis as the primary mechanism through which a person may obtain citizenship, rather than jus soli. A citizen of the modern state of Israel is called an Israeli. Apart from citizenship, there is another civil status which can be held by residents of Israel: the permanent residency status. It is most common among Syrian citizens of the Golan Heights and among East Jerusalem residents, but it occurs also among other non-citizens.|$|R
5000|$|Since the Israeli State {{was founded}} as a Jewish State {{in the land}} of Israel, it becomes {{difficult}} to separate Jewish from <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality.</b> In fact, the Knesset, or parliamentary assembly of Israel, enacts laws with religious underpinnings. Such laws include; ‘observance of the Sabbath, provision of kosher food to the army, abortion, and forbid, among other things, flights by the national airline El Al on Sabbath and festival days, the sale of bread during the Passover, raising pigs and selling pork, and [...] "indecent" [...] advertisements’. Thus, even though Judaism is not the official religion of the state, religious rules have integrated themselves into the public sphere.|$|R

5000|$|The Israeli Declaration of Independence {{identifies}} Israel as a [...] "Jewish State," [...] hence, a {{state that}} is influenced by its affinity towards the Jewish heritage and Tradition. These characteristics were codified in the Emblem of Israel, the Flag of Israel, {{as well as its}} official institutions such as the Religious Services Ministry, as well as the status of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and in its legislations such as the Law of Return, <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality</b> law, and the Status of the World Zionist Organization - Jewish Agency for Israel law. While a constitution was to [...] "be adopted ... not later than the 1st October 1948." [...] no such document has been passed by Israel's legislature.|$|R
500|$|Afroyim's earlier {{stipulation}} that he {{had voted}} in the 1951 Israeli election—together with an accompanying concession by the government {{that this was the}} sole ground upon which it had acted to revoke Afroyim's citizenship—allowed the potential issue of diluted allegiance through dual citizenship to be sidestepped. [...] Indeed, in 1951 there was no <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality</b> law; eligibility to vote in the election that year had been based on residence rather than any concept of citizenship. [...] Although Afroyim had later acquired Israeli citizenship and voted in at least two other elections in his new country, his lawyers were able to avoid discussing this matter and instead focus entirely on whether foreign voting was a sufficient cause for loss of one's U.S. citizenship.|$|R

2500|$|In February 1949, Stanley {{applied for}} <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality.</b> On 13 February, his {{application}} was rejected {{on the grounds}} that he was an undesirable. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz attacked Stanley as a Jew who [...] "suddenly discovered his love for Zion" [...] when in difficulties and there was speculation that Stanley had done his case no good when he criticised the conduct of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War during his tribunal testimony. Stanley continued to entertain and enjoy his celebrity, despite continued calls for his deportation, while he was again pursued by the bankruptcy courts. Stanley threatened to sue Israel for denying him entry, and empowered his lawyers in Israel to take action in court to get him an immigration visa. His lawyers in Israel argued that under the new state's proposed constitution, no Jew could be barred from immigrating to Israel.|$|R
5000|$|Questions about {{conflicts}} of interest swirled around Sam Chalabi." [...] Returning to Iraq in April 2003 he founded the controversial Iraqi International Law Group.

40|$|How {{does the}} {{discovery}} of the mausoleum of Herod the Great in the West Bank relate to Jewish Neo-Zionist territorial claims? What are the connections between agricultural farms and social exclusion? And why is it so difficult for Ka adan, an Arab citizen of Israel, to purchase state owned land outside his own town? In Israel, development schemes often contain a nationalistic overtone, marked by ethnic delineation and religious sentiments. This thesis, a cross-disciplinary sociocultural and historical-geographical study, examines the role that religion, ethnicity and nationality play in the creation of ethnoscapes and ethno-classes. It is argued that the exclusive religious character of <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality</b> poses a challenge to distributive justice and social sustainability. Focusing on the case of the Arab-Bedouins in the Negev, the relationship between nationality, Demographic design and spatial domination is studied, revealing the interconnectedness of the politics of space, place, myth and identity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} ‘transformative engagement’ between expatriate missionaries and the Gogodala of Western Province, PNG, {{in light of}} a recent claim for Jewish ancestry and <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality.</b> This claim {{is based on the}} contention that the original Gogodala ancestors, whose migration to the area is detailed in formal ancestral narratives or iniwa olagi, were members of the Lost Tribes of Israel. In July 2003 this culminated in a visit by Professor Tudor Parfitt, Director of Jewish Studies at the University of London, to investigate. This paper examines the extent to which this claim for identification with Israel represents ongoing dialogue about the origins and nature of Gogodala Christianity, and outlines the extent to which Gogodala communities are substantially connected to places and people beyond their village, province and even country, blurring the boundaries between local and global through their engagement with Christianity.

50|$|On July 14, 1952, the Israeli {{parliament}} {{enacted the}} <b>Israeli</b> <b>Nationality</b> Law. The Nationality Law naturalized all citizens of Mandated Palestine, {{the inhabitants of}} Israel on July 15, 1952, {{and those who had}} legally resided in Israel between May 14, 1948, and July 14, 1952. The law further clarified that naturalization was available to immigrants who had arrived before Israel's creation, immigrants who arrived after statehood was granted, {{and those who did not}} come to Israel as immigrants but have since expressed desire to settle in Israel, with restriction. Naturalization applicants must also meet the following requirements: be over 18 years of age, have resided in Israel for three out of the five preceding years, have settled or intend to settle permanently in Israel, have some knowledge of Hebrew, and have renounced prior nationality or demonstrated ability to renounce nationality after becoming a citizen of Israel.|$|R
5000|$|From the start, the {{response}} to Israeli statements of mistaken identity ranged between frank disbelief and unquestioning acceptance within the administration in Washington. A communication to the Israeli Ambassador on 10 June, by Secretary Rusk stated, among other things: [...] "At {{the time of the}} attack, the USS Liberty was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. ... Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air.... Accordingly, {{there is every reason to}} believe that the USS Liberty was identified, or at least her <b>nationality</b> determined, by <b>Israeli</b> aircraft approximately one hour before the attack. ... The subsequent attack by the torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life." ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the State of Israel in May 1948, more than 40, 000 Iranian Jews have moved to Israel, with the last big wave arriving after the Iranian Revolution of 1978 / 79. As the governments of these two states continue to display animosity towards each other, an examination of the Jews of Iran who now live in Israel provides important insights into {{the nature of the relationship}} between these two key countries in the Middle East. Alessandra Cecolin combines a historical approach to the patterns of Iranian Jewish emigration to Israel with a political analysis of Iranian-Israeli relations, exploring how the political and diplomatic interactions between the two have shaped the processes of emigration and integration of Iranian Jewry in Israel. In this book she explores how this community is often caught between a Persian cultural identity and <b>Israeli</b> <b>nationality,</b> and draws out the implications this has both for the community in Israel and for the wider region...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} motifs of place, landscape, earth (territory), and <b>nationality</b> in <b>Israeli</b> {{art from the}} 1920 s to the 1970 s, when the {{approach}} to these topics underwent a paradigm crisis {{with the emergence of}} Environmental and Earth Art. These motifs are reexamined in the particular art trends, through the works of pioneer artists like Nahum Gutman and Yossef Zaritsky, as well as Conceptual, Environmental and earth artists like Joshua Neustein, Avital Geva and Micha Ullman. Section I examines art as a reaction to the ideology of a newly forming society trying to erase the remnants of ghetto mentality through identification with the local landscapes. This section traces the theme of the "pioneer" as an almost super-human model of the New Jew and its relationship with the local landscapes. Section II observes the Jewish-European aspects of localism through "French" and "German" expressionistic influences, and Israeli artists' relationship to the Orient and the local physical and mental environment. Section III deals with the "Canaanites" passion for the local soil and Hebrew identity which was expressed through nostalgic attachment to nature, landscapes, and the archaic past. Section IV tracks the awakening from the Zionist Dream and its ramifications from the sixties onwards. Section V deals with the Americanization of Israeli culture during the 1960 s when artists broke away from the dominating "lyrical abstraction" through daring and experimental work that evolved into Conceptual, Environmental and Earth Art. Sections VI and VII examine the transition from painting the landscape to working within the landscapes, and the evolution of art and state from the romantic stage of construction into a stage of reaction from a conscious, critical distance. The Epilogue summarizes the attitude of Israeli art towards the motifs of Landscape, Land, Territory and Nationality considering Jewish tradition's rejection of the physical "place," and the "image.
