5|$|The Dark Eternal <b>Night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{second of}} two songs {{released}} {{to the general public}} in advance of the album's release, with an in-studio video being released to YouTube in May 2007.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics, {{many of whom}} appreciated the album's combination of melodic song craft and catchy, pop-oriented material that, while slickly produced, avoided the commercial cynicism and adult contemporary posturing {{of some of their}} '80s and '90s forebears. An international success, the album topped the charts in sixteen countries and, by December 2012, has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide. The album bowed at number two on the UK Albums Chart and ultimately became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011. Up All Night debuted to number one on the United States Billboard 200, selling 176,000 copies in its first week. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Up All <b>Night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> third global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 4.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The raid on Christmas <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{last major}} Japanese {{attack on the}} Marianas. On January2, a single Japanese {{aircraft}} destroyed one B-29 and damaged another three. A further two small raids were attempted in January and one on February2, but none of five aircraft dispatched reached the islands and four were shot down. In early February the 6thAir Army's parent headquarters, the General Defense Command (GDC), reached {{the conclusion that the}} raiding forces being dispatched against the American bomber bases were too small to be effective. As {{it was not possible to}} allocate additional aircraft to bolster these missions, the GDC directed that the offensive cease and that the 6thAir Army be held in reserve to be used against any Allied forces which landed in the Japanese home islands.|$|E

5|$|The return match saw Celta Vigo's Jesuli {{level the}} tie on {{aggregate}} after 24 minutes. Celtic rallied, and on 37 minutes John Hartson used his body strength to force {{his way into}} the Spanish penalty box and score with a powerful shot. Crucially, due to the away goals rule, Celta Viga now had to score twice to avoid losing the tie. Benni McCarthy scored early in the second half for Celta Vigo but, despite a glaring miss from Jesuli near the end, Celtic held on to win the tie on away goals. The 1–2 loss on the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first of two defeats for Celtic {{on the way to the}} final.|$|E
5|$|The last {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> main event between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on}} the ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, Davis {{began the}} season with a 50-point, 16-rebound, 7-steal (career high), 5-assist, 4-block {{performance}} against the Denver Nuggets. He was one block short of his first five-by-five. It was the first 50-point, 15-rebound, 5-assist, 5-steal performance in NBA history since steals became an officially recorded statistic in the 1973–74 season. His 50-point <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> second highest scoring output of his career and was the most by any NBA player in a season opener since Michael Jordan scored 54 points in 1989. Two days later, he had 45 points and 17 rebounds against the Golden State Warriors, becoming the first back-to-back game 40-point scorer in Pelicans history (since the New Orleans Hornets creation in 2002). On November 10, he scored 32 points against the Milwaukee Bucks, helping the Pelicans record their first win of the season after starting 0–8. On November 19, Davis posted 38 points and 16 rebounds, including 11 of the Pelicans' final 16 in an overtime win against the Charlotte Hornets. He posted the game-tying score with 18 seconds remaining in regulation.

On February 2, he was selected as a participant in the NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge. On February 10, he had 42 points and 13 rebounds in a 122–106 win over the Timberwolves. Davis scored 40 for the sixth time this season, and it was his highest scoring game since he put up 45 against Minnesota on November 23. On February 19, 2017, playing on his team's home floor for the NBA All-Star Game, Davis notched 52 points and 10 rebounds, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's previous All-Star record high of 42 points, and also won the game's Most Valuable Player award. On March 11, 2017, Davis scored 46 points and grabbed 21 rebounds in a 125–122 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. On March 31, 2017, Davis had 19 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks in a 117–89 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game, Davis became the first player in Pelicans history to reach 2,000 points in a season. Following the season, he edged out Rudy Gobert as the center on the All-NBA first team. He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the second time.|$|E

25|$|The first {{main event}} of the <b>night,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> match for the WWE Championship between the {{champion}} Eddie Guerrero and the challenger Kurt Angle. The match was centered around both men maneuvering around on the mat. Guerrero performed a DDT and Frog Splash on Angle {{that would result in}} a pin attempt; Angle then recovered and applied an ankle lock but Guerrero escaped the hold by rolling through it and throwing Angle out of the ring. As Angle was outside, Guerrero loosened his ring boot. As Angle returned to the ring, he tried to apply the hold again. This time, Guerrero pushed Angle off with his other foot, allowing him to break free from Angle's hold. With Angle confused, Guerrero pinned Angle with a roll-up to win the match and retain the WWE Championship.|$|E
25|$|Celebrity Big Brothers launch show (aired on 3 January 2007) {{averaged}} 7.1million viewers, and ratings fell to 3.9million by 7 January. Ratings quickly rose as {{media coverage}} reported alleged racism towards Shilpa Shetty from fellow female contestants; the episode that aired on 16 January saw a ratings boost {{with the show}} sharing 18% of the available audience and ratings of 4.5million viewers, as the episode aired on 17 January was predicted to be Celebrity Big Brothers top ratings grabber. The episode the following night also rose in ratings, as 5.2million people viewed the episode. The ratings once again rose on Jade's eviction night {{to an average of}} 7.8million viewers and a peak of 8.8million viewers, which were, and remain to this day, the highest viewing figures in Celebrity Big Brothers history and second for any Big Brother show after the Big Brother 3 finale, which landed a record 10 million viewers.

25|$|The final {{contest of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> WWF Championship match between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, {{which had a}} {{surprise}} no disqualification stipulation added just before the superstars were introduced. During the match, the two brawled {{inside and outside of}} the ring, with both men bleeding after hitting each other with the ring bell. The Rock attempted to place Austin in a Sharpshooter hold, but Austin reversed it into Sharpshooter of his own. After Rock reached the ropes to force a break, Austin applied the Million Dollar Dream, a submission hold best known from his former gimmick, The Ringmaster. Shortly after, Rock used Austin's own finishing maneuver on Austin by executing a Stunner. Vince McMahon then came to ringside to observe the match. When Rock tried to pin Austin after the People's Elbow, McMahon seized Rock's leg and pulled him off Austin, breaking the pin attempt. After chasing McMahon around the ring, Austin responded by using Rock's signature move, the Rock Bottom. Later, Rock executed a Rock Bottom for a near fall. After The Rock attacked McMahon, he was given a Stunner by Austin for a near fall. After Rock kicked out of the Stunner, McMahon handed Austin a steel chair to hit Rock with at Austin's request, revealing that Austin had sided with McMahon, a man he once considered his nemesis. With this, Austin turned heel. Austin attacked him with the steel chair, hitting him sixteen times, before pinning him and becoming the new WWF Champion. The show ended with the new champion and the chairman shaking hands and sharing beers.|$|E
25|$|The {{night of}} 30 January 1895 was stormy. In the North Sea, {{conditions}} were freezing {{and there were}} huge seas. SS Elbe had left Bremerhaven for New York {{earlier in the day}} with 354 passengers aboard. Also at sea on this rough <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> steamship Crathie, sailing from Aberdeen in Scotland, heading for Rotterdam. As conditions grew worse, the Elbe discharged warning rockets to alert other ships to her presence. The Crathie either did not see the warning rockets or chose to ignore them. She did not alter her course, with such disastrous consequences, that she struck the liner on her port side with such force that whole compartments of the Elbe were immediately flooded. The collision happened at 5.30 am and most of the passengers were still asleep.The Elbe began to sink immediately and the captain, von Goessel, gave the order to abandon ship. Amid great scenes of panic the crew managed to lower two of the Elbes lifeboats. One of the lifeboats capsized as too many passengers tried in vain to squeeze into the boat. Twenty people scrambled into the second lifeboat, of whom 15 were members of the crew. The others were four male second-class passengers and a young lady’s maid by the name of Anna Boecker, who had been lucky enough to be pulled from the raging sea after the first boat had capsized. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the Elbe, Captain von Goessel had ordered all the women and children to assemble there but no other lifeboats were launched because the ropes on the derricks were all frozen up, and so they perished along with the captain. Within 20 minutes of the collision, the Elbe had sunk and the only survivors were the 20 people in the one surviving lifeboat. These people now had to endure mountainous seas and below-zero temperatures and they were 50 miles from land. Things looked bleak; the Elbes distress rockets had not been seen by any passing vessels and so no one knew of their predicament. After five hours in the raging storm, their luck changed. A fishing smack from Lowestoft called the Wildflower found them. In desperate conditions the crew of the Wildflower struggled to pull the 20 survivors from the lifeboat, which had begun to break up. The skipper, William Wright, said later that the survivors would not have lasted another hour in those conditions, and believed that the only reason they had stayed alive for five hours was the expertise of the Elbes crewmen aboard the lifeboat.|$|E
500|$|The first {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Can-Am Connection (Rick Martel and Tom Zenk) versus Ace Cowboy Bob Orton and The Magnificent Muraco (with Mr. Fuji).

500|$|Writing about Schwa's post-relaunch menu, Metromix dining {{producer}} Chris LaMorte writes, [...] "It's [...] {{better now}} – dishes are more focused, yet still inventive.

[...] LaMorte did find some fault during his visit, describing the china as [...] "monotonous" [...] and saying the chef-waiters [...] "always dash off too quickly." [...] Martha Bayne of Chicago Reader, also {{writing about the}} post-relaunch menu, agreed saying, [...] "the food is better than ever." [...] Bayne called the food [...] "legendary", but did say the jellyfish pad Thai did not [...] "quite {{live up to their}} promise".

500|$|The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain Bill Hudson, a Special Operations Executive officer, met with Mihailović at his Ravna Gora headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. [...] "Morning and <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most desolating atmosphere," [...] he recounted, [...] "because the women were out in the fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailović." [...] "The tragedy gave to Nedić convincing proof that the Serbs would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive," [...] Djilas wrote, [...] "and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans".|$|E

500|$|The opening {{match of}} the show was a best two-out-of-three-falls tag team match {{featuring}} four wrestlers from CMLL's Mini-Estrella division as the rudo team of Pierrothito and Universito 2000 faced off against the tecnico team of [...] Niño de Acero and Pequeño Ninja. The first two falls were split between the teams {{in less than five}} minutes, with the third and deciding fall lasting longer than the first two combinted. After 11 minutes, 32 second Pierrothito pinned Pequeño Ninja to win the match for his side. The second match of the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only Best two-out-of-three-falls six-man tag team match {{of the show}}, normally the most common match type in Lucha Libre. For the match Dragón Rojo Jr., El Satánico and Virus won the first fall when Los Bombardieros (Flash and Stuka Jr.) were forced to submit to Satánico and Virus. In the second fall the third tecnico, Mictlán, pinned Dragón Rojo Jr. to further the ongoing storyline between the two. In the third fall, the rudo team was by disqualification when Dragón Rojo Jr. intentionally unmasked his Mictlán in plain view of the referee. Unmasking an opponent during a match is an automatic disqualification in lucha libre.|$|E
500|$|The third {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> International Gran Prix tournament. Christopher Daniels was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} part of [...] "Team International" [...] but was replaced with Johnny Devine due to a TNA storyline where Daniels supposedly had been fired from the company. The sixteen-man torneo cibernetico match lasted almost a full hour, officially timed at 57 minutes and 37 seconds from the opening bell to the last elimination. For the first eighteen minutes of the match Team Mexico and Team International members took turns facing off {{in the middle of the}} ring, allowing all sixteen wrestlers to show off their skills before a single man was eliminated from the tournament. Rey Bucanero gave Team Mexico an advantage when he pinned Alex Koslov 18 minutes, 5 seconds into the match. The next three eliminations were all from Team Mexico as Averno (by Sonjay Dutt), Volador Jr. (by Jay Lethal) and Rey Bucanero (by A.J. Styles) were eliminated. The fifth elimination of the night happened just over thirty minutes into the match as Sonjay Dutt was pinned by Héctor Garza. Five minutes later Último Guerrero took advantage of the referee being distracted to his Styles' with a low blow, allowing Guerrero to pin A.J. Styles evening the sides between the two teams to five-a-side. Further eliminations followed with Dos Caras Jr. (by Marco Corleone), Jay Lethal (by Dr. Wagner Jr.), Johnny Devine (by Shocker) and Héctor Garza (by Corleone) brought the numbers down to six in total, three on each team.|$|E
