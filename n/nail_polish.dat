25|$|Since <b>nail</b> <b>polish</b> remover is a solvent, it will {{dissolve}} in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it {{hydrogen bonds}} with water.

40|$|Background: Toxic and {{hazardous}} heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, zinc, chromium and iron {{are found in}} a variety of personal care products, e. g. lipstick, whitening toothpaste, eyeliner and nail color. The nails absorb the pigments of <b>nail</b> <b>polishes</b> and vaporized or soluble metals can easily pass it. The goal of this survey was to assess whether the different colors of <b>nail</b> <b>polishes</b> comply with maximum concentrations of heavy metals in the EPA’s guidelines. Methods: 150 samples of different popular brands of <b>nail</b> <b>polishes</b> in 13 colors (yellow, beige, silver, pink, white, violet, brown, golden, green, black, colorless, red and blue) were randomly purchased from beauty shops in Tehran City, Iran, in 2014. Microwave digestion EPA method 3051 was used by a microwave oven to determine the amount of 5 heavy metals; Nickel, Chromium, Lead, Arsenic and Cadmium. One-way ANOVA, Two-way ANOVA, hierarchical cluster, and principal component analyses were applied by Statistica 7. 0 software. Results: The concentrations of chrome, lead, nickel and arsenic showed significant differences between the colors (p< 0. 05). In all studied samples, the level of cadmium was beyond the safe maximum permissible limit (MPS), but no significance difference in the cadmium content was identified. Conclusion: Due to the high concentrations of toxic metals in many brands of <b>nail</b> <b>polishes,</b> meticulous quality control is recommended for these beauty products. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Nail</b> <b>polish</b> remover has {{the ability}} to enter bodies of water and soil after {{entering}} landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to acetone's high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. <b>Nail</b> <b>polish</b> remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.|$|E

25|$|<b>Nail</b> <b>polish</b> remover {{can also}} enter the {{lithosphere}} by landfills and by precipitation. However, {{it will not}} bind to the soil.

The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.|$|E
25|$|First {{one should}} rinse hands with warm water, keeping hands below wrists and forearms, to prevent {{contaminated}} water from {{moving from the}} hands to the wrists and arms.
