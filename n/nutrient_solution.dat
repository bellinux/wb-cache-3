5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E

Seedlings were grown in acidic and limed soil and in two contrasting <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions.</b> Root systems of soil-grown plants were scanned using x-ray microcomputed tomography (µCT) while that of nutrient solution–grown plants were assesses using WinRhizo, 3 and 5 days after planting (DAP), respectively. Aluminum caused significant reduction of all examined root traits (number of seminal roots, root length, length of the longest seminal root, root surface area, and root volume). Growth in acidic soil caused significant reduction in root length, length of the longest seminal root, and root surface area at 5 DAP. Soil-grown plants produced a larger root system compared to plants grown in <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions.</b> Aluminum toxicity–induced differences of root traits were also found between different <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions.</b> Beside the well-known reduction of root length, Al toxicity {{had a profound effect}} on other root architectural traits.

40|$|Background and Aims: Many {{recent studies}} {{examining}} aluminum (Al) toxicity {{have failed to}} consider its complex chemistry, thereby leading to erroneous results. Methods: Using modelling and experimental approaches, we focussed on the key effects of pH, P, and ionic strength on Al in <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> and resultant root elongation rate (RER) of soybean (Glycine max). Results: A {{review of the literature}} showed that the composition of <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> (ionic strength = 3 to 26  mM) in many studies differs markedly from solutions (mean ionic strength = 5  mM) extracted from acid soils. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> should have a pH ≤  4. 5 to ensure that Al remains soluble and that the toxic Al ion is the dominant species. Solutions should contain ≤ 5  μM P to ensure that Al is not precipitated and should have an ionic strength of < ca. 5  mM. Finally, we have shown that soybean RER is more closely related to the activity of Al at the outer surface of the root-cell plasma membrane than its activity in the bulk solution.
