40|$|Importance to the field: <b>Natural</b> <b>products</b> are {{the most}} {{consistently}} successful source of drug leads, both historically and currently. Despite this, the use of <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> in industrial drug discovery has fallen out of favour. <b>Natural</b> <b>products</b> {{are likely to continue}} to be sources of new commercially viable drug leads because the chemical novelty associated with <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> is higher than that of any other source: this is particularly important when searching for lead molecules against newly discovered targets for which there are no known small molecule leads. Areas to be covered: Current drug discovery strategies involving <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> are described in three sections: developments from traditionally used medicines, random testing of natural compounds on biological assays and use of virtual screening techniques with structures of <b>natural</b> <b>products.</b> What the reader will gain: The reader will gain an insight into the potential for <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> in current drug discovery paradigms, particularly in the value of using <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> in virtual screening approaches.

5|$|Lactacystin, a <b>natural</b> <b>product</b> {{synthesized}} by Streptomyces bacteria, was {{the first}} non-peptidic proteasome inhibitor discovered and is widely used as a research tool in biochemistry and cell biology.

Lactacystin covalently modifies the amino-terminal threonine of catalytic β subunits of the proteasome, particularly the β5 subunit responsible for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity. This discovery helped to establish the proteasome as a mechanistically novel class of protease: an amino-terminal threonine protease.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Natural</b> <b>products</b> {{have been}} an {{important}} source of lead compounds for drug discovery. How to find and evaluate bioactive <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> is critical to the achievement of drug/lead discovery from <b>natural</b> <b>products.</b> Methodology: We collected 19, 7201 <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> structures, reported biological activities and virtual screening results. Principal component analysis was employed to explore the chemical space, and we found that there was a large portion of overlap between <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> and FDA-approved drugs in the chemical space, which indicated that <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> had large quantity of potential lead compounds. We also explored the network properties of natural product-target networks and found that polypharmacology was greatly enriched to those compounds with large degree and high betweenness centrality. In order to make up for a lack of experimental data, high throughput virtual screening was employed. All <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> were docked to 332 target proteins of FDA-approved drugs. The most potential <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> for drug discovery and their indications were predicted based on a docking score-weighted prediction model. Conclusions: Analysis of molecular descriptors, distribution in chemical space and biological activities of <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> was conducted in this article. <b>Natural</b> <b>products</b> have vast chemical diversity, good drug-like properties and can interact with multiple cellular target proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the review was to {{summarise}} the effect of some commonly available <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> used for body weight management. We collected data from PubMed and scientific journals. There are numerous publications on this topic, however we have summarized the most commonly available and potent <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> from recent 53 publications. The <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> analyzed in this paper include catechins, capsaicin, conjugated linoleic acid, fucoxanthin, soy isoflavone, glabridin, astaxanthin and cyaniding- 3 -glucoside. These <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> are effective and safe for body weight management.

30|$|Metabolomics {{has been}} defined as “the {{comprehensive}} and quantitative analysis of all metabolites”, which can be used for the study of natural products’ druggability, including the metabolites derived from <b>natural</b> <b>products,</b> metabolic changes-induced by <b>natural</b> <b>products,</b> and toxicity related to <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> exposure. In the past decade, <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> studies have been greatly aided by the using of LC–MS-based metabolomics. In the future, metabolomics can give more valuable information in the research of <b>natural</b> <b>products,</b> especially when combined with isotopes tracers, genetically modified mice, and a systems biology analysis. First, the combination of metabolomics with stable isotope tracers can be successfully used to both study the metabolism of <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> and monitor metabolite flux in vivo and in vitro. Second, genetically modified mice are also valuable tools to understand the role of specific genes in the xenobiotic metabolism, active and toxicology mechanisms of <b>natural</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, metabolomics integrating with other omics, such as genomics and proteomics, can serve as an effective tool for investigating the mechanisms of <b>natural</b> <b>products</b> toxicity and activity.|$|R

A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit.

5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with mechanical equipment and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the <b>natural</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
