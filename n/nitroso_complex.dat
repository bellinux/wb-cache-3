40|$|The {{deposition}} {{behavior of}} ruthenium at low concentrations {{has been investigated}} under a var iety of conditions. Only when the ruthenium was in solution as the ruthenium <b>nitroso</b> <b>complex</b> were reproducible results obtained. Complete deposition was not pos-sible at concentrations below 10 - 5 molar. A mechanism involving a catalytic hydrogen reduction of the ruthenium <b>nitroso</b> <b>complex</b> is proposed {{to account for the}} complete deposition of m~cro amour~ts of ruthenium and the incomplete deposition of micro amounts...|$|E
40|$|The photo ligand {{substitution}} {{reaction of}} the bisphenanthroline complex [Ru(phen) 2 B] 2 + (where phen= 1, 10 -phenanthroline, B=ethylenediamine (en), trimethylenediamine (tn), or butanediamine (bn)) in acetonitrile solution was studied using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The photochemical reaction of a diamineruthenium(II) complex {{has been known to}} proceed by oxidation of a diamine ligand to an α,α′-diimine by oxidative dehydrogenation. The final reaction product was a solvent substituted complex [Ru(phen) 2 S 2] 2 +, where S is the solvent acetonitrile. We detected two monodentate complexes, an imine complex [Ru(phen) 2 (B- 2) S] 2 + and a <b>nitroso</b> <b>complex</b> [Ru(phen) 2 (en+ 14) S] 2 + in the ESI-MS analysis of the photoreaction products of [Ru(phen) 2 B] 2 +. These monodentate complexes were not observed with a bipyridine complex [Ru(bpy) 2 B] 2 + (where bpy= 2, 2 ′-bipyridine, B=en or tn). In addition, photochemical reactivity of the phen complex was found to be higher than that of the bpy complex. The difference in the photochemical reactivity {{can be explained by the}} difference in configurational flexibility of the phen and bpy ligands in the ruthenium complexes...|$|E
40|$|Color filters were {{prepared}} by using azo colorants and <b>nitroso</b> metal <b>complex</b> colorants. Initially, crushed glass particles were colored {{by using the}} azo and nitroso-iron complex colorants. These colored glass particles were used to obtain a colored composite with unsaturated polyester resin to give colored glass filters. Glass filters obtained were used for study to evaluate fading rate with respect to UV radiation, heat and moisture. Thermo gravimetric analyses of synthesized colorants were also carried out to determine their thermal stability. 7 page(s...|$|R
