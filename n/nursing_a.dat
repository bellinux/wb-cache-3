5|$|Chapman celebrated New Year in London before {{travelling}} {{north on}} a scouting trip to see Bury play Notts County on 1 January 1934. The following day, he travelled {{to his native}} Yorkshire to watch Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal's next opponents, before spending a final night in his home town of Kiveton Park. He returned to London <b>nursing</b> <b>a</b> cold but was well enough to watch an Arsenal third team match against Guildford City. Soon afterwards, his illness suddenly worsened; pneumonia set in, and Chapman quickly succumbed. He died {{in the early hours}} of 6 January 1934 at his home in Hendon. He was buried four days later in St Mary's Churchyard, Hendon.|$|E
5|$|Tracy is an overachieving {{high school}} junior, {{preparing}} for an easy election {{to the office of}} student body president after three years of extracurricular toil. Her assumptions of an unopposed victory are dashed when two unexpected challengers enter the race: friendly and popular athlete Paul Metzler, sidelined from the football team by a skiing accident, and Paul's younger adopted sister Tammy, a moody, sarcastic rebel. Paul has been coaxed into running by election supervisor Jim McAllister, a well-liked civics teacher <b>nursing</b> <b>a</b> deep resentment towards Tracy since her affair with Jim's best friend and fellow teacher cost the man his job and family.|$|E
5|$|With quarterback Dan Pastorini <b>nursing</b> <b>a</b> mid-season {{shoulder}} injury, Campbell {{carried the}} Oilers to a five-game winning streak in 1979, which {{concluded with a}} 30–24 win over the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day, in which he rushed for 195 yards and two touchdowns. He finished the season with 1,697 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns, leading the league in both categories. He also set NFL records with eleven 100-yard rushing games, seven consecutive 100-yard games, and 368 carries. He was named NFL MVP by the AP, NEA, and PFWA. He also repeated as the AP Offensive Player of the Year, and won the Bert Bell Award as the league's most outstanding player.|$|E

5|$|In the 2003–04 season, he was {{originally}} Detroit's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek {{came out of}} retirement, and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph, since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace. However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. After {{a stint in the}} minors, he returned to the Red Wings lineup while Hašek was <b>nursing</b> <b>a</b> groin injury. The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek decided to call it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league. After defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games, the Red Wings were defeated {{in the second round of}} the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|With 2:19 to {{play and}} <b>nursing</b> <b>a</b> one-point lead, Texas was in {{position}} to win if they could run out the clock. They began with a 12-yard rush {{on the left side}} by Jamaal Charles for a first down. Charles then carried again up the middle for a two-yard gain to the Ohio State 7. OSU called a time-out to stop the clock at 1:36. On second-and-goal, Vince Young kept the ball and gained threeyards before being tackled by A. J. Hawk. The Buckeyes again called time-out with 1:23 left. Young carried again for threeyards before being brought down by B. Carpenter and A. J. Hawk just one yard short of the goal-line. This time, Texas took a time-out with 29seconds left to play. Following the time-out, Young handed off to Henry Melton who was stopped for no gain. Ohio State took over on downs.|$|E

5|$|With {{running back}} James Wilder <b>nursing</b> <b>a</b> bruised sternum, Nathan Wonsley rushed for 138 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. Wonsley became the first Buccaneer running back, other than Wilder, to rush for 100 yards since Nov. 29, 1981. He was the first Tampa Bay rookie to rush for 100 yards since Jerry Eckwood in 1979. Wonsley {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his two older brothers, George and Otis, both backup NFL running backs who came off the bench to have breakout games while leading their respective teams to victory against the Lions. Constant Buccaneer blitzes resulted in four sacks, two interceptions, and six forced fumbles. Although Lions quarterback Eric Hipple had a good statistical day, completing 31 passes for 318 yards, the Tampa Bay defense's pressure prevented him from converting his opportunities into points. The win broke Tampa Bay's 19-game road losing streak.|$|E
