Other scholars such as Burton Stein concur with Thapar and Sastri, however, Bhargava states that given Kautilya was the prime minister, one must expect that he implemented the ideas in the book.|$|E

Although local governments face a number of superiors, their priorities are mainly concentrated in three principals: the party committee, government, and functional bureaus. This judgment comes from the author’s close participant observation and governmental documents from all levels in the country. A local government mainly receives three types of documents: party committee and government documents, government <b>documents,</b> and bureau <b>normative</b> <b>documents.</b> For example, the central-level government handles documents of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, State Council <b>documents,</b> and <b>normative</b> <b>documents</b> of ministries and commissions.

Norms typically describe {{the conditions under which}} they are applicable and the normative effects as a results of their applications. On the other hand, process models specify how a business operation or service is to be carried out to achieve a desired outcome. Norms can have significant impact on how business operations are conducted and they can apply to the whole or part of a business process. For example, they may impose conditions on the different aspects of a process (e. g., perform tasks in a specific sequence (control-flow), at a specific time or within a certain time frame (temporal aspect), by specific people (resources)). We propose a framework that provides the formal semantics of the normative requirements for determining whether a business process complies with a <b>normative</b> <b>document</b> (where a <b>normative</b> <b>document</b> can be understood in a very broad sense, ranging from internal policies to best practice policies, to statutory acts).
