Wetti was most terrified to see emperor Charlemagne, bound and completely unharmed, except for an animal tearing at his genitals. His shock came from the idea that Charlemagne was a pious, good-natured Christian king, but the angel revealed that all Charlemagne's good deeds had been negated by the lust and debauchery which dominated his later life. Yet he would eventually be forgiven because of his actions on behalf of Christianity.|$|E

After having read Tim Powers' historical fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, {{he decided to}} add paranormal themes to the game's plot. He also cited Powers' book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck. Inspiration for the game's ambiance came from Gilbert's favorite childhood amusement park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted [...] "to step off the ride" [...] and [...] "talk {{to the people who}} lived in that world". Near the final stages of the design work, Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game's story.

500|$|The {{film was}} the first Hollywood {{production}} to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution.

I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer." [...] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, [...] "I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D." [...] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the [...] "RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that." [...] Webb continued that [...] "you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we <b>need</b> <b>those</b> cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it." [...] The Amazing Spider-Man climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.|$|E

Of course every great man is always being helped by everybody,[103] for his gift is to get good out of all things and all persons; and also there were two men associated with him in early study, who showed high promise in the same field, Cousen and Girtin (especially the former), {{and there is no}} saying what these men might have done had they lived; there might, perhaps, have been a struggle between one or other of them and Turner, as between Giorgione and Titian. But they lived not; and Turner is the only great man whom the school has yet produced,--quite great enough, as we shall see, for all that needed to be done. To him, therefore, we now finally turn, as the sole object of our inquiry.

Those three acres will feed as many horses as heaven knows how huge an area of unseeded, uncared for, wasted pasture would feed. Think it over. I'll lend you books on the subject. I don't know how large your crops will be, nor do I know how much a horse eats; that's your business. But I am certain, with a hired man to take your place helping your wife on her two acres of vegetables, that by the time you own the horses your three acres will feed, you will have all you can attend to. Then it will be time to get more land, for more horses, for more riches, if that way happiness lie." ...|$|E

40|$|Luxus - Essen - Ãœberfluss - Konsumgewohnheiten - Komplexe Gesellschaften The statement, by the {{eighteenth-century}} economist Adam Smith, that luxuries are {{all things that}} are not necessities is too simplistic an approach to be useful within the context of zooarchaeology. To start with, all animal products could be regarded as unnecessary within the human diet. Therefore, a four-part subdivision is proposed, distinguishing between foodstuffs that fulfill basic physiological <b>needs,</b> <b>those</b> that fulfill imagined <b>needs,</b> <b>those</b> that render a diet affluent and, finally, luxury foods. Optimal foraging theory further develops this subdivision by also taking into account the costs involved in obtaining the ingredients. The distinction between the affluent and the luxurious diet in particular allows us to define criteria through which luxury foods can be recognized within a zooarchaeological assemblage. At the same time, however, the constraints of such an exercise become apparent. This theoretical approach is illustrated by case studies from Roman to post-medieval Europe...|$|R
