5000|$|The {{attacker}} may try {{to break}} the encryption of the mobile network. The GSM <b>network</b> <b>encryption</b> algorithms belong {{to the family of}} algorithms called A5. Due to the policy of security through obscurity it has not been possible to openly test the robustness of these algorithms. There were originally two variants of the algorithm: A5/1 and A5/2 (stream ciphers), where the former was designed to be relatively strong, and the latter was designed to be weak on purpose to allow easy cryptanalysis and eavesdropping. ETSI forced some countries (typically outside Europe) to use A5/2. Since the encryption algorithm was made public, it was proved it was possible to break the encryption: A5/2 could be broken on the fly, and A5/1 in about 6 hours [...] In July 2007, the 3GPP approved a change request to prohibit the implementation of A5/2 in any new mobile phones, which means that it has been decommissioned and is no longer implemented in mobile phones. Stronger public algorithms {{have been added to the}} GSM standard, the A5/3 and A5/4 (Block ciphers), otherwise known as KASUMI or UEA1 published by the ETSI. If the network does not support A5/1, or any other A5 algorithm implemented by the phone, then the base station can specify A5/0 which is the null-algorithm, whereby the radio traffic is sent unencrypted. Even in case mobile phones are able to use 3G or 4G which have much stronger encryption than 2G GSM, the base station can downgrade the radio communication to 2G GSM and specify A5/0 (no encryption) [...] This is the basis for eavesdropping attacks on mobile radio networks using a fake base station commonly called an IMSI catcher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Traffic {{analysis}} poses {{a serious}} threat to communication se-curity, especially in wireless <b>networks.</b> <b>Encryption</b> may be used to hide message contents, whereas traffic padding may be used to hide the traffic pattern. This paper deals with the issue of preventing traffic analysis by inserting dummy (or padding) traffic to hide the real traffic pattern. The observable traffic pattern, after dummy traffic has been inserted, is referred to as a cover mode. Since the dummy traffic incurs an overhead, it is im-portant to minimize dummy traffic while achieving the desired security ob-jective. In this paper, we attempt to develop a suitable cover mode with the objective of minimizing energy consumption – the nodes in wireless ad hoc networks typically have limited battery supply, therefore, it is important to minimize the energy consumption. We propose different methods for im-plementing the cover mode, and evaluate the impact of these techniques on system lifetime and on energy consumption per unit of real traffic transmit-ted in the network...|$|R
