40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{aspects of}} current EU competition policy and additional {{provisions of the}} Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) relevant for competition in the financial services sector. Primarily, it analyzes the application of Article 101 (3) TFEU in the insurance sector. It argues that the traditional arguments that have been advanced by insurance associations to justify different treatment from EU competition rules have lost their relevance since they fail to recognize the similarities and an increasing convergence between the two sectors of the financial services industry. Therefore, insurance sector cannot be considered ‘peculiar’, at least vis-à-vis banking, and therefore, {{can no longer be}} treated as ‘sui generis’ for the application of EU competition law. Afterwards, it investigates the effectiveness of the harmonization measures in the sectors of insurance and banking at enhancing competition in the internal market. For this purpose, evidence is provided from Italy as a case study. Based on the analysis, concerns arise about the effectiveness of the harmonization process of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> in Italy {{due to the fact that}} over the period 1998 - 2013, the level of competition did not remarkably improve but witnessed an unstable trend. Same concerns can be extended to the Italian banking sector. Further, findings suggest that competition in non-life insurance and banking sectors is not detrimental to financial soundness. Moreover, sounder insurers and banks benefit more from higher competition as compared to less sound counterparts...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{insurance}} market activity within financial development is gaining more attention in academia, as the sector experiences growth within emerging markets. This paper aims to understand which macro-economic and social variables impact the growth or {{decline of the}} <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> sector broadly across Africa, {{with a view to}} provide recommendations to drive increased penetration across the region. The study examines the explanatory factors of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand in Africa, using annual data from 1990 to 2013 on 28 countries. Using Fixed Effects Panel Data Regression, the study finds that: levels of income, and unemployment rates have a significant negative impact on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand; whilst population growth rates, and the level of private sector credit (to GDP) positively impacted <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand. Urbanisation rates, and levels of merchandise trade had statistically insignificant effects on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand. Since these variables only explained about 11 % of the variation in the dependent variable, the study suggests that further research into the cultural and institutional (ie. Legal / regulatory) dynamics is required to improve our understanding of what conditions would stimulate <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand in future...|$|R

This paper uses the Concentration Ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index {{to measure the}} degree of market concentration. The paper also analyzes various data from all type of insurance premium, balance sheet and income statement to measure the concentration and competition trend. An analysis of life insurance premium, group market is unconcentrated where as ordinary and industry markets are concentrated. As for the life insurance balance sheet and income statement are concentrated market. An analysis of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> premium, fire, marine and transportation and automobile markets are unconcentrated. As for the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> balance sheet and income statement are unconcentrated market. In terms of the same sub-categorized product, personal accident and health insurance have difference concentrate degree. Personal accident in life insurance is near monopoly and highly concentrated market while personal accident in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> is loose oligopoly and moderate concentrated market. Health insurance in life and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> are tight oligopoly and concentrated market. The results conclude that the life insurance industry is more concentrated than the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. In both segments of the insurance market, {{as well as in}} the overall insurance sector, there is a downward trend in market concentration, which indicates the success of the competition promoting process which allows a greater and better choice for customers...|$|R

40|$|An optimal asset {{allocation}} {{is crucial for}} <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The most previous studies focused on this topic use a mono-objective technique optimization. This technique usually allows the maximization of shareholders’ expected utility. As <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> company is a complex system, it has many stakeholders other than shareholders. So, the satisfaction of the shareholders’ expected utility cannot lead usually {{to the satisfaction of}} other stakeholders’ objectives. Therefore, the focus on utility maximization can be a destruction source of other objectives such as productivity, competitiveness and solvency. Our developed model integrates simulation approach with a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. This model insures an optimal {{asset allocation}} that maximizes, simultaneously, shareholders expected utility and technical efficiency of European <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The empirical application conducts a comparison between the attained results with multi-objective optimization technique and mono-objective technique to search the optimal asset allocation for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. Our results show that the investment portfolio will be more diversified between most available investment assets. In addition, any decision maker should take account of different stakeholders’ objectives. Accordingly multi-objective optimization allows us to find the best asset allocation that maximizes simultaneously expected utility and technical efficiency of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. ...|$|R

40|$|Insurance is an {{industry}} given special attention in the national accounts due to {{the very nature of}} its activities. In particular the method for estimating the value of output of <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> is a challenging task. This report documents new methods for estimating output in the insurance industry in the Norwegian national accounts. The background is new international recommendations as given in world-wide System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) and the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010), but also action points given in the report of the Eurostat GNI 1 visit to Norway in 2009 – 2010 have been addressed. Finally, the life insurance reform in Norway in 2008, changing the system for reports from insurance companies to the authorities, has been taken into account. For <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> the methods employed for output at both current and constant prices have been changed. Following the new international recommendations adjusted claims due is used in the calculation of the current price figures, while a new volume indicator based on number of insurance contracts is constructed for the constant price estimations of output. The results show a more smooth development in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> output compared to previous figures in the Norwegian national accounts. For life insurance the new reporting system that came into force in 2008 has made it possible to extract the value of the <b>insurance</b> <b>service</b> directly from the accounting based reports. Also, the imputed interest accruing to the insurance policy holders is extracted directly from the reports of the life insurance companies.
