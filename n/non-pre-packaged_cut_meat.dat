Results showed that beef and kangaroo meat could be separated when samples were analyzed by spectrophotometry as minced <b>meat</b> or <b>cut</b> <b>meat.</b> For minced meat, scatter correction and derivative treatment of reflectance spectra improved classification. For <b>cut</b> <b>meat,</b> original reflectance spectra produced better classification. Overall classification accuracy was 83 % to 100 %, and no kangaroo meat was misclassified.

Thermal treatment was conducted to the temperature of 71 ºC inside beef inside.

We looked at forty-five females and 5 males with wrist fractures at 12 weeks after injury and compared their level of satisfaction with various respected outcome measures. The mean age was 66 years. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out using a statistical software package. Patient satisfaction correlated best with the MacDermid, Watts, and DASH scores. The variables in these scoring systems that predicted satisfaction were pain and ability to perform household chores or usual occupation, open packets, and <b>cut</b> <b>meat.</b> The four most important questions to ask in the clinic following wrist fractures are about severity of pain and ability to open packets, <b>cut</b> <b>meat,</b> and perform household chores or usual occupation.
