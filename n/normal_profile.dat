40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient on-line anomaly detection algorithm that can effectively identify {{a group of}} especially harmful internal attackers- masqueraders in cellular mobile networks. Our scheme is derived from a well-developed data compression technique. We use cell IDs traversed by a user as the feature value. Based on this, the mobility pattern of a user {{is characterized by a}} high order Markov model. Ziv-Lempel data compression algorithms are utilized to parse the data and store relevant statistical information in a mobility trie. Moreover, the technique of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) is used to efficiently update the mobility trie in order to modify the user’s <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> constantly. In this way, an up-to-date <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> is maintained. The proposed <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. A threshold scheme is then used to determine whether the mobile device is potentially compromised or not.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ovarian function, metabolic profiles and fertility in first lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (mean 305 day milk yield: 7417 +/- 191 kg, n = 37). Reproductive profiles obtained from milk progesterone analysis were categorized into normal (n = 17) and four abnormal profiles (delayed ovulation, DOV 1, n = 9; DOV 2, n = 2; persistent corpus luteum, PCL 1, n = 6; PCL 2, n = 4; 1 : immediately post-calving, 2 : subsequent cycles). Fifty-five percent of cows had abnormal profiles with half of these being categorized as DOV 1. Fertility of DOV 1 and DOV 2 cows was reduced whereas PCL 1 and PCL 2 cows had similar reproductive competence to <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> cows. DOV 1 animals had higher milk energy values, lower energy balances, lower dry matter intakes (DMI) and greater body weight and body condition score (BCS) losses post-calving than <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> animals. DOV 1 animals also had lower insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and higher betahydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations and tended to have the lower insulin and glucose concentrations in the pre-service period than <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> cows. All PCL animals had vulval discharges postpartum. Despite this, the DMI, body weight and BCS changes, IGF-I concentrations and fertility of PCL 1 animals was similar to <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> cows. In conclusion, the high prevalence of delayed ovulation post-calving (DOV 1) in primiparous high yielding cows lasted long enough (71 +/- 8. 3 days) to have a detrimental impact on fertility and was associated with significant physiological changes. This study did not establish any detrimental effects of PCL profiles on fertility or production parameters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

However, limited research {{has examined the}} frequency with which such adjustments alter score profiles, psychologists 2 ̆ 7 decision-making, or diagnostic accuracy. Of particular interest, in an unknown number of cases test scores that are and are not adjusted may yield conflicting interpretations, both of which cannot be correct. Working with the WAIS-Ill and WMS-Ill, this study examined how often, and the extent to which, sociodemographic adjustment altered test score patterns among normal and abnormal groups. Potential impact on classification and diagnostic accuracy was also examined by determining {{the frequency with which}} sociodemographically adjusted profiles best matched their original diagnostic prototypes as opposed to other prototypes, and with which abnormal and <b>normal</b> <b>profiles</b> shifted to more closely resemble the opposing classification. Analysis showed that sociodemographic adjustment frequently produced substantial change in profiles for cases based on the prototype for traumatic brain injury, with these same findings replicated for cases of alcohol abuse, as well as for various <b>normal</b> <b>profiles.</b> Further, matches with original prototypes were often altered such that in a large percentage of cases, profiles from specific pathologic conditions formed better matches with different conditions. Both <b>normal</b> and abnormal <b>profiles</b> additionally switched classes with modest frequency. This research demonstrates that sociodemographic {{adjustment of}}ten has a considerable affect on test score patterns, and hence research on the ultimate impact of such adjustments on clinical judgment and diagnostic accuracy is urgently needed...|$|R

Since the slope obtained from MBRT is indicative of the total metabolic active cell, a standard profile for normal operation can be established. During operation deviations from the <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> may indicate contamination or abnormal behavior. Since the metabolic active cell count increased in case of contamination, the MBRT slope would be higher than the MBRT slope for normal operation. If the MBRT slope obtained during monitoring is less than that of the <b>normal</b> <b>profile,</b> abnormalities such as failure in temperature or pH control, oxygen limitation or inhibitors in the medium, may be the cause for decrease in metabolic active cell. Thus, MBRT can be used for fault diagnosis through online measurement of slope of MB decoloration.|$|E

Working at second line of defense, detection accuracy is the key objective that largely depends upon the precision of its <b>normal</b> <b>profile.</b> Due to existence of vague boundaries between normal and anomalous classes and dynamic network behavior, building accurate and generalize <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> is very difficult. Based on the assumption that intruder?s behavior can be grouped into different phases active at different times, this article proposes to evolve and use ?short-term fuzzy profiles/contexts? for each such individual intrusion phase resulting in enhanced detection accuracy for low-level attacks. The result is a context-driven, adaptable implementation framework based on a double layer hierarchy of fuzzy sensors. The framework adapts to network conditions by switching between different contexts, according to network traffic patterns, anomaly conditions and organization?s security policies. These contexts are evolved in incremental fashion with genetic algorithm using real-time network traces. The framework is tested using DARPA 98 / 99 dataset showing accurate detection of low-level DoS attack...|$|E

Based on the design parameters of worm and worm wheel, {{it is possible to}} calculate the coordinates of the shape of the tool cutting edge. The exact calculation of the coordinates or parameters requires mathematical formulations and applying mathematical relationships we can transform the design of worm screw profile to the profile of tool. Worms of different types can be produced in various ways, e. g. with a lathe and the plane to set a tool is either axial or normal. In this article we consider their production on the lathe and tool setting in the normal plane.

40|$|Anomaly {{detection}} {{in mobile}} ad hoc network (MANET) {{is a relatively}} new area of research. The lack of fixed infrastructure, limited resources, and dynamic topology present numerous problems in MANET security. Recently, several machine learning and data mining techniques have been proposed for anomaly detection in MANETs. In addition, researchers continue to examine new unsupervised detection techniques. As the number of unsupervised learning techniques grows, {{there is a lack of}} evidence to support the use of one technique over another. This dissertation research conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different unsupervised learning techniques for anomaly detection in MANETs, more specifically, the K-means, the C-means, the Fixed-width clustering, the Principal Component Analysis, and the One-class Support Vector Machine. While the main goal of the research was to compare performance of the unsupervised learning techniques, this dissertation research also investigated: i) tradeoffs between competing factors such as high detection performance and limited resource utilization, ii) the impact of <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> selection models on anomaly detection, iii) the influence of the link change rate as the weighting function on the unsupervised learning algorithms and iv) the influence of decision thresholds on the detection techniques. The results of this dissertation research showed that both K-means and C-means delivered the best performance when using different <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> models. The results indicated that direct application of clustering techniques provided a worse average performance than that of trained clusters. This dissertation research found that a small value for the time slot was preferred for all techniques. Moreover, a short training interval was also preferred. These preferences appeared to provide better performance while minimizing resource usage (e. g. execution time, CPU, and memory usages). Additionally, the method of using only the initial training data set was found to provide a comparable performance to that of random, recent, and adaptive <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> models, but required the least resource usage. Finally, the study found that the application of link change rate as the weighting function to adjust the importance of the time slot had no influence on all techniques. Choosing appropriate parameter and decision thresholds for each detection algorithm had a significant influence on maximizing the performance results...|$|E
30|$|The {{performance}} of BM 3 D {{varies depending on}} the type of transformation used in both steps. There are two major profiles of BM 3 D, namely: DC-only profile and wavelet profile. In DC-Only profile, BM 3 D uses a three-dimensional discrete cosine transform as a 3 D transform. For the wavelet profile, on the other hand, BM 3 D uses a combination of 2 D bi-orthogonal transform and 1 D-Haar or Walsh-Hadamard transform. DC-only profile generally produces poorer results as compared to its wavelet counterpart [5, 6]. Wavelet profile may be defined as the mainstream BM 3 D since the authors of BM 3 D [5] recommended to use Wavelet transform in their proposed denoising method. This is because, the main stream BM 3 D has PSNR gain much better than DC-only profile. For the wavelet profile, we used an exactly same parameterized setup as in BM 3 D [5]. We present the basic parameterized setup from the original article [5] in Table  1 for readers’ convenience. We use exactly the same parameters to ensure the same environment for the experiment. The wavelet profile uses two sub-profiles called <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> and fast profile. The only difference between them is that the denoising performance is compromised in order to reduce the computational complexity in fast profile. Another difference between these two profiles is the fast profile uses predictive searching in order to decrease its searching time while the <b>normal</b> <b>profile</b> uses only exhaustive searching.|$|E
