50|$|Lecithin {{can easily}} be {{extracted}} chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, benzene, etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as soybeans, eggs, milk, marine sources, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b>|$|E
40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane glue, paint thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and isobutyl nitrites, often marketed as “poppers ” or room odorizers). (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants.

5000|$|<b>Cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is a spray {{form of an}} oil as a lubricant, {{lecithin}} as an emulsifier, and a propellant such as food-grade alcohol, nitrous oxide, {{carbon dioxide}} or propane. <b>Cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is applied to frying pans and other cookware to prevent food from sticking. Traditionally, cooks used butter, shortening, or oils poured or rubbed on cookware. [...] Most <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays</b> have less food energy per serving than an application of vegetable oil, because they are applied in a much thinner layer: US regulations allow many to be labelled [...] "zero-calorie"; in the UK sprays claim to supply [...] "less than 1 calorie per serving". Popular US brands include Pam, Crisco, and Baker's Joy. Sprays are available with plain vegetable oil, butter and olive oil flavor.|$|R

50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently cooked over light to medium heat, it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|R

50|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{were once}} {{often used as}} propellants, but since the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, they have been {{replaced}} in nearly every country due to the negative effects CFCs have on Earth's ozone layer. The most common replacements are mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons, typically propane, n-butane and isobutane. Dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl ethyl ether are also used. All these have the disadvantage of being flammable. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are also used as propellants to deliver foodstuffs (for example, whipped cream and <b>cooking</b> <b>spray).</b> Medicinal aerosols such as asthma inhalers use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA): either HFA 134a (1,1,1,2,-tetrafluoroethane) or HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) or combinations of the two.

50|$|Muffin tins and muffin pans are {{typically}} metal bakeware which has round bowl-shaped depressions into which muffin batter is poured. Muffin tins or pans can be greased with butter or <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> {{to lessen the}} issue of batter sticking to the pan. Alternatively, muffin cups or cases are used. Cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They {{are used in the}} baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin. The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming.|$|R

Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are sprayed into plastic bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister.

40|$|When aqueous {{potato starch}} {{suspensions}} were heated into the solution state and cooled, spreadable particle gels were obtained with a spherulite morphology and a cream-like texture. This so-called superheated starch (SHS) exhibits more effective gelling properties than maltodextrin, {{which is currently}} applied as a fat mimetic. In addition, a gel-like texture is immediately obtained when mixing dry SHS with cold water. Other starch types showed similar properties. Gel moduli were higher as amylose content increased. A large-scale preparation procedure based on jet <b>cooking</b> and <b>spray</b> drying with or without intermediate gelation was devised. SHS {{was identified as a}} slightly to moderately degraded starch. The formation of particle gels with spherulitic morphology was observed over at least two decades of Mw from 0. 06 to 16 × 106 g/mol. At higher molar mass, demixing between amylose and amylopectin was observed. These phenomena are tentatively explained by assuming a competition between demixing and crystallization. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
