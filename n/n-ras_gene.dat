The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the extent of involvement of ras oncogenes in osteosarcoma. Tumor samples from a series of 49 pediatric patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma and treated at our institution were evaluated. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples from diagnostic biopsies, from tumor en bloc resection tissue after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and samples from metastases were examined in search of point mutations in H, K, and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes</b> at codons 12 and 61 by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), slot-blotting, and radioactive labeled specific DNA probes. A total of 92 archival samples were studied. No point mutations activating these genes were found. These findings suggest that the activation by point mutations at codons 12 and 61 of the H, K, and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes</b> does not play a role in the pathogenesis of human osteosarcoma. Since no point mutations in codons 12 and 61 were detected, it was not possible to establish any correlation between the ras genes and clinical or histologic finding...|$|R

K-ras codon 12 point mutations were found in 8 out of 37 (22 %) specimens while no mutations {{were found in the}} Î—-ras and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes.</b> Mutations were found in 27 % (3 out of 11) of adenocarcinomas while in squamous cell carcinomas the incidence of mutations was 18 % (3 out of 17). In addition, a K-ras codon 12 point mutation was found in one (12 %) among 8 small cell carcinomas and in the only Hodgkin's lymphoma with metastasis in the lung.

40|$|The {{activation}} of ras genes in naturally occurring tumors has, thus far, {{been found to}} be due to mutations in codon 12 or 61 resulting in single amino acid substitutions. We have used highly labeled synthetic oligonucleotides to detect mutations in these codons and to determine the exact position of the mutation. Using this approach we have found three different mutations in codon 61 of the <b>N-ras</b> <b>gene</b> of various human tumor cell lines. In the fibrosarcoma line HT 1080 the first nucleotide of the codon is mutated; in the promyelocytic line HL 60 the second and in the rhabdomyosarcoma line RD 301 the third nucleotide. For RD 301 this implies that the normal glutamine residue at position 61 is replaced by histidine.

40|$|Altered tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 and/or CDKN 2 A {{as well as}} Ras {{genes are}} frequently found in primary and metastatic melanomas. These alterations {{were found to be}} responsible for acquisition of invasive and metastatic potential through their defective regulatory control of metalloproteinases and urokinase genes. Using primary human melanoma M 10 cells with altered p 53, CDKN 2 A and <b>N-Ras</b> <b>genes,</b> we found that inhibition of the proprotein convertases (PCs), enzymes involved in the proteolytic activation of various cancer-related protein precursors resulted in significantly reduced invasiveness. Analysis of M 10 cells and their gastric and lymph node derived metastatic cells revealed the presence of all the PCs found in the secretory pathway. Expression of the general PCs inhibitor alpha 1 -PDX in these cells in a stable manner (M 10 /PDX) had no effect on the mRNA expression levels of these PCs. Whereas, in vitro digestion assays and cell transfection experiments, revealed that M 10 /PDX cells display reduced PCs activity and are unable to process the PCs substrates proIGF- 1 R and proPDGF-A. These cells showed reduced migration and invasion that paralleled decreased gelatinase MMP- 2 activity and increased expression and secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1) and TIMP- 2. Furthermore, these cells showed decreased levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of PCs activity results in decreased invasiveness of primary human melanoma cells despite their altered p 53, CDKN 2 A and <b>N-Ras</b> <b>genes,</b> suggesting that PCs may serve as novel therapeutic targets in melanoma...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess the {{prevalence}} and type of activating point mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the Ki-, Ha-, and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes</b> in a series of early gastric carcinomas in white patients and to correlate these ras gene mutations, if any, with the histological type (Lauren classification), the type of growth pattern, and with the Helicobacter pylori status. Haematoxylin and eosin and Giemsa stained sections from 45 formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded early gastric carcinomas were used to assess the Lauren type, the type of growth pattern, and the antral H pylori status. DNA was extracted according to standard procedures. Mutations at codon 12 of the Ki-ras gene were examined with a polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and dot blot hybridisation with allele-specific 32 P-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) probes. All other ras genes were analysed with specific PCR amplification and dot blot hybridisation with ASO probes. Mutations were detected by overnight autoradiography at - 70 degrees C. Some 20 intestinal-type and 25 diffuse-type early gastric carcinomas were seen. According to growth pattern, there were 24 small mucosal type early gastric carcinomas, five superficial spreading type early gastric carcinomas, and 16 penetrating type early gastric carcinomas (four penetrating A type, 12 penetrating B type). H pylori was found in the antral mucosa of 28 early gastric carcinomas (62 %). Activating ras gene mutations were not found. It was discovered that activating point mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the Ki-, Ha-, and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes</b> do not play a part in the development of early gastric carcinomas in white subjects, irrespective of Lauren type. Moreover, differences in biological behaviour between early carcinomas with different types of growth pattern are not related to these ras gene mutations.

Electron microscopic examination suggested that the KPL- 1 cells are of epithelial origin. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the cells express cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 15 - 3. They also possess a large number of oestrogen receptors but not progesterone receptors. Interestingly, KPL- 1 cells seem to grow oestrogen independently in vitro. No amplification of c-erbB- 2, c-myc, H-ras and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes</b> was detected. KPL- 1 cells secrete a large amount of tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA). Although the secretion of CA 15 - 3 seemed to be constant throughout all cell growth phases, TPA secretion increased during the exponential growth phase and decreased during the plateau phase.

Analysis of purified populations of spermatogenic cell types indicates that the 2. 4 -kb transcript is selectively expressed in haploid postmeiotic early spermatids. The evidence for a developmentally regulated expression of pim- 1 in haploid spermatids suggests a possible developmental role for this protooncogene product. The 2. 4 -kb pim- 1 transcript present in postmeiotic cells differs in size from the 2. 8 -kb transcript usually detected in somatic tissues. Similar testis-specific transcripts have been seen for mos and abl genes. These data suggest specificity in transcription or processing of certain genes in haploid male germ cells. We have also analyzed other representative protooncogenes, including examples of protein kinases, the ras family, and the "nuclear" protooncogenes. The results indicate that additional protooncogenes are preferentially expressed in either meiotic pachytene cells or postmeiotic early spermatids. These findings suggest a differential regulation of gene expression in these two developmental stages of germ cells.

The mutations in the BRAF and N-ras genes, in this study, were not associated with histologic type, location, skin type, size, or numbers of nevi. Our results suggest that mutations in the BRAF gene {{and to some extent}} in the <b>N-ras</b> <b>gene</b> represent early somatic events that occur in melanocytic nevi.

Several cell lines, both normal and transformed, were selected that expressed high levels of p 21 ras.

Bradykinin receptor numbers were measured in these lines and found to be up to 40 -fold higher in the p 21 ras overexpressors than in the parental cells. This was found to be the case for both normal and transforming forms of all three varieties of ras genes. Receptor number correlated well with the bradykinin-dependent phosphatidylinositol turnover response in all cases.

In nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells, adducts accumulated to similar levels in all four genes. The repair efficiency in different gene loci varied in a qualitatively and quantitatively similar way in both GGR-deficient and TCR-deficient backgrounds and correlated with transcriptional activity and local chromatin condensation. No strand-specific repair was found in GGR(+) /TCR(+) cells, implying that GGR dominated. Adducts were lost over two sharply demarcated phases: a rapid phase resulting in the removal within 1 hour of up to approximately 80 % of the adducts, and a subsequent phase with t(1 / 2) approximately 36 to 48 hours.

An open reading frame, potentially encoding a 798 amino acid protein, is contained within the unr cDNA. Neither the primary protein structure nor the nucleic acid sequence of unr is homologous to any other known gene, including N-ras. Unr transcripts are detected in mouse, rat and human cells, and Southern analysis indicates that the unr locus found immediately upstream of the <b>N-ras</b> <b>gene</b> is transcriptionaly active in the mouse since only a single copy of unr is detected in this species. Unr produces multiple transcripts that differ in their 3 ' ends and are apparently created through the differential use of multiple polyadenylation sites located in the 3 ' untranslated region of the gene. Both unr and N-ras are expressed in all tissues examined. In the testis, both genes are developmentally regulated, with an increase in expression occurring upon testicular maturation. Thus the two genes may be coordinately regulated, at least in certain circumstances. Our findings suggest that a thorough analysis of the relationship that exists between the two genes could potentially provide insights into the regulation and/or function of N-ras...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the expression of}} the ras gene family (H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras) in adult mouse tissues and during development. We found substantial variations in expression among different organs and in the amounts of the different transcripts originating from each gene, especially for the <b>N-ras</b> <b>gene.</b> The expression patterns were consistent with the reported preferential tissue activation of ras genes and suggested different cellular functions for each of the ras genes...|$|E
40|$|In 7 of 37 {{patients}} with cutaneous melanoma, mutations in the <b>N-ras</b> <b>gene</b> were found. The primary tumors of these seven patients were exclusively localized on body sites continuously exposed to sunlight. Moreover, the ras mutations were all {{at or near}} dipyrimidine sites known to be targets of UV damage. Two primary tumors were biclonal with respect to ras mutation. An active role for UV irradiation in induction of the mutations is suggeste...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{phenomenon in}} tumor immunology {{that has come}} under recent attention {{is the impact of}} oncogene activation in tumor cells on the sensitivity to lysis by immune effector cells. Several studies suggested that transfer of an activated ras oncogene into cultured rodent fibroblasts induces susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK) -mediated lysis. Experiments using human tumor cells, however, have produced conflicting data on the effect of ras activation in this respect. In studying the activation of the oncogene c-myc, which is often overexpressed in human melanoma, we have found that in cell lines expressing high levels of Myc protein, the sensitivity to lysis by NK cells was dramatically increased due to reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen B locus products. Since the N-ras oncogene was found to be activated in 15 % of human melanomas, we examined the possibility that in melanoma, in analogy to the murine systems, the mutated ras oncogene may influence NK susceptibility of human melanoma cells. Two <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes</b> harboring frequently found mutations were cloned into an expression vector. Transfection of the IGR 39 D melanoma cell line with wildtype and mutant N-ras constructs yielded several ras-expressing clones that were tested for NK sensitivity. Neither high expression of the wildtype N-ras protein, nor expression of two mutant proteins (N 61 -arg, N 61 -lys) was shown to result in enhanced NK-mediated lysis. We conclude that activation of ras oncogenes does not lead to the induction of an NK-sensitive phenotype in human melanoma cells. J Invest Dermatol 103 : 117 Sâ€“ 121 S, 199...|$|R
40|$|Akv 1 - 99, {{a variant}} of Akv murine leukemia virus, induces B-cell lymphomas with nearly 100 % {{incidence}} and a mean latency period of 12 months after injection into newborn NMRI mice. PCR amplification and sequence analyses of DNA flanking integrated proviruses revealed proviral insertion into the N-ras/unr (upstream of N-ras) locus in 2 out of 13 B-cell lymphomas, both of which appeared clonal by Southern blotting analysis. These two tumors showed increased expression levels of N-ras by Northern blotting, as did a third tumor shown by reverse transcriptase PCR to have a nonclonal provirus integration located in the same area. However, no significant changes in expression were observed when using a specific probe for the unr gene. All proviruses were integrated in the same transcriptional orientation as unr and <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes.</b> By promoter insertion, the two Akv 1 - 99 proviruses integrated between exon âˆ’ 1 and exon 1 of N-ras gave rise to two different spliced products, whereas the provirus integrated into unr used only an exon skipping pattern. The absence of mutations of the N-ras codons 12, 13, 18, and 61 suggests that activation of the proto-oncogene is exclusively due to overexpression by retroviral promoter insertion, and furthermore, Northern blot analyses indicate that the expression of unr is unaffected by N-ras overexpression even in the case where the unr gene itself is the target of proviral insertion. Thus, altogether our findings indicate that overexpression of N-ras {{plays a role in}} development of murine leukemia virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, leaving the expression of the tightly linked unr gene unaltered...|$|R
40|$|DNAs from hamster embryo {{cells and}} mouse C 3 H/ 10 T 1 / 2 cells {{transformed}} in vitro by x-irradiation into malignant cells transmit the radiation transformation phenotype by producing transformed colonies (transfectants) in two mouse recipient lines, the NIH 3 T 3 and C 3 H/ 101 / 2 cells, {{and in a}} rat cell line, the Rat- 2 cells. DNAs from unirradiated cells or irradiated and visibly untransformed cells do not produce transformed colonies. The transfectants grow in agar and form tumors in nude mice. Treatment of the DNAs with restriction endonucleases prior to transfection indicates that the same transforming gene (oncogene) is present {{in each of the}} transformed mouse cells and is the same in each of the transformed hamster cells. Southern blot analysis of 3 T 3 or Rat- 2 transfectants carrying oncogenes from radiation-transformed C 3 H/ 10 T 1 / 2 or hamster cells indicates that the oncogenes responsible for the transformation of 3 T 3 cells are not the Ki-ras, Ha-ras, or <b>N-ras</b> <b>genes,</b> nor are they neu, trk, raf, abl, or fms, although quick blot analysis using 11 oncogene probes detected increased transcripts of c-abl and c-fms in the 3 T 3 transformants containing oncogenic sequences from the x-ray-transformed C 3 H/ 10 T 1 / 2 cells. The work demonstrates that DNAs from mammalian cells transformed into malignancy by direct exposure in vitro to radiation contain genetic sequences with detectable transforming activity in three recipient cell lines. The results provide evidence that DNA is the target of radiation carcinogenesis induced at a cellular level in vitro. The experiments indicate that malignant radiogenic transformation in vitro of hamster embryo and mouse C 3 H/ 10 T 1 / 2 cells involves the activation of unique non-ras transforming genes, which heretofore have not been described...|$|R
