Wood, Mrs. I. L. Bell, and her sister, Miss Pattinson of Washington. As the train passed steadily over the bridge the anxiety of the immense multitude seemed intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet fearful—not only from the lofty eminence occupied by the train, but, from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which it rolled along. It seemed from its <b>noiselessness,</b> rather an aerial flight, than the rattling sweep of the iron horse.|$|E

60|$|Tarzan swung {{himself to}} the trees once more, and with swift <b>noiselessness</b> sped along high above the trail.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{with all}} the swift {{movement}} and the countless thousands rushing hither and thither, the predominant suggestion was that of luxurious ease and soft <b>noiselessness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then he who {{had sent}} them away stole silently {{to the tent}} flap and untying the {{fastenings}} entered with the <b>noiselessness</b> of a disembodied spirit.|$|E
60|$|At one {{instant he}} was {{speaking}} with me, and at the next he had vanished as completely and silently as if the waters had covered him. No Indian who ever lived could have equaled him in swiftness and <b>noiselessness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again {{she turned}} to the window, where, with the short sword, she {{commenced}} her labor of enlarging it to permit the passage of her body. The work was necessarily slow {{because of the fact that}} it must proceed with utter <b>noiselessness.</b>|$|E
60|$|Away {{then ran}} the housemaid and Menlove, {{and the young}} footman started at their heels. Round the room, over the furniture, under the furniture, through the furniture, out of one window, along the balcony, in at another window, again round the room--so they glided with the {{swiftness}} of swallows and the <b>noiselessness</b> of ghosts.|$|E
60|$|I {{know of no}} more {{delightful}} sensation {{than that}} of riding {{in one of these}} luxuriously appointed cars which skim, light and airy as feathers, along the soft, mossy avenues of Marentina. They move with absolute <b>noiselessness</b> between borders of crimson sward and beneath arching trees gorgeous with the wondrous blooms that mark so many of the highly cultivated varieties of Barsoomian vegetation.|$|E
60|$|As James ran along, at {{the heels}} of Nat, he was struck with the strangeness of the scene, and the <b>noiselessness</b> with which the band of moccasin-footed men flitted among the trees. Not a word was spoken. All had {{implicit}} confidence in their leader, the most experienced bush fighter on the frontier, and knew that, if anyone could lead them safe from the perils that surrounded them, it was Rogers.|$|E
60|$|A short space elapsed, and up {{into this}} <b>noiselessness</b> came Ahab alone from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb's long spade still {{remaining}} there after the whale's decapitation and striking it into {{the lower part of}} the half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutchwise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.|$|E
60|$|Although the Lizard {{knew that}} there was no danger of detection, yet from long habit he moved through the plant of the International Machine Company with the <b>noiselessness</b> of a disembodied spirit. Occasionally, and just for the briefest instant, he flashed his lamp ahead of him, but though he had never been in the place before he found it {{scarcely}} necessary, so minute had been his instructions for reaching the office from the fifth basement window.|$|E
60|$|Helena {{turned to}} Siegmund. He took both {{her hands and}} pressed them, whilst {{she looked at him}} with eyes blind with emotion. She was white to the lips, and heaving like the buoy {{in the wake of the}} steamer. The noise of life had {{suddenly}} been hushed, and each heart had heard for a moment the <b>noiselessness</b> of death. How everyone was white and gasping! They strove, on every hand, to fill the day with noise and the colour of life again.|$|E
60|$|The {{thought of}} the horror that his {{presence}} would arouse within her, the knowledge that she would look upon him as a terrifying monstrosity, added new fuel to the fires of hate that raged in his bosom against {{the man who had}} created him. With clenched fists, and tight set jaws the great, soulless giant moved across the dark chamber with the stealthy <b>noiselessness</b> of a tiger. Feeling before him with hands and feet he made the circuit of the room before he reached the bed.|$|E
60|$|So unnerved was he at {{the sight}} that he leaned {{up against the wall}} with his hand to his throat to stifle his {{inclination}} to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and <b>noiselessness</b> of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.|$|E
60|$|Like its master, it {{was entirely}} devoid of hair, but was of a dark slate color and {{exceeding}} smooth and glossy. Its belly was white, and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet. The feet themselves were heavily padded and nailless, which fact had {{also contributed to the}} <b>noiselessness</b> of their approach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is a characteristic feature of the fauna of Mars. The highest type of man and one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone have well-formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in existence there.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{conveyance}} particularly unsuited to such {{a season}} and weather, being nothing more substantial than an open basket-carriage drawn by a single horse. Within sat two persons, of different sexes, as could soon be discerned, {{in spite of their}} muffled attire. The man held the reins, and the lady had got some shelter from the storm by clinging close to his side. The landlord rang the hostler's bell {{to attract the attention of}} the stable-man, for the approach of the visitors had been deadened to <b>noiselessness</b> by the snow, and when the hostler had come to the horse's head the gentleman and lady alighted, the landlord meeting them in the hall.|$|E
6000|$|In the cool, crisp {{quiet of}} the evening I sought that river, and found a pile of newly gnawed sticks and twigs. The beaver works with the cold-chisel, and a few clean strokes suffice to level a four-inch bole. Across the water on the far bank glimmered, with the ghastly white of peeled dead timber, the beaver-lodge--a mass of dishevelled branches. The {{inhabitants}} had dammed the stream lower down and spread it into a nice little lake. The question was would they come out for their walk before it got too dark to see. They came--blessings on their blunt muzzles, they came--as shadows come, drifting down the stream, stirring neither foot nor tail. There were three of them. One went down to investigate {{the state of the}} dam; the other two began to look for supper. There is only one thing more startling than the <b>noiselessness</b> of a tiger in the jungle, and that is the <b>noiselessness</b> of a beaver in the water. The straining ear could catch no sound whatever till they began to eat the thick green river-scudge that they call beaver-grass. I, bowed among the logs, held my breath and stared with all my eyes. They were not ten yards from me, and they would have eaten their dinner in peace so long as I had kept absolutely still. They were dear and desirable beasts, and I was just preparing to creep a step nearer when that wicked old lady from Chicago clattered down the bank, an umbrella in her hand, shrieking: [...] "Beavers, beavers! Young man, whurr are those beavers? Good Lord! What was that now?" ...|$|E
60|$|I did not saddle or {{mount the}} animals there, but instead walked {{quietly in the}} shadows of the {{buildings}} toward an unfrequented avenue which led toward the point I had arranged to meet Dejah Thoris and Sola. With the <b>noiselessness</b> of disembodied spirits we moved stealthily along the deserted streets, but not until we were within sight of the plain beyond the city did I commence to breathe freely. I was sure that Sola and Dejah Thoris would find no difficulty in reaching our rendezvous undetected, but with my great thoats I was not so sure for myself, as it was quite unusual for warriors to leave the city after dark; in fact there was no place for them to go within any but a long ride.|$|E
6000|$|Among the frescos which told {{no story}} but their own, we were most pleased with {{one in a}} delicately painted little bed-chamber. This {{represented}} an alarmed and furtive man, whom we at once pronounced The Belated Husband, opening a door with a night-latch. Nothing could have been better than this miserable wretch's cowardly haste and cautious <b>noiselessness</b> in applying his key; apprehension sat upon his brow, confusion dwelt in his guilty eye. He had been out till {{two o'clock in the}} morning, electioneering for Pansa, the friend of the people ("Pansa, and Roman gladiators," [...] "Pansa, and Christians to the Beasts," [...] was the platform), and he had left his placens uxor at home alone with the children, and now within this door that placens uxor awaited him! ...|$|E
60|$|She came up {{and looked}} around--then {{on the other side}} of the hedge. Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an {{unexpected}} performance induced him to suspend the action for the present. The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected the plantation. It was not a bridle-path--merely a pedestrian's track, and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground, which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them. The girl, who wore no riding-habit, looked around for a moment, as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view, then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back, her head over its tail, her feet against its shoulders, and her eyes to the sky. The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher--its <b>noiselessness</b> that of a hawk. Gabriel's eyes had scarcely been able to follow her. The tall lank pony seemed used to such doings, and ambled along unconcerned. Thus she passed under the level boughs.|$|E
60|$|Softly {{drawing the}} wooden peg {{that served as}} a bolt, Gabriel entered with that <b>noiselessness</b> and caution that were {{habitual}} to him. Lighting a candle by the embers of a dying fire, he carefully looked around him. The cabin was divided into two compartments by the aid of a canvas stretched between the walls, with a flap for the doorway. On a pine table lay several garments apparently belonging to a girl of seven or eight--a frock grievously rent and torn, a frayed petticoat of white flannel already patched with material taken from a red shirt, and a pair of stockings so excessively and sincerely darned, as to have lost nearly all of their original fabric in repeated bits of relief that covered almost the entire structure. Gabriel looked at these articles ruefully, and, slowly picking them up, examined each with the greatest gravity and concern. Then he took off his coat and boots, and having in this way settled himself into an easy dishabille, he took a box from the shelf, and proceeded to lay out thread and needles, when he was interrupted by a child's voice from behind the canvas screen.|$|E
60|$|Cautiously {{he lowered}} himself {{over the edge}} of the cliff, and with utter <b>noiselessness</b> {{commenced}} the descent toward the bottom of the gulch. He stopped often and turned his keen eyes and ears in the direction of the cave's mouth at the far end of the gulch, some hundred feet away. As he neared the foot of the cliff his danger increased greatly. If he could reach the bottom and cover half the distance to the tree that stood in the center of the gulch he would feel comparatively safe for then, even if Numa appeared, he felt that he could beat him either to the cliff or to the tree, but to scale the first thirty feet of the cliff rapidly enough to elude the leaping beast would require a running start of at least twenty feet as there were no very good hand- or footholds close to the bottom--he had had to run up the first twenty feet like a squirrel running up a tree that other time he had beaten an infuriated Numa to it. He had no desire to attempt it again unless the conditions were equally favorable at least, for he had escaped Numa's raking talons by only a matter of inches on the former occasion.|$|E
6000|$|ALBERTO. Monster! (He {{goes into}} the hotel, PAUL strolls out towards the garden, {{whistling}} an air from Mozart as he goes. The window on the left opens and LUCREZIA steps on to her balcony. Uncoiled, her red hair falls almost to her waist. Her nightdress is always half slipping off one shoulder or the other, like those loose-bodied Restoration gowns that reveal the tight-blown charms of Kneller's Beauties. Her feet are bare. She is a marvellously romantic figure, as she stands there, leaning on the balustrade, and with eyes more sombre than night, gazing into the darkness. The nightingales, the bells, the guitar, and passionate voice strike up. Great stars palpitate in the sky. The moon has swum imperceptibly to the height of heaven. In the garden below flowers are yielding their souls into the air, censers invisible. It is too much, too much.... Large tears roll down LUCREZIA's cheeks and fall with a splash to the ground. Suddenly, but with the <b>noiselessness</b> of a cat, ALBERTO appears, childish-looking in pink pajamas, on {{the middle of the}} three balconies. He sees LUCREZIA, but she is much too deeply absorbed in thought to have noticed his coming, ALBERTO plants his elbows on the rail of the balcony, covers his face, and begins to sob, at first inaudibly, then in a gradual quickening crescendo. At the seventh sob LUCREZIA starts and becomes aware of his presence.) ...|$|E
6000|$|The time {{dragged on}} slowly enough, {{as it might}} well have done under the circumstances. I was waiting for something,--I had not the least idea what, or in what form it would arrive. I heard the {{quarters}} chime {{one after the other}} until one o'clock. Then at last I heard the sound of a key in the outer door of the suite. I had already poured half the syphon of soda and a fair quantity of the whiskey out of the window. I now threw myself upon the bed, closed my eyes, and did my best to simulate a heavy sleep. The person who entered the apartments came up the little outer passage until he reached the door leading into my room. I heard that softly opened. Then there was a pause, broken only by my heavy breathing. Some one was in the room, and it was some one who had learned the art of absolute <b>noiselessness.</b> I heard no footsteps,--not even a man's breathing. Suddenly there was the click of the electric light, and although I still heard nothing, I felt that some one had approached a little way towards the bed. I dared not open my eyes, but in a restless movement, which I felt I might safely make, I raised my hand to shield me, and caught a momentary glimpse of the person who was standing between me and the door. As I expected, it was Louis! He held the soda-water syphon in his hand, as though measuring its contents. I believe that he afterwards came and stood over me. I dared not open my eyes again, for I was none too good an actor, and I feared that he might not be deceived. The quantity of whiskey and soda, however, which I had apparently drunk, must have satisfied him, for he only stayed altogether about a minute in the room. Then he passed out into the sitting-room, closing the door behind him, and without noticing the open transept. I lay quite still, expecting that before long he would return. There were no signs of his coming, however, though through the transept I could see that the light in the sitting-room had been turned on. I rose softly from the bed and bolted both doors. If Louis were to make up his mind to return, it was better, after all, for him to discover that I had been deceiving him than to have him come upon me unawares! ...|$|E

5000|$|... "A {{remarkable}} {{gateway to}} the Dolomites is the majestic gorge, directly opposite Botzen, known as the Eggen Thal. This suffers nothing by comparism with the other portals. Indeed, to its extraordinary vestibule may be awarded {{the primacy of the}} picturesque. A mighty strip of porphyry, forty miles in length, thirteen in breadth and several thousand feet in height stretches along the western border of the Dolomites and its huge, purplish walls form a conspicuous feature in the landscapes near Meran and Botzen. One section of its blood-red cliffs, just east of the latter city, is perforated by a deep gash, several miles in length, from which emerges a tumultuous torrent. This gash is called the Eggen Thal. Into its sombre shadow winds a carriage road constructed at great cost and with enormous difficulty, which gradually ascends the cañon, passing beneath vast, overhanging precipices, crossing repeatedly the tortuous stream by means of massive bridges and even taking refuge within tunnels, at points where some concession to the opposition of the raging tunnels becomes essential. It is a solemn entrance, especially when one has some acquaintance with the Dolomite peaks which lie beyond, and knows what weird and awful shapes they can assume. On this account, the Eggen Thal is probably the most appropriate avenue of approach to those mysterious mountains. It is a corridor of time, that leads us from old igneous rocks, forged in the earths fiery furnace when our globe was young, to coral reefs, on which the ocean waves once broke in glittering spray, but which now sparkle in the frosty air, ten thousand feet above their early home. At times one looks up almost timidly between these jaws of ruddy porphyry toward the narrow streak of blue, so far away. It seems like a celestial river, whose <b>noiselessness,</b> limpidity and calm present a great contrast to the maddened stream beside us, as our deal of heaven differs from the storms and sorrows of this earthly life." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of quiet electric motorizations {{has led to}} a radical change in the acoustic feedback that the driver perceives in the passenger compartment. Although one might think that this <b>noiselessness</b> might improve the comfort, internal combustion engine noise is a major source of information for the driver. Even,'combination of visual, vestibular and acoustic information. To evaluate the influence of sound on motion perception, two experiments were conducted in a driving simulator. Participants were asked to accelerate or decelerate to a given target speed {{in the absence of a}} speedometer with three sound conditions: internal combustion engine, electric motorization or no sound. The results confirmed that acoustic feedback can influence motion perception, and showed that the engine noise plays a leading role in speed estimation. Without engine noise and even more without any sound, it was more difficult for the participants to precisely estimate the target speed and to keep it constant. Consequently, drivers might be forced to pay more attention to speed regulation in quiet vehicles, which might lead to an increase in their cognitive load and consequently affect their driving performance...|$|E
