40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} obtainable from a fluorescence-based measurement is limited by photobleaching: Irreversible photochemical reactions either render the molecules nonfluorescent or shift their absorption and/or emission spectra outside the working range. Photobleaching is evidenced as a decrease of fluorescence intensity with time, {{or in the case}} of single molecule measurements, as an abrupt, single-step interruption of the fluorescence emission that determines the end of the experiment. Reducing photobleaching is central for improving fluorescence (functional) imaging, single molecule tracking, and fluorescence-based biosensors and assays. In this single molecule study, we use DNA self-assembly to produce hybrid nanostructures containing individual fluorophores and gold nanoparticles at a controlled separation distance of 8. 5 nm. By changing the nanoparticles? size we are able to systematically increase the mean number of photons emitted by the fluorophores before photobleaching. Fil: Pellegrotti, Jesica Vanesa.

The goal of this research was to develop a plant-based sensor network for characterizing, monitoring, and understanding the environmental impact of TiO 2 nanoparticles. The network consisted of potted Arabidopsis thaliana with a surrounding water supply, which was monitored by cameras attached to a laptop computer running a machine learning algorithm. Using the proposed plant sensor network, we were able to examine the toxicity of TiO 2 nanoparticles in two systems: algae and terrestrial plants. Increased terrestrial plant growth was observed upon introduction of the nanoparticles, whereas algal growth decreased significantly. The proposed system can be further automated for high-throughput screening of nanoparticle toxicity in the environment at multiple trophic levels. The proposed plant-based sensor network could be used for more accurate characterization of the environmental impact of nanomaterials.

40|$|Abstract—It {{was shown}} that a wedgelike microparticle (referred to as “carrier”) {{exhibits}} a directed translational motion along the wedge cusp if it is exposed to a bath of microswimmers. Here we model this effect in detail by resolving the microswimmers explic-itly using interactionmodels with different degrees ofmutual align-ment. Using computer simulations we study {{the impact of these}} in-teractions on the transport efficiency of a V-shaped carrier. We show that the transport mechanism itself strongly depends on the degree of alignment embodied in the modeling of the individual swimmer dynamics. For weak alignment, optimal carrier trans-port occurs in the turbulent microswimmer state and is induced by swirl depletion inside the carrier. For strong aligning interac-tions, optimal transport occurs already in the dilute regime and is mediated by a polar cloud of swimmers in the carrier wake pushing the wedge-particle forward. We also demonstrate that the optimal shape of the carrier leading to maximal transport speed depends on the kind of interaction model used.

We characterize the mutual information between receiver observations to show how often independent observations can be made. We derive the maximum likelihood sequence detector to provide a lower bound on the bit error probability. We propose the family of weighted sum detectors for more practical implementation and derive their expected bit error probability. Under certain conditions, the performance of the optimal weighted sum detector is shown to be equivalent to a matched filter. Receiver simulation results show the tradeoff in detector complexity versus achievable bit error probability, and that a slow flow in any direction can improve the performance of a weighted sum detector.

40|$|Determination of {{the genetic}} code {{embedded}} in DNA molecules is fundamental to molecular biology and medicine. The most successful technique used for DNA sequencing has been the dideoxy termination mechanism developed by Sanger. Some of the main limitations of the traditional Sanger method are its relatively high cost (it heavily relies on multiple costly polymerase chain reactions), slow speed (the technique relies on gel separations), and only relatively short DNA strands can be effectively sequenced in each gel (600 - 800 bases). Alternative, faster and lower-cost methods for DNA sequencing are thus in high demand. There is a worldwide race towards a DNA sequencing technology that will cost no more than $ 1 k per human genome. Such a personal genome technology promises to revolutionize medicine.

40|$|We {{consider}} molecular communication networks {{consisting of}} transmitters and receivers distributed in a fluidic medium. In such networks, a transmitter sends {{one or more}} signalling molecules, which are diffused over the medium, to the receiver to realise the communication. In {{order to be able}} to engineer synthetic molecular communication networks, mathematical models for these networks are required. This paper proposes a new stochastic model for molecular communication networks called reaction-diffusion master equation with exogenous input (RDMEX). The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time series of signalling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and chemical reactions at the receivers are modelled as Markov processes using master equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model molecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers. For the case where the reaction kinetics at the receivers is linear, we show how RDMEX can be used to determine the mean and covariance of the receiver output signals, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean receiver output signal of the RDMEX model. These closed-form expressions reveal that the output signal of a receiver can be affected by the presence of other receivers. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the model. Comment: IEEE Transactions on <b>Nanobioscience,</b> 201...|$|R

Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate varied effect of biosynthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on normal and cancerous mammalian cells. Methods AuNP synthesized and characterized by different characterization methods, here are produced by specifically isolated Aspergillus species, which is hardly explored in precious scientific findings. These bio-synthesized AuNP are then tested by MTT assay and further confirmed by different fluorescent staining methods. Results The AuNPs synthesized here are fairly monodispersed and uniform in shape as confirmed by the relatively tall and dominant UV spectroscopy peak at 540 nm and TEM images showing round shaped particles at a magnification of 20 and 50 nm size ranges. The crystalline powder formed peaks at 2 θ angles specific for AuNPs verifying their presence and FT-IR validates presence of side groups which help in stabilization of particulates. We have clearly proved that the less toxic nature of these AuNPs on mouse fibroblasts cells and comparatively elevated inhibiting effect on cancer cells at as low as 1 µg/mL concentration of AuNP. Condensation of nucleus and damage of cells seen in fluorescent images also substantiates the results.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{receiver}} modeling in molecular communication systems. We consider the diffusive molecular communication channel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a fluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter nano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario, {{we assume that the}} entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected received signal at the receiver, i. e., the expected number of activated receptors {{on the surface of the}} receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy of the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based simulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the effect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results.

The evolutionary adaptations of kinesins and tubulins when merged generate a highly adaptable communication and infrastructure cellular network {{that is important to}} understanding specialized cell functions, human disease, and disease therapies. Here, we review the state of the field in the complex relationship of kinesin–tubulin interactions. We propose 12 mechanistic specializations of kinesins. In one category, referred to as sortability, we describe how kinesin interactions with tubulin isoforms, isotypes, or posttranslationally modified tubulins contribute to diverse cellular roles. Fourteen kinesin families have previously been described. Here, we illustrate the great depth of functional complexity that is possible in members within a single kinesin family by mechanistic specialization through discussion of the well-studied Kinesin- 14 family. This includes new roles of Kinesin- 14 in regulating supramolecular structures such as the microtubule-organizing center γ-tubulin ring complex of centrosomes. We next explore the value of an improved mechanistic understanding of kinesin–tubulin interactions in regard to human development, disease mechanisms, and improving treatments that target kinesin–tubulin complexes. The ability to combine the current kinesin nomenclature along with a more precisely defined kinesin and tubulin molecular toolbox is needed to support more detailed exploration of kinesin–tubulin interaction mechanisms including functional uniqueness, redundancy, or adaptations to new roles upon cell specialization, and to thereby accelerate applications in human health.

40|$|Advances in <b>nanobioscience</b> and {{nanomaterials}} {{have resulted}} in biological nanomachines, or bionanomachines, that can perform tasks at the molecular scale and promise novel applications {{in the areas of}} medical, biological and nano science. A key enabler for these applications is the creation of nanoscale networks or nanonetworks which will facilitate communication and collaboration between bionanomachines and communication with external networks. However, the creation of a biological nanonetwork using conventional electromagnetic communication technology is constrained by the physical scale, biological compatibility factors, and the computational limitations of the biological nanomachines. Inspired by natural biological processes, molecular communication is an emerging communication paradigm that uses biological molecules to encode and transmit information. The current research in this domain has concentrated predominantly on the physical mechanisms and channel models involved in encoding and transporting molecular encoded information in biological environments. This thesis extends this work by developing communication protocols for molecular communication nanonetworks. More speci�cally, this research maps existing networking concepts such as addressing, routing and message scheduling to biological processes and shows how these processes can be integrated with di�erent modes of molecular communication. Components from various layers of a communication protocol stack are matched to suitable molecular computing mechanisms. Nucleic acid-based molecular computing solutions are used to design and simulate protocol components for information encoding and addressing of biological molecules whereas enzyme-based molecular computing solutions are utilised for routing and switching protocol functions. The performance of neuronal nanonetworks is investigated taking into account how neuron cell characteristics a�ect message delivery. This includes a genetic algorithmbased transmission scheduling approach to ensure that signals initiated by multiple devices will successfully reach the receiver with minimum interference.

40|$|Nanomaterials {{are already}} {{used in many}} {{applications}} of science, medicine, and industry. Radioactive nanoparticles have the advantage {{that they can be}} accurately and precisely traced during each of the steps of their applications, thanks to the sensitivity of nuclear measurement techniques. There are already several protocols using radioactive nanoparticles, either for diagnosis or for therapeutic applications, combining the radioactivity (gamma or particle emitters) with the nanostructure in a single substance. In this paper, we give an overview of the scientific and technical activities devoted to the activation of nanoparticles. We have selected and investigated TiO 2, Au, CeO 2, Co, Ag, Re, Ho and C based nanomaterials. Experiments and Methods: Radioactive nanoparticles can be produced either by direct irradiation of the nanoparticles themselves or by using radioactive species as raw materials in the synthesis process. In this paper, we focus on the former production route. Direct irradiation can be performed with neutrons (in general in nuclear reactors) or with ion beams in particle accelerators (cyclotrons or LINACs). Neutron Activation: It has been observed that irradiations in nuclear reactors can damage the target nanostructure, especially if coated with organic material, due to the high gamma-radiation background. At the JRC Cyclotron, we have developed two neutron activators as an alternative to nuclear reactors for activation of nanoparticles to acceptable yields for cell/intracell uptake studies. The first activator is based on the Adiabatic Resonance Crossing concept. The neutrons are generated by protons bombarding a beryllium target. They are then slowed down in graphite and finally captured in the nanomaterial target. The second neutron activation methods is based on the thermalisation of the high neutron flux which is emitted during the daily commercial FDG production. The nanoparticles to be neutron activated are put in an appropriate neutron moderator and positioned close to the 18 F target where they can be left to increasingly activate over several days. Charged Particle Activation: The JRC cyclotron (K= 40) accelerates protons, deuterons, alphas or 3 He 2 + at variable energies. Neutron capture occurring in a nuclear reactor is comparable to the stripping reaction (d,p) in a cyclotron. In charged particles activation, therefore, nanoparticles/nanomaterials may be radiolabelled with a radioisotope of one of the target elements, though non-intrinsic radiolabels via (p,n) or other reactions may also be suitable. Results: Table 1 gives an overview on the results of the production of a variety of radioactive nanoparticles for <b>nanobioscience</b> applications carried out to date using either charged particle or neutron activations. Conclusion: Manufactured nanoparticles can be successfully radiolabelled by charged particles or neutrons in dedicated facilities developed for the purpose at the JRC Cyclotron. Sufficient nanoparticle activation yields have been achieved in the case of Au, CeO 2 and TiO 2 for subsequent in vitro biokinetic studies with different cell lines, and activation yields will be increased for other nanoparticle types for similar studies.

40|$|Researchers {{from the}} UK’s University of Bradford have raised {{concerns}} {{about the dangers of}} some tattoo inks and their potential to cause illnesses, including cancers. [1] Evidence has been found that nanoparticles from the ink can leave the skin (most likely via its dense network of blood and lymphatic vessels) and be transported to other organs of the body. Professor Tobin, Director of the University’s Centre for Skin Sciences (CSS) believes that toxins in the dyes may accumulate in the spleen or the kidneys – the organs which filter impurities from the blood. Given the enormous increase in tattooing in the last 10 years, Professor Tobin believes this is a potentially significant public health concern. Millions {{of people around the world}} are tattooed. A 2006 American study found that up to 24 % of people aged between 18 and 50 had tattoos. [2] However, still relatively little is known about the potential health consequences. This is despite a 2010 study by German scientists suggesting that millions of people in the Western world may have transient or persisting health problems after tattooing. [3] To date, much of the debate around nanomaterials in consumer products has focussed on the use of nanomaterials in sunscreen. One of the significant toxicity concerns associated with nanomaterials is their ability to produce free radicals that can damage DNA and proteins. The extent to which nanomaterials in sunscreen can penetrate the skin is still hotly debated. However, unlike sunscreens, tattoos involve the injection of chemicals such as titanium dioxide (anatase and rutile forms), aluminium oxide and carbon black directly into the dermis. This has scientists worried. A recent study, looking at a range of tattoo inks, found that the vast majority contained significant amounts of nanoparticles. [4] In particular, black pigments – those most used by tattooists - are usually made of carbon nanoparticles. Carbon black is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic to human beings, based partly on inhalation studies on rats. [5] Studies have shown that carbon black nanoparticles can cause inflammation and damage DNA. [6] This damage is believed to be due to free radical production. Furthermore, studies confirm that nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and carbon black are more toxic and generate free radicals to a greater extent than larger particles of the same chemicals. [7] Scientists are now suggesting that free radical production could be the cause of the high prevalence of symptoms such as swelling and itching reported by individuals with tattoos. In one study eighty-five per cent of complaints were related to black tattoos and fifty-eight per cent of these were induced by exposure to sunlight. [8] Alarmingly, given their potential toxicity, it appears that tattoo inks are not as stable in the skin as one might think. A German study which investigated the fate of tattoo ink injected into the skin of mice, found that 32 % of the pigment had disappeared 42 days after the injection. [9] Whilst larger particles are caught in the lymph nodes, studies with rats have shown that nanoparticles pass directly into the blood stream and can come to rest anywhere in the body. [10] A 2009 Chinese study injected either silver nanoparticles or microparticles into the skin of rats. The researchers found that, whilst the microparticles could not reach the bloodstream, the nanoparticles did and then were distributed to the major organs - especially the kidney, liver, spleen, brain and lung. [11] The liver and spleen are believed to be the organs most likely to accumulate nanomaterials. Nanoparticles are by no means the only potentially dangerous ingredients in tattoo inks. Solid science shows that many of the inks used in tattoos contain carcinogens. [12] This means people are having cancer-producing particles injected directly into their skin. Many tattoo ink pigments also decompose in the presence of sunlight to form toxic chemicals – some of which are known or suspected human carcinogens. [13] Surprisingly therefore a clear link between tattoos and skin cancer has yet to be identified. Removal might not be the best option Counter-intuitively, attempting to remove tattoos could actually increase any potential risks. Lasers are often used to remove tattoos which shatter the pigments, making the particles unstable and more likely to flow into the body’s lymph system, and - if they are small enough - into the blood stream. Scientists are concerned that if these settle in an area, the harm could build slowly and only declare itself decades later, perhaps in the form of a cancer. In Australia, our chemical regulator NICNAS (National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme) claims it assesses industrial chemicals - including those in tattoo inks - that are new to Australia for their health and environmental effects prior to their use. However this is not the case for nano versions of existing chemicals. In 2004, the UK Royal Society argued that nanomaterials have completely different properties to bulk forms of the same chemicals and should undergo proper safety assessments before they are allowed in consumer products. NICNAS introduced regulation of nano forms of new chemicals in 2011, but has yet to introduce regulation for nano forms of existing chemicals such as titanium dioxide, aluminium oxide and carbon black. This means that these chemicals are being injected into peoples’ bodies without even basic safety testing. • Author: Louise Sales: Nanotechnology Project Coordinator, Friends of the Earth, Hobart.
