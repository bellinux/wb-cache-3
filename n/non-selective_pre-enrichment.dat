The purpose of the following studies was to evaluate three selected diagnostic and intervention strategies for the potential to improve the microbiological quality of poultry meat with regard to Salmonella contamination. Sampling methodologies were evaluated and compared for sensitivity of Salmonella detection on commercially processed poultry carcasses. Additionally, this same study evaluated potential sites of Salmonella contamination and cross-contamination during specific stages of processing. Another study evaluated the benefit of <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> for the detection of low levels of sublethally injured Salmonella enteritidis. The final study investigated the use of a combination of d-limonene and citric acid for the ability to remove Salmonella enteritidis from commercially processed poultry skin. Swab, skin, and carcass rinse samples were obtained from commercially processed poultry carcasses at selected stages within a commercial processing plant. In these studies, culture of excised skin from the ventral aspect of the thoracic inlet was determined to be equal in sensitivity to carcass rinse for the detection of Salmonella. Culture of cotton swabs used to manually swab a similar area in the thoracic inlet region was not effective for detection of Salmonella. These experiments also provided evidence that the site of chill immersion could be a major source for cross-contamination between negative and positive flocks. In order to evaluate the benefit of <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment,</b> a standard <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> method followed by selective enrichment was compared to a direct selective enrichment method for the ability to detect sublethally injured Salmonella. While a marginal advantage of the <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> method was observed, either culture procedure was capable of detecting injured Salmonella at levels incapable of infecting neonatal chicks. In the study designed to evaluate a combined treatment of d-limonene and citric acid for Salmonella decontamination, the combined treatment was effective in causing 8 to I 0 -fold reductions in recoverable Salmonella from processed poultry thigh skin following 30 s exposure at 26 C. Increasing the temperature from 26 C to 55 C resulted in approximately-' 30 -fold reductions in recoverable Salmonella. Possible effects on carcass quality and consumer acceptability remain to be determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of Salmonella enterica serotypes remains a highly important public health concern for microbiological analysis of foods, feeds, and clinical samples. Outbreaks of human salmonellosis are sometimes linked to contact with infected animals and animal feeds. To possibly {{reduce the number}} of outbreaks, it is important to rapidly, efficiently detect Salmonella enterica in animal feeds and food products. A multiplex PCR for molecular serotyping of Salmonella enterica previously used in a single lab validation study for serotyping in multiple human food matrices was used in this investigation {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the multiplex PCR assay as serotyping method and screening tool for Salmonella in animal feeds. This approach is unique in that: • The multiplex PCR serotyping assay may be used for rapid screening and serotyping of Salmonella enterica from contaminated animal feed at the <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> step. • The assay may provide the serotype or {{identification of}} Salmonella in positive samples at concentration as low as 10 CFU/ 25  g after a 24  h <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> step. • In addition to the ability to serotype, this assay contains invA as an internal control for Salmonella positive identification. The invA shows positive indication for Salmonella outside of the 30 serotypic banding patterns...|$|E
40|$|The central goal of {{food safety}} policy in the European Union (EU) is to protect {{consumer}} health by guaranteeing a high level {{of food safety}} throughout the food chain. This goal can in part be achieved by testing foodstuffs for the presence of various chemical and biological hazards. The aim {{of this study was to}} facilitate food safety testing by providing rapid and user-friendly methods for the detection of particular food-related hazards. Heterogeneous competitive time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays were developed for the detection of selected veterinary residues, that is coccidiostat residues, in eggs and chicken liver. After a simplified sample preparation procedure, the immunoassays were performed either in manual format with dissociation-enhanced measurement or in automated format with pre-dried assay reagents and surface measurement. Although the assays were primarily designed for screening purposes providing only qualitative results, they could also be used in a quantitative mode. All the developed assays had good performance characteristics enabling reliable screening of samples at concentration levels required by the authorities. A novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay system was developed for the detection of Salmonella spp. in food. The sample preparation included a short <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> step, after which the target cells were collected with immunomagnetic beads and applied to PCR reaction vessels containing all the reagents required for the assay in dry form. The homogeneous PCR assay was performed with a novel instrument platform, GenomEra ™, and the qualitative assay results were automatically interpreted based on end-point time-resolved fluorescence measurements and cut-off values. The assay was validated using various food matrices spiked with sub-lethally injured Salmonella cells at levels of 1 - 10 colony forming units (CFU) / 25 g of food. The main advantage of the system was the exceptionally short time to result; the entire process starting from the pre-enrichment and ending with the PCR result could be completed in eight hours. In conclusion, molecular methods using state-of-the-art assay techniques were developed for food safety testing. The combination of time-resolved fluorescence detection and ready-to-use reagents enabled sensitive assays easily amenable to automation. Consequently, together with the simplified sample preparation, these methods could prove to be applicable in routine testing...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} {{occurring in}} foods cause various human illnisses. Standard methods {{for the detection}} of pathogenic microorganisms are time consuming (e. g. the determination of Salmonella in a food sample takes more than 5 days). In the food industry and health service there is a demand for a rapid pathogen detection method. The aim of this work was to develop a rapid method {{for the detection of}} Salmonella in food samples. The first step of the process optimisation was the connection of <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment</b> of bacteria and filtration. Various materials were tested for the construction of the filtration bag, which would allow to passage the bacteria into the cultivation medium {{and at the same time}} avoid releasing of food particles. Usage of a polyamide material with pores of defined size for the construction of filtration bags was not successful. Better results were obtained with materials of paper with polyethylene (used for production of tea bags), or filtration membranes of commercially produced homogenisation bags (A. E. S. Laboratoire). The cultivation time required for filtration pre-enrichment was estimated to seven hours. Optimisation of shortened cultivation procedure for Salmonella enrichment in food samples was evaluated. Both the addition of iron compounds to buffered peptone water and the growth in various selective media did not enhance the growth rate of Salmonella cells significantly. Commercial kits for the shortened enrichment of Salmonella cells did not fulfil the demand for efficacy of selectivity. Good results were obtained using a combination of shortened enrichment in buffered peptone water followed by selective cultivation in Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was chosen for the final specific detection of Salmonella. Primers were prepared according to sequences of the chromosomal gene invA and plasmid gene spvC. PCR is often inhibited by compounds from food matrices. To prevent this inhibition it is necessary to separate target bacteria or DNA from the sample. After the enrichment of bacteria from food sample the following separation methods were applied: immunomagnetic separation using anti-Salmonella Dynabeads (Dynal), two-step centrifugation, magnetic separation of DNA using Dynabeads DNA Direct (Dynal) and centrifugation on sucrose layer. Results differed according to the composition of sample food matrices. Immunomagnetic separation was not successful when applied to samples with high contents of fat and competitive microflora. Centrifugation methods provided good results for meat and egg samples. The optimised protocol including shortened non-selective enrichment in buffered peptone water, selective enrichment in Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium, two-step centrifugation and final detection by PCR was applied on real food samples. The reached sensitivity of the method were units of Salmonella cells added to 25 g of food sample. Positive determination of Salmonella occurrence in entrails of infected animals was achieved by this method. Real-time fluorescence PCR was used for determination of Salmonella in samples of minced meat and chicken carcass rinse. The efficacy of four separation methods for sample pre-treatment before PCR was compared: gradient centrifugation using BactxtractorTM solution (Quintessence Research AB), magnetic separation of DNA using Dynabeads DNA Direct (Dynal), DNA isolation by DNeasyTM Tissue kit (Qiagen) and the combination of BactxtractorTM with DNeasyTM Tissue kit. BactxtractorTM and DNeasyTM Tissue kit provided reproducible results with the required sensitivity. Results obtained during this work can be exploited for the automation of food pathogen detection by PCR. This could be used in the future for routine determinations allowing detection time to be shortened to just one dayAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented here is to investigate presence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in turkey flocks and personnel on the respective farms. MRSA For evidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), cloaca and trachea swab samples were taken from a total of 200 turkeys and dust samples from 20 turkey houses as well as swab samples from the noses of 59 personnel on the respective farms. The investigations were conducted according to Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) guidelines based on Commission Decision 2008 / 55 /EG {{using a combination of}} <b>non-selective</b> <b>pre-enrichment,</b> selective enrichment and subsequent cultivation on a selective, chromogenic agar plate (Anon, 2008 a; BfR, 2009). The identification of genus and species was by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and mecA gene detection via real-time PCR. In conclusion, the isolate carrying the mecA gene was molecularbiologically characterised via spa and SCCmec typing. In each isolate of every identified spa type the MLST type was additionally determined. MRSA could be detected in 71. 5 % (143 from 200) of the examined turkeys in a total of 90 %(18 from 20) of the farms. In all 18 of the positive farms the dust swab samples always tested positive for MRSA. In this way testing for MRSA bacteria presence in turkey flocks can be simplified with sufficient reliability through collecting dust swab samples. 90. 2 % of the MRSApositive birds could be identified through a trachea swab sample alone. This enables identification of MRSA presence with individual birds through testing the trachea sample only. In addition to MRSA bacteria, MRS/SA (methicillin-resistant staphylococci, with exception of S. aureus) bacteria were also present on 11 of the farms. These results showed that the examined turkeys were not only substantially infected with MRSA bacteria but also – although to a clearly lesser extent – with MRS/SA bacteria. From the 59 personnel examined via nose swab sampling, 22 of them (37. 3 %) were shown to be MRSA carriers and eight (13. 5 %) to be carriers of MRS/SA. Looking at the detection of MRSA {{in the light of the}} frequency of stay in the turkey stables so was the chance of colonization with MRSA in people who were regularly in turkey stables clearly increased, compared to people, who were rarely or never in turkey stables (OR = 3. 43). MRSA isolates belonging to the sequence type ST 398 and, with that, the livestock-associated MRSA (laMRSA), were always isolated from the tested people and isolated in the majority of the cases from the tested turkeys. VRE For detecting VRE bacteria in this study, cloaca swab samples were taken from 200 living turkeys and dust swab samples from 20 turkey houses as well as nose swab samples from 59 humans. The detection of VRE bacteria was carried out using the method described by Ellerbroek et al. (2004). This combines an enrichment procedure using Chromocult® enteroccoci broth with subsequent cultivation of a selective agar supplemented with vancomycin. The identification of the enterococci took place with the help of biochemical parameters according to Ruoff et al. (2003) and real-time PCR was applied for identifying the vanA, vanB 1 / 2 / 3 and vanC 2 / 3 resistance genes. VRE bacteria could be identified in 27 % (54 from 200) of the examined turkeys in total 75 % (15 from 20) of the examined feeding farms. At 93. 3 % of the positive flocks was the pooled swab dust sample VRE-positive. The spectrum of detected VRE resistance genes was limited in the study presented here to only the vanA gene (17. 6 %, 12 from 68) and the vanC 1 gene (82. 4 %, 56 from 68). The resistance genes vanB 1 / 2 / 3 and vanC 2 / 3 which were also tested for, could not be detected in the investigations. Although VRE bacteria could be detected in a high proportion of dust samples, VRE bacteria were not isolated from the nose swab samples from any of the 59 persons sampled...|$|E
