50|$|Under certain circumstances, {{valuation}} of inventory based on cost is impractical. If {{the market price}} of a good drops below the purchase price, the lower of cost or market method of valuation is recommended. This method allows declines in inventory value to be offset against income of the period. When goods are damaged or obsolete, and can only be sold for below purchase prices, they should be recorded at <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value.</b> The <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> is the estimated selling price less any expense incurred {{to dispose of the}} good.|$|E

As an example, if a taxpayer has a home worth $100,000 and owes $50,000 on the home, the IRS will calculate the <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> equity in the asset as follows: ($100,000 x [...]80) - $50,000 = $30,000.

50|$|<b>Net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> (NRV) is {{a method}} of {{evaluating}} a fixed or current asset's worth when held in inventory, {{in the field of}} accounting. NRV is part of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that apply to valuing inventory, so as to not overstate or understate the value of inventory goods. <b>Net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> is generally equal to the selling price of the inventory goods less the selling costs (completion and disposal). Therefore, it is expected sales price less selling costs (e.g. repair and disposal costs). NRV prevents overstating or understating of an assets value. NRV is the price cap when using the Lower of Cost or Market Rule.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{possible}} values can represent the market value: the replacement {{cost of the}} inventory, the <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> (also known as the [...] "ceiling"), and the [...] "floor" [...] (the difference between the <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> and the normal profit). In the lower of cost or market approach, companies must determine these three values and find the median of the values. The companies then compare the median value, which is called the designated market value, to the inventory cost that is recorded. The lower of these two values is subsequently reported on the balance sheet. Because the lower of cost or market approach requires companies to use three possible market values, the companies' financial statements {{can be difficult to}} compare.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of fruits maturity stages at harvest on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility and in sacco degradability of Ficus surfruits (FSF). The treatments involved different maturity stages of Ficus sur fruits. Color, moisture content, and texture were used to distinguish among the fruit maturity stages. Fruits at early, mid, and late stages of maturity were collected from five trees and analyzed. The proximate composition of the fruits varied only slightly (0 to 3 %) with the progress in maturity of the fruits. The exception was the DM content which increased from 45 to 87 % with increasing maturity. The condensed tannins were low (< 2 %) for all the stages of maturity. In vitro and in sacco measurements indicated that the fruits at all stages of maturity were theoretically only slightly inferior to cereal grains as sources of digestible energy. However, the high washing loss in the in sacco study (38 to 42 %) indicates that much of the digestible carbohydrate was in the form of soluble sugars which, depending on the levels used in the diet, could compromise the <b>realizable</b> <b>net</b> energy <b>value</b> of the diet.

" The issues are: 1.

However, any downward revision in the book values of the assets is immediately written off to the Profit & Loss account. Under IFRS, an asset {{is considered to be}} impaired (and is thus written down) if its carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset's value in use (present value of future values) or <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might default on payment, accounts receivable have to be recorded at <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value.</b> The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called Allowance for doubtful accounts. At the end of each accounting cycle, adjusting entries are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense.

40|$|We {{describe}} a design methodology for modifying the {{refractive index profile}} of graded-index optical instruments that incorporate singularities or zeros in their refractive index. The process maintains the device performance whilst resulting in graded profiles that are all-dielectric, do not require materials with unrealistic values, and that are impedance matched to the bounding medium. This is achieved by transmuting the singularities (or zeros) using the formalism of transformation optics, but with an additional boundary condition requiring the gradient of the co- ordinate transformation be continuous. This additional boundary condition ensures that the device is impedance matched to the bounding medium when the spatially varying permittivity and permeability profiles are scaled to <b>realizable</b> <b>values.</b> We demonstrate the method in some detail for an Eaton lens, before describing the profiles for an "invisible disc" and "multipole" lenses.

This paper provides a rigorous proof that 'recoverable cost' is the observed measurement property underlying financial accounting measurement. This analysis draws upon: (a) the concept of recovery underlying the investment decision and (b) the distinction between decision theory and measurement theory.

In the context of production, a by-product is the 'output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> (NRV) {{when compared with the}} main products'. Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as 'other income' or as a reduction of joint production processing costs when the by-product is produced.

With regard to joint costs, it is essential to allocate the joint cost for the different joint products for determining individual product costs. Several methods are used to allocate joint cost. These methods are mainly classified onto engineering and non-engineering methods. Non engineering methods are mainly based on the market share of the product; the higher market share, the higher proportion assigned to it e.g. <b>net</b> <b>realizable</b> <b>value.</b> In this method, the proportions are determined based on the sales value proportions.

Findings â In particular, the models suggest that reducing the tax rate on capital gains does not always benefit bondholders and shareholders. For common stock the changes in both market <b>value</b> and <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> depend not only on the change in tax rate, but also on the growth rate of the dividend stream.
