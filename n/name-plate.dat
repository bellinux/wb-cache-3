25|$|Life {{was founded}} January 4, 1883, in a New York City artist's studio at 1155 Broadway, as a {{partnership}} between John Ames Mitchell and Andrew Miller. Mitchell held a 75 per cent interest in the magazine with the remainder by Miller. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths. Miller served as secretary-treasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing {{the business side of}} the operation. Mitchell, a 37-year-old illustrator who used a $10,000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine, served as its publisher. Mitchell created the first Life <b>name-plate</b> with cupids as mascots; he later drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil. Mitchell took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using zinc-coated plates, which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork. This edge helped because Life faced stiff competition from the best-selling humor magazines Judge and Puck, which were already established and successful. Edward Sandford Martin was brought on as Lifes first literary editor; the recent Harvard University graduate was a founder of the Harvard Lampoon.|$|E

6000|$|Well, {{that was}} a very good {{business}} for the evening. The people all went away because the demon was gone away, and the circus was over, and Sina was allowed to sleep. But the trouble came after. There had been an evil spirit in that room and his name was Tu. No one could say when he might come back again; they all voted it was Tu much; and now Talolo and Sina have had to be lodged in the Soldier Room.[24] As for the little room by the stable, there it stands empty; it is too small to play soldiers in, and I do not {{see what we can do}} with it, except to have a nice brass <b>name-plate</b> engraved in Sydney, or in [...] "Frisco," [...] and stuck upon the door of it--Mr. Tu.|$|E
6000|$|Powell Street, {{that happy}} hunting-ground of my youth, had changed its character, become {{contracted}} and unfamiliar, sooty. The McAlerys and other older families {{who had not}} decayed with the neighbourhood were rapidly deserting it, moving out to the new residence district known as [...] "the Heights." [...] I came to the Willett House. That, too, had an air of shabbiness,--of well-tended shabbiness, to be sure; the stone steps had been scrupulously scrubbed, {{but one of them}} was cracked clear across, and the silver on the polished <b>name-plate</b> was wearing off; even the act of pulling the knob of a door-bell was becoming obsolete, so used had we grown to pushing porcelain buttons in bright, new vestibules. As I waited for my summons to be answered it struck me as remarkable that neither Nancy nor her father had been contaminated by the shabbiness that surrounded them.|$|E

Between 1938 (November) - 1945, the future Petržalka borough was occupied by Nazi Germany, and from October 1938 to April 1945, the future Devín borough was part of the Lower Austria area of the German Third Reich. After the break-up of Czechoslovakia, Bratislava became the capital of the First Slovak Republic in 1939. Until 1945, most of the approximately city's 15,000 Jews were expelled and sent into concentration camps. The Bratislava oil district included the Apollo oil refinery and was bombed on 9 September 1944 during the German occupation. The Soviet Red Army took Bratislava on 4 April 1945.|$|R
5000|$|Gulab Bagh, {{also known}} as Sajjan Niwas Garden, was built by Maharana Sajjan Singh in the 1881. It is the fourth oldest zoo in the semi-continent. It spans across 66 acres of land, and is hailed {{as one of the}} most {{beautiful}} and largest garden in Rajasthan. [...] By Maharana's volition, a horticulturist from Madras, T.H. Story, was appointed in 1882 to stock the garden with plants with medicinal values on the 66.5 acres of land and worked there till 1920.The garden consisted of a Lotus Pond, and many prominent trees that included many species of mangoes, guava, grapes, lemon, bor, mulbury, rayan, pomegranate, bananas, sapota, tamarind, bullock’s heart (ramphal), lichi, arjun trees, wood apple, karonda, campher, citron, jamun, pummelo, meetha neem, kargi lime, ficus species, anola, jack fruit, dhanverjia, grandi flora, jasmin, dawood etc.In the year 1882, all the trees had their <b>name-plates</b> denoting Hindi, English, and systematic botanical names, which are not the same now.A small pond existed in the garden before it was demolished for the construction of Water works complex. In this pond a water lily, Victoria sp., was initially planted. The leaf of Victoria could withstand a child on a chair kept on it, a property common to all the water-lilies of the genus due to plant's structure.|$|R
60|$|In {{the better}} {{parts of the}} most {{interesting}} city there is apt to be a touch of the commonplace. It is in the slums and suburbs that the city dilettante finds his game. And there is nothing more characteristic and original than the outlying quarters of San Francisco. The Chinese district is the most famous; but it is far from the only truffle in the pie. There is many another dingy corner, many a young antiquity, many a terrain vague with that stamp of quaintness that the city lover seeks and dwells on; and the indefinite prolongation of its streets, up hill and down dale, makes San Francisco a place apart. The same street in its career visits and unites so many different classes of society, here echoing with drays, there lying decorously silent between the mansions of Bonanza millionaires, to founder at last among the drifting sands beside Lone Mountain cemetery, or die out among the sheds and lumber of the north. Thus you may be struck with a spot, set it down for the most romantic of the city, and, glancing at the <b>name-plate,</b> find it is in the same street that you yourself inhabit in another quarter of the town.|$|E

They partially withdrew from the oil-shocked Texas and southern Florida markets in 1989-1990 after the 1986 May/ADG merger. After May assumed ownership, ADG's Hahne's division (several New Jersey locations) and several former John Wanamaker (Philadelphia) locations were combined under the Lord & Taylor <b>name-plate.</b> From 1997-2006, Lord & Taylor occupied the former Wanamaker's landmark store in downtown Philadelphia.

Eva-Maria’s parents, Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Neckermann, were also present.During the dinner it started to rain and Hermann Duckek asked if he was allowed to put a water-glass outside to measure how much rain had fallen. After 30 minutes the glass was totally full. Hermann Duckek returned to the stadium as darkness was falling. The recently built stadium, built under Canadian management and to a Canadian concept design, had hilly surroundings and no illumination. For the competition area itself, some 35 m x 75 m, Hermann Duckek had used rocks, plants, flowers, and as a special tribute to emphasize the beauty of Canadian Nature, he used large wooden chips to decorate the Judge boxes. Standing on one of the hills in the stadium, Hermann Duckek could not believe his own eyes. The drainage didn’t work and, worst of all, “his” wooden chips were drifting all over this newborn “lake”. Concerned about the heavy rain, other stadium personnel arrived. In the darkness head lights illuminated a ghostly scene. It took considerable time for the “lake” to drain and it took many hours to replace the wooden chips.The competition, and the worldwide TV-transmission started the next day with only 2 hours delay.
