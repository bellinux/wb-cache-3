We {{investigate}} the non-linear interaction {{of a strong}} Gravitational Wave with the plasma during {{the collapse of a}} massive magnetized star to form a black hole, or during the merging of neutron star binaries (central engine). We found that under certain conditions this coupling may result in an efficient energy space diffusion of particles. We suggest that the atmosphere created around the central engine is filled with 3 -D magnetic <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets</b> (magnetic nulls). We demonstrate that the passage of strong pulses of Gravitational Waves through the magnetic <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets</b> accelerates electrons to very high energies. We conclude that in several astrophysical events, gravitational pulses may accelerate the tail of the ambient plasma to very high energies and become the driver for many types of astrophysical bursts.

However the lower charge in brucite's magnesium (+2) as opposed to gibbsite's aluminium (+3) does not require that one third of the octahedrons be vacant of a central ion in order to maintain a <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet.</b> The different symmetry of gibbsite and brucite is due to the different way that the layers are stacked.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} of gibbsite is interesting and {{analogous to the}} basic {{structure of}} the micas. The basic structure forms stacked sheets of linked octahedrons of aluminium hydroxide. The octahedrons are composed of aluminium ions with a +3 charge bonded to six octahedrally coordinated hydroxides with a -1 charge. Each of the hydroxides is bonded to only two aluminium atoms because one third of the octahedrons are vacant a central aluminium. The result is a <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> since +3/6 = +1/2 (+3 charge on the aluminiums divided by six hydroxide bonds times the number of aluminiums) and -1/2 = -1/2 (-1 charge on the hydroxides divided between only two aluminiums); thus the charges cancel. The lack of a charge on the gibbsite sheets means that there is no charge to retain ions between the sheets and act as a [...] "glue" [...] to keep the sheets together. The sheets are only held together by weak residual bonds and this results in a very soft easily cleaved mineral.|$|E
40|$|The {{observable}} spatio-temporal {{characteristics of}} the energy release in flares and their association with the magnetic environment and tracers of field dynamics are reviewed.

The small spatial scale of these events and the high anisotropy of the particle flux suggest local acceleration. The spectra of the particles, which are cut off at equal energy per charge, suggest acceleration through an electric field. The possibility that these events {{have their origin in}} active magnetic <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets</b> in the shocked solar wind is examined...|$|R

50|$|Although {{spacecraft}} have travelled {{many times}} in the inner and outer orbit of Earth since the 1960s, the spacecraft ATS 5 was the first major plasma experiment performed that could reliably determine the existence of radial injections driven by interchange motions. The analysis revealed the frequent injection of a hot plasma cloud is injected inward during a substorm in the outer layers of the magnetosphere et al. 1971. The injections occur predominantly in the night-time hemisphere, being associated with the depolarization of the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> configuration in the tail regions of the magnetosphere. This paper then implies that Earth’s magnetotail region is a major mechanism in which the magnetosphere stores and releases energy through the interchange mechanism.The interchange instability also has been found to have a limiting factor on the night side plasmapause thickness et al. 1990. In this paper, the plasmapause is found to be near the geosynchronous orbit in which the centrifugal and gravitational potential cancel exactly. This sharp change in plasma pressure associated with the plasma pause enables this instability. A mathematical treatment comparing the growth rate of the instability with the thickness of the plasmapause boundary revealed that the interchange instability limits the thickness of the boundary.|$|E

All data in the aberrated GSM (geocentric solar magnetospheric) coordinate system are normalized to the same solar wind pressure 2 nPa and downtail distance X ∼ − 20 R E. Our results show characteristics of the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet,</b> as follows. (1)  The <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> assumes {{a greater degree of}} curve in the YZ cross section when the dipole tilt increases, the Earth dipole tilt angle affects the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> configuration not only in the YZ cross section but also in the XY cross section, and the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> assumes a more significant degree of tilt in the XY cross section when the dipole tilt increases. (2)  Counterclockwise twisting of the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> with 3. 10 ° is observed, looking along the downtail direction, for the positive interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B Y with a value of 3 to 8 nT, and clockwise twisting of the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> with 3. 37 ° for the negative IMF B Y with a value of − 8 to − 3 nT, and a northward IMF can result in a greater twisting of the near-tail <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> than southward.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{asymptotic}} method of resolution of the two-dimensional equilibrium equation of collisionless plasmas described by the Maxwell–Vlasov equations. This method differs from the classical one proposed by K. Schindler [Earth's Magnetospheric Processes (ed. B. M. McCormac). Norwood, MA: Reidel, 1972, pp. 200 – 209. ] since we consider free-boundary plasmas. Our method is a generalization of the usual multiscale asymptotic developments. The first-approximation asymptotic solutions are found from the elimination of increasing and singular terms in the next approximation. We apply the method to the mathematical description of nonlinear structures that may form in <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets.</b> Particular solutions describing localized plasmoids (O-point configuration) as well as X-point magnetic configurations are obtained.

40|$|The visible corona of the Sun {{appears to}} be heated by direct {{dissipation}} of magnetic fields. The magnetic fields in the visible corona are tied at both ends to the photosphere where the active convection continually rotates and shuffles the footpoints in a random pattern. The twisting and wrapping of flux tubes about each other produce magnetic <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets</b> {{in a state of}} dynamical nonequilibrium such that the current sheets become increasingly concentrated with the passage of time. Dissipation of the high current densities takes place regardless of the high electrical conductivity of the fluid. The convection on the feet of the lines of force at the surface of the Sun goes directly (within a matter of 10 to 20 hours) into heat in the corona. The rate of doing work seems adequate to supply the necessary 10 to the 7 th power ergs/square cm. sec for the active corona...|$|R

Stress balance in the first two cases requires that the ratios h/LX and BZ/BX be of the same order of magnitude, where h is the half-thickness of the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet,</b> LX is the length scale for variations along the axis of the tail, and BZ and BX are the magnetic field components in the plasma sheet just outside the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet.</b> The second case requires, in addition, that the plasma flow speed within the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> be of the order of or larger than the Alfven speed outside the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet.</b> Stress balance in the third case requires that just outside the <b>neutral</b> <b>sheet</b> the plasma pressure obey the marginal firehose stability condition...|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of remote sensing techniques which measure the electric field component transverse {{to the line}} of sight and achieve a sensitivity range of 5 - 10 V/cm. Three models are shown to predict quasistatic, macroscopic values of E(parallel), the electric field component parallel to the magnetic vector, beyond the sensitivity range considered. These processes are: the discharge model of flares; the models of return currents related to flare particle beams; and the models of <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets</b> related to two-ribbon flares and postflare loops. Time dependent electric fields related to MHD and plasma waves, and to plasma disturbance, may allow the detection of both E components (parallel and perpendicular). The uncertainty relating to the emission measures, time scales, volumes, and plasma conditions of these flares and electrified plasma volumes is emphasized. It is pointed out, however, that important information can be obtained by observing electric fields at existing sensitivity levels. By measuring these E-fields, the understanding of flares and related dynamic events can be improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium of a large-scale magnetic field embedded in a fluid with infinite electrical conductivity is considered. It is pointed out that {{a necessary condition for}} static equilibrium is the invariance of the small-scale pattern in the field along the large-scale direction. A varying topological pattern implies that no fluid pressure distribution exists for which the field is everywhere static. Magnetic <b>neutral</b> <b>sheets</b> form, and dynamical reconnection of the field takes place. It is shown here that the invariance is also a sufficient condition for the existence of a fluid pressure distribution producing static equilibrium. Even in the simplest cases, however, the requirements on the fluid pressure are extreme and, a priori, are unlikely. It is concluded that almost all twisted flux tubes packed together produce dynamical nonequilibrium and dissipation of their twisting. This is the basic effect underlying the long-standing conjecture that the shuffling of the footpoints of the bipolar magnetic fields in the sun is responsible for heating the active corona. Attention is then given to the consequences of this general dynamical dissipation in the magnetic fields that produce the active corona of the sun.
