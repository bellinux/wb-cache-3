50|$|Millett J {{held that}} the {{administrator}} had not unfairly prejudiced the creditors, and rejected that the standard of care had been breached. This was, in substance, an action for professional negligence. The administrator owed a duty to a company to obtain a proper price for assets, {{the same as for}} anybody with a power to sell property that does not belong to him (such as a mortgagee, as in Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd 1971 Ch 949). He ‘must take reasonable care in choosing the time at which to sell the property. His duty is ‘to take reasonable care to obtain the best price that the circumstances permit, as in Standard Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker 1982 1 WLR 1410. But that only meant ‘the best prices that circumstances as he reasonably perceives them to be permit. He is not made liable because his perception is wrong, unless it is unreasonable.’ Professional <b>negligence</b> <b>principles</b> did apply to professional insolvency practitioners, which administrators must be. This was to be judged by the standard of ‘an ordinary, skilled practitioner.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought that the}} Uniform Commercial Code adopts a <b>negligence</b> <b>principle</b> {{as the basis of}} loss allocation for the check system. This article argues that this common assumption is wrong. Instead, the fundamental principle of the check system and all other payment systems is that the burden of unpreventable losses should rest with the providers of the payment system rather than with the users of the payment system. The article shows that the old English case of Price v. Neal is not, as {{is commonly}} thought, an anomaly but is instead entirely consistent with the basic principle of loss allocation for the check system. The article suggests that a correct understanding of the basic principle of loss allocation has significant implications for the enforceability of agreements between customers and banks concerning checking accounts. Specifically, an approach that appears to be emerging in recent cases concerning forged facsimile signatures on checks can be seen to be fundamentally misguided. checks, forgery, facsimile signature,...|$|R

And, according to what is here called the “Intoxication Negligence Principle,” a defendant who is unaware of a condition thanks to voluntary intoxication is to be compared to a sober reasonable person when we ask whether his obliviousness was reasonable. When applied in tandem, as these principles often are, a defendant whose mental state is not criminal at all, considered independently of the recent history of intoxication that gave rise to it, will be treated as though he were reckless. Through a proposed model that illuminates the nature of both recklessness and negligence, this paper identifies a set of conditions under which it is justified to employ the Intoxication Recklessness Principle, even in conjunction with the Intoxication <b>Negligence</b> <b>Principle.</b> When the relevant conditions are met, the voluntarily intoxicated negligent defendant is in a mental state that is just as bad as many reckless defendants. This paper, then, defends the law’s current use of the Intoxication Recklessness Principle, but with qualifications, for in identifying the conditions in which the principle is justifiably employed; conditions are also identified in which it is not...|$|R

40|$|In 1990, the Minnesota Legislature {{amended the}} Civil Damage Act {{to allow for}} common law tort claims against persons 21 years old or older who knowingly provide alcohol to a person under 21 years of age. The 1990 {{amendment}} is unique because the legislature in effect appears to be releasing its stranglehold on liquor liability law, permitting the courts to apply common law <b>negligence</b> <b>principles</b> under the defined circumstances, but without providing any guidelines {{as to how the}} common law remedy should be formulated. The interpretive problems the amendment creates will eventually have to be resolved by the courts. The purpose of this Article is to examine those interpretive problems, and proceeds in four parts. Part II provides a backdrop for the examination of common law claims arising out of furnishing or providing alcohol to another and discusses the legislative intent in adopting subdivision 6. Part III analyzes the statutory window the legislature used to open up common law liability. Because common law <b>negligence</b> <b>principles</b> may be imposed only where a person twenty-one years of age or older has knowingly provided or furnished liquor to a person under the age of twenty-one, questions will arise concerning the interpretation of the term “knowingly,” and the meaning of the terms “provided or furnished. ” Part IV focuses on the potential constitutional problems that may be created by the 1990 amendment because it permits the imposition of liability against social hosts according to standards that are different from those that apply to commercial vendors of alcohol. More specifically, the issue is whether the split in standards will give rise to an equal protection claim of the same strength that caused the Minnesota Supreme Court in Wegan v. Village of Lexington to hold that the split standards that were the product of its decision in Trail were unconstitutional, or whether the split {{is the result of a}} reasoned decision that will withstand a potential constitutional attack. Finally, Part V recaps the analysis of the common law liability and statutory window issue in a brief conclusion...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the prevailing {{view in the}} United States, and everywhere else in the common law world, which classifies the claim of negligent misrepresentation as a tort. I argue negligent misrepresentation is best understood as a contractual claim akin to promissory estoppel, with the gist of both claims being invited reliance. The prevailing view is an unfortunate byproduct of classical theories of contract and the idealization of contract as essentially private legislation. The classification of the claim as a tort is unfortunate because {{the rise of the}} modern tort of negligence, which has at its heart a principle of liability for harm carelessly caused, creates a risk that the tort of negligent misrepresentation will be subsumed into a general tort of negligence. Subsuming the claim into negligence will efface important features of the claim. Classifying the claim as contractual, however, will preserve these features while reinforcing largely positive trends in modern contract law. To make this case, the Article traces debates on the best theories of contract, tort, and negligence law from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. A long and broad view of these debates highlights a phenomenon that theorists who focus on specific fields overlook. In each of these fields, the best theory accounting for the core of the field does a poor job accounting for its periphery. Modern variations on classical theories of contract, like promise-based theories, brilliantly account for the core of contract law. Similarly, the theory of negligence as liability for harm carelessly caused brilliantly accounts for the core of negligence law. However, both theories fail in explaining the periphery of their respective fields of law. Promise-based theories of contract are too parsimonious and constrictive. They tend to reduce contract to a perfect circle of private legislation. The <b>negligence</b> <b>principle</b> is too general and open-ended, and it unhelpfully effaces the rich morality of the common law. Treating negligent misrepresentation as a problem of contract pushes back against both of these tendencies. It makes the domain of contract less constrictive and confines the domain of negligence...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} issue in Taiwan today concerns the rising tension between strict liability and negligence. Article 191 - 3 of the Civil Code of Taiwan imposes a fault-based standard of liability on persons conducting dangerous activities. On the other hand, {{the majority of}} scholars believe that to afford greater protection, this rule should be changed into a strict liability rule. Traditionally, three arguments make it preferable to impose strict liability under certain circumstances. First, strict liability induces more safety incentives {{on the part of}} the defendant. Second, fairness requires that one who benefits from conducting dangerous activities should bear the risk of loss. Finally, the defendant is better able to spread the loss to the general public. However, based on the analysis of each justification, this Dissertation finds that all of these arguments fail. Accordingly, this Dissertation argues that intermediate liability, a variation under <b>negligence</b> <b>principles,</b> is a proper standard of liability when high risk of harm is involved;—i. e. Article 191 - 3 is proper in imposing fault-based liability to dangerous activities—for the following three reasons: 1) intermediate liability provides additional safety incentives by shifting the burden of proof to the defendant; 2) it conforms to fairness; and 3) it does not consider tort law as a means of insurance...|$|E
40|$|The complex, remote, and {{seamless}} {{nature of}} ATM/debit card operations, the relatively outmoded and vulnerable technology {{employed in the}} ATM/debit card technology, the innovative and adaptive identity theft and fraud methods, and the severe asymmetry of information suffered by the consumer due to bank reluctance to provide fraud risk education have made unauthorised ATM/debit card transactions an inherent risk and real threat in the rapid development of electronic payment in Indonesia. The absence of specific fraud liability regulation {{and the lack of}} a clear understanding of the facts about unauthorised ATM/debit card transactions have contributed to prolonged disputes between banks and consumers about who should bear liability for the losses. The deficiency in adjudicator knowledge about empirical facts that are intertwined with the unauthorised ATM/debit card transactions as well as of relevant economic and technological facts, and the legal aspects specific to ATM/debit card regulation has also made the adjudicator’s decisions in the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) forum and courts tend towards being unjust and misleading, and failed to create incentives for optimum identity theft/fraud containment. This thesis, therefore, investigates quite exhaustively the technicalities and standard operating procedures of ATM/debit card system, methods and typology of identity theft and fraud, the fraudsters, the pertinent laws and regulations, and the adjudicator’s verdicts that are relevant to unauthorised ATM/debit card transactions in Indonesia. To enrich the research, comparative analysis was also undertaken with the United States and Australia’s fraud liability/fraud loss allocation rules regulations. To overcome the legal ramifications and disincentives that might otherwise occur because of lack fraud liability regulation and poor adjudicator decisions on unauthorised ATM/debit card transaction disputes, this thesis proposes law reform on Indonesian fraud liability regulations using multi-disciplinary approaches, namely economic, technological and legal. The thesis concludes by arguing that reform can be achieved by creating clear, fair, enumerated, and decisive loss allocation rules for unauthorised ATM/debit card transactions. To assure sensible adjudicator decisions, this thesis also argues that the old and unjust pure contributory negligence in legal proceedings should be replaced by the comparative <b>negligence</b> <b>principle</b> as part of the law reform...|$|R

Factors causing professional employees to be uninsured include lack of contractual privity between client and employee and absence of compelling rules or statutes.

40|$|The {{impact rule}} {{is an ancient}} torts {{doctrine}} that precludes recovery for emotional distress unless the victim has been physically impacted by the tortfeasor and the emotional distress grew out of that physical impact. American courts widely adopted the impact rule and it persists {{in a handful of}} states to this day. Courts give several reasons for denying these negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) claims and these reasons fall into three broad categories: judicial efficiency, evidence concerns, and foreseeability. This paper proposes that Florida abrogate the impact rule and switch to using a general negligence approach for NIED claims. First, this paper gives an overview of {{the current state of the}} Florida impact rule, its exceptions, and why the rule exists. This overview shows that the policy benefits that justify the impact rule do not flow from the rule itself. Next, this paper discusses the impact rules as they stand in the four other states that still cling to them. Comparison of these jurisdictions with Florida reveals that Florida’s impact rule is the least restrictive, appearing more like a general negligence analysis. With this background in mind, discussion of Kentucky’s recent abrogation of the impact rule and Tennessee’s overruling of the physical manifestation rule shows that foreseeability is the true core of the impact rule. Lastly, analysis of impact rule cases under a general negligence approach shows Florida already functionally uses general <b>negligence</b> <b>principles</b> in NIED claims. Thus, there is no loss in abrogating the impact rule because Florida is functionally already there...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent article}} {{warns that the}} {{adoption}} of the Uniform Commercial Code ". • • has altered many of the traditional notions of products liability, as it had been delineated under the Uniform Sales Act," 10 PRAC. LAW. 49 (1964). Such undue alarmism is apparently designed to inflate the value of those who {{have a little bit of}} Code information by scaring the harried and hurried lawyer who has not yet found the time to study this legislation in depth. The statement is simply not true. It is doubtful whether any provision in the warranty sections of the Code does not find substantial support in cases decided under the Sales Act. It would be surprising indeed if a commercial code greatly affected products liability law. The warranty cause of action, and this is the only area in which the Code touches products liability, is not commercial law at all. In its most important modern function, the compensation of buyers personally injured by using a product, it is essentially tort law. This is true even if it is classified as one sounding in contract to determine what statute of limitations period applies, to decide whether contributory negligence should be a bar to recovery, or for some other purpose. In fact, it may be argued that it was only through an historical accident or because of a too strict use of logic that the law allows any recovery for personal injuries in a warranty action. If the imposition of strict liability upon vendors had developed out of traditional <b>negligence</b> <b>principles,</b> it would have been on firmer ground and many of the present-day problems in this area would have been avoided.

Unfortunately, {{the main problem}} of corrected texts {{is not just the}} lack or not using of authentic manuscripts but the reason should be sought in the method used by correctors and their lack of attention to several literary and linguistic <b>principles.</b> The <b>negligence</b> of such <b>principles</b> has occurred in the correction of âOnsoriâs divan and caused his verses to be far from authenticity yet. This article aims to study and correct some verses of his divan which have been recorded incorrectly in Yahya Gharib (second impression, Tehran, 1344) and Mohammad Dabir Siaghi (second impression, Tehran, 1363) publications. Most corrections have been done on the basis of grammatical and semantic criteria and with regard to the conventions of old Persian poetry, especially methods of rhyming and imagery. Doing so, in addition to manuscripts used by the mentioned correctors in their correction, another manuscript which is older than those ones is also used in this study. Undoubtedly, in selecting the correct record, the author has not judged on the basis of subjective criteria and has not considered the stylistic characteristics of the poet as proven and absolute data.

40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} a fourth model of contact between patient and doctor, that of innovation. The law fails to recognise this and therefore uses principles established {{in the context of}} a normal therapeutic doctor patient relationship to determine negligence in cases of innovation. Innovation in turn can take two forms, experimental or personal. The law treats experimentation as if it were normal therapy and is thus too benevolent towards experimenters. The courts currently accept the use of experimental treatment merely no the grounds that a responsible body of medical opinion supports its use. However, it has been argued that the law should change to require the experimenters to justify their actions. On the other hand, with respect to personal innovation and learning new techniques, the law of negligence is too harsh, taking no account of the need for doctors to learn and develop their skills, which is in the interests of future patients. Some suggestions have been proposed to overcome this. In summary, the benefit of recognising that innovation is a separate model of contact between doctor and patient is that it will be fairer to both parties. Two important issues have been raised. Firstly, the context in which the innovative treatment of either variety is administered needs to be taken into consideration by the courts. Standard laws of <b>negligence,</b> based on <b>principles</b> established when considering the normal doctor-patient relationship, do not take this into account. Secondly, the question of what information is disclosed to the patient regarding this innovation also needs to be considered. The doctor should inform the patient, either that the treatment proposed was experimental, or that he or she was inexperienced in the particular technique proposed. Primarily this should lead to better protection from risk for patients and allow them the choice of whether to proceed. However, it is also fairer to the doctor and provides better protection, as the patient cannot then claim that he or she was not fully informed and the realities of medical practice are respected...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the issue of}} when a tortious duty of care to prevent economic loss should be imposed on the company directors and employees who stand behind the complex structure of companies and contracts involved {{in the creation of}} a defective building. Set against the background of the leaky building crisis, and what are (it is argued) unfair litigation outcomes, the thesis traverses the emergence and development of the principles that underpin liability for negligence and negligent misstatement in respect of defective buildings. A review of the cases confirms that the concepts of control and general reliance are the basis of New Zealand law in this area. There follows a discussion of the difficult relationship between company law principles and <b>negligence</b> <b>principles,</b> and the role of assumption of responsibility in the law of negligence and negligent misstatement, including a discussion of developments in the leaky building litigation. The thesis advanced is that, in respect of the creation of defective buildings, the approach to the issue of whether to impose a duty of care on company directors and employees would benefit from placing significant weight on the factor of de facto control of the inputs that dictate the outcome of a building project, and on the lower level factor of a direct or indirect financial interest in the outcome of the project. It is argued that the approach to imposing a duty of care should be the same for directors and employees and in respect of statements and actions. In cases where the evidence establishes that the financial interest factor is not present, this should give rise to an inference that the company director or employee does not have control of the inputs that dictate the outcome of the project, so that no duty of care arises. This would enable a director or employee to exit litigation by way of an application for summary judgment. This is intended to discourage the practice of joining minor parties to litigation for the purpose of extracting a precautionary settlement. If control of the inputs that dictate the outcome of a project can be established by inference from the existence of the financial interest factor, or by the other evidence, then the two stage approach to the imposition of a duty of care would require a consideration of other factors that might negate the duty, such as the contractual matrix...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, I {{compare the}} role of the creditor’s (promisee’s) conduct in {{contractual}} relationships in US and European legal systems. Different approaches to comparative negligence and mitigation are first considered, and then a more general analysis of doctrines dealing with the creditor’s position in the contractual relationship and {{the role of}} cooperation is carried out. In this area, legal systems display significant divergences – partly rooted in their historical antecedents, and partly related to different concepts of contracts and contractual relationships. Continental European systems (with significant differences between Germany and France) recognize a strong role for comparative negligence and the duty to cooperate, while common law jurisdictions (with important differences between England and the US) limit the scope of comparative negligence and the duty to cooperate whilst attributing a wider role to the duty to mitigate In this chapter I have shown that the great divergence concerning the rule of comparative negligence in contract law between England and the US on the one hand, and among European continental systems with the exception of France on the other, needs to be rethought. A wider range of doctrines beyond mitigation should be considered on the ground that they act, at least partially, as functional equivalents to comparative negligence. The divergence is reduced if we move away from specific doctrines to the general principle of creditor’s cooperation. This cooperation is relevant in many doctrines of contract law in the US, and to a lesser extent, England, although it has different scope in these legal systems. In England, where comparative negligence has limited application, the doctrines of causation and foreseeability provide some recognition of creditor’s conduct and apportionment of losses The narrow and very limited recognition of the rule of comparative negligence in the US is ‘compensated’ for by reference to other apportionment techniques in different doctrines such as those fostering reasonable reliance, mitigation and foreseeability. The potential explanation for these divergences may vary if we consider the rule of comparative <b>negligence</b> or the <b>principle</b> of creditor’s cooperation and its apportionment of losses regime as encompassing different doctrines. The recognition of the principle, under different doctrines but with different weight, does not eliminate the divergence, rather forces us to rethink its reasons. The lack of comparative negligence in the US, when considered along with the deployment of other forms of risksharing and apportionment of losses stemming from breach of contract, conforms to the idea that contract law is mainly directed at risk allocation. In European continental systems, the recognition of a general rule of comparative negligence and mitigation delineates a general principle based on the law of obligations, applicable to both contract and tort. Contractual relationships are generally characterized by a legal framework fostering higher level of cooperation including re-allocation between time of contract and time of performance. These divergences have been explained with reference to different business practices and community norms which legal systems have internalized. This ‘sociological’ perspective can partly shed light on these divergences but needs to be complemented by {{a deeper understanding of the}} core function of contract law and business rules...|$|R
