5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that {{astronomy}} described {{the movements of}} the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing {{the movements of the}} sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into <b>natural</b> <b>astrology,</b> with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his Livre de divinacions. Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 Contre les Devineurs. This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose Introductorium in Astronomiam and De Magnis Coniunctionibus argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages <b>natural</b> <b>astrology</b> {{was mainly}} {{focused on the}} {{diagnosis}} and the treatment of medical patients. For more information on this, see the article on medical astrology. An additional use {{would have been the}} application of astrology to determine future weather patterns based on the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic rationale that the planets cause change in the sublunary world by producing an efflux of elements and qualities. Every other branch was lumped together into the heading of 'judicial astrology'. These included natal astrology, mundane astrology, horary astrology, and electional astrology. Judicial astrology is an obsolete category, because since the Middle Ages other sciences have arisen, astrology has ceased to be a tool in medicine and meteorology, and scientifically demonstrable parts of <b>natural</b> <b>astrology</b> such as the moon's effect on tides are considered to be physics not astrology.|$|E
50|$|His Treatise Against Judiciall Astrologie was {{an attack}} on the {{judicial}} form of astrology on several fronts, while he said nothing about <b>natural</b> <b>astrology.</b> He claimed that the astrologers of his day now confined themselves to producing almanacs, because they were embarrassed by the science of their subject, which had many technical faults. Astrology was less reliable than other kinds of divination, and only stupid people would rely on it. He asked whether an astrologer could draw up a horoscope for the eggs in a bird's nest? This attack led to Christopher Heydon's A Defence of Judicial Astrology (1603), a ponderous work which claimed that Chamber had misunderstood those he relied on, while plagiarizing from them. Chamber responded with A confutation of astrological demonology, or, The divell's schole (1604), which exists only in a manuscript now at the Bodleian Library and may never have been published. George Carleton also responded to Heydon, with The Madnesse of Astrologers, which was eventually published in 1624.|$|E
2500|$|The {{miscellaneous}} examinations, or japgwa, {{were divided}} into four parts: translation, medicine, <b>natural</b> science (<b>astrology,</b> geography, and ...), and recordkeeping(??). These examinations were overseen by the government office which employed specialists in the field. They were closely connected to the Sahak royal technical academies, which were overseen by the same offices.|$|R
50|$|A Promenade of the Hearts is a {{collection}} of stories, anecdotes, and poems from the Arab Middle Ages, including some poems on homosexual and lesbian themes. Ahmad al-Tifashi, the compiler (1184-1253), was born in Tiffech now in Algeria and studied in Tunisia, Egypt and Damascus. His interests included law, <b>natural</b> science, <b>astrology,</b> poetry and the social sciences.|$|R

Vishaka is the sixteenth nakshatra of the Hindu zodiac, ruled by the planet Jupiter Brihaspati or Guru, It is also the birth star of the Hindu deity Lord Murugan.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} Arabic learning, in Latin translations, on Chaucer’s oeuvre. That Chaucer drew on Arabic sources has long been acknowledged by Chaucerians, {{but there has been}} little scholarly engagement with them, particularly in relation to his highly technical, diagnostic concept of fin’ amors. This study demonstrates Chaucer’s portrayal of fin’ amors is informed by Arabic learning in the related fields of medicine, <b>natural</b> philosophy, <b>astrology</b> and alchemy, disseminated through Latin translations from the Iberian Peninsula in particular. This study demonstrates that whilst Chaucer has the utmost respect for the scholarly achievements of the Islamic world, he adopts a condemnatory attitude toward the religious milieu that gave birth to these achievements, grounded in the contemporary context of the later crusades. Chapter One considers the influence of Arabic medical texts on Chaucer’s diagnosis of amor hereos, love as a life-threatening illness, in Troilus and Criseyde and the Knight’s Tale. Chapter Two examines Aristotelian natural philosophy and the effect of the 1277 Condemnations at the University of Paris on the genesis of love as a cerebral illness. Chapter Three turns to the diagnostic aspect of Arabic astronomy evinced in the Treatise on the Astrolabe, focusing on judicial astrology and saturnine melancholia in the Knight’s Tale. Chapter Four concentrates on the technical transmission of Arabic alchemical sources in the Canon’s Yeoman’s Tale, which act as a metaphor for fin’ amors. Chapter Five examines Chaucer’s dichotomous attitude toward Arabic learning and Islam as a religion...|$|R
