40|$|Construction {{is a major}} {{industry}} {{throughout the}} world accounting for a sizeable proportion of most countries gross domestic product (GDP). According to a recent survey, total world construction spending in 1998 was over $ 3 trillion. Furthermore {{the importance of the}} construction sector is related not only to its size but also to its role in economic development. This paper examines the extent of international construction activity, and is based on a cross-sectional analysis of published data pertaining to global construction spending. The principal findings suggest that the role of construction changes as economic development proceeds. It was found that the share of construction spending in GDP first grows during less developed country (LDC) status, peaks during <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country</b> (NIC) status and then declines as countries move from NIC to advanced industrialized country (AIC) status. The research identifies the importance of construction within NICs. The regions of Asia and Latin America and the countries of China, Mexico, Argentina and Egypt are considered noteworthy in regard to various indicators concerned with construction and economic activity. However, the conclusion is that as economic development proceeds from NIC to AIC status construction fails to maintain its share of GDP and therefore declines in importance.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} for the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> toward trade liberalization is that technology spillover from exporting the high-tech intermediate goods will benefit the final goods production in other developing countries. Furthermore, those developing countries will then compete with the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>countries</b> in exporting the final goods to other countries. This paper establishes a three-country theoretical model that has considered those “side effects” mentioned above to simulate the effects of trade liberalization on a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country,</b> which has the comparative advantage in producing high-tech intermediate goods. The model shows that when the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> liberalizes the export of the high-tech intermediate goods to the developing country, the latter’s export of the final good to the third country becomes more competitive and the global welfare level goes up. However, the welfare level for the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> might go down since its export of the final good is hampered. To partially internalize the benefit from the specialization, the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>country</b> can also liberalize the import of the final good from the developing country at the same time. The model also shows that when both countries play a simultaneous move game on their respective trade policies, there are many possible policy combinations that are welfare-improving for both countries compared to the Nash equilibrium outcome. This suggests that instead of letting both countries interact strategically without negotiation, the role of some trade agreements would be crucial...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{construction}} in economic development {{is an important}} issue facing the construction research community, government and international development agencies. Based on empirical analyses, the complexities of the relationship between construction activity and stage of economic development in Hong Kong were examined. With time series data, Granger causality test results show that the construction output particularly the infrastructure sector drives the economic growth of Hong Kong, and not vice versa. Findings further indicate that the role of the local construction industry changes as the economy matures from <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country</b> (NIC) to advanced industrialized country (AIC) status, as revealed by the diminishing rate of capacity addition by construction as well as the growing maintenance and repair sector. This complies with Bon's inverted U-shaped relationship between construction activity and gross domestic product (GDP). However, the proposition of 'volume follows share' is not supported since the indigenous construction investments still sustain for the service-oriented economy which inevitably needs commercial development and logistics infrastructure to provide the services. The results may be significant for policy makers in NICs, in the long run, to formulate corporate and industrial policies to chart out a viable and sustainable course to revive the vigour of the industry.

40|$|This article {{examines}} 42 innovative firms in a <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country,</b> Korea. It identifies different patterns of innovation associated with {{four types of}} firms, which is categorized by two variables: the source of initiation and the local availability of related foreign products. Bivariate analyses suggest that innovation patterns are distinctly different for Type I firms (user initiated and related foreign products locally available) and Type IV firms (innovator initiated and no related foreign products locally available). Type I firms use and benefit most from close interactions with customers and visits to the domestic users of related foreign products, while Type IV firms benefit most from the overseas observation of foreign suppliers and the assistance of local R&D institutes. The other two groups are more closely related but still different from the above two groups. The results of a multiple discriminant analysis are supportive of the patterns which emerged in the bivariate analyses. It was also found that majority of important and crucial information to solve technical problems were transferred free of charge from abroad through informal mechanisms rather than formal collaboration with foreign firms. The findings suggest that different situations call for different approaches to make innovations successful. research and development, technology transfer, economic development...|$|E
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{purchasing}} of imported industrial products among managers in a <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country</b> (NIC). The authors propose that the industrial marketing requirements to buyers in an NIC, given their mix of environmental and organizational conditions, {{are different from those}} in advanced nations. South Korea, {{in addition to being a}} representative NIC, is interesting from the standpoint that there is a heavy import dependence on Japan. The results of a survey of South Korean companies importing industrial products in key representative industries suggest that the strong ratings for Japanese industrial products are based not only on stronger overall quality, but also on their higher orientation toward intangible factors such as communication, technical assistance, and reliability. Moreover, many of the Japanese sources have “localized” their product to compete with the domestic suppliers as well. These results suggest that in order to improve their performance, other foreign suppliers must compete on dual fronts; a product-related dimension as well as a more service-related dimension. Other possible avenues for improvement can be found by examining differences in supplier ratings based on organizational and situational influences. This study shows that buyers in smaller and newer companies tend to be more open to non-Japanese products. The findings also suggest that certain technology-transfer modes may be more conducive to generating better supplier ratings. Overall, the variability of country ratings across situational factors strongly indicates that more conceptualization and theory building is needed in the international industrial marketing are...|$|E

But since the latter proviso is not met in practice, empirical {{studies of the}} environmental and resource depletion effects of such reforms are needed to convince sceptics that trade reform is still worthwhile. This paper provides a methodology for doing that. It is illustrated with {{a case study of}} Indonesia, a large <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country</b> that is rich in natural resources and committed to taking part in major multilateral and regional trade liberalizations over the next two decades. A modified version of the global CGE model known as GTAP is used to project the world economy to 2010 and 2020 both with and without those reforms. An environmental module is attached to the Indonesian part of that global CGE model so as to measure the effects of changes in economic activity on air and water pollution. The proportional contributions to environmental indicators of changes in the level and composition of output, and changes in production techniques, are identified. A base case projection without trade reform is compared with alternative scenarios involving full global implementation of Uruguay Round commitments by 2010, and the additional move to MFN free trade by APEC countries by 2020. The study suggests that, at least with respect to air and water, trade policy reforms slated for the next two decades would in many cases improve the environment and reduce the depletion of natural resources and, in the worst cases, would add only slightly to environmental degradation – even without toughening the enforcement of existing environmental regulations or adding new ones, and even if the reforms stimulate a faster rate of economic growth.

40|$|Purpose - There {{is limited}} {{empirical}} {{research on the}} internationalization processes, strategies and operations of Asian multinational enterprises (MNEs) from countries {{at different levels of}} development. This paper examines and analyzes the internationalization strategies and characteristics of Asian MNEs within the investment development path (IDP) perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data are drawn from matched case studies of emerging MNEs from Taiwan (a <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country)</b> and Malaysia (a fast developing country) in the textile and electronics industries. Findings - The internationalization strategies of our Taiwanese and Malaysian case firms were founded on cost-based competencies and other location-based advantages, brought together by an extensive web of ethnic networks. Differences between our Taiwanese and Malaysian case firms were found and discussed. In general, the Taiwanese firms were more internationalized (at stage 3 of IDP) than the Malaysian firms (stage 2). They had more developed and elaborate production networks and greater own design manufacturing/own brand manufacturing participation than the Malaysian firms. Research limitations/implications - The research did not capture the operational strategies {{at the level of the}} subsidiary or JV. The findings were exploratory and formed the basis for research propositions presented. As indicated there existed a wide empirical research gap on Asian as well as Taiwanese and Malaysian MNEs. These need to be filled to provide further evidence and answers to the issues raised in the paper. Other potential areas of research could include longitudinal studies of Asian MNEs to examine whether they will resemble Western MNEs as they evolve, the impact of ethnic networks on the performance of Asian MNEs of both Chinese and non-Chinese origins, and the role of the state in internationalization strategies.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to theoretically evaluate {{an important aspect of}} a <b>Newly</b> <b>Industrializing</b> <b>Country</b> (NICs) : Korea. Namely, the behaviour of firms in Korea competing with firms in an industrialized country after all Government intervention of the former is withdrawn. This aspect is considered in the main part while a descriptive introductory part introduces the Korean economy as a NIC. We construct a simple asymmetric duopoly model where firms conjectures {{play an important role in}} deriving the Perfect Equilibrium for a two stage game. Different costs of production and first mover advantage form the basis of the asymmetry. We find that under Cournot conjectures assumption for the marketing stage and certain cost conditions, it is profitable for the incumbent firm to stay a leader and the follower to remain a follower. For some cost conditions and a credible threat at the disposal of the follower, the incumbent firm may be forced to stay a leader even though it is more profitable to became a follower. We examine possible licensing rules the leader may propose to the follower. The dominant strategy, we find, is a licence fee that is a function of the quality difference between the top quality of the market leader and the level of quality it is selling to the follower. There will be a cost to the leader in terms of a lower licence fee to prevent possible leap forgging. Once we allow for free copying, we find that the follower will copy closely the new product of the leadership. Under Bertrand conjectures assumption, we find that unless the firm with higher production cost remains the leader offering a higher quality product, it will be driven out of the market, i. e., either it has to innovate or-die...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is written}} {{in the tradition of}} the latest resurgence in economic sociology. It intends to contribute to this literature by examining the political embeddedness of financial development in an East Asian <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country.</b> I have tried to chart a position between free markets and state control of the financial system as against Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s postwar experience. This effort helps to lay the groundwork for an economic sociology of finance that will broaden our understandings of the variety of ways in which the financial system can be organized with different kinds of consequences. ^ For many years, the discussion of the role of financial development in economic growth has been centered on the debate over 2 ̆ 2 financial liberalization 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 financial repression 2 ̆ 2 in the implementation of financial policies in developing countries. The central argument of this dissertation is that neither free market nor central planning principles could adequately explain the making and unmaking of financial policies in developing countries. I will argue that what is missing from the previous analyses on the enactment of financial repression in developing countries is precisely the specific mechanism of the political embeddedness of financial development which this study tries to uncover: (1) legal framework of the state; (2) international context; (3) financial system as a social contract; (4) the interplay between politics and economy. ^ After a review of the existing theoretical frameworks in the first two chapters, I will examine Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s postwar financial development to test the validity of the neoclassical diagnostics of the financial repression in developing countries. Chapter three will deal with the mobilization of savings in Taiwan. The allocation of savings in Taiwan will be analyzed in chapter four. I will then focus on the issue of economic adjustment in relation to Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s financial reform in chapter five. The concluding chapter will summarize the theoretical and empirical findings of the previous chapters and make a few remarks on the implications of the Taiwanese case for the literature. ...|$|E

This dissertation attempts to explain the role of state elites in policy change in a <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country.</b> More specifically, it analyzes the adoption of a package of economic policies, collectively known as structural adjustment, in Costa Rica from 1982 to 1990, and the factors that influenced those choices. The study argues that state elites' decisions are influenced, but not determined, by domestic pressure groups or external actors such as multilateral financial institutions (i. e. World Bank). To ascertain the degree of autonomy policy makers have in Costa Rica, I engage in two levels of analysis. The first level centers on the state, in terms of its organizational strength and the degree of consensus among policy elite members. The second focuses on the state-society relations. Three study propositions were empirically supported: (1) the state elite's commitment to structural adjustment was affected by their belief that a severe crisis was affecting the domestic economy and that failure to act would lead to even more threatening economic situation; (2) the implementation of adjustment policies was facilitated by the operating characteristics of the Costa Rican formal institutions which created favorable conditions for cooperation to arise, particularly in a crisis situation; and (3) the political leaders' ability to manage opposition enhanced their degree of autonomy in implementing authoritative decisions. The analysis enabled me to identify two variables overlooked by the existing literature on policy change. First, the representation system is a critical variable in explaining the decision-making context and the mixture of adjustment policies. Second, the analysis suggests that characteristics of the party system have important influence on political leaders' commitment to policy change. Finally, the analysis provides evidence that policy makers have the capacity to act upon broad interests and to bring about changes to pursue these interests. This study thus demonstrates the limitation of society-centered approaches which consider the activities of the state and policy makers as reflections of social class, interest group or rent-seeking objectives. It also demonstrates the limitation of state-centered approaches which argue that policy makers cannot alter the constraint derived from the bureaucratic and political context...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{economic}} development accompanied by increasing manufacturing output in Malaysia {{for the past}} two decades is not balanced with sufficient environmental management. Although pollution control measures have been formulated and implemented by the Malaysian government, the improvements and achievements in environmental performance vary from one industrial sector to another. This raises the question on the reasons for the differences in environmental performances of industrial sectors in one country. In addition, most of the studies using Ecological Modernization Theory - a prevailing theory for analyzing and understanding environmental reform in western countries - have a national character, {{in the sense that the}} studies do not differentiate between sectors in analyzing and explaining environmental management and performance. And these Ecological Modernization Theory studies have prevailed up till now in Western OECD countries, and hardly in Asian developing economies. Moreover, most studies in the Ecological Modernization Theory tradition are more qualitative by making interesting use of case study research in analyzing environmental reform and further building theory. Limited quantitative research has been done up till now to test the central tenets laid down in Ecological Modernization Theory and no methodology has been developed yet to carry out a more substantive quantitative testing. Against this background, the current study aims to make a scientific contribution. This study aims to understand the differences in sectoral environmental performance in Malaysian industries by applying Ecological Modernization Theory. In investigating sectoral performances, the study has two objectives. The first objective is to develop a quantitative methodology for investigating the claims of successes and failures of environmental reform as hypothesized by Ecological Modernization Theory. This quantitative methodology focuses on two central tenets of Ecological Modernization Theory. The first central tenet pertains to the claim that environmental reforms are stimulated and triggered by transformations in environmental policy, also known as political modernization. The second central tenet relates to the increasing importance of market dynamics and economic agents in successful industrial environmental management in the era of globalization. The second objective of this study is to understand sectoral variations with regard to the drivers for environmental reform and to understand why a particular sector is better than another in environmental performance. The palm oil production chain (POPC) and the textile and apparel production chain (TAPC) in Malaysia are the foci of this study. The POPC in Malaysia is a high priority resource-based industry with heavy government involvement, whereas the TAPC has more laissez faire characteristics with limited government involvement in its economic activities. Based on the two objectives, three research questions emanate. The first research question relates to how the policy and economic tenets of Ecological Modernization Theory can be operationalized into testable factors that contribute to improved environmental performances in industrial sectors. The second question relates to the factors in the policy and economic domains explaining sector variations with respect to environmental performance. The third research question pertains to the recommendations for the development of sector-                                  based industrial development policy in Malaysia, most notably the POPC and the TAPC. The development of a quantitative methodology starts with the operationalization of Ecological Modernization Theory into hypotheses to enable the validity of the Ecological Modernization Theory claims to be tested in a developing country. All the hypotheses formulated are either consistent or consonant with ecological modernization characteristics. The central tenet of political modernization gives birth to the Government-Industry (G-I) linkage which in turn looks at the Ecological Modernization Theory characteristics of policy formulation, technology, regulatory efforts, advocacy of preventive approaches, and local communities' involvement. Likewise, the central tenet of the role of market dynamics and economic actors gives birth to the Industry-Industry (I-I) linkage, which focuses on the Ecological Modernization Theory characteristics of international trade, vertical integration, international relationship, and local collaboration (localization). Each characteristic in the G-I linkage and the I-I linkage is translated into an independent variable and linked to hypotheses. Each of the independent variables is then statistically tested against environmental performance, operationalized as a composition of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs) or alternatively known as dependent variables. Hypothesis testing provides the means to support or refute the hypothesis. As hypothesis testing via statistical data analysis is required, the independent and dependent variables are operationalized in a measurable form. To overcome the problem of data limitations for the dependent variables - quite common in developing countries, five categories of EPIs were formulated and merged into one final environmental performance variable. The basic five categories of EPIs offer the advantage of robustness in compensating for data variability and limitation. A minimum of 35 and 36 companies for the POPC and the TAPC respectively were selected via disproportionate stratified random sampling, making over 5 % of the population in each sector. The primary purpose of adopting disproportionate stratified random sampling is that it is much more efficient statistically as compared to simple random sampling and in the worst scenario is equal to it. Kendall's tau-b, a non-parametric test, is used as it is the most appropriate tool in view of data characteristics and less stringent requirements. Data were collected at the company sites of each company via interviewing, at the statistical offices of Malaysia, at the offices of the environmental authorities in the districts the sampled companies were located, and with (academic) experts. This research shows that two out of five hypotheses are statistically significant in the G-I linkage for the POPC. However, none are statistically significant in the G-I Linkage for the TAPC. This is mainly due to the fact that the POPC is designated as a high priority industry by the government. Thus political modernization has taken roots in the POPC. In the I-I linkage, three out of four hypotheses are statistically significant for both the POPC and the TAPC. This also signifies the impact of the increasing importance of market dynamics and economic actors in ecological reform in Malaysia palm oil and textile production chains. Studies using Ecological Modernization Theory in China, Vietnam and Thailand showed limited applicability of Ecological Modernization Theory in these countries. The main findings of this research on Malaysia, a developing economy in Southeast                                                                                                                                                                     Asia, prove in some way better. As mentioned above, the two central tenets of Ecological Modernization Theory, namely political modernization and the increasing importance of market dynamics and economic actors, are to some extent applicable to the POPC. However, for the TAPC, the central tenet of the increasing importance of market dynamics and economic actors is applicable whereas the central tenet of political modernization could not be proven. This shows at least the partial applicability of Ecological Modernization Theory in contemporary Malaysia, a <b>newly</b> <b>industrializing</b> <b>country</b> in Asia. A facet that has to be considered is the refinement of the Ecological Modernization Theory in the context of localized conditions and institutional developments in Malaysia. The central tenet that environmental reforms are stimulated and triggered by transformations in environmental governance shows that the role of the state has turned towards contextual steering for the POPC. This is made possible with the existence of modernized, sector-specific, government related institutions like the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC). However, this claim is not valid for the TAPC as it has more laissez faire characteristics. The government's innovative policy of technology development and technology transfer, as hypothesized by ecological modernization scholars, shows a muted response for both the POPC and the TAPC. The highly bureaucratic and time-consuming application process, together with poor public service delivery, act as a deterrence in such technological collaborative efforts. Likewise, poor enforcement of environmental regulations by both direct and indirect environmental government agencies leads to environmental regulations not being main drivers in environmental reform for both the POPC and the TAPC. The Ecological Modernization Theory characteristics of preventive measures and self-regulation are evident in the POPC, but not the TAPC. Preventive measures in the form of the various ISO certifications, strongly advocated by the state, have become part of the standard operating procedures of government agencies like Felda and government-linked companies in the POPC. As mentioned above, the TAPC has a more laissez faire characteristic and as such there is no push or catalyst to toe the government line. The role of civil society in environmental reform, which is very much in evidence in Ecological Modernization Theory literature, is to a large extent absent for the local communities in Malaysia. The environmental dimension has yet to become sufficiently important in the worldview and in the political opportunity structures of the local communities. The central tenet of the increasing importance of market dynamics and economic agents in environmental reform demonstrates a great impact on both the POPC and the TAPC. These two sectors are highly export-oriented and the reverberations of globalization are felt. For the POPC, the market actors in the farm to fork supply chain have adopted environmental standards like ISO 14000. On the other hand, for the TAPC the mere act of exporting to the developed markets acts as a trigger to adopt environmental standards. The adoption of environmental standards has contributed to the harmonization of environmental practices. For the TAPC, transnational corporations (TNCs) in their centrally powerful position in the economic webs, act as a stimulus in triggering environmental reform in supplier companies. However, the role of the TNCs is not merely imposing their requirements but also collaborating by helping the supplier companies to meet the                            firm-based environmental standards that they have set. On the other hand, the foreign downstream customers of the POPC have not initiated any collaborative effort to meet environmental requirements. The impact of global market forces has a local effect. Local vertically integrated groups with palm oil milling activity, especially the government linked companies (GLCs) in the POPC, have made efforts in accommodating environmental pressures. The strong corporate culture imbued with the environmental dimension, is used as a cornerstone in meeting market requirements as well as toeing the government line. Through local collaboration, they are able to cascade good environmental management systems and practices within the entire group via structural embeddedness. On the other hand, the vertically integrated groups that are involved in low pollutant generating activities in the TAPC, have made efforts in complying with environmental requirements as the investment cost is relatively low as opposed to wet processing. Thus, environmental reform in the TAPC is dictated by local cost condition. The study concludes with recommendations. The first recommendation for the development of sector-based industrial policy is the formation of sector specific, government related institutions with participation of economic actors. These institutions provide the means to formulate, promulgate, implement and monitor environmental policies. The experiences in the POPC show that allowing the industry to cooperate and participate in the policy formulation process, buttressed by the sector-specific government related institutions, has provided a synergistic government-industry linkage leading to a strong relationship with clear environmental reforms. The second recommendation is that advanced preventive and curative environmental technologies should be provided on a pro bono basis to all industries as these technologies are meant for the good of the commonwealth. Currently, the indigenous technologies developed by MPOB are sold to any interested parties based on certain specific terms and conditions. The third recommendation is that the adoption and maintaining of environmental standards and certifications should be highly encouraged, as this proves to be a workable form of self-regulatory practice. Attaining the pioneer or the first environmental certification, especially ISO 14000 standards, is relatively easy but maintaining the certification on a long term basis proves much more difficult. Tax incentives on a graduated scale can be provided for the adoption and maintaining of environmental certifications as these have both economic and environmental benefits. This preventive measure complements and supplements the environmental enforcement agencies in view and in lieu of their poor regulatory enforcement. The fourth recommendation is that a fast track program should be institutionalized for the approval of technological collaboration, technological financing and the application of tax incentives for environment-related projects and technologies by relevant government agencies. This fast track program is to overcome the highly bureaucratic and time consuming application process by relevant government agencies. ...|$|E
