Although aerosolization is well understood, {{studies have focused on}} pharmaceuticals and very little data is available regarding vaccines. The proposed study analyzes the relationships between various pre- and post-aerosolization parameters in order to calculate the "aerosol fingerprint," or combination of pre-aerosolization parameters optimized to produce the most effective aerosol particle size distribution for measles vaccination. Relevant pre-aerosolization parameters are identified as relative humidity, nebulizer temperature, vaccine reconstitution, solution pH, surface tension, viscosity, air pressure, and nebulizer geometry. Relevant post-aerosolization parameters are identified particle size distribution, aerosolization endurance and bioavailability, and drug delivery rate.

40|$|Mucositis is {{a common}} and serious side-effect {{experienced}} by cancer patients during treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Consequently, programmes of research focus centre on the elucidation of novel therapeutics for alleviation of mucositis symptoms, and these frequently use animal models. However, although these models {{are assumed to be}} painful and distressing to the animal, endpoints are difficult to determine. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether a change in burrowing behaviour could provide an indication of disease onset and potentially be applied as a humane endpoint. Baseline burrowing behaviour was measured in healthy animals on three occasions by determining the weight of gravel displaced from a hollow tube. Mucositis was then induced in the same animals by intraperitoneal injection of 5 -fluorouracil (150 [*]mg/kg) and burrowing behaviour recorded over three consecutive days. Standard measures of disease progression, including body weight loss and clinical score, were also made. The presence of mucositis was confirmed at necropsy by findings of decreased duodenal and colon lengths, and reduced liver, spleen and thymus weights in comparison with non-treated control animals. Histological score of the jejunum and ileum was also significantly increased. Mucositis onset coincided with a decrease in mean burrowing behaviour which was progressive, however this result did not achieve statistical significance (P[*]=[*] 0. 66). We conclude that burrowing may be a useful indicator of inflammation in the mucositis model, although this requires further characterization. Pre-selection of animals into treatment groups based on their prior burrowing performance should be pursued in further studies. A L Whittaker, K A Lymn, A <b>Nicholson,</b> G <b>S</b> Howart...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing {{alternative}} {{materials is}} an important tactic to improve the environmental performance of products. Currently a growing array of materials candidates confronts today's product designer. While life-cycle assessment (LCA) methods provide quantitative input into this selection decision, their implementations are evolving and disparate. The goal {{of this paper is}} to explore several major analytical variations of LCA implementations and the implications of these variants across a range of application contexts. Specifically, this thesis examines analytical variations in valuation method and treatment of recycling by exploring allocation methods that affect product end-of-life. An abstracted case study across a range of materials is presented, including materials that exhibit a spectrum in variation of environmental performance and material degradation between primary and secondary applications. To date, research has shown that the amount of recycled material delivered by, or used in, the life cycle of a product will affect the environmental burdens of other product life cycles. However, explicit consideration has not been given to the question of whether end-of-life allocation methods can lead to different materials selection decisions in early stage product development cycles. Similarly stemming from this question is the issue of, if so, how do these allocation methods differentially favor certain material classes? Results indicate that the choice of analytical method as well as its underlying parameters can have substantial impact on individual metrics that determine environmentally preferred material and that there are sets of analytical variation over which strategic results are strongly affected. by Anna L. <b>Nicholson.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M. in Technology and Policy) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program; and, (S.

40|$|Though {{little is}} known of the graptoloid {{reproductive}} mechanism, graptolites with putatively sac-like appendages, supposedly ovarian vesicles, have been known from the Moffat Shales Group, Southern Uplands, Scotland, for over 150 years. Locally, these co-occur with isolated, two-dimensional, discoidal or ovatotriangular fossils. In the 1870 <b>s,</b> <b>Nicholson</b> interpreted these isolated fossils as being graptoloid ‘egg-sacs’, detached from their parent and existing as free-swimming bodies. He assigned them to the genus “Dawsonia”, though the name was preoccupied by a trilobite, and named four species: “D. ” campanulata, “D. ” acuminata, “D. ” rotunda (sic.) and “D. ” tenuistriata. A reassessment of Nicholson’s type material from the Silurian of Moffatdale, Scotland, and the Ordovician Lévis Formation of Quebec, Canada, shows that Dawsonia Nicholson comprises the inarticulate brachiopods Acrosaccus? rotundus, Paterula? tenuistriata and Discotreta cf. levisensis, the tail-piece of the crustacean Caryocaris acuminata and the problematic fossil “D. ” campanulata. Though “D. ” campanulata resembles sac-like graptolite appendages, morphometric analysis reveals the similarity to be superficial and the systematic position of this taxon remains uncertain.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to show the importance of supply chain management in the dry-bulk shipping industry. A hypothetical company, the Texas Grain and Bakery Corporation, was created. The values and calculations used are artificial but representative of the industry. A well defined fleet analysis of Texas Intercoastal Transport's vessels and supply chain infrastructure show that an increase in productivity and profitability are possible with proper implementation. A systems approach of tying together the subsidiaries of Texas Grain and Bakery is used. This analysis is broken into seven sections: (1) Overview of the Systems Approach, which breaks down the seven step process. (2) Establishing a Baseline, which shows an annualized view of cargo movement of the core trade based on {{the first half of}} 2005. (3) Analysis of "Ideal" Allocation of Current Fleet, which defines assumptions used in the model and proposes a core trade fleet. (4) Analysis of Intermediate Fleet Allocation, which is a fleet analysis executable within the next 18 months. (cont.) (5) Analysis of Long-Term Fleet Allocation, which is a fleet analysis executable around 2009. Two new-build vessels are added into the core trade along with sharply increasing the amount of grain moved. (6) Analysis of Delays, which goes over historical data from the Texas Intercoastal Transport fleet that warrants further future study. (7) Conclusions and Recommendations, which summarizes the results of the seven step process and makes recommendations for implement ion of results into the core trade of Texas Grain and Bakery. The paper concludes with several findings. Conservatively, there is an estimated savings of $ 4 - 6 Million savings per year throughout Texas Grain and Bakery. There are certain inefficiencies that do exist in the system and cannot be remedied; they can only be minimized. Finally, additional study into mechanical delays is suggested in order to further increase fleet productivity and profitability in the future. by Bryan E. <b>Nicholson.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M. in Ocean Systems Management) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2006.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{properties of}} two commercial (Condias, Sumitomo) boron-doped diamond thin-film electrodes {{were compared with}} those of two types of boron-doped diamond thin film deposited in our laboratory (microcrystalline, nanocrystalline). Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the electrode morphology and microstructure, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the electrochemical response, with five different redox systems serving as probes (Fe(CN) (6) (3 -/ 4 -), Ru(NH 3) (6) (3 +/ 2 +), IrCI 62 -/ 3 -, 4 -methylcatechol, Fe 3 +/ 2 +). The response for the different systems was quite reproducibile from electrode type to type and from film to film for electrodes of the same type. For all five redox systems, the forward reaction peak current varied linearly with the scan rate(1 / 2) (v), indicative of electrode reaction kinetics controlled by mass transport (semi-infinite linear diffusion) of the reactant. Apparent heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constants, kdegrees(app), for all five redox systems were determined from DeltaE(p) -v experimental data, according to the method described by <b>Nicholson</b> (<b>Nicholson,</b> R. <b>S.</b> Anal. Chem. 1965, 37, 1351.). The rate constants were also verified through digital simulation (DigiSim 3. 03) of the voltammetric i-E curves at different scan rates. Good fits between the experimental and simulated voltammograms were found for scan rates up to 50 V/s. kdegrees(app) values of 0. 05 - 0. 5 cm/s were observed for Fe(CN) (6) (3 -/ 4 -), Ru(NH 3) (6) (3 +/ 2 +), and IrCl 62 -/ 3 - without any extensive electrode pretreatment (e. g., polishing). Lower kdegrees(app) values of 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 6) cm/s were found for 4 -methylcatechol and Fe 3 +/ 2 +. The voltammetric responses for Fe(CN) (6) (3 -/ 4 -) and Ru(NH 3) (6) (3 +/ 2 +) were also examined at all four electrode types at two different solution pH (1. 90, 7. 35). Since the hydrogen-terminated diamond surfaces contain few, if any, ionizable carbon-oxygen functionalities (e. g., carboxylic acid, pK(a) similar to 4. 5), the DeltaE(p), i(p) (ox), and i(p) (red) values for the two systems were, for the most part, unaffected by the solution pH.

50|$|Fletcher {{was born}} on November 5, 1831 in England. Early in his life his family immigrated to the United States, {{settling}} {{in the state of}} Maryland. Early in 1861 President Abraham Lincoln appointed Fletcher as Register of the Vancouver, Washington Territory, office of the United States General Land Office. The General Land Office was charged with administrating the conveyance of public lands to those claiming the lands as a part of homesteading or otherwise, {{in the form of a}} Land patent. For a new territory, this office was at the center of the local business development efforts. Mr. Fletcher and his wife Rhoda Fletcher left Maryland and moved west to Vancouver in June, 1861. They purchased two lots near St. Luke's Episcopal Church and built a prominent house there. The Fletchers joined the parish at St. Luke's, with Rhoda being baptized by Reverend John D. McCarty in 1861.At St. Luke's, Joseph M. Fletcher was an active leader of the parish. He was one of the incorporators when St. Luke’s became the first Episcopal Church in the Washington Territory to be incorporated. He served on the Vestry, along with other civic and military leaders including Louis Sohns, Henry C. Hodges, and John McNeil Eddings, and was the Senior Warden when the church was consecrated in 1868 by Benjamin Wistar Morris (bishop). Typically Senior Wardens only serve for a few years, yet Joseph Fletcher served from 1868 through 1875, and again in 1881, working with the church's second rector, Reverend Albert <b>S.</b> <b>Nicholson.</b> He also served as the Superintendent of Sunday School during this period. Perhaps not as notable as some would like, but in perspective to his many other duties and activities during this time, it illustrates his commitment to service as well as popularity amongst his peers.|$|R

He was {{declared}} a Democrat at that time, and won by 17 votes out of 447. In 1865, Sohns was again elected Treasurer of Clark County.Mr. Sohns joined St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, and soon became one of its leaders. He was elected nine times to serve on the church’s Vestry or leadership team, first in 1870 and the last time in 1889. He continued to be active in church activities throughout the rest of his business and civic career. The close ties Sohns had with St. Luke's rector, Reverend Albert <b>S.</b> <b>Nicholson</b> were evidenced by the rector's involvement, and Sohns' involvement, in local education development in the community.In 1875 Louis Sohns was elected Mayor of Vancouver, after having already served on the city council and various civic committees. He served four years, but returned in 1889 to serve another two years as Mayor. Sohns also served on the Washington Territory Legislature, and was a delegate for the Vancouver area to the State Constitutional Convention in 1889, serving on the Preamble and Bill of Rights, Apportionment and Representation, Revenue and Taxation, and Rules committees of the Convention.One of the interesting events in the 1870s in which Sohns, as a businessman, landowner, church leader, and Mayor, played a key part was the ‘St. James Mission Land Claim’. In 1853, Catholic Bishop Augustin-Magloire Blanchet filed a land claim for 640 acres. This was based on an Act of Congress and his interpretation of that law. The law allowed missions to claim their land. The Bishop felt that this included not only the mission land, but that of its parishioners and suppliers. The land claim happened to include most of downtown Vancouver and the Fort Vancouver Reserve, affecting homeowners, businesses, churches (like St. Luke's Episcopal Church at the time), and governments. The land claim initiated several lawsuits, with support as well as opposition from high offices locally and nationally. In 1895 the case was settled by the U.S. Supreme Court, basically in favor of everyone except the Bishop. In the meantime, Sohns is credited with negotiating a set of quit claims between local land owners and the Catholic Diocese. While not recognizing the validity of the land claim, it released any claim for specific property for a sum of money. St. Luke’s quit claim on its church property was for $33.33, {{as an example of the}} settlement. A prominent local attorney, and member of the parish, Joseph M. Fletcher also participated in this legal action.|$|R

Spatial patterns and time-frequency characteristics of subseasonal variability are documented based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) decomposition and wavelet analysis. Despite the land contamination of the TMI satellite data within approximately 100 km off the coast the first EOF of SST anomalies allows characterizing the coastal upwelling variability at the subseasonal scale. Two regimes of variability are evidenced: a submonthly (2 - 30 days) regime with a dominant 11 days oscillation and a lower frequency intraseasonal (30 - 90 days) regime with a dominant 61 days oscillation. Both regimes are modulated, to a large extent, by the local surface wind stress and are consistent with Ekman dynamics. The seasonality of the relationship between wind stress and SST for submonthly (intraseasonal) regime is characterized by a marked semiannual (annual) cycle, which is explained in terms of the impact of seasonal change of the upper ocean stratification on the vertical advection process. The wind-driven SST subseasonal variability is shown to be associated with eastward propagating disturbances in the midlatitudes corresponding to a wave number 4. The results also suggest an important role of the Antarctic Oscillation in modulating the intraseasonal wind-driven SST variability. The characteristics of the equatorial intraseasonal Kelvin waves are documented in order to discuss possible impact of remote oceanic forcing on SST variability along the coast in the Benguela upwelling system...|$|R

Resistance of t(11; 18) positive gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma to Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. 	Lancet. 2001 Jan 6; 357 (9249) : 39 - 40. [URL] associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is characterized by t(11; 18) (q 21;q 21) /API 2 -MALT 1, t(1; 14) (p 22;q 32) /BCL 10 -IGH and t(14; 18) (q 32;q 21) /IGH-MALT 1, which commonly activate the NF-κB pathway. Gastric MALT lymphomas harbouring such translocation do not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication, while those without translocation can be cured by antibiotics. To understand the molecular mechanism of MALT lymphoma with and without chromosome translocation, 24 cases (15 translocation-positive and 9 translocation-negative) of MALT lymphomas together with 7 follicular lymphomas and 7 mantle cell lymphomas were analysed by Affymetrix gene expression microarray platform. Unsupervised clustering showed that cases of MALT lymphoma were clustered as a single branch. However, within the MALT lymphoma group, translocation-positive cases were intermingled with translocation-negative cases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the NF-κB target genes and 4394 additional gene sets covering various cellular pathways, biological processes and molecular functions showed that translocation-positive MALT lymphomas were characterized by an enhanced expression of NF-κB target genes, particularly TLR 6, CCR 2, CD 69 and BCL 2, while translocation-negative cases were featured by active inflammatory and immune responses, such as IL 8, CD 86, CD 28 and ICOS. Separate analyses of the genes differentially expressed between translocation-positive and negative cases and measurement of gene ontology term in these differentially expressed genes by hypergeometric test reinforced the above findings by GSEA. The differential expression of these NF-κB target genes between MALT lymphoma with and without translocation was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry or Western blot. Expression of TLR 6, in the presence of TLR 2, enhanced both API 2 -MALT 1 and BCL 10 mediated NF-κB activation in vitro. In addition, there was cooperation between expression of BCL 10, MALT 1 or API 2 -MALT 1, and stimulation of the antigen receptor or CD 40 or TLR in NF-κB activation as shown by both reporter assay and IκBα degradation. Interestingly, expression of BCL 10 but not API 2 -MALT 1 and MALT 1, in the presence of LPS stimulation, also triggered IκBβ degradation, suggesting activation of different NF-κB dimers between these oncogenic products. Study by co-immunoprecipitation showed that BCL 10 directly interacts with MALT 1. Sub-cellular localisation experiments in BJAB B-cells, showed that BCL 10 localisation was affected by MALT 1. When BCL 10 was over-expressed, the protein was predominantly expressed in the nuclei, but when MALT 1 was over-expressed, BCL 10 was mainly localised in the cytoplasm. When both BCL 10 and MALT 1 were over-expressed, BCL 10 was expressed in the cytoplasm in the early hours when the protein level was low, but in both the cytoplasm and nuclei after 9 hours when the protein level was high. Over-expression of API 2 -MALT 1 did not shown any apparent effect on BCL 10 sub-cellular localisation in vitro. Finally, comparison of MALT lymphoma expression microarray with other lymphomas showed lactoferrin to be highly expressed in MALT lymphoma. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR, showing lactoferrin to be significantly over-expressed in MALT lymphoma compared to FL and MCL. Thus lactoferrin may be a potential marker for MALT lymphoma...|$|R

Las mutaciones en H-Ras inducen a la carcinogénesis y han sido frecuentemente detectadas en los tumores de los pacientes (30 %) con melanoma, cáncer oral, de riñón y vejiga Para nuestros experimentos evaluamos las siguientes líneas celulares: 1) Células HeLa transfectadas en forma transiente, y que sobreexpresaban las proteínas H-Ras de nuestro interés en forma separada (vectores PRK 5); 2) Fibroblastos embrionarios de ratón knock-out H-Ras (-/-) o bien doble knock-out H-Ras (-/-), N-Ras (-/-), transfectados de manera estable con los vectores pEGFP-p 19 ó pEGFP-p 21 y 3) líneas mutantes de fibroblastos obtenidas de los tumores extraídos por cirugía de los pacientes con Síndrome de Costello, el cuál es un raro desorden congénito causado por la activación en la línea germinal del oncogen H-Ras que afecta tanto a la proteína p 19 como a la p 21 (11 - 13). Nuestros resultados mostraron que las proteínas H-Ras promueven el incremento en la expresión de los miRNAs evaluados, y en forma diferencial, la p 19 incrementa la expresión de miR- 206 y promueve un estado de quiescencia celular en la fase G 0 /G 1 provocando una disminución en la proliferación celular, la capacidad invasiva y la capacidad formadora de tumores; además la sobreexpresión de p 19 incrementa la expresión de la proteína NM 23 H 1 la cuál confiere protección contra el daño producido al DNA por las especies reactivas de oxígeno. En cuanto a las líneas mutantes de los fibroblastos de los pacientes con Síndrome de Costello, detectamos que 1) la mutación G 12 S posee mayor capacidad invasiva que la G 12 A, y 2) una disminución en la expresión de miR- 206, la cuál ha sido relacionada recientemente con la aparición de rabdomyosarcoma en los pacientes por lo que se ha propuesto como un marcador del pronóstico de la enfermedad.

HRAS mutation analysis in Costello Syndrome: Genotype and Phenotype correlation. Am J. Med. Genet. A 140 (1) : 1 - 7 Ras is an evolutionary and conserved family of genes present in many organisms, in humans, Ras is conformed by three members called N-Ras, K-Ras and H-Ras located on chromosomes 1, 11 and 12 respectively (1, 2). Ras proteins act as a molecular switch, activating many signalling pathways through phosphorylation of GTPases; so their punctual mutations promote a constitutive activation in their GTPase function that fosters carcinogenesis, loss of adhesion and invasion of malignant cells (3 - 9). In the case of H-Ras, 30 % of the malignant tumours analyzed have showed mutations and they were frequently detected in melanoma, thyroid, oral, bladder, and kidney cancers (10 - 14). H-Ras gene renders two different proteins by their alternative splicing called p 19 and p 21 (15, 16); even though both proteins have the same origin, they differ in their size function and localization. P 19 and p 21 are similar in their first 150 aminoacids, but they differ in the C-terminal amino acid sequences, meanwhile p 21 contains 152 - 165 residues that confer the GTPase function, p 19 lacks of it. Nevertheless p 19 protein is smaller than p 21, is able to cross the nuclear membrane and then p 19 can bind with other proteins as such as RACK 1, PKCβII, p 73 and NSE (neuron specific enolase), (17, 18) forming protein complexes; which suggest that p 19 protein indirectly orchestrates multiple cell functions from the nucleus (19). For the experimental development of this PhD thesis we decided to overexpress p 19, p 21, or their mutant protein variants transient and ectopically in HeLa cells. Three mutations were analyzed in these assays: Q 61 L, G 12 S, and G 12 A, the first of them induces a constitutive activation of GTPase activity and G 12 S, G 12 A are both a frequent mutations observed in Costello Syndrome, a rare congenital disorder caused by germ-line activation of H-Ras oncogenes that affects both p 19 and p 21 (20 - 22). We also analyzed the contribution of p 19, or p 21 proteins in knock-out H-Ras (-/-) and double knock-out for H-Ras (-/-), N-Ras (-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs); these cell lines have the advantage that they do not show gene redundancy in their expression, so in other words this means that the absence of one member of Ras proteins does not cause that other Ras protein assume its functions. We also analyzed mutated fibroblasts obtained from tumours of Costello Syndrome patients in order to determinate the contribution of G 12 S and G 12 A mutations in this syndrome. A general increment in the miRNA expression profile was detected when p 19, p 21 and their mutant variants were overexpressed in HeLa cells, even though further experiments in our knock-out H-Ras (-/-) and double knock-out H-Ras (-/-), N-Ras (-/-) MEFs transfected with pEGFP-p 19 or pEGFP-p 21, we detected a differential expression of miR- 206 and miR- 342 when p 19 and p 21 were expressed respectively. In addition, miR- 206 was consistently downregulated in our mutated fibroblasts of Costello Syndrome patients which is agree with recent reports that have correlated the misregulation of miR- 206 with the development of rhabdomyosarcoma in these patients. In other hand, overexpression of p 21 (G 12 S) protein in HeLa cells showed the highest rate of invasion, followed by p 21, p 19 (G 12 S) and p 19 proteins; in further cotransfection assays (p 19 /p 21 (G 12 S) proteins); p 19 was able to diminished the invasion and in mutated fibroblasts of Costello Syndrome patients, the highest invasion capacity rate was conferred by G 12 S mutation. P 19 protein showed a low rate proliferation in double knock-out H-Ras (-/-), N-Ras (-/-) MEFs, further analyses of cytometry revealed that p 19 induces a quiescent arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase cell cycle. The capacity of forming colonies was also evaluated in clonogenic anchorage agar assays in which the presence of (G 12 S) mutation in p 19 and p 21 proteins contributed to the formation of bigger and more number of colonies. Additionally, overexpression of p 19 protein (pRK 5 -p 19 vector) in HeLa cells also conferred protection against reactive oxygen species emission overexpressing NM 23 H 1 protein, this effect was also detected in high ROS emission environment.

40|$| {{and social}} anarchy do not explain all the cases. Some cities are bypassed. Such global {{exclusion}} {{is partly a}} function of national ideologies. Tehran and Pyongyang, for example are cities where national ideologies have not encouraged global economic connections to the advanced capitalist economies. Fundamentalist beliefs, of a religious and political nature, have sought to resist the encroachment of a global capitalist, because {{of the fear of}} secular beliefs in the case of Iran and capitalist hegemony in the case of North Korea. However, cities that have severed themselves from economic globalization often find it difficult to resist the pervasive influence of cultural globalization, especially amongst the young. In the summer of 2001 it was possible to see graffiti on the walls of public buildings in Tehran, in English, lauding Madonna. Baghdad is an example of direct exclusion from the global economy. The city and the country have been subject to economic sanctions by much of the world since the 1990 s. Although the sanctions are widely breached in the primary sector of oil exports, at the tertiary and quaternary sector they are having a marked effect on global connections. Theorisation of the black holes is only at a primitive stage. Table 3 lists four ideal types of large, non-world cities: the poor city, the collapsed city, the excluded city and the resisting city. The table lists some exemplars. There are clearly connections between these four types and in reality most of the cities listed in Table 3 have elements of all four in differing proportions. Social collapse tends to occur more easily in very poor cities, collapse can often induce anti-capitalist ideologies that not so much inhibit global connections as justify the lack of them. The interconnections between the four types are indicated in the table by the repetition of certain cities. Thus Kinshasa and Khartoum appears as both a poor and collapsed city, while Baghdad is listed as both an excluded and a resisting city. Most of the cities exhibit characteristics of each of the ideal types. LOOSE CONNECTIONS Cities are connected in varying degrees {{to the rest of the}} global urban network. We can use the GAWC connectivity data along with population data to measure a city's degree of connectivity. Taylor et al (2001) calculated a connectivity value for each of their 123 world cities based on their producer services data. The values ranged from 0. 196 to 1. The most connected city, London had a value of 1, the next was New York with a value of 0. 976 all the way to Lagos with a connectivity value of 0. 196. Figure 1 plots the GAWC connectivity value of each of the 123 world cities against their population. The population figures were derived from Brinkoff (2001) who gave the figures for all cities with more than 1 million. For cities with less than 1 million, and this included 16 cities, the latest population figures were taken from the respective recent national census. Connectivity was conceptualised as a function of population size, a regression line was fitted through the data and the resulting linear regression is presented in Figure 1. The linear regression model allows us to identify the position of individual cities compared to the aggregate pattern. The value of individual cities varies from this equation; the difference is referred to as a residual. Those with a connectivity greater than that predicted by the equation have positive residuals, and conversely, those with a connectivity less than that predicted by the equation have negative residuals. The residuals are revealing since they indicate connectivity greater or lesser than that predicted by population size alone. The residuals are plotted in Figure 2 and the cities with the very largest residuals are noted. Tables 4 and 5 list the ten cities with the largest negative and positive residuals respectively. The cities listed in Table 4 are world cities that have a degree of connectivity less than that predicted by their population. This is a crude measure, but nevertheless provides a provisional look at loose connections. The least connected city is Calcutta, followed by Lagos and Karachi. From the previous discussion we would expect this pattern. The less connected cities tend to be very large cities in poor countries. Their weight of population is not matched by the corresponding amount of producer service activity found in the rest of the world. Further down the table are found Kiev and Pittsburgh. The economy of Ukraine has collapsed in recent years while Pittsburgh has witnessed severe deindustrialization whilst many of the producer service functions can easily be handled by large cities close by such as New York and Philadelphia. The more connected cities, shown in Table 5 include London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore and a strong representation of European cities as well as Toronto. London and New York, despite their huge populations are more connected than any other cities, a function of the centrality in the global urban network. The remaining cities are much smaller but have significant connectivity. The results are more suggestive than definitive but they suggest cities differentially connected to the global urban hierarchy in which broad patterns of national wealth and the size of the local economy play a significant role. It is important to note in passing that the largest positive residuals are substantially larger than the largest negative residuals, which suggests that the network is dominated by a small number of exceedingly well-connected cities. The residual value for London is almost six times the size of the value for Pittsburgh for example. The results suggest a global urban network dominated by a few key cities with London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore providing global coverage. CONCLUSIONS This paper has been a rudimentary exploratory empirical analysis that focussed attention on the missing gaps rather than the connected nodes of the global urban network. The data sets were not ideal and the analysis was relatively crude. It did not discuss the issue of scale. For example, global cities have marginalized populations while black holes also have transnational elites. The analysis has been pitched at an aggregate scale. However, despite the obvious failings, the most startling point is to what extent this simple analysis managed to pick up some obvious examples of global disconnect. Poverty, economic and social collapse, exclusion and resistance were posited as reasons for the existence of very large cities with few global economic connections. Four ideal types were suggested: poor city, collapsed city, excluded city and resisting city. These cities were either ignored, abandoned, or excluded by global capital or were sites of resistance against capitalist incorporation. The picture of loose connections presents a similar picture of large poor cities in Asia and Africa much less connected than London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore. The absolute values suggest a network dominated by a few very well connected cities. The study has been exploratory. Clearly, further work is desirable. However, the paper has provided the empirical beginnings for a debate on the uneven nature of globalization. Theorized case studies of less-connected cities present an intriguing opportunity to understand and explore the underside of globalization. Silences and voids are also part of globalization. It is just as important to identify the black holes and loose connections as well as the important nodes of the global urban network. REFERENCES Beaverstock, J. V., Smith, R. G. and Taylor, P. G.
