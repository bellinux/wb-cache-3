25|$|When {{a person}} {{performs}} two tasks simultaneously or in overlapping fashion, the BOLD response {{is expected to}} add linearly. This is a fundamental assumption of many fMRI studies. Linear addition means the only operation allowed on the individual responses before they are combined (added together) is a separate scaling of each. Since scaling is just multiplication by a constant number, this means an event that evokes, say, twice the <b>neural</b> <b>response</b> as another, can be modeled as the first event presented twice simultaneously. The HDR for the doubled-event is then just double that of the single event.|$|E
25|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes, and which is found in all air-breathing vertebrates. It optimizes respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain which allows staying underwater for extended periods of time. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins, muskrats), but exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered specifically by chilling the face and breath-hold. The most noticeable effects are on the cardiovascular system, which displays peripheral vasoconstriction, slowed pulse rate, redirection of blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, release of red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but the apnea, bradycardia, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals as a <b>neural</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of spastic CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The spasticity can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep spastic CP well-managed. If the spasticity {{is too much for}} the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, baclofen, or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the spasticity by reducing the excitatory <b>neural</b> <b>response</b> in the nerves causing it).|$|E

40|$|Results {{from human}} neuroimaging studies {{consistently}} demonstrate that obesity {{is associated with}} altered neural reward processing of food-relevant cues. These observations have caused some investigators to question whether behavioral interventions such as dietary manipulations or physical activity might modulate processing of food cues in reward-related brain regions. The use of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to measure <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli is a commonly utilized paradigm for assessing <b>neural</b> reward <b>responses</b> relating to ingestive behavior of foods in humans. Using this study design, limited evidence suggests that increases in dietary protein and participation in acute and chronic aerobic exercise may modulate reward-related <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli. However, data regarding the reliability of this fMRI-based paradigm to produce consistent results on multiple testing days and time course of responses following a meal have not been systematically studied. These data are critically important for the proper interpretation of existing literature and for the design of future intervention studies using this paradigm. ^ Therefore, the purpose of Study 1 (Chapter 2) was to 1) assess the test-retest reliability of fasting-state <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli and 2) document potential meal-induced changes in <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> up to 4. 5 hours after the consumption of a meal in overweight and obese adults. We hypothesized that fasting-state <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> would demonstrate good to excellent test-retest reliability and that <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli would be suppressed following meal consumption and then would return to fasting-state levels of activation by 4. 5 hours after the meal. Our results indicate that visual food stimuli elicits relatively consistent mean or group-level neural activation in reward-associated brain regions including the insula, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, and putamen. However, contrary to our hypotheses, the test-retest reliabilities of these responses were generally poor (high degree of within-subject variability) and responses were relatively unaffected by meal consumption. These results have important implications relating to the design of future studies including observable correlations among study outcomes, sample size determination, and statistical modeling. ^ Being cognizant of these considerations, the purpose of the two randomized crossover trials within this document were to assess the effects of dietary protein and fiber (Study 2, Chapter 3) and dietary protein and acute aerobic exercise (Study 3, Chapter 4) on <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli and appetite in overweight (Study 2) and obese (Study 3) adults. For Study 2, we hypothesized that higher intakes of protein and fiber at breakfast would independently and additively increase fullness and decrease hunger, desire to eat, <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli, and ad libitum energy intake at lunch. For Study 3, we hypothesized that higher protein consumption at dinner would increase fullness and decrease hunger, desire to eat, and <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli similar to our hypotheses in Study 2. We further hypothesized that acute aerobic exercise would decrease fullness and increase hunger, desire to eat, and <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli only when performed prior to the consumption of a normal protein dinner. ^ Higher protein breakfasts in Study 2 transiently decreased desire to eat compared to normal protein breakfasts, and hunger was increased on exercise compared to rest in Study 3. Appetite and <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to visual food stimuli were otherwise not influenced by the interventions in either study. Collectively, the results of these intervention studies do not support higher intakes of dietary protein and fiber or acute aerobic exercise as significant modulators of neural reward-based ingestive behavior in overweight and obese adults. ...|$|R

The current study investigated whether oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide that {{has been linked to}} empathic concern and in-group favoritism, contributes to the racial bias in empathic <b>neural</b> <b>responses.</b> Event-related brain potentials were recorded in Chinese male adults during race judgments on Asian and Caucasian faces expressing pain or showing a neutral expression after intranasal self-administration of OT or placebo.

However, {{the degree to which}} the <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> to slow amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) are capable of conveying independent time-varying information, particularly with respect to speech communication, is unclear. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) study, participants listened to amplitude- and frequency-modulated narrow-band noises with a 3 -Hz modulation rate, and the resulting <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> were compared. Spectral analyses revealed similar spectral amplitude peaks for AM and FM at the stimulation frequency (3 Hz), but amplitude at the second harmonic frequency (6 Hz) was much higher for FM than for AM. Moreover, the phase delay of <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> with respect to the full-band stimulus envelope was shorter for FM than for AM. Finally, the critical analysis involved classification of single trials as being in response to either AM or FM based on either phase or amplitude information.

ICC-DMP, with receptor tyrosine kinase Kit-like immunoreactivity, appear first in the jejunum and then in the ileum. We performed electrophysiological experiments on mice immediately after birth (P 0) or at 10 days post partum (P 10) to determine whether <b>neural</b> <b>responses</b> follow development of ICC-DMP.
