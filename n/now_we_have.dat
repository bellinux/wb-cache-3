5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
25|$|Wettstein knew 112 {{minuscule}} codices of the Gospels, 58 of the Acts, 60 of St. Paul, and 28 of the Apocalypse. Manuscripts of the Gospels with number 260–469 {{were added}} to the list by Scholz (1794–1852). Gregory in 1908 knew 2292 all minuscule manuscripts of the New Testament. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 2911 minuscule codices catalogued by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF) in Münster.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, K'inich Kan B'alam I began ambitious projects, {{including}} the Group of the Crosses. Thanks to numerous works begun during his government, <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> portraits of this king, found in various sculptures. His brother succeeded him continuing {{with the same}} enthusiasm of construction and art, reconstructing and enlarging {{the north side of}} the Palace. Thanks to the reign of these three kings, B'aakal had a century of growing and splendor.|$|E
500|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the machine, but <b>we</b> didn't <b>have</b> {{the keys}} and we couldn't very well require Bertrand to keep on {{supplying}} us with the keys every month ... The situation had reversed itself: before, we'd had the keys but <b>we</b> hadn't <b>had</b> the machine — we solved the machine; <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the machine but <b>we</b> didn't <b>have</b> the keys. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to work out methods to find the daily keys.|$|R
60|$|We gripped each other. We shrank {{back and}} found the door. It gave to our push. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> were in the {{passages}} again, and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> reached our room.|$|R
60|$|By <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> reached {{our camp}} and here I found Umslopogaas {{sitting in the}} doorway and staring at the sky.|$|R
25|$|Our fighters {{control the}} perimeter. We control Timbuktu completely. We control Gao completely. It's Ansar Dine that {{commands}} {{the north of}} Mali. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> every opportunity to apply sharia. Sharia {{does not require a}} majority vote. It's not democracy. It's the divine law that was set out by God to be followed by his slaves. One hundred percent of the north of Mali is Muslim, and even if they don't want this, they need to go along with it.|$|E
25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and poor is {{enormous}} in a country that was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of achieving social justice that would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E
25|$|I {{find that}} while the Catholic {{population}} has increased a third, the churches and priests have doubled in number. In 1854 there was no religious community. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a monastery of Benedictines, another of Passionists, a mother-house of Sisters of Charity, conducting seventeen different establishments; two convents of Benedictine nuns, two others of German Sisters of Notre Dame and two others of the Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis. In 1854 there was no institution of learning; to-day we have a flourishing college and a diocesan seminary, an academy for young ladies, a boarding school for boys, and parish schools attached to almost all the parishes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> arranged, through notes {{exchanged}} [...] Early that afternoon, At Number Four to waltz no more, [...] But {{to sit in}} {{the dusk}} and spoon.|$|R
5000|$|Until <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{sequences}} of integers from 0 to , {{in order to}} have {{sequences of}} , one can divide a sequences of integers by its period [...]|$|R
60|$|He seems sent by Providence, {{for just}} <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been {{discussing}} {{how we should}} broach our remarkable situation to these Utopians before our money is spent.|$|R
25|$|These factors led to {{the shift}} of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, {{and at one point}} there was bronze as well. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the {{individual}} taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).|$|E
500|$|... "The musicindustry... {{were selling}} [...] quite expensively actually, that fostered a {{generally}} quite lazy attitude within recordcompanies... Suddenly <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{a quite different}} situation which it seems to me, artists understand much better than recordcompanies do... oung artists are very comfortable with starting their careers on Facebook or MySpace or something like that—and they're {{way ahead of the}} recordcompanies in some respects." ...|$|E
500|$|American Recordings was {{partially}} absorbed by Columbia Records in early 1998. [...] Though the arrangement preserved the American label, The Black Crowes transferred to Columbia after privately expressing {{their desire to}} disassociate themselves from American Recordings founder Rick Rubin. [...] Despite working under a larger label, the band felt they had more freedom and support under Columbia; Chris remarked, [...] "At American, I never knew what a record company did. [...] We never had an A guy. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a product manager.... It's like... I didn't know what the music business was." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> arranged, through notes {{exchanged}} [...] Early that afternoon, [...] At Number Four to waltz no more, [...] But {{to sit in}} {{the dusk}} and spoon.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> been {{maintaining}} an armed truce {{with each other}} since my resolve {{to go up to}} Cambridge, and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> out all that had accumulated between us. There had been stupendous accumulations....|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "not <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> {{better go}} some {{morning when the}} troops are parading there. <b>We</b> must go <b>now</b> and look out our lodgings." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{the match}} Henrik Larsson {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he was disappointed to have scored two goals in the final and still come away with a runners up medal. Larsson stated that there was nothing to be happy about the outcome of the final. He told BBC Sport, [...] "I've said before, I'd much rather not score and be able to lift the UEFA Cup, than to score twice and finish up on the losing side. There's nothing to be happy about, but <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to find a way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 2016, then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew {{announced}} plans to add Tubman {{to the front of}} the twenty-dollar bill, moving President Andrew Jackson to the rear of the bill. Lew instructed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to expedite the redesign process, though the new bill would not enter circulation until after 2020. Steven Mnuchin, the current U.S. Treasury Secretary, said that he will not commit to putting Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill, explaining [...] "People have been on the bills for a long period of time. This is something we’ll consider; right <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a lot more important issues to focus on." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 November, Benfica hosted Celtic; {{they scored}} two {{goals in the}} first 25 minutes and a third through Andrei Karyaka in the 90th minute, winning by the same margin they had lost in Glasgow. Santos was happy with the win, saying, [...] "We knew he had three 'finals' and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> two. We are better now, with four points and closing in on Celtic." [...] Four days later, Benfica hosted [...] Beira-Mar for a Primeira Liga match. Benfica did not score until the second half, when in the 51st minute, Katsouranis headed in the match's first goal. Three minutes later, Petit scored the second and an own-goal from Beira-Mar made the score 3–0.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a daisy!" [...] Harry shouted; [...] "we {{could not}} do better if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been all Canadian half-breeds, chief. <b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better set to and bale her out {{as quickly as we}} can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{better be}} off," [...] the officer {{in command of}} the relief party said. [...] "Likely enough the Afridis will be down upon us, as soon as we move." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{better go}} in. Your father will, doubtless, {{have much to}} say to you, this evening; and your mother will grudge every minute you are out of her sight." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{whether it}} was Marvel's idea or the showrunner's to have Coulson {{promoted}} to Director and tasked with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. {{at the end of}} the season, Jed Whedon said [...] "They're one in the same. They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it's the name of our show. The second to last episode is called [...] "Ragtag", and that's a term we've used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a chance to start them over and figure out what it's like to really be a secret again." ...|$|E
500|$|The January 1938 Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, resolving the 1934 case, and {{the lifting of}} the {{injunction}} by an appeals court, sent the parties back to the negotiating table. Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt's New Deal policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. [...] "For several years <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been listening to a bedtime story, telling us that the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue." [...] The Saturday Evening Post dubbed Willkie [...] "the man who talked back".|$|E
500|$|In {{the home}} opener against the Brewers, starter Kyle Kendrick gave up two of Ryan Braun's three {{home runs and}} allowed six runs (four earned) in five innings for a 10–4 loss. The next day the Phillies again lost, 9–4, after the bullpen gave up five runs {{in the last three}} innings; three of the Brewers' nine runs were unearned, after two infield errors. They were swept in the series, losing the final game 6–2 (the first time since 2007 the Phillies were swept in their first home series). In the series the Brewers scored 25 runs on 38 hits, 17 of which were extra base hits. Sandberg said, [...] "The good news is they are leaving town. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to {{concentrate}} on gaining some momentum... " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shorted it {{out with}} this, so we could get close enough for a {{thorough}} check. It'll come back on in a second <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> better get behind the wall again." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> only to {{wait for}} Sergeant Corney, and, having seen {{what he could do}} in the wilderness, I had no doubt but that he would succeed in his purpose, which he soon did.|$|R
6000|$|... "They do {{not mean}} anything, Ibrahim; it is just an ugly way of talking. They all mean the same, 'very much' or 'very great,' nothing more or less. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better go on talking Arabic." ...|$|R
500|$|Two {{day after}} the game, Crusinberry wrote a column in the Chicago Daily Tribune opining that Michigan's offense was the {{culmination}} of the new, less brutish game of football:"The old time player, who did his stuff by brute strength, has given way to the modern man with a head full of tricks[...] [...] [...] And <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Mr. Yost's new Michigan team, with not a Grange on it, but with one of the brainiest players of the age in Benny Friedman and a lot of smart fellows to work with him. [...] Before Benny Friedman ends his career all the teams of the country, even the Navy, will have abandoned the old style football and will be using, or at least trying to use, smart and unexpected stuff. [...] It gains ground, it is spectacular, and it wins." ...|$|E
500|$|When Raghavacharya fell ill, his son Samudrala Ramanujacharya (popularly {{known as}} Samudrala Jr), wrote the {{monologue}} [...] "Sandhaana Samayamidi Inkanu Sairandhri Raalede..." [...] (It {{is time for}} unison and Sairandhri hasn't turned up yet...) for Ranga Rao. Since Brihannala was a dance teacher and Vijayalakshmi, who played Uttaraa, was a trained classical dancer, Rama Rao took two-hour long daily lessons from the film's choreographer Vempati Pedha Satyam for a month. Satyam also held a three-day rehearsals for Sobhan Babu with Vijayalakshmi to help him overcome his nervousness. For the scene where Sairandhri was tied to a pole and dragged on a cart, Kameswara Rao employed a body double. When the intended artist did not turn up, another was employed and the scene was filmed. This made Kameswara Rao remark, [...] "so <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a dupe for a dupe [...] ".|$|E
500|$|When asked {{during a}} Reddit [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] in October 2013 {{whether there were}} plans for a {{follow-up}} film, Guggenheim said, [...] "I think {{about it a lot}} – I think we need one right now." [...] In 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that the producers of the film were in talks over a possible sequel. [...] "We have had conversations," [...] co-producer Bender said. [...] "We've met; we've discussed. If {{we are going to make}} a movie, we want it to have an impact." [...] Co-producer David also believed a sequel was needed. [...] "God, do we need one," [...] David said. [...] "Everything in that movie has come to pass. At the time we did the movie, there was Hurricane Katrina; <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> extreme weather events every other week. The update has to be incredible and shocking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} wake him who sleeps in the cave," [...] I {{answered}} enigmatically, as we departed rejoicing, for <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{learned that the}} Kendah did not yet know {{of the death of}} the serpent.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} they mean to do with us, Luka?" [...] Godfrey asked. [...] "Will they hand us over to the Russians, {{do you think}}? Cowardly blackguards. I wish <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> fought at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --We {{want to hear}} more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. We {{begin to}} be {{interested}} in Mrs S. Till <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.|$|R
