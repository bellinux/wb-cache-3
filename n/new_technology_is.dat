5|$|Perfect Dark is set {{in early}} 2022, predating the storyline of the Nintendo 64 game by one year. Joanna Dark is {{a student at the}} Carrington Institute and she is eager to {{complete}} the final stages of her training. After completing her training successfully, Carrington Institute leader Daniel Carrington sends her on a mission to destroy an illegal cyborg manufacturing facility in the South American jungle. The facility is headed by Mink Hunter, a highly dangerous terrorist whose purpose is to produce high-tech weaponry for terrorist operations. Joanna manages to complete her mission by eliminating Hunter and destroying the entire facility. When Carrington contacts Joanna, she reports that, during her landing in the jungle, she witnessed an aircraft being shot down and made a note of the co-ordinates. Carrington soon learns that there is a UFO in the area at the time and that dataDyne, the world's leading developer of <b>new</b> <b>technology,</b> <b>is</b> getting away with the alien wreckage.|$|E
25|$|An {{excellent}} example of Eakins' use of this <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> his painting A May Morning in the Park, which relied heavily on photographic motion studies to depict the true gait of the four horses pulling the coach of patron Fairman Rogers. But in typical fashion, Eakins also employed wax figures and oil sketches to get the final effect he desired.|$|E
25|$|Even if <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> able {{to compete}} with {{traditional}} recovery boiler technology the transition {{will most likely be}} gradual. First, manufacturers of recovery boilers such as Metso, Andritz and Mitsubishi, can be expected to continue development of their products. Second, Tomlinson recovery boilers have a long life span, often around 40 years, and will probably not be replaced until the end of their economic lifetime, and may in the meantime be upgraded at intervals of 10 – 15 years.|$|E

The main results of this study and a further approach are described in this article...|$|R
25|$|A {{relatively}} <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> the electronically controlled 'active differential'. An {{electronic control}} unit (ECU) uses inputs from multiple sensors, including yaw rate, steering input angle, and lateral acceleration—and adjusts the distribution of torque to compensate for undesirable handling behaviours like understeer. Active differentials used to play {{a large role in}} the World Rally Championship, but in the 2006 season the FIA has limited the use of active differentials to only those drivers who have not competed in the World Rally Championship in the last five years.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Alstom {{was awarded}} an {{additional}} $117m 5-year contract with MARTA to upgrade its train control and SCADA systems. The <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> {{designed to provide}} MARTA’s rail team with more efficient operations, better communication between trains and stations, enhanced monitoring capabilities, quicker response times, and reduced maintenance costs. Included in the project is an upgrade for all 318 rail cars to install an enhanced Fault Identification and Monitoring System (FIMS) and full color driver’s display built by Quester Tangent. The new systems passed “mini fleet” testing in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a {{continued}} application of technology to bicycles: in designing them, building them, and using them. Bicycle frames and components continue to get lighter and more aerodynamic without sacrificing strength largely {{through the use of}} computer aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics. Recent discoveries about bicycle stability have been facilitated by computer simulations. Once designed, <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> applied to manufacturing such as hydroforming and automated carbon fiber layup. Finally, electronic gadgetry has expanded from just cyclocomputers to now include cycling power meters and electronic gear-shifting systems.|$|E

25|$|<b>New</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} {{and has been}} piloted by the US Department of Energy that may be better suited to real-time market pricing. A potential use of event-driven SOA could be a virtual electricity market where home clothes dryers can bid {{on the price of}} the electricity they use in a real-time market pricing system. The real-time market price and control system could turn home electricity customers into active participants in managing the power grid and their monthly utility bills. Customers can set limits on how much they would pay for electricity to run a clothes dryer, for example, and electricity providers willing to transmit power at that price would be alerted over the grid and could sell the electricity to the dryer.|$|E
25|$|One popular use {{for this}} <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> social {{networking}} between businesses. Companies {{have found that}} social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive, there are five major uses for businesses and social media: to create brand awareness, as an online reputation management tool, for recruiting, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and as a lead generation tool to intercept potential prospects. These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions {{on how to improve}} or change products or services. As of September 2013, 71% of online adults use Facebook, 17% use Instagram, 21% use Pinterest, and 22% use LinkedIn.|$|E
25|$|Proof of {{improved}} survival benefit from {{either of these}} two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers {{in a series of}} pivotal trials performed by Professor Christopher Nutting of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT, about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> called image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} level {{crossings}} {{depends on the}} location, but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would, on the approach of a train, wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks. Gated crossings became commonplace in many areas, as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock, and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman. In {{the second quarter of}} the 20th century, manual or electrical closable gates that barricaded the roadway started to be introduced, intended to be a complete barrier against intrusion of any road traffic onto the railway. Automatic crossings are now commonplace in some countries as motor vehicles replaced horse-drawn vehicles and the need for animal protection diminished with time. Full, half or no barrier crossings superseded gated crossings, although crossings of older types can still be found in places. <b>New</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> advancing to create new ways of protecting the railway from users of a level crossing, {{with one of the most}} recent being obstacle detection scanners fitted to some crossings in Europe.|$|E
500|$|This early launch {{did come}} with some trouble, as {{technical}} problems {{appeared in a}} portion of Xbox 360 units sold. The most well-known problem is the [...] "red ring of death" [...] and Error E74, which received (and still receives) {{a great deal of}} attention due to some users having to replace their consoles multiple times. Microsoft attempted to address this by offering a three-year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge. It also retroactively reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs. According to The Mercury News, new models of the console featuring 65-nanometer technology will address this and other issues; the <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> expected to reduce heat production, which will lower the risk of overheating and system failures; although, this has never been officially confirmed by Microsoft.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{the field}} of Cellular Microbiology has been {{expanded}} to incorporate investigation of the cell biology of microbes themselves.

Particularly {{in the case of}} bacterial cells, <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> starting to be used to reveal a high level of organization within the bacterial cells themselves. For example, high-resolution fluorescence microscopy [...] and atomic force microscopy [...] are both being used to show just how sophisticated bacterial cells are.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} it <b>is</b> {{presented}} how <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> influence democratization of diplomacy. Primarily, {{the advantages of}} democratization of diplomacy in the conditions of <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> explained. It is shown how increasing influence of non state players decreases the monopoly of state players. It is suggested that media and social network are catalysts of democracy. On the other hand, negative effects of democratization of diplomacy in the conditions of <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. The <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> as potential source of propaganda and vulgarization is described. Finally, although there are disadvantages of democratization of diplomacy in the conditions of <b>new</b> <b>technologies,</b> it <b>is</b> concluded the advantages surpass the disadvantages. The <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> raise the democratization of diplomacy for a general well-fair and {{have a tendency to}} reduce hard power and to strengthen soft power...|$|R

2500|$|A <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> being {{introduced}} to the consumer market currently. It was first shown at the 2012 Shot Show in Las Vegas, NV by Armasight. [...] This technology called Ceramic Optical Ruggedized Engine (CORE) produces a higher performance Gen 1 tubes. [...] The main difference between CORE tubes and standard Gen 1 tubes is introduction of a ceramic plate instead of a glass one. This plate is produced of specially formulated ceramic and metal alloys. [...] Edge distortion is improved, photo sensitivity is increased and the resolution can get as high as 60 lp/mm. [...] CORE is still considered Gen 1 as it does not utilize a micro channel plate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this same}} sense, filters lack precision. [...] They block out some {{valuable}} material {{along with the}} harmful material deemed “obscene”. [...] An example of this given in Justice Breyer’s dissent is the ACLU informing Congress during a hearing that filtering software “blocks out valuable and protected information, such as information about the Quaker religion, and web sites {{including those of the}} American Association of University Women, and the AIDS Quilt. [...] This is an extreme weakness of filters, something that will probably be used in arguments against them until, and if, <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> developed that is able to define and deem what is “obscene” and what is not.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} power, energy harvesting, also called power harvesting or energy scavenging, is the conversion of ambient energy from the environment to electric power, mainly to power small autonomous wireless electronic devices. [...] The ambient energy may come from stray electric or magnetic fields or radio waves [...] from nearby electrical equipment, light, thermal energy (heat), or kinetic energy such as vibration or motion of the device. [...] Although the efficiency of conversion is usually low and the power gathered often minuscule (milliwatts or microwatts), it can be adequate to run or recharge small micropower wireless devices such as remote sensors, which are proliferating in many fields. [...] This <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> being developed to {{eliminate the need for}} battery replacement or charging of such wireless devices, allowing them to operate completely autonomously.|$|E

An alternative empirical model is proposed and estimated which predicts that the factors that drive the intra firm diffusion process for a <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> basically time since first adoption, firm size and the other technologies in use. Our results also hint that as <b>newer</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> introduced older <b>technologies</b> will <b>be</b> used less extensively. ...|$|R
2500|$|Improvements in {{computers}} and treatment delivery technology {{have led to}} more complex radiotherapy treatment options. One such <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> using IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy), which can change the shape and intensity of the radiation beam making [...] "beamlets" [...] at different points across and inside the breast. This allows for better dose distribution within the breast while minimizing dose to healthy organs such as the lung or heart. However, there {{is yet to be}} a demonstrated difference in treatment outcomes (both tumor recurrence and level of side effects) for IMRT in breast cancer when compared to conventional radiotherapy treatment. In addition, conventional radiotherapy can also deliver similar dose distributions utilizing modern computer dosimetry planning and equipment. External beam radiation therapy treatments for breast cancer are typically given every day, five days a week, for five to 10 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|E Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. {{released}} the first colored e-ink displays {{to be used}} in a marketed product. The Ectaco Jetbook Color was released in 2012 as the first colored e-ink e-reader, which used E Ink's Triton display technology. E Ink in early 2015 also announced another color e-ink technology called Prism. This <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> a color changing film {{that can be used for}} e-reader, but Prism is also marketed as a film that can be integrated into architectural design such as [...] "wall, ceiling panel, or entire room instantly." [...] The disadvantages present within these technologies are that they are considerably more expensive than standard E Ink displays. The JetBook Color costs roughly nine times more than other popular e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle. As of January 2015, Prism had not been announced {{to be used in}} the plans for any e-reader devices.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the season, {{many species}} of birds, {{including}} the long-tailed widowbird, and rodents feed upon wheat crops. These animals can cause significant damage to a crop by digging up and eating newly planted seeds or young plants. They can also damage the crop {{late in the season}} by eating the grain from the mature spike. Recent post-harvest losses in cereals amount to billions of dollars per year in the United States alone, and damage to wheat by various borers, beetles and weevils is no exception. Rodents can also cause major losses during storage, and in major grain growing regions, field mice numbers can sometimes build up explosively to plague proportions because of the ready availability of food. To reduce the amount of wheat lost to post-harvest pests, Agricultural Research Service scientists have developed an [...] "insect-o-graph," [...] which can detect insects in wheat that are not visible to the naked eye. The device uses electrical signals to detect the insects as the wheat is being milled. The <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> so precise that it can detect 5-10 infested seeds out of 300,000 good ones. Tracking insect infestations in stored grain is critical for food safety {{as well as for the}} marketing value of the crop.|$|E
