2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Niamh and {{eliminate}} Keisha. Before announcing his decision he said, [...] "First, I'm {{going to say}} this is a complete and utter travesty, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> should be in the bottom two, it's completely wrong. I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. I think you have a huge career ahead of you and all I can say is that I'll do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Remember," [...] Mr. Bundercombe added, {{his voice}} {{suddenly}} very stern and threatening, [...] "that {{through all the}} years that man--your rightful partner-- has been in prison, through all the agony of his trial, the humiliation of his sentence, the name <b>of</b> <b>neither</b> one <b>of</b> <b>you</b> has passed his lips! Is it your wish that the truth shall now be told?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she changed}} the subject abruptly. [...] "Aunt, {{if you want to}} catch the New York mail, you will have to answer that letter to-night. <b>You</b> know that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> us wants <b>you</b> to go." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. Then you <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> know anything. Your guesses are innocence itself {{compared}} with the truth.|$|E

2500|$|You {{mentioned}} Darfur, the Darfur {{region of}} Sudan. Fifty thousand {{people have already}} died in that area, {{more than a million}} are homeless and it has been labeled an act of ongoing genocide, yet, <b>neither</b> one <b>of</b> <b>you</b> [...] or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find [...] has discussed the possibility of sending in troops. Why not? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very well}} aware," [...] {{interrupted}} the duck, [...] "what your decision is. It {{is that by}} our own showing the frog belongs to <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> us, and <b>you</b> will eat him yourself. But please remember that lions do not like frogs." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{not very}} well, Papa; but, nevertheless, I will not return to Loughlinter. What I {{suffered}} there <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> can understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate, O'Neil, adventures {{cannot be}} so common as you represent, since <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> so far, has called upon me for aid or assistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There, my dear!' she said. 'Now {{you know}} the beginning, middle, and end, and all about it. We won't mention the subject to one another any more; <b>neither,</b> <b>of</b> course, will <b>you</b> mention it to anybody else. This is my grumpy, frumpy story, and we'll keep it to ourselves, Trot!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (After {{laughing}} incredulously {{and sipping}} his whiskey.) Well, Knox, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> us wins. <b>You</b> don't get the woman. Neither do I. She remains under my roof, and I fancy {{that is about}} all. I won't divorce her. What's the good? But I've got her tied hard and fast by Tommy. You won't get her.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{undertake}} to come aboard of me," [...] {{called the}} pirate, [...] "I'll shoot into you. You've got {{no authority to}} board me, and I won't have you do it. If you undertake it 'twill be at your own risk, for I'll <b>neither</b> ask quarter <b>of</b> <b>you</b> nor give none." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How stupid {{you must}} have been!" [...] said Babie. [...] "That comes of you, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> ever reading. You couldn't have done it right, Cecil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Give me your swords,' said Arthur {{from behind}} them, 'for <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> has vanquished the other,' and Owen turned {{and put his}} arms round Arthur's neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rosamund, freeing herself, [...] "it is I and no other, yet I {{rode with}} you all this way and <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> knew me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must be {{anxious about}} your friends, Rupert. I heard from Colonel Holliday just before I left England, begging me to cause further {{inquiries}} {{to be made}} for you. He mentioned that your lady mother was in good health, but greatly grieving at your disappearance. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> them believed <b>you</b> to be dead, and were confident you would reappear.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mind}} <b>of</b> <b>neither,</b> <b>you</b> see, {{was there any}} doubt of what must be the issue. The calm {{confidence}} in which La Tour d'Azyr had spoken compelled itself to be shared. He was no vainglorious boaster, and they knew of what a force as a swordsman he was generally accounted.|$|R
40|$|Do {{you recall}} {{as a child}} {{resisting}} when you were given two or more options, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> which <b>you</b> found palatable? For example, do your homework now or no television tonight (insert digital device in place <b>of</b> television if <b>you</b> were born within 20 years of this millennium). If you were like me, you complained, perhaps even rebelled, when faced with such distasteful choices. A funny thing {{happened to me in}} the last five decades, however: I grew up. Growing up means being confronted regularly with choices that you may not especially like, but have to make for the greater good — like choosing to work late, or spend Thanksgiving with your spouse 2 ̆ 7 s family or forgo dessert. Many people don 2 ̆ 7 t like the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. I speak to those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> who complain regularly about the failings of these candidates, those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> who believe that she is dishonest and he is unfit to be president. Most respectfully, to you I say: too bad. Life isn 2 ̆ 7 t easy; get over it. You need to make a difficult choice knowing that you will not be entirely satisfied with the person you vote for...|$|R
6000|$|... "What has happened?" [...] she demanded. [...] "Will <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> tell me? Is {{my uncle}} worse? Has any one--any one {{tried to do}} him an injury?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it has to}} be you. A half-share, and you and Leger {{can work}} the thing between you. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> is going to go back on me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Will they do so, Don Guzman? Or wilt thou and Amyas {{meet again}} upon a mightier battlefield, {{to learn a}} lesson which <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> yet has learned? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Floyd, don't be a fool. You've been on {{the border}} for ten years. You've packed a gun and you've used it. You've been with rustlers when they killed their men. You've been present at many fights. But you never {{in all that time}} saw a man like this ranger. You haven't got sense enough to see him right if you had a chance. <b>Neither</b> have any <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> The only {{way to get rid of}} him is for the gang to draw on him, all at once. Then he's going to drop some of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Understand me, Jim," [...] he said, returning. [...] "I've a {{head on my}} shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've {{got that}} ship safe somewheres. How you done it I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much {{believed}} in <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them. Now <b>you</b> mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch. Ah, you that's young--you and me might have done a power of good together!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; {{you better}} keep out o' the caffy. It ain't a fit place for you. Fact is, I weren't expecting {{anything}} so fine as you are. I laid awake till three o'clock last night figurin' {{on what to}} do. I reckon you'd better go back and give this outfit up as a bad job. I used to tell Ed you didn't belong to <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> us, and <b>you</b> don't.
