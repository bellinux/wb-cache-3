25|$|Setting this aside, however, opportunism was the key. Napoleon {{had been}} {{motivated}} neither by an altruistic desire {{to spread the}} benifts of freedom and enlightenment, nor by a gigantic strategic combination, nor by an overwhelming clan loyalty that made the creation of family courts the centrepiece of French foreign policy. Strategic, ideological and historical factors were present in his thinking, certainly, {{but in the last}} resort what mattered was, first, the emperor's character, and, second, the force of circumstance. Forever eager to demonstrate his prowess, impose his stamp upon affairs, and demonstrate his contempt for diplomacy, the emperor was confronted with a situation in which <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to stand between him and the stroke that was more audacious than anything that he had yet attempted. Never had he been more wrong.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, praising Gatiss's script which [...] "moved the drama and horror {{straight}} into the miniaturised heart of a rickety creepy dolls house, {{with a set of}} villains that— while never as memorable or scary as their look may suggest— used sound design to its most effective". He said that the main story [...] "soared", though the sidelined Amy and Rory left [...] "little impact" [...] in relation to the Doctor, George, and Alex. Russell Lewin of SFX gave [...] "Night Terrors" [...] three and a half out of five stars, saying that it had [...] "many great things going for it but perhaps hasn't quite got that little extra something that would have turned it into a classic" [...] and that <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> especially unexpected. However, he praised the shots of the doll house and apartment buildings, the sound, dolls, the acting of Matt Smith and Daniel Mays, and the idea of George being alien who created the reality.|$|E
500|$|The {{operation}} had two aims: {{creating the}} appearance of army units where none existed and concealing the real armour, artillery and matériel at the front. Barkas observed that [...] "the concealment of the huge assembly of the Armoured Corps was essentially a piece of military planning by Army Headquarters, with Camouflage carrying out certain specific tasks". Since {{it would be impossible}} to hide the existence of such a large number of vehicles, especially of tanks in the Martello area, Barkas planned instead to make the vehicles there quite obvious, as trucks, well before battle. The tanks, too, would be openly displayed, far behind the battle front. When the enemy saw that <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to be happening, the trucks would be replaced by tanks, masquerading as trucks. That meant that the tanks, too, would have to be seen not to move.so they would all be replaced with dummies. An unprecedented and [...] "formidable" [...] number of dummies were required: more than 400 tanks, 100 guns, and nearly 2000 soft-skinned vehicles.|$|E

500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|The Emperor {{experienced}} an unhappy and solitary childhood. He was considered precocious, docile and obedient, but frequently cried and often <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to please him. He [...] "was not raised in luxury {{and everything was}} very simple." [...] As his sisters could not accompany him at other times, he only had permission to meet them after lunch, and even then for only one hour. He had few friends of his age, {{and the only one}} he retained into adulthood was Luís Pedreira do Couto Ferraz, future Viscount of Bom Retiro. However, he was treated tenderly by Mariana de Verna and also by Rafael, who played with him by carrying him on his shoulders and who also allowed Pedro II to hide in his room to escape from studies. For the greater part of his time, he was surrounded by servants who only had permission to speak to him when questioned. The environment in which Pedro II was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw in [...] "books another world where he could isolate and protect himself." [...] Behind the [...] "pomp of the monarchy, of the self-sufficient appearance, there must have lived an unhappy man." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cowboys {{had one of}} {{the worst}} games of their season. [...] Payton's defense never gave them a chance to get into a rhythm, and Tony Romo threw for 16 {{completions}} of 33 attempts for 249 yards for a single touchdown and a pair of interceptions. [...] The Cowboys started out promising, stopping the Saints' offense and Julius Jones responding with a career record 77-yard touchdown run. [...] Though after that play, <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to go right. [...] Gramatica missed another crucial field goal, soaring wide right, and the only other touchdown came from a fourth-down pass to Terrell Owens that could have been an interception had cornerback Fred Thomas not had a cast on his hand.|$|E

Similar collaborations had been very successful in the United States, but Chant found an entirely different reception in Canada and <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> forthcoming. His fortunes changed in 1921 when Chant delivered a public lecture on Comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke, which had recently been visible in Canada. One of the attendees was Hollinger Mines co-founder, lawyer David Dunlap (1863–1924), who was bitten by the astronomy bug {{as a result of the}} lecture, and expressed an interest in Chant's efforts to build a large observatory. Before making any firm financial commitment, however, Dunlap died in October 1924 at age 61 (also see [...] ). Chant approached his widow, Jessie Dunlap, in late 1926 with the idea of erecting an observatory as a monument to her husband. Mrs. Dunlap promised to [...] "keep it in [...] heart for consideration, for it appeals to me tremendously." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a {{day when}} a victory would give the Patriots their third {{consecutive}} AFC East title, <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to go right for the Patriots as the Dolphins outplayed the Patriots to split the season series and give New England their first shutout since 2003, defeating the Patriots 21–0. [...] The first half was a defensive struggle with the only points coming from Olindo Mare, {{in the form of}} a 35-yard and a 33-yard field goal. [...] Even the punter, Donnie Jones, gave the Patriots issues as multiple punts resulted in the offensive unit starting within the five-yard line. [...] The furthest the Patriots drove into Dolphin territory was in the third quarter with the Dolphins leading 13–0. [...] Ending with a would-be touchdown reception by Watson, a play consisting of a lateral from Faulk to Brady was ruled penalty, as Faulk's lateral was an illegal forward pass. On the following possession, Matt Cassel took over the offense, but he too succumbed to the Dolphin defense and was sacked, fumbling the ball. [...] The Dolphins marched within the New England 10-yard line again but knelt to burn out the clock. [...] The loss gave the Patriots a 4–2 division record and 9–4 record overall.|$|E
2500|$|Houses loom {{large in}} Bowen's work (as {{is evident in}} Bowen Court, her 1946 book memorialising her ancestral house, Bowen Court, one of the Irish great houses, which {{she was forced to}} sell and which was {{subsequently}} demolished) and in The House in Paris the main setting is the house where Naomi and Mme Fisher live, which is characterised as full, stuffy, and oppressive: [...] "The inside of this house—with its shallow door-panels, lozenge door-knobs, polished brass ball {{on the end of the}} banisters, stuffy red matt paper with stripes so artfully shadowed as to appear bars—was more than simply novel to Henrietta, it was antagonistic, as though it had been invented to put her out. [...] She felt the house was acting, <b>nothing</b> <b>seemed</b> to be natural; objects did not wait to be seen but came crowding in on her, each with what amounted to its aggressive cry." [...] Naomi's deceased aunt's home in Twickenham is similarly described, though there is a suggestion of future redemption: [...] "the aunt's house was hollow, completely dead. But someone else would move in almost at once, and be here next spring, no doubt, to enjoy the cherry." [...] A third house is the home of Colonel and Violet Bent lived in Rushbrook, the house in Ireland that Karen briefly visited before returning to the Michaelis home in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London. But that Irish home is itself a replacement of an earlier great house, the ancestral home of Colonel Bent, which was burned during the Irish War of Independence.|$|E
