40|$|Wastewater minimisation {{in batch}} {{processes}} is becoming evermore important as environmental legislation becomes more stringent and fresh water sources are becoming scarce. Added to this, {{is the need}} for batch plants to occupy the least amount of space. Therefore, one would like to minimise any storage in a batch process, since storage takes up a large amount of space with relatively low economic return. Generally, in any batch process there are <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> that are idle at some point during a given time horizon. In essence, any <b>processing</b> <b>vessel</b> standing idle {{can be used as a}} storage vessel. Under correct conditions, the idle <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> can be used as storage for wastewater. This would mean that the size of dedicated wastewater storage is reduced and in some cases not even required. Furthermore, the capital utilisation of the installed <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> is greatly increased. Past wastewater minimisation methodologies in batch processes (Wang & Smith, 1995, Kim & Smith, 2004, Foo et al., 2005; Majozi, 2005) have generally accepted that there will always be storage vessels dedicated to the storage of wastewater. The usage of wastewater storage allows for greater reuse opportunities since it enables the inherent time constraint o...|$|R

For this purpose, we suggest double sensing methods by adopting both capacitive and optical sensing.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to model {{logistics}} for the downstream aquaculture supply chain interaction for increased production of salmon in the future. We employed a quantitative approach using discrete-event simulation, where we developed a model, replicating the real-world supply chain in MATLAB s add-on software Simulink. The output was basis for evaluations regarding system dynamics and flexibility, based on composition and throughput. Project limitations excluded human influence, {{as well as all}} commercial aspects, from the analyses. The motivation for the thesis was the Norwegian governments goal to increase aquaculture production by five-fold within 2050. Following this increase comes the development of farm sizes and locations, as well as an adapted supply chain. Such an expansion may include the introduction of additional transportation modes, like <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> and seaborne transportation of products to market. As a multimodal system, the challenge lies in coordinating the various modes, pursuing seamless integration between them. This is effectively assessed using discrete-event simulation, modelling the continuous movement of entities. The model was run several times with different system compositions and scenarios. These served to verify the model, establish a benchmarking fleet and test system robustness against external influence. Two crash scenarios, simulating emergency slaughter and waiting cage ban, were imposed. The results showed that delivery to market using the current day trucking system is efficient and reliable. However, a simulated expansion required a large fleet, which the introduction of cargo <b>vessels</b> could relieve. <b>Processing</b> <b>vessels</b> withheld transit-time to a minimum regardless of imposed scenarios, and were a contribution to continuity in operation. In conclusion, we showed that any system upgrade must be supported by equivalent infrastructure to increase system performance. Collaboration and redundancy through parallel nodes were key factors in ensuring system up-time. Further work should include evaluations on commercial competitiveness...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Optimizing the Pistachio Supply Chain and Logistics Network for Fresno County Using Geographic Information Systems Network Analysis Method Farnaz Daneshpour This study aims to {{optimize}} the transportation of pistachios from orchards to processing centers in Fresno County, California to improve logistics efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. This study evaluates the current transportation situation and compared it with the {{case in which a}} <b>new</b> <b>processing</b> center is built. Also, this study evaluates transportation efficiency based on calculations of total driving distance, driving time, fuel cost, and Co 2 emission and assesses how much of these variables will be saved if a new facility center is built. This study also explores optimal locations for pistachio cultivation, based on soil characteristics such as soil pH, type, and drainage class and compared these locations to current pistachio orchards. The study is based on data from 52 pistachio orchards in Fresno County, 11 existing large scale processing centers in the Central Valley, the current transportation network, and soil survey data. Location allocation and closest facility analyses using Network Analysis in ESRI ArcGIS are carried out on two scenarios; first for allocation of the orchards to existing processing centers and second, reallocation of orchards considering a <b>new</b> <b>processing</b> facility in the area. A Center of Gravity model is used to determine an optimal location of the <b>new</b> <b>processing</b> facility in Fresno County. Comparing two scenarios shows that there is 41 % of saving in distance, Co 2 emission, fuel cost, and driving time in a harvesting period by considering the <b>new</b> <b>processing</b> center in Fresno County. Locating the new facility center in the area can make positive improvements towards logistics efficiency and environmental issues...|$|R
50|$|The movie {{revolves}} around the true events of a Lithuanian man named Simas Kudirka, {{who was at the}} time was a radio operator on a Soviet fish <b>processing</b> <b>vessel.</b> When his ship meets at sea with a U.S. Coast Guard cutter near Martha's Vineyard in early 1970, Kudirka makes a dramatic leap from the deck, landing on the USCGC Vigilant. He announces that he wishes to defect, but confusion over U.S. policy on defections prevents the Americans from offering him asylum. As the crew of the Vigilant looks on helplessly, Soviet officers are allowed to board the cutter, beat and bind Kudirka, and drag him back to his own ship. This tinderbox political incident occurs during a Soviet/U.S. conference over fishing rights. The ultimate fate of Simas Kudirka provides the core of the script.|$|R
5000|$|Fish {{harvesting}} {{practices in}} the catcher/processor sector of the Pacific whiting fishery changed dramatically during the 1990s. The catcher/processor fishery evolved from an Olympic-style [...] "race for fish" [...] into a fish harvesting cooperative that emphasizes resource conservation and efficient production. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Pacific Council) provided the needed regulatory framework for the change when it formally divided the annual total allowable catch of Pacific whiting among three fishery sectors: vessels delivering to shoreside processors (shoreside sector - 42%); <b>vessels</b> delivering to <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> (mothership sector - 24%); and vessels that both catch and process (catcher/processor sector - 34%). During this same period, the Pacific Council also imposed a license limitation program for the West Coast groundfish fishery, which limited participation in the fishery to qualified vessels.|$|R
