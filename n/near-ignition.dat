40|$|The {{magnetic}} implosion of a high-Z quasi-spherical shell {{filled with}} DT fuel by the 20 -MA Z accelerator can heat the fuel to <b>near-ignition</b> temperature. The attainable implosion velocity on Z, 13 -cm/{micro}s, is fast enough that thermal losses from the {{fuel to the}} shell are small. The high-Z shell traps radiation losses from the fuel, and the fuel reaches a high enough density to reabsorb the trapped radiation. The implosion is then nearly adiabatic. In this case {{the temperature of the}} fuel increases as the square of the convergence. The initial temperature of the fuel is set by the heating of an ion acoustic wave to be about 200 -eV after a convergence of 4. To reach the ignition temperature of 5 -keV an additional convergence of 5 is required. The implosion dynamics of the quasi-spherical implosion is modeled with the 2 -D radiation hydrodynamic code LASNEX. LASNEX shows an 8 -mm diameter quasi-spherical tungsten shell on Z driving 6 -atmospheres of DT fuel nearly to ignition at 3. 5 -keV with a convergence of 20. The convergence is limited by mass flow along the surface of the quasi-spherical shell. With a convergence of 20 the final spot size is 400 -{micro}m in diameter...|$|E
