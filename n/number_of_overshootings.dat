40|$|The thermal {{structure}} of tropical cyclones (TCs) in different ocean basins is studied using {{global positioning system}} (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements co-located with TCs' best tracks. The objective of this work is to understand the mutual influence of TCs and atmospheric parameters in different regions. We selected more than 20 000 GPS RO profiles co-located with TCs in a time window of 6 h and space window of 600 km from the TC center in the period 2001 – 2012 and classified them by intensity of the cyclone and by ocean basin. The results show that TCs have different characteristics depending on the basin, which affects the cloud top altitude and the TC thermal structure which usually shows a negative temperature anomaly near the cloud top altitude. In the Northern Hemisphere ocean basins, the temperature anomaly becomes positive above the cloud top while in the Southern Hemisphere ocean basins it stays negative up to about 25 km in altitude. Furthermore, in the Southern Hemisphere the storms reach higher cloud top altitudes than in the Northern Hemisphere ocean basins, indicating that possible overshootings overpass the climatological tropopause more deeply at extratropical latitudes. The comparison of the TC thermal structure with the respective monthly mean tropopause altitude allows for {{a detailed analysis of}} the probability for possible overshooting. While the co-locations between GPS ROs and TC tracks are well distributed in all the ocean basins, conditions for possible overshootings are found to be more frequent in the Southern Hemisphere basins and in the northern Indian Ocean basin. However, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>overshootings</b> for high intensity storms (i. e., TC categories 1 – 5) is the highest in the western Pacific Ocean basin...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, tracers have {{revealed}} to be an invaluable integrated tool to investigate the different thematics related to coastal areas, shallow shelf seas or estuaries. In this work, they are used in combination with a parallel scalable Fortran 90 implementation of a 3 D hydrodynamic model to study the transport of mud within the Belgian Coastal Zone. The results obtained illustrate the need for tools to understand the interactions between such highly energetic coastal areas and the sediment dynamics. The Constituent Age and Residence time Theory (CART), originally applied to passive tracers, is therefore extended to describe the sediments and used to quantify their rates of resuspension and horizontal transport. This application reveals some numerical issues that may degrade {{the reliability of the}} results. The different numerical parameterizations are thus revisited starting with the use of advection schemes, and especially, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) schemes built along the line defined by Harten. It is shown that the blind application of the usual TVD schemes and associated flux limiters can lead to non-TVD solutions when applied to complex geometries. Spatial and/or temporal variations of the bathymetry can indeed break the TVD property. Hopefully, really TVD schemes can be recovered by taking these variations into account in the formulation of the flux limiters. Even if its Eulerian formulation eases the implementation of CART into existing models, it is shown that CART's computation procedure lacks a numerical framework for a robust application. To address this, we enforce the consistency, defined as the requirement that the integration scheme does not introduce errors in the age field when aging is the only active process. Unfortunately, this does not guarantee the absence <b>of</b> <b>overshootings.</b> While it does not seem feasible to ensure a TVD behavior of the age field, appropriate modifications of the flux/slope limiters are derived here to prevent the occurrence of age values outside the physically acceptable range. On the bases of the solutions obtained after the advection <b>of</b> any <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> tracers using high-order non-linear schemes, several control or global variables can be built. Even if the independent advection schemes used are specifically built to produce profiles free from the numerical artifacts that can spoil the physical meaning of the results, such global/control variables can exhibit these unwanted behaviors. This problematic is firstly treated with regard to the TVD schemes built from Harten's theorem. But guaranteeing the TVD property is not always feasible. Alternatively, appropriate modifications of the flux/slope limiters are implemented here to enforce a maximum principle for any global/control variable built as first-order homographic function of its components...|$|R
