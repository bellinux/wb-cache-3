The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & <b>Neonatal</b> <b>Nursing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M.

Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{describe}} the introduction, implementation {{and evaluation of}} the post of postnatal ward liaison <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurse.</b> Method In the X Hospital in Ireland there were 1075 short-term admissions to the Neonatal Centre in 2009, for observation, evaluation or antibiotic therapy, {{and the practice of}} separating mother and baby was identified as a factor in increasing maternal anxiety. The post of postnatal ward liaison <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurse</b> was introduced for a two-month pilot period to provide care for babies at the mother 2 Ì† 7 s bedside. Findings In the pilot phase the postnatal ward liaison <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurse</b> was involved in the care of 369 infants, reviewing each infant between 1 and 6 occasions. This resulted in a reduction of 66 cot days per year, saving ? 31, 416, for a cost of approximately ? 7, 815 in salaries. Conclusion The introduction of a postnatal ward liaison <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurse</b> is recommended as a means of providing safe, cost-effective and high quality care, while enabling more effective use of cots for infants requiring high dependency care...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} with the aim of discovering parentsâ€™ experiences of receiving family-centred care from the <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> of an Irish, Level III, neonatal intensive care unit. The objective {{of the study was to}} use the knowledge gained from the parentsâ€™ experiences to improve partnership between <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> and parents. A total of five couples were recruited using purposeful sampling. One taped, semi-structured interview was conducted with each of the couples that participated. An interpretive, hermeneutic approach was utilized to discover the submerged essences/truths of the parentsâ€™ experiences of receiving family-centred care. The four main types of family-centred care that the parentsâ€™ received from the <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> in the <b>neonatal</b> intensive care unit were: Comforting, Hit or Miss, Empowering, and Waiting for Family-Centred Care. It was identified from the interpretation of the transcribed data that all the parents had highly valued family-centred nursing care activities that were comforting and empowering. These activities from <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> included: facilitating kangaroo care, providing emotional comfort to parents, loving care of premature babies and teaching parents how to perform basic cares for their own baby. The primary barrier to comforting and empowering family-centred care was the busyness of <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> due to the high activity level of the neonatal intensive care unit. While recognizing the reality of austerity on government Health spending, these findings indicate that in order to provide individualised family-centred care for parents of a premature baby in the NICU, an increased ratio of nurses to babies is essential...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} grief {{reactions}} of <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> caring for dying babies. Methods: This study utilises a qualitative research design. Focus group methods explored <b>neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> 2 Ì† 7 beliefs, perceptions {{and experiences of}} death, dying, grief and loss associated with clinical practice in the neonatal intensive care unit. A deductive data analysis framework was employed to catalogue participant responses into corresponding constructs. Results: Data collected from the focus group interviews were aggregated in deductive analysis against three constructs: Acknowledgement of loss; recognition of the relationship; and inclusion of the griever. Conclusion: The findings from this research contribute to a definition of grief as a pervasive, highly individualized, dynamic process that often is discussed normatively within professional healthcare disciplines. <b>Neonatal</b> <b>nurses</b> routinely deal with grief and feelings of loss. It is important that a framework be developed to help understand the process and to guide appropriate interventions for ongoing support...|$|R
