40|$|Abstract: Although FDI {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{to have a positive}} effect on economic growth, the exact mechanism of how FDI impacts upon the development process of the newly industrialising economies is far from being well understood. This paper presents and tests two propositions on the role of FDI in economic growth from a newly industrialising economy’s perspective. First, FDI is a mover of production efficiency because it helps reduce the gap between the actual level of production and a steady state production frontier. Second, FDI being embedded with advanced technologies and knowledge is a shifter of the host country’s production frontier. Due to its dual role as a mover of production efficiency and a shifter of production frontier, FDI is a powerful driver of economic growth for a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economy</b> to catch up with the world’s most advanced countries. China’s economic success over the past decades provides an ideal example to test the hypotheses. JEL...|$|E
40|$|In a globalised and {{knowledge-based}} economy, {{companies must}} innovate continuously. Recent {{studies suggest that}} companies create multiple types of innovation and should expand the boundaries of their knowledge-production processes to cooperate with external organisations for innovation. Extant empirical studies of relationships between internal and external innovation activities, R&D cooperation, and types of innovation in developed countries have yielded mixed results. As a prominent Asian <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economy</b> (NIE), Hong Kong's innovation and technology management has rarely been studied. This study explores the innovation activities and performance of Hong Kong companies with operations in Guangdong. Using a survey - based on the community innovation survey 4 (CIS 4) - of 492 companies, {{we have found that}} intramural and extramural R&D, acquisition of machinery, and R&D cooperation are important for product, process, organisational, or marketing innovation.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} hypothesis {{has altered}} {{many of the}} common-sense ‘truths’ around which the social world is organised. * In particular, globalisation is thought to restrict {{the parameters of the}} politically and economically possible. Indeed, the notion of constrained choice is so pronounced that we are increasingly confronted with the image of globalisation’s ‘logic of no alternative’; an image which is predicated on the assumption of perfect capital mobility. Capital is considered to be sufficiently rational to take advantage of enhanced exit options from the national economy in circumstances in which its interests are served by moving off-shore. Moreover, global markets are also assumed to have exploited contemporary technological developments {{to such an extent that}} they now clear instantaneously; consequently, allowing capital to further its interests wherever in the world new profit opportunities arise. Thus, we are presented with the fundamental ‘reality’ of globalisation as currently narrated throughout much of the west: unless the market can be allowed to restore a competitive global equilibrium, capital will exit high-wage, high-cost western economies and re-locate in lower-wage, lower-cost, <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies.</b> Under the auspices of ever more hostile wage competition from the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies,</b> globalisation is commonly presumed to act as a trigger for an ‘inevitable’ job displacement effect as capital deserts the advanced <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

40|$|A central {{question}} {{in studies of}} the Asian <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies</b> has been whether the extremely rapid export growth of these countries {{can be viewed as}} primarily a phenomenon of income-elastic export demand or of fast-expanding export supply in the face of highly price-elastic demand.

40|$|Among <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies,</b> Malaysia has mounted notably {{comprehensive}} {{efforts to}} build a national innovation system. Despite continuously updating Science and Technology (S&T) policies to reflect prevailing understandings of successful innovation strategy, its achievements in technology development are mixed. Invoking Ergas' (1987) binary typology, this study finds that Malaysia's mission-oriented technology policies have been less successful than diffusion-oriented interventions. The government's institutional capacities have often been unequal to its more ambitious technology development goals, but sufficient to create effective infrastructure for the deployment and diffusion of advanced technology from abroad. Weak linkages between public sector technology agencies and private enterprises are a second limiting factor. Malaysia's experience suggests that the scope for deliberate efforts to engineer national innovation systems is constrained by institutional and political factors even when technology policies themselves are comprehensive and up-to-date. science and technology policy; S&T; national innovation system; <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> economies; Malaysia; innovation strategy; technology development. ...|$|R

The degree of synchronisation has fluctuated over time, with an upward trend particularly evident for the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies.</b> Synchronisation appears to mainly reflect strong export synchronisation, rather than common consumption or investment dynamics.

40|$|In summary, {{the returns}} to {{investment}} in education in Singapore tend to increase {{with years of}} schooling, with the returns to tertiary education generally higher than those for non-tertiary education. This {{is similar to the}} findings for other Asian <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies</b> like South Korea and Hong Kong. As the structure of Singapore’s economy shifts towards higher value-added and knowledge activities, there will continue to be an increase in the demand for skilled and educated human capital. We can thus expect the demand for workers with tertiary education to increase, which implies that the rate of returns to tertiary education is likely to remain high and above those for secondary and below education. Education will hence continue to be an attractive investment for individuals. ...|$|R

It is argued that the way the manufacturing industries respond to rising production costs, increasing protectionism, and growing competition from other NIEs is essentially shaped by the "politics of production', at the structural, institutional, as well as organisational levels.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} export growth for four of the Asian <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies</b> (NIEs) : Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Using the framework of cointegration and error correction modelling, it is found that, {{in the case of}} Singapore, income effects, competitiveness (relative price effects) and exchange rate effects are the dominant sources of export growth while in Korea’s case, these same variables are less significant in explaining export growth. In the case of Taiwan, income effects and exchange rate effect are more dominant than relative price effects and domestic factors such as exchange rate, and export prices have more significantly affected export growth in Hong Kong. Overall, the most significant variable in explaining export growth in the NIEs is the exchange rate. The empirical evidence indicates that the J-curve does exist for these NIE exports. ...|$|R
40|$|The renewed {{interest}} {{in the role of}} the state in economic growth and development has been focused on the four <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies</b> (NIEs) of Asia—Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Much of the recent literature tends to crowd these states into an undifferentiated model of the 'developmental state'. A closer examination reveals significant differences among them in terms of the state's relations to capital, labour, and the external economy that not only defy reduction to a single model but also show that options for moving away from labour intensive segments of production for world markets vary considerably. Furthermore, as democratisation movements gain voice, and as the transnationalisation of capital from within these economies proceeds, the high degree of autonomy associated with the developmental state is eroding, and its authoritarian uses of power are increasingly being challenged. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} rapid growth of China's share in the {{international}} commodity market and the structural changes of China's commodity exports. It demonstrates a significant improvement of international competitiveness in China's manufacturing sector. The panel data analysis, based on a Solow-Swan type growth model on China's 37 manufacturing industries from 1991 to 2002, reveals that the main sources of the strengthened competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector have been mainly from Total Factor Productivity (TFP), while labour productivity has been increasing and capital productivity has been falling.

40|$|Extract] In 1990 {{there were}} signs that Japan {{might not be able}} to sustain its {{economic}} dynamic, but observers were still confident that the Asian 'miracle' would continue through the region. Towards the end of the decade many East Asian countries were in a recession precipitated by the rapid exodus of capital that occurred in 1997. Dore (1979) demonstrates how employment relations reflect the stages of industrialisation. Before the 1997 financial crisis the leader in Asia was Japan, and there was a worldwide interest in Japanese employment systems and their transferability, both in the region and to Europe and North America. Next were the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies</b> (NIEs) of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, followed by a third generation comprising Malaysia, Thailand and the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) of the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC). On the horizon was a fourth generation of <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies</b> as diverse as Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and provinces of the PRC (Leggett and Bamber, 1996).
