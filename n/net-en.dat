This clinical trial represents the largest clinical trial undertaken on injectable contraceptives. After two years, the pregnancy rate with <b>NET-EN</b> (84 -day) was 1. 4 (± 0. 6 S. E.) per 100 women, as compared with the two-year rates of 0. 4 (± 0. 3 S. E.) per 100 women observed with DMPA and 0. 4 (± 0. 2 S. E.) with <b>NET-EN</b> (60 -day). Both discontinuation rates for amenorrhea and the prevalence of amenorrhea lasting more than 90 days were significantly higher with DMPA than with either <b>NET-EN</b> regimen. Terminations for bleeding problems were similar with the three treatments, despite a better cyclic pattern {{for the first six months}} with the <b>NET-EN</b> regimens. The three treatments were comparable with respect to discontinuation rates for other medical or personal reasons, and for all reasons combined. For family planning programs, <b>NET-EN</b> (60 -day) has the advantage of low pregnancy rates compared to <b>NET-EN</b> (84 -day), and a schedule of administration that does not change. Both <b>NET-EN</b> regimens produce less amenorrhea than DMPA. However, the <b>NET-EN</b> (60 -day) regimen has the logistic and economic disadvantage of requiring more frequent injections. All three injectable regimens compare favourably with oral contraceptives in terms of pregnancy and total continuation rates observed in clinical trial settings...|$|E

After 18 months of observation, preliminary findings are reported for 1, 589 women who received DMPA 150 mg every 90 days; 790 women who received <b>NET-EN</b> 200 mg every 60 days; and 796 women who received <b>NET-EN,</b> 200 mg every 60 days for 6 months, then 200 mg every 84 days. The overall discontinuation rates per 100 women were similar {{for all three}} treatment groups over the 18 months observation (61. 8 – 63. 5 per 100 women). The discontinuation rates for bleeding problems and for personal reasons were also similar for all three treatment groups. However, terminations due to amenorrhoea were significantly higher among DMPA users (12. 1 and 17. 4 per 100 women at 12 and 18 months) as compared with both <b>NET-EN</b> groups (6. 8 – 8. 2 per 100 women at 12 months and 10. 4 – 10. 9 per 100 women at 18 months).

40|$|Abstract Background In South Africa, where {{health care}} {{resources}} are limited, {{it is important}} to ensure that drugs provision and use is rational. The Essential Drug List includes depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (<b>NET-EN)</b> as injectable progestagen-only contraceptives (IPCs), and both products are extensively used. Objectives and Methods Utilisation patterns of the injectable contraceptive products DMPA and <b>NET-EN</b> are compared in the context of current knowledge of the safety and efficacy of these agents. Utilisation patterns were analysed by means of a Pareto (ABC) analysis of IPCs issued from 4 South African provincial pharmaceutical depots over 3 financial years. A case study from rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is used to examine utilisation patterns and self-reported side effects experienced by 187 women using IPCs. Results IPCs accounted for a substantial share of total state expenditure on drugs. While more DMPA than <b>NET-EN</b> was issued, <b>NET-EN</b> distribution from 2 depots increased over the 3 -year period. Since DMPA was cheaper, if all <b>NET-EN</b> clients in the 1999 / 2000 financial year (annualised) had used DMPA, the 4 depots could have saved 4. 95 million South African Rands on product acquisition costs alone. The KZN case study showed slightly more <b>NET-EN</b> (54 %) than DMPA (46 %) use; no significant differences in self-reported side effects; and that younger women were more likely to use <b>NET-EN</b> than DMPA (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions Providing IPCs on the basis of age is not appropriate or cost effective. Rational use of these products should include consideration of the cost of prescribing one over another. </p...|$|E
40|$|PhD, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandMany {{studies have}} shown a {{negative}} effect of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) hormonal contraception on bone mineral density (BMD) in women. There is limited information {{on the effect of}} norethisterone enanthate (<b>NET-EN)</b> on BMD and the effect of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) on BMD is inconclusive, however emerging evidence is showing that low-dose COCs maybe detrimental to BMD in young women. The aim of this research was to evaluate, in a 5 -year follow-up study, the possible effect of DMPA, <b>NET-EN</b> and COCs on BMD among young (15 - 19 years) and older (40 - 49 years) South African women. Method: This prospective study was conducted at the Commercial City Family Planning clinic in Durban, South Africa between 2000 and 2007. In the adolescent group women with no history of hormonal contraception who were initiating use of DMPA (n= 115), <b>NET-EN</b> (n= 115) or COCs (n= 116) and 144 nonuser controls were recruited. In the older group, one hundred and twenty seven users of DMPA, 102 <b>NET-EN</b> users and 106 COC users of at least one year were compared to 161 nonuser controls. BMD was measured at the distal radius and midshaft of the ulna using dual x-ray absorptiometry. In the crosssectional component of the study conducted {{at the end of the}} longitudinal phase, BMD was measured at the hip, spine and femoral neck in a sub-group of 96 of the younger women. Results: In the longitudinal study of adolescents, BMD increased in all four groups during follow-up (p<. 001). There was evidence for lower BMD increases per annum in <b>NET-EN</b> (p=. 050) and COC (p=. 010) users compared to nonusers but no difference between DMPA and nonusers (p=. 76).

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} hormonal contraception including combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and the injectable progestins depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone enanthate (<b>Net-En)</b> on the risk of HIV acquisition among women in South Africa. Design/methods: We analyzed data from 5567 women aged 16 - 49 years participating in the Carraguard Phase 3 Efficacy Trial. Participants were interviewed about contraceptive use and sexual behaviors and underwent pelvic examinations and HIV testing quarterly. We used marginal structural Cox regression models to estimate the effect of hormonal contraception exposure on HIV acquisition risk among women overall and among young women (16 - 24 years) in particular. Results: Two hundred and seventy participants became HIV-infected (3. 7 per 100 woman-years); HIV incidence was 2. 8, 4. 6, 3. 5 and 3. 4 per 100 woman-years in the COC, DMPA, <b>Net-En</b> and nonhormonal contraceptive groups, respectively (P = 0. 09). The adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) were 0. 84 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 51 - 1. 39], 1. 28 (95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 78) and 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 64 - 1. 32) among COC, DMPA and <b>Net-En</b> users, respectively, compared with the nonhormonal group controlling for covariates. Age modified the effect of hormonal contraception on HIV acquisition risk; among young women, the AHRs were 1. 02 (95 % CI 0. 46 - 2. 28) for COCs, 1. 68 (95 % CI 0. 96 - 2. 94) for DMPA and 1. 36 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 2. 35) for <b>Net-En</b> users. Conclusions: In this study conducted among South African women, hormonal contraception did not significantly {{increase the risk of}} HIV acquisition. However, the effect estimate does not rule out a moderate increase in HIV risk associated with DMPA use found in some other recent studies.

40|$|Observational {{studies of}} a {{putative}} association between hormonal contraception (HC) and HIV acquisition have produced conflicting results. We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies from sub-Saharan Africa {{to compare the}} incidence of HIV infection in women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or the injectable progestins depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (<b>NET-EN)</b> with women not using HC. Eligible studies measured HC exposure and incident HIV infection prospectively using standardized measures, enrolled women aged 15 - 49 y, recorded ≥ 15 incident HIV infections, and measured prespecified covariates. Our primary analysis estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) using two-stage random effects meta-analysis, controlling for region, marital status, age, number of sex partners, and condom use. We included 18 studies, including 37, 124 women (43, 613 woman-years) and 1, 830 incident HIV infections. Relative to no HC use, the aHR for HIV acquisition was 1. 50 (95 % CI 1. 24 - 1. 83) for DMPA use, 1. 24 (95 % CI 0. 84 - 1. 82) for <b>NET-EN</b> use, and 1. 03 (95 % CI 0. 88 - 1. 20) for COC use. Between-study heterogeneity was mild (I(2) < 50 %). DMPA use was associated with increased HIV acquisition compared with COC use (aHR 1. 43, 95 % CI 1. 23 - 1. 67) and <b>NET-EN</b> use (aHR 1. 32, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 1. 61). Effect estimates were attenuated for studies at lower risk of methodological bias (compared with no HC use, aHR for DMPA use 1. 22, 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 50; for <b>NET-EN</b> use 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 47 - 0. 96; and for COC use 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 41) compared to those at higher risk of bias (p(interaction) = 0. 003). Neither age nor herpes simplex virus type 2 infection status modified the HC-HIV relationship.

40|$|AbstractWhether use {{of various}} types of {{hormonal}} contraception (HC) affect risk of HIV acquisition is a critical question for women's health. For this systematic review, we identified 22 studies published by January 15, 2014 which met inclusion criteria; we classified thirteen studies as having severe methodological limitations, and nine studies as “informative but with important limitations”. Overall, data do not support an association between use of oral contraceptives and increased risk of HIV acquisition. Uncertainty persists regarding whether an association exists between depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and risk of HIV acquisition. Most studies suggested no significantly increased HIV risk with norethisterone enanthate (<b>NET-EN)</b> use, but when assessed in the same study, point estimates for <b>NET-EN</b> tended to be larger than for DMPA, though 95 % confidence intervals overlapped substantially. No data have suggested significantly increased risk of HIV acquisition with use of implants, though data were limited. No data {{are available on the}} relationship between use of contraceptive patches, rings, or hormonal intrauterine devices and risk of HIV acquisition. Women choosing progestin-only injectable contraceptives such as DMPA or <b>NET-EN</b> should be informed of the current uncertainty regarding whether use of these methods increases risk of HIV acquisition, and like all women at risk of HIV, should be empowered to access and use condoms and other HIV preventative measures. Programs, practitioners, and women urgently need guidance on how to maximize health with respect to avoiding both unintended pregnancy and HIV given inconclusive or limited data for certain HC methods...|$|E
40|$|Background Many women using {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are also}} at risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection, but data are mixed on whether hormonal contra-ception increases women’s risk of HIV. We investigated associations between HIV incidence and use of combined oral contraceptives (COC), norethindrone enanthate (<b>NET-EN)</b> or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in a cohort of South African women. Methods Participants were 4200 HIV-negative women aged 35 – 49 years enrolled into a cervical cancer screening trial. At enrollment, women were tested for sexually transmitted infections and reported on their sexual behaviour and contraceptive use. During the 24 months of follow-up, women reported on their sexual behaviours and contraceptive use and underwent repeat HIV testing. Results During the 5010 person-years of follow-up, 111 incident HIV infections were observed (HIV incidence, 2. 2 infections/ 100 person-years). At enrollment, 21 % of women reported using hormonal contraception, primarily DMPA (14 % of all women) or <b>NET-EN</b> (5 %). After adjusting for sexual risk behaviours and sexually transmitted infections, the incidence of HIV was similar among women using COC, <b>NET-EN</b> or DMPA compared with women not using any hormonal method [incidence rate ratios and 95 % confidence intervals, 0. 65, 0. 16 – 2. 66; 0. 79, 0. 31 – 2. 02 and 0. 96, 0. 58 – 1. 59, respectively]. There was also no association between increased duration of DMPA use and HIV incidence (P-value for trend, 0. 51).

Although addition of depot form of testosterone (T, 20 mg/month) to the regimen restored the behavioral response {{typical of a}} normal male, it did not reverse the azoospermic state. Serum T (heightened nocturnal) levels were significantly reduced (> 85 %, p < 0. 001) in all the treated groups. Evidence for blockade in spermatogenesis following treatment was obtained by DNA flow cytometry. Following withdrawal of treatment, the T level was restored to normalcy within 15 days but 120 days more were required for the animals to exhibit normal sperm counts. In conclusion, the efficacy of once-a-month injection of relatively low doses of <b>NET-EN</b> + E-Val to bring about azoospermia in monkeys, {{in a relatively short}} time, has been demonstrated.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} progestins, {{medroxyprogesterone acetate}} (MPA) and norethisterone acetate (<b>NET-EN</b> or NET-A), {{are widely used}} as female contraceptive agents and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Competitive binding revealed that MPA displays a higher relative binding affinity than NET-A and progesterone (prog) for the human GR (Kd of 4. 2 nM for dexamethasone (dex) and Ki 2 ̆ 7 s of 10. 8, 270 and 215 nM for MPA, NET-A and prog, respectively). Furthermore, MPA displays much greater glucocorticoid (GC) transactivation agonist potency than NET-A or prog (EC 50 s of 1. 1, 7. 2, > 1000 and 280 nM for dex, MPA, NET-A and prog, respectively) and much greater GC agonist potency for transrepression than NET-A or prog (EC 50 s of 0. 21, 2. 7, > 100 and 26 nM for dex, MPA, NET-A and prog, respectively). In addition, MPA induces phosphorylation of the GR at Ser 211 to a much greater extent than NET-A or prog and protects the GR from partial trypsin digestion in vitro to a much greater extent than NET-A or prog at saturating concentrations. Together {{these results suggest that}} the differences in biological activity of the progestins are not merely due to differences in their affinity for the GR but also due to the induction of different conformational changes in the liganded-GR.

MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P 4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IκBα genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL- 6, IL- 8 and RANTES genes, and IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR knockdown experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P 4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone. This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein synthesis. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ∼ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ∼ 4 - 20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at injectable contraceptive doses of MPA. These findings suggest that {{in the context of the}} genital mucosa, these GR-mediated glucocorticoid-like effects of MPA in cervical epithelial cells are likely to play a critical role in discriminating between the effects on inflammation caused by different progestins and P 4 and hence susceptibility to genital infections, given the predominant expression of the GR in primary endocervical epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between progestin-only injectable contraception {{and risk of}} HIV- 1 acquisition is controversial. Most clinical data suggests that the injectable contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), unlike norethisterone enanthate (<b>NET-EN),</b> increases susceptibility to infections such as HIV- 1. The {{first part of this}} thesis investigated the differential effects, molecular mechanisms of action and steroid receptor involvement in gene expression by MPA as compared to NET and progesterone (P 4) in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 and HeLa cell line models for the endocervical epithelium, a key point of entry for pathogens in the lower female genital tract (FGT). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P 4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IÎºBÎ± genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL- 6, IL- 8 and RANTES genes, and IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the cervical cell lines and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR siRNA experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P 4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX). This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein vi synthesis. This is the first study to show direct proof for a GR-mediated mechanism of action in anti-inflammatory effects of MPA. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ~ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ~ 4 - 20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at injectable contraceptive doses of MPA.
