It was still uncomfortable for me. When you're mentioned with him, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> fully understand what it means." ...|$|E
500|$|Yiftach Klein {{was cast}} to act {{alongside}} her as Yochay Goldberg. Burshtein remarked that Klein [...] "is {{a big star}} in Israel, and has played a pimp, a homosexual, and a cop (among many other roles), so I was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> could really believe him as this Orthodox guy. But his audition, and then his chemistry with Hadas were just perfect".|$|E
500|$|Rihanna first {{performed}} [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] on American Idol on April 7, 2010. She {{wore a black}} PVC catsuit and {{was accompanied}} on stage by guitarist Nuno Bettencourt; the set design included flame throwers and a video screen which showed guitars, lightning bolts and skulls. At one point, the singer picked and played up a black Gibson Flying V guitar. Larry Carroll for MTV wrote that the extent of Rihanna's ability to play the guitar was limited to playing it with one finger {{on one of the}} strings. However, he complimented Rihanna's overall performance, writing that her shoulder pads were [...] "nearly as huge as her presence". He went on to write that she [...] "half-sung, half-spoke" [...] the song. A reviewer for MTV UK agreed with Carroll, writing that [...] "halfway through the performance [...] donned a 'black flying v guitar' although we're <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> could say she 'played' it!" [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone praised Rihanna's performance, writing [...] "if the introductory rules of rock stardom are 'teach thyself to pick slide,' 'tight clothes' and 'pyro!' then Rihanna has been paying attention in her 'Rockstar 101' classes after all".|$|E

2500|$|Redford {{supports}} environmentalism, Native American rights, LGBT rights, and the arts. [...] He {{has also}} supported advocacy groups, {{such as the}} Political Action Committee of the Directors Guild of America. Redford has on occasion also supported Republicans, including Brent Cornell Morris in his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination for Utah's 3rd congressional district in 1990. Redford also supported Gary Herbert, another Republican and a friend, in Herbert's successful 2004 campaign to be elected Utah's Lieutenant Governor. Herbert later became Governor of Utah. Redford is an avid environmentalist and is a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He endorsed Democratic President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. Redford is the first quote on the back cover of Donald Trump's book Crippled America saying of Trump “I'm glad he's in there, being the way he is." [...] But Redford's comment {{was intended to be}} sarcastic, {{as the rest of the}} comment follows, [...] "He's got such a big foot in his mouth I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> could get it out.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You haven't {{answered}} her, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] he said. [...] "She put {{the whole}} thing in a nutshell when she asked--why shouldn't she." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> {{only said}} that for {{argument}} I should feel very badly," [...] his wife replied. [...] "But you know you love her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I see I {{have come}} to the right house,' said she, glancing at the lad, and smiling. 'But I was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> till <b>you</b> opened the door.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Ingleby {{would have}} spoken, but Sewell {{held up his}} hand. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> know how tight the place is, Tomlinson. If you'll listen I'll try to show you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty's eyes shone softly. [...] "We {{have been}} waiting for you, Walter--we knew you would come. Still, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can ever get quite back to where you were before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have struck}} bad luck," [...] said Andrew with a smile. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't deserve it, but that's another matter. And now {{give me the}} blankets: we'll take the things along." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> haven't," [...] he said. [...] "Now I'll go. Where did you {{get your}} violets, Martha? Had them in water since last night, haven't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No harm? You {{have done}} {{your best to}} get an {{innocent}} man hanged. If it wasn't for this gentleman here, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> would <b>not</b> have succeeded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't do {{to go for}} it at present," [...] he said. [...] "Are {{you still}} set on this divorce? I told you in my letter that I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> are right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} have covered about half the distance, Jack," [...] was the reply of the young driver. [...] "Still, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> know a boxsled isn't like an auto--it doesn't carry a speedometer." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} who sat beside her laughed. [...] "There must be, or you never would have {{admitted}} it," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> would find many folks who would believe you here." ...|$|E

6000|$|Again Lord Canterville had the air, unusual with him, of sounding, at some {{expense of}} {{precious}} moments, {{the expression of}} face of a visitor so unacquainted with shyness. “I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> ought to have done that, you know.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{those who}} can live as you live, {{it would be hard}} to find the equal of this part of England," [...] he said. [...] "But I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can keep it very much longer as it is." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Saxton, simply. [...] "I don't quite {{think it}} would. Still, I've seen {{enough to show}} me {{that you can take}} the {{sensible}} point of view. We both want dollars, and I can't afford to be particular. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I do {{not want}} to live in England, and you are taking too {{personal}} a view of the thing. Since there is Violet to consider your life is not your own to throw away, and I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> know how much she would forgive you.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether <b>you</b> {{would come}} this way, Martin, but I thought I would run the chance. There {{is no such}} thing as getting a quiet word spoken in the church or churchyard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Clyffurde abruptly, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> Thank <b>you</b> very much. I {{think that}} if you don't object to my {{somewhat}} morose company I would like a lift as far as Grenoble." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deringham {{appeared}} a trifle embarrassed. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> are indebted {{to me at}} all," [...] he said. [...] "I only seized his shoulder, and {{you would not have}} expected me to look on?" ...|$|R
