New restrictions are allowed to be posed on existing concepts. But, <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> are <b>allowed</b> on existing restrictions. We build a knowledge table from the ontology to be enhanced, to determine the consistency of an input submission.

This table intuitively stores property restrictions applicable to concepts in the ontology. Interactions between property flavors are captured in another data structure called influence tables.

50|$|Traditionally, tendons {{have been}} {{considered}} to be a mechanism by which muscles connect to bone, functioning to transmit forces. This connection allows tendons to passively modulate forces during locomotion, providing additional stability with no active work. However, over the past two decades, much research focused on the elastic properties of some tendons and their ability to function as springs. Not all tendons are required to perform the same functional role, with some predominantly positioning limbs, such as the fingers when writing (positional tendons) and others acting as springs to make locomotion more efficient (energy storing tendons). Energy storing tendons can store and recover energy at high efficiency. For example, during a human stride, the Achilles tendon stretches as the ankle joint dorsiflexes. During the last portion of the stride, as the foot plantar-flexes (pointing the toes down), the stored elastic energy is released. Furthermore, because the tendon stretches, the muscle is able to function with less or even <b>no</b> <b>change</b> in length, <b>allowing</b> the muscle to generate greater force.|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel transdermal 2 % testosterone gel was evaluated over 12 months in 220 hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes and/or MetS in a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study. The primary outcome was mean change from baseline in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes were measures of body composition, glycemic control, lipids, and sexual function. Efficacy results focused primarily on months 026 (phase 1; <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> in medication <b>allowed).</b> Medication <b>changes</b> were <b>allowed</b> in phase 2 (months 6212). RESULTS—TRT reduced HOMA-IR in the overall population by 15. 2 % at 6 months (P = 0. 018) and 16. 4 % at 12 months (P = 0. 006). In type 2 diabetic patients, glycemic control was significantly better in the TRT group than the placebo group at month 9 (HbA 1 c: treatment difference, 20. 446 %; P = 0. 035). Improvements in total and LDL cholesterol, lipoprotein a (Lpa), body composition, libido, and sexual function occurred in selected patient groups. There {{were no significant differences}} between groups in the frequencies of adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs. The majority of AEs (. 95 %) were mild or moderate. CONCLUSIONS—Over a 6 -month period, transdermal TRT was associated with beneficial effects on insulin resistance, total and LDL-cholesterol, Lpa, and sexual health in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes and/or MetS...|$|R

However, {{the construction of}} the High Aswan Dam has reduced the suspended sediment concentration downstream the dam and this reduction has increased the ability of the flowing water to erode banks and reduce their stability.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the so called ”plant-size problem”: a demand increasing over time has to be served by a firm when there are economies of scale in plant construction. Generally the operating firm is assumed to be a cost-minimizer. We depart from this by supposing that it is a profit-maximizer, namely can manipulate demand through its own price. For the properties of a simultaneous pricing and expansion capacity strategy to be exploited, we first fix the time points when the investment for adding capacity is undertaken and characterize the optimal policy in terms of the price and the size of investment. We show that the investment size is strictly smaller than the one realized if <b>no</b> price <b>change</b> is <b>allowed.</b> Then we proceed in the reverse way: we assume that the amount of investment is fixed and define the optimal policy in terms of the price regime and time points when the investment is realized and we prove that price manipulation induces the firm to postpone the increment of capacity. Indeed as for both the cases, prices are so charged to dampen demand and make it satified by the existing capacity at any time...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: β-Amyloid (Aβ) {{accumulation}} in cortical capillaries is {{a variant}} of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) referred to as capillary CAA (capCAA). capCAA {{is associated with a}} neuroinflammatory response. In vitro studies indicate that Aβ induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mainly generated through NADPH oxidase (NOX), by activated microglia. ROS in turn can induce altered expression of tight junctions (TJ), which are essential for blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Whether the function of the BBB is affected in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with comorbid capCAA remains elusive. Cases with capCAA and <b>no</b> other AD-related <b>changes</b> <b>allow</b> studying capCAA-associated BBB alterations independent of AD pathology. Aim: In this study, we have investigated BBB alterations in capCAA and addressed the role of the neuroinflammatory response. Methods: Human postmortem brain tissue with capCAA was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Results: In this study, we show {{for the first time a}} dramatic loss of TJ proteins claudin- 5, occludin and ZO- 1 in Aβ-laden capillaries. In addition, affected capillaries are associated with clusters of NOX- 2 -positive activated microglia. Disrupted BBB function was observed by increased presence of fibrinogen around the affected capillaries. Conclusions: Our data provide support for the early observation that neuroinflammatory response is involved in the altered expression of TJs in endothelial cells and loss of BBB integrity in capCAA.

Materials and Methods: Children who ophthalmoscopically revealed prominence and blurring of the optic disk with a comprehensive survey includes an ultrasonic scanning of the eyeball and orbit, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and retinal optic disc, computer perimetry, electroretinography (ERG) and the registration of visual evoked potentials (VEP). Results and discussion: Optic disc drusen is diagnosed by ultrasound scan that leds to prominence disk. <b>No</b> <b>changes</b> perineural space <b>allowed</b> excluding stagnation and avoiding the need for complex and invasive methods. OCT allows locating drusen, and assessing the degree of prominence disc and peripapillary retinal condition.

Drop of electrophysiological parameters (neuroglial index and amplitude oscillatory potentials) and increased light sensitivity of the retina of depression (from the expansion of the «blind spot» to a generalized depression with lots of scotomas) depend on the volume, the depth of druses and their proximity to the vascular bundles, characterizing the degree of compression glial tissue of the optic disc and hemodynamic disturbances.
