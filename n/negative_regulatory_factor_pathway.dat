40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{induction}} of the 4 -aminobutyrate-catabolic pathway by 4 -aminobutyrate requires two positive <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors,</b> encoded by the UGA 3 and the UGA 35 genes respectively. In addition to this, expression of one gene of this pathway, namely the UGA 4 gene encoding the 4 -aminobutyrate-specific permease, is controlled negatively by {{the product of}} the UGA 43 gene [Vissers, S. André, B. Muyldermans, F. & Grenson, M. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 181, 357 - 361]. We show here that the products of two of these regulatory genes, UGA 35 and UGA 43, also control the expression of the genes encoding the urea-catabolic pathway, although the 4 -aminobutyrate and urea-catabolic pathways are synthesised under specific conditions and do not share any enzymatic step or metabolite: the UGA 35 pathways are synthesised under specific conditions and do not share any enzymatic step or metabolite: the UGA 35 gene is shown to be identical to the DURL gene which was previously identified as a positive <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> of the urea-catabolic pathway; the UGA 43 gene product is shown to behave like a <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> of this <b>pathway.</b> In contrast to UGA 35 /DURL and UGA 43, the positive <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> encoded by the UGA 3 gene and the previously identified DURM gene specifically control 4 -aminobutyrate and urea catabolisms respectively. Northern hybridization experiments suggest that the UGA 35 /DURL and UGA 43 common <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> act at the transcriptional level. Our results show that the expression of two biochemically distinct nitrogenous catabolisms, as triggered by their respective inducers, seems to involve multiple <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors,</b> some of which are common to the two catabolic pathways.

40|$|The PHO 81 {{gene product}} is a {{positive}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> required for the synthesis of the phosphate repressible acid phosphatase (encoded by the PHO 5 gene) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetic analysis has suggested that PHO 81 may be the signal acceptor molecule; however, the biochemical function of the PHO 81 gene product is not known. We have cloned the PHO 81 gene and sequenced the promoter. A PHO 81 -LacZ fusion was {{shown to be a}} valid reporter since its expression is regulated by the level of inorganic phosphate and is controlled by the same <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> that regulate PHO 5 expression. To elucidate the mechanism by which PHO 81 functions, we have isolated and cloned dominant mutations in the PHO 81 gene which confer constitutive synthesis of acid phosphatase. We have demonstrated that overexpression of the <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor,</b> PHO 80, but not the <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> PHO 85, partially blocks the constitutive acid phosphatase synthesis in a strain containing a dominant constitutive allele of PHO 81. This suggests that PHO 81 may function by interacting with PHO 80 or that these molecules compete for the same target...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to phosphorus starvation, Neurospora crassa makes several enzymes that are undetectable or barely detectable in phosphate-sufficient cultures. The nuc- 1 + gene, whose product regulates {{the synthesis of}} these enzymes, was cloned and sequenced. The nuc- 1 + gene encodes a protein of 824 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 87, 429. The amino acid sequence shows homology with two yeast proteins whose functions are analogous {{to that of the}} NUC- 1 protein. Two nuc- 1 + transcripts of 3. 2 and 3. 0 kilobases were detected; they were present in similar amounts during growth at low or high phosphate concentrations. The nuc- 2 + gene encodes a product normally required for NUC- 1 function, and yet a nuc- 2 mutation can be complemented by overexpression of the nuc- 1 + gene. This implies physical interactions between NUC- 1 protein and the <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor(s)</b> PREG and/or PGOV. Analysis of nuc- 2 and nuc- 1; nuc- 2 strains transformed by the nuc- 1 + gene suggests that phosphate directly affects the level or activity of the <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor(s)</b> controlling phosphorus acquisition...|$|R

Blocking the action of <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> may provide a new approach for inducing HSCs into proliferation. A variety of {{studies have suggested that}} TGF-beta negatively regulates cell cycle progression of HSCs. In this study, a dominant negatively acting mutant of TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRIIDN) was transiently expressed in HSCs by using adenoviral vector-mediated gene delivery, such that the effects of disrupting the autocrine TGF-beta signaling in HSCs can be directly examined at a single cell level. Adenoviral vectors allowing the expression of TbetaRIIDN and green fluorescence protein in the same CD 34 (+) CD 38 (-) Lin(-) cells were constructed. Overexpression of TbetaRIIDN specifically disrupted TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Autocrine TGF-beta signaling in CD 34 (+) CD 38 (-) Lin(-) cells was studied in single cell assays under serum-free conditions. Transient blockage of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in CD 34 (+) CD 38 (-) Lin(-) cells enhanced their survival. Furthermore, the overall proliferation potential and proliferation kinetics in these cells were significantly enhanced compared with the CD 34 (+) CD 38 (-) Lin(-) cells expressing green fluorescence protein alone. Therefore, we have successfully blocked the autocrine TGF-beta-negative regulatory loop of primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} a <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor(s)</b> suppressing T-cell receptor alpha-chain (TCR alpha) gene expression in non-T cells, 10 independent cell hybrid clones were generated between mouse T-cell lymphoma EL 4 cells (TCR alpha+/beta+) and mouse fibroblast B 82 cells. These cell hybrids showed a typical fibroblastic morphology and retained an approximate sum of chromosome numbers derived from both parental cells. No transcripts of the TCR alpha gene were detected in the cell hybrids, although the presence of the rearranged TCR alpha allele from EL 4 cells was confirmed. The possibility of involvement of nuclear proteins responsible for the activity of the TCR alpha gene enhancer in the extinction of TCR alpha gene expression in the cell hybrids was examined. Nuclear proteins which bind to the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF- 1) binding motif present in EL 4 cells disappeared in the hybrid clones, whereas no significant change was observed in DNA-binding activity of nuclear proteins to a consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and the Ets- 1 binding motif between the parental cells and the cell hybrids. No transcripts of the LEF- 1 gene were detected in the cell hybrids, despite the retention of the LEF- 1 gene and murine chromosomes 3, on which the LEF- 1 allele is located, from both parental cells. These results suggest that a trans-acting <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor(s)</b> present in fibroblasts suppresses LEF- 1 gene expression and that suppression of LEF- 1 may lead to the extinction of TCR alpha gene expression in the cell hybrids...|$|R

50|$|Not only {{do certain}} HLA alleles {{prescribe}} increased or decreased resistance to HIV, but HIV {{is able to}} alter HLA expression, and does so selectively to avoid being eliminated by natural killer cells (NK cells). Research has shown that HIV downregulates Class I MHC expression in infected cells. However, doing so indiscriminately opens up the opportunity for attack by NK cells, because NK cells respond to downregulation of HLA-C and HLA-E. Obviously, this mechanism has put selective pressure on the HIV virus. Thus, HIV has evolved the capability to downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B without significantly disturbing the expression of HLA-C and HLA-E. A protein coded for by the HIV genome, <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> (Nef), induces this change by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the Class I MHC while it {{is still in the}} endoplasmic reticulum or occasionally while it is {{in the early stages of}} trafficking through the golgi bodies. This complex of MHC and Nef then causes adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) to direct the MHC to the lysosomes for degradation instead of to the cell membrane where it normally functions. In addition to selective HLA downregulation, <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> (Nef) enables HIV to downregulate CD4 and CD8. These glycoproteins are essential for, respectively, helper t-cell and cytotoxic t-cell binding to MHCs. Without these cofactors, both types of t-cells are less likely to bind to HLAs and initiate apoptosis, even if the HLA is expressing an HIV derived (non-self) peptide. Both of these proteins are also targeted at their cytoplasmic tail domain. The combination of these abilities greatly enhances HIV's ability to avoid detection by the immune system.|$|R

In yeast and mammalian cells, TSG 101 represses whereas DRIP 150 enhances GR AF- 1 -mediated transactivation. Thus, GR AF- 1 is capable of recruiting both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> that differentially regulate GR transcriptional enhancement. In addition, we show that {{another member of the}} DRIP complex, DRIP 205, interacts with the GR ligand binding domain in a hormone-dependent manner and facilitates GR transactivation in concert with DRIP 150.

In addition, repression mediated by the inhibitory component was orientation independent.

The molecular mechanisms behind DC impairment are still obscure. We investigated changes in DC function and association of key regulators of cytokine signaling during different stages of HIV- 1 infection and following antiretroviral therapy (ART). Phenotypic and functional characteristics of circulating myeloid DCs (mDCs) in 56 ART-naive patients (23 in early and 33 in advanced stage of disease), 36 on ART and 24 healthy controls were evaluated. Sixteen patients were studied longitudinally prior-to and 6 months after the start of ART. For functional studies, monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) were evaluated for endocytosis, allo-stimulation and cytokine secretion. The expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) - 1 and other regulators of cytokine signaling was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. The ability to respond to an antigenic stimulation was severely impaired in patients in advanced HIV- 1 disease which showed partial recovery in the treated group. Mo-DCs from patients with advanced HIV-disease remained immature with low allo-stimulation and reduced cytokine secretion even after TLR- 4 mediated stimulation ex-vivo. The cells had an increased expression of <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> like SOCS- 1, SOCS- 3, SH 2 -containing phosphatase (SHP) - 1 and a reduced expression of positive regulators like Janus kinase (JAK) 2 and Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) 1. A functional recovery after siRNA mediated silencing of SOCS- 1 in these mo-DCs confirms the role of <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> in functional impairment of these cells. Functionally defective DCs in advanced stage of HIV- 1 infection seems to be due to imbalanced state of <b>negative</b> and positive <b>regulatory</b> gene expression.

40|$|The Mutator {{system of}} transposable {{elements}} {{is characterized by}} a family of transposons called Mu transposons that share common termini and are actively transposing in Robertson's Mutator (Mu) lines of maize. Mu lines lose transposition activity during propagation by either outcrossing or inbreeding. This loss of transposition activity, which can occur at non-Mendelian frequencies, {{is in the form of}} loss of forward transposition activity resulting in a decrease in the generation of new mutations, as well as the loss of mutability of Mu transposon induced mutations, and it has been correlated with hypermethylation of the Mu elements. Previous studies have concluded that restoration of Mutator transposon activity by crossing inactive lines back to active lines is incomplete or transient, and depends upon the sex of the inactive parent. Further, it has been proposed that the inactive system is dominant to the active system, with the dominance possibly mediated through a <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> that is preferentially transmitted through the female. In this study, we have examined the frequencies of loss and restoration of Mu transposon activity using a Mu line carrying an insertion in the bronze 1 locus. We find that transmission of Mu transposon activity to non-Mu plants can occur at high rates through males and females, but individual cases of decreased transmission through the male were observed. We also find that in crosses between inactive-Mu and active-Mu plants, reactivation was efficient as well as heritable, regardless of the sex of the inactive parent. Similar results were obtained whether the inactivation occurred in an outcross or a self. In all cases examined, loss of Mu transposon activity was correlated with hypermethylation of Mu elements, and reactivation was correlated with their demethylation. Our results indicate that an inactive Mu system does not exhibit dominance over an active Mu system. We conclude that contrary to current models, inactivation and its maintenance is not obligatorily associated with a dominant <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> whether nuclear or cytoplasmic, and we propose a revised model to account for these and other observations...|$|R

A Gal 4 DNA binding domain–mammalian RPD 3 fusion protein strongly represses transcription from a promoter containing Gal 4 binding sites. Association between YY 1 and mammalian RPD 3 requires a glycine-rich region on YY 1.

Although this suppression is mediated by inhibitory factors, the {{mechanisms by which}} virus-specific T cells encounter and integrate immunoregulatory signals during persistent infection are unclear. We show that a distinct population of IL- 10 -expressing immunoregulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is amplified during chronic versus acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and suppresses T cell responses. Although acute LCMV infection induces the expansion of immunoregulatory APCs, they subsequently decline. However, during persistent LCMV infection, immunoregulatory APCs are amplified and parallel the viral replication kinetics. Further characterization demonstrates that immunoregulatory APCs are molecularly and metabolically distinct, and exhibit increased expression of T cell-interacting molecules and <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> that suppress T cell responses. Thus, immunoregulatory APCs are amplified during viral persistence and deliver inhibitory signals that suppress antiviral T cell immunity and likely contribute to persistent infection...|$|R

A strong fortification, a combined activity of the phage and host factors, prevents untimely expression of mom and associated toxic effects. Here, we identify the bacterial chromatin architectural protein Fis as an additional player in this crowded regulatory cascade. Both in vivo and in vitro studies described here indicate that Fis acts as a transcriptional repressor of mom promoter. Further, our data shows that Fis mediates its repressive effect by denying access to RNA polymerase at mom promoter. We propose that a combined repressive effect of Fis and previously characterized <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> could be responsible to keep the gene silenced most of the time. We thus present a new facet of Fis function in Mu biology. In addition to bringing about overall downregulation of Mu genome, it also ensures silencing of the advantageous but potentially lethal mom gene...|$|R
40|$|Human {{leukocyte}} antigen HLA-B alleles {{have better}} protective activity against HIV- 1 than HLA-A alleles, possibly due {{to differences in}} HLA-restricted HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function, but the mechanism is unknown. HIV- 1 <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factor</b> (Nef) mediates down-regulation of surface expression of class I HLA (HLA-I) and may therefore impair immune recognition by CTL. Because of sequence differences in the cytoplasmic domains, HLA-A and -B are down-regulated by Nef but HLA-C and -E are not affected. However, the latter are expressed at low levels and are not of major importance in the CTL responses to HIV- 1. Here, we compared the role of the cytoplasmic domains of HLA-A and -B in Nef-mediated escape from CTL. We found HLA-B cytoplasmic domains were more resistant to Nef-mediated down-regulation than HLA-A cytoplasmic domains and demonstrated that these differences affect CTL recognition of virus-infected cells in vitro. We propose that the relative resistance to Nef-mediated down-regulation by the cytoplasmic domains of HLA-B compared with HLA-A contributes to the better control of HIV- 1 infection associated with HLA-B-restricted CTLs...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcriptional}} activator NUC- 1 {{controls the}} transcription {{of the genes}} for phosphorus acquisition enzymes, and its activity is regulated by the <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors,</b> PREG and PGOV. In this report, we describe the cloning and molecular analysis of the preg(+) gene. In Neurospora crassa, as in higher eukaryotes, transformation frequently results in nonhomologous integration of transforming DNA. Insertion of transforming DNA into host genes mutates the gene and provides a molecular tag for cloning it. We obtained two mutants that have an insertion in the preg(+) and pgov(+) genes, respectively, among 2 X 10 (5) transformants. The preg(+) gene was cloned by screening a Neurospora genomic DNA library with DNA sequences flanking the transforming DNA of the rescued plasmid. Northern analysis showed that the transcription of the preg(+) gene is not regulated by phosphate. The carboxy-terminal half of PREG shows strong homology with Saccharomyces cerevisiae PHO 80 whose function is analogous to that of PREG. The preg(c) mutations {{are located in the}} well conserved residues which may directly interact with the residues in the regulatory domain of NUC- 1...|$|R
40|$|There are, in the {{broadest}} sense, two mechanisms by which gene expression can be extinguished in vertebrates. The first of these is based on mass action effects of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> and is termed activation and repression; the second is independent of positive <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> but {{is based on the}} history of the affected gene and is termed silencing. It can be said, again in {{the broadest}} sense, that imprinted genes, genes subject to X inactivation, and transposon promoters are subject to silencing, while the promoters of tissue-specific genes in non-expressing tissues are controlled by activation and repression. The escape of imprinted genes from silencing through unknown mechanisms can cause developmental abnormalities and can predispose to the formation of embryonal tumours. One developmental disorder caused by loss of imprinting of genes on chromosome 11 p 15. 5 is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). This syndrome has long been known to be inexplicably common in monozygotic twins; the twins are nearly always discordant for BWS, and nearly all twins are female. A loss of imprinting model based on stochastic errors in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT 1, or a paternally expressed function that opposes maintenance methylation of maternally repressed growth-enhancing genes, is proposed to explain the perplexing genetics of BWS in monozygotic twins...|$|R
40|$|Osteoclast {{formation}} is regulated by balancing between the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) expressed in osteoblasts and extracellular <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interferon-β (IFN-β), which can suppress excessive bone destruction. However, relatively {{little is known}} about intrinsic <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors</b> in RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Here, we show the paired-box homeodomain transcription factor Pax 6 acts as a negative regulator of RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift and reporter assays found that Pax 6 binds endogenously to the proximal region of the tartrate acid phosphatase (TRAP) gene promoter and suppresses nuclear factor of activated T cells c 1 (NFATc 1) -induced TRAP gene expression. Introduction of Pax 6 retrovirally into bone marrow macrophages attenuates RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Moreover, we found that the Groucho family member co-repressor Grg 6 contributes to Pax 6 -mediated suppression of the TRAP gene expression induced by NFATc 1. These results suggest that Pax 6 interferes with RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation together with Grg 6. Our results demonstrate that the Pax 6 pathway constitutes a new aspect of the <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> circuit of RANKL-RANK signaling in osteoclastogenesis and that the augmentation of Pax 6 might therefore represent a novel target to block pathological bone resorption.

40|$|Xvent {{homeobox}} genes encode transcription {{factors that}} repress organizer genes and {{are essential for}} dorsoventral specification during early embryogenesis in Xenopus. In contrast to the Xvent- 2 gene subfamily, Xvent- 1 subfamily members, including PV. 1 A, have been proposed as indirect targets of Bone Morphogenetic Protein- 4 (BMP- 4) signaling. Because PV. 1 A is a critical downstream mediator of, and tightly regulated by, BMP- 4 signaling, we hypothesized that its promoter contains a direct BMP- 4 response element to effect this transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate that direct regulation by BMP- 4 is necessary for transcription of PV. 1 A: its proximal promoter contains cis-acting binding elements for Smads and Oaz crucial to induction in response to BMP- 4 signaling. In addition to these direct cis-acting BMP- 4 responsive elements, an indirect Xvent- 2 response element and several repressive elements exist in the PV. 1 A promoter to regulate its transcription. In summary, PV. 1 A undergoes combinatorial regulation during early Xenopus development as both the direct target of BMP- 4 signaling and as the direct and indirect target of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
