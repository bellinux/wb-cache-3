5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

Of course, this does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E

40|$|This essay aims to {{summarize}} the main physical features arising from a new supersymmetric theory of gravitation. Based on preliminary discussions about classical field theory, cosmology, algebra and group theory, and taking formal results and theoretical considerations in comparison with several contributions from great authors, present work deals with gravity inside the limits of a meta-field theory, that is, a non-quantized but consistent representation of supergravity, the supersymmetry between gravitons and gravitinos. The introduction of meta-fields furnishes an independent framework {{for the study of}} gravity despite of constraints of quantization, treating the supersymmetric partners as deterministic actors of gravitation and not simply probabilistic entities. I explain my belief that gravitational field, by its own nature, is not quantizable in the same foot as the other fields, what does <b>not</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can <b>not</b> understand gravity by similar formal veins. Also, present work proposes the implementation of the so-called SCYL program (Supersymmetric Cosmology at Yonder Locals), an attempt to apply supergravity as a meta-field theory to solve problems on astrophysical cosmology. The SCYL program is an effort directed to search convergence between the knowledge brought by cosmology and by supersymmetry to attain more clearness about the structure and evolution of the Universe. As an additional motivation, there are some exercises in the final part of the work to aid fixing of the main concepts. Comment: Original field theory for supergravity with 72 page...|$|R

Why else do we create and administer socially adjudicative systems if the predictive function of an ethical system is congruent with the adjudicative function? The predictive function informs what we will do; the adjudicative function informs whether what we did was normative. What we will do and what we have done are not always the same.|$|R

Still, like Job, we should humbly acknowledge the limits of human wisdom and not presume to fully fathom why God permits suffering and evil. With that important caveat, Lewis proceeds to suggest some reasons why a good and all-powerful God might allow evil. Lewis also addresses issues in The Problem of Pain on the Fall and original sin, hell, animal pain, and heaven.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{discourse}} on risk {{carried out in}} the scientific community for some time now has drawn {{attention to the fact that}} the conventional concept of risk based on the product of probability and extent of damage is not applicable to the risks associated with modern technologies (e. g. genetic engineering). This is so because we are dealing with hypothetical dangers for which neither the possible extent of damage nor the probability of the occurrence of accidents may be calculated in any exact sense in advance. In the form of technically and ecologically induced risks uncertainty – in relation to the consequences – has become a basic and contentious problem for modern society as a knowledge society. Decisions with regard to uncertainty can only be made as a part of social of processes or hypothetical situations. Processing uncertainty, ambiguity and unfeasibility is the most distinctive characteristic of future-oriented decision-making and risk communication in knowledge societies. In this essay, I want to highlight some of the more recent theoretical and empirical developments that have taken place in the social scientific discussion of risks. Such an examination requires (1) reference to the texture of modern society and some of its cen-tral features that serve as the social, cultural, political and economic context within which science gener-ally and the communication of risks by scientists are embedded. My perspective is that modern society is best understood as a knowledge society. It is self-evident that science and technology pay a crucial role in the modern life-world. But this <b>not</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have acquired a well-developed sense of the risks and uncertainties that are associated with knowledge in general and risks in particular. On the contrary, what still prevails is a perspective that treats knowledge in disembodied fashion, systematically overestimates its efficacy and independence of mere human circum-stances.

The fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot involve future people in our present decision-making does <b>not</b> <b>mean,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to depart from the requirements of the all affected principle. And this principle is natural to adopt if we conceive of democracy as a way of aggregating interests. So the principle remains a live option in that sphere of democratic theory. However, its role is limited by the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to make moral decisions about the future. Here an epistemic notion of democracy is more to the point than the idea of a method of aggregating interests...|$|R
