Budesonide inhibited FCS-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 release in a dose-dependent manner. The IC 25 (25 % inhibitory concentration) of budesonide on IL- 6 release was higher in nasal polyp than in nasal mucosa epithelial cells (34 n Mvs. 200 p M). The IC 25 of budesonide on IL- 8 release was higher in nasal mucosa than in nasal polyps (145 p Mvs. 4 pM). <b>Nedocromil</b> sodium caused a dose-related inhibitory effect on IL- 8 release from nasal mucosa (IC 25, 207 nM), while it only had a significant effect in nasal polyps at 10 − 5 M. <b>Nedocromil</b> sodium had no effect on IL- 6 release.

Compound 48 / 80 also stimulated ANX-A 1 phosphorylation and release and this was also potentiated by <b>nedocromil.</b> Anti-ANX-A 1 neutralising monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) enhanced the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to compound 48 / 80. 4. <b>Nedocromil</b> and ketotifen potently inhibited the release of histamine, PGD 2, tryptase and β-hexosaminidase from mast cells challenged with compound 48 / 80. Anti-ANX-A 1 neutralising Mabs prevented the inhibitory effect of these drugs. 5. BMDMCs derived from Anx-A 1 −/− mice were insensitive to the inhibitory effects of <b>nedocromil</b> or ketotifen but cells retained their sensitivity to the inhibitory action of hu-r-ANX-A 1. 6. The fpr 2 / 3 antagonist WRW 4 blocked the action of <b>nedocromil</b> on PGD 2, but not histamine, release.

40|$|Background: <b>Nedocromil</b> {{sodium and}} {{levocabastine}} {{are widely used}} {{for the treatment of}} ocular allergy, but their mechanisms of action are unclear. Objective: We sought to compare the efficacy and mechanisms of action of <b>nedocromil</b> sodium and levocabastine in reducing conjunctival symptoms after ocular allergen challenge. Methods: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 48 subjects were randomized to 3 groups to receive <b>nedocromil</b> sodium (2 %), levocabastine (0. 05 %), or placebo eye drops twice daily for 2 weeks before ocular challenge with 10 ?L of ryegrass extract. Symptoms and tear histamine and PGD 2 concentrations were determined before challenge and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 180, and 360 minutes after challenge. Bulbar biopsy specimens were taken at 6 and 24 hours after challenge to assess conjunctival inflammatory cell numbers, adhesion molecule expression, and mast cell–associated IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 13, and TNF-? levels. Results: Both drugs significantly reduced total symptom scores (P <. 05) at all times after challenge compared with placebo. Itching, hyperemia, and lacrimation were most affected. <b>Nedocromil</b> sodium treatment reduced tear concentrations of histamine (by 77 %) and PGD 2 (by 70 %) at 30 minutes after challenge (both P <. 05). In biopsy specimens <b>nedocromil</b> sodium reduced the number of 3 H 4 -positive mast cells (purportedly the secreted form of IL- 4) by 49 % at 6 hours and 59 % at 24 hours (both P <. 05). Levocabastine reduced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression by 52 % at 6 hours and 45 % at 24 hours (both P <. 05). Conclusion: <b>Nedocromil</b> sodium and levocabastine both reduced the conjunctival symptoms after ocular allergen challenge but appeared to work by different mechanisms. <b>Nedocromil</b> sodium reduced mast cell function, whereas levocabastine appeared to have primarily antihistaminic actions, although it also reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1...|$|E
40|$|Among nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs used in {{the treatment}} of adult asthma, sodium cromoglycate and <b>nedocromil</b> sodium are the most frequently prescribed. These medications have a similar efficacy profile in asthma although {{it has been suggested that}} <b>nedocromil</b> is more powerful than cromoglycate, particularly in its steroid sparing effects. Both drugs have been recommended as alternatives to steroids {{in the treatment of}} mild asthma. They are useful in the prevention of bronchospasm induced by exposure to allergens or to a variety of other stimuli. In comparison with theophylline or low dose inhaled steroids, cromoglycate and <b>nedocromil</b> have shown a similar antiasthmatic efficacy, although this is variable among patients...|$|E

Sodium cromoglycate was relatively inactive in both these systems.

40|$|Ttm {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether <b>nedocromil</b> sodium benefits urban asthmatic children showing seasonal bronchial hyper-reactivity to ultrasonic nebulization of distilled water (UNDW). A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind study was carried out at the outpatient pulmonology service at a tertiary-care teaching hospital. Twelve children Hving in Milan, who were 7 - 17 years of age, who were SPT and RAST-negative to perennial allergens, who were suffering from episodic asthma, and showing seasonal bronchial hyper-reactivity to UNDW during winter, participated in this study. All the children received either placebo or <b>nedocromil</b> sodium, 4 mg every 6 h for 6 weeks. Spirometry and UNDW challenge were done at the following times: day- 7; day 0; day 1; day 7; day 14; day 28; day 42. No differences were found in the basal spirometric parameters, which were normal in both <b>nedocromil</b> and placebo groups. Bronchial reactivity to UNDW was found to be significantly decreased in the group treated with nedocromtl starting from day 7. It is therefore concluded that <b>nedocromil</b> sodium can reverse bronchial hyper-reactivity caused by seasonal factors such as cold, viral infections and atmospheric pollutants in children suffering from asthma. Effect of <b>nedocromil</b> sodium on aspecific bronchial hyper-reactivity in asthmatic childre...|$|E
