5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E

25|$|Short {{of water}} and feed for the horses, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> his supply boats were, and {{receiving}} divided opinions from his senior officers, Banks ordered a rapid retreat downriver to Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. Both sides at the Battle of Pleasant Hill suffered roughly equal casualties of 1,600. It was a tactical victory for the Federals, but a strategic Confederate one because the Union army retreated following the battle.|$|E

Despite attempts over many years to have Bellini's remains transferred to Catania, that did not take place until 1876, when the casket containing his remains was taken to the cathedral in Catania and reburied.|$|E
25|$|Keleon {{explains}} {{that if the}} trio defeat Eldrith, it will mean {{the destruction of the}} Tower itself, as well as freeing the ghosts within. However, as they cannot leave the tower the way they entered, it will most likely lead to their own deaths. They find Eldrith alone {{on the roof of the}} Tower guarding another portal. She reiterates her plans for the destruction of Baldur's Gate. They fight and defeat her, and as she dies, she repents her actions and asks forgiveness. With the tower crumbling around them, the heroes enter the portal, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> it leads.|$|E

Frederick appointed Nassau as major general, and instructed him to recruit a dragoon regiment (Dragoon Regiment No. XI) of Prussian and Saxon officers.

Nassau had been successful in Saxony and maintained his contacts: in three months he had a battalion with five squadrons and a second battalion was under formation. Although no horses were available, the regiment was ordered into the camp near Strehlen, where it came {{under the command of}} Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin. In the First Silesian War the regiment fought in Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia. He was involved in the seven-week Siege of Olomouc.|$|E

Kinkaid, hoping to close the range to be able to execute an attack that day, steamed towards the Japanese carriers at top speed and, at 14:25, launched a strike force of 23 aircraft. But the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted by U.S. aircraft and <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the U.S. carriers were, turned to the north to stay out of range of the U.S. carriers' aircraft. Consequently the U.S. strike force returned to their carriers without finding or attacking the Japanese warships.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers. I despise them." [...] As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: [...] "And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude... I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> you're going to end up..." ...|$|E

Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is how to keep you on your toes in terms of <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|E

When Hotaru is a teenager, she shares some pudding with Gin before she leaves {{at the end of}} the summer. After Hotaru leaves, the yōkai attempt to cheer Gin up by bringing him a couple of persimmons, one of the most prized treats on the mountain. Impressed with the taste, Gin thinks of sharing one of these persimmons with Hotaru next year.

After he returns from his unsuccessful attempt to find Hotaru, Matsumino apologizes to Gin for eating the persimmon and Gin forgives him. The story concludes with Gin seeing Hotaru the following summer and wondering if he will be able to tell her about his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Control", is an up-tempo {{electronic}} song. Heavily influenced by techno and trance, {{it contains a}} prominent electric guitar riff. [...] "I told Ben [...] I {{wanted to do a}} song that had elements of rock and roll but with a techno vibe and he ran with it, creating a slamming heavy metal guitar intro on an insanely hyper track." [...] The song is about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart as she sings, [...] "Let me kiss it and make it better/After tonight you will forget her". [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] is also an up-tempo techno-trance song with elements of ambient music. It features Spanish guitar and castanets. The lyrics were influenced by and written surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. The third track, [...] "Good-N-Evil", incorporates elements of industrial music. [...] "Fly" [...] is a mid-tempo song built around a trip hop beat. The album's fifth track and the only ballad on the album, [...] "Distant Land", contains elements of ambient music and features mellow guitar melody.

5000|$|The lyrics {{tell the}} story of a fictional American pilot. He is tricked into believing that the mission is {{perfectly}} safe, as his bomber is [...] "invisible" [...] to radar. The song continues by relating the story of his flight and subsequent downing by Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences. The pilot is evacuated with 32 helicopters after having been searched for by peasants with pitchforks. The song also emphasises the supposed ignorance of NATO troops about Kosovo, describing them as <b>not</b> even <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> it exactly is.|$|R

[...] However, a storm forces the pair's plane to crash land on a cliff-top, right close to the scientist's lab. [...] Escaping the wreckage, George makes his way to the lab, arriving {{just in time to see}} the scientist gunned down by a pale, lanky man, known as Susarro, and his bodyguard, after being questioned on an unknown subject. [...] A postcard hidden in the lab prompts George to travel to Glastonbury, England, to search for a man named Bruno, and a friend of the scientist, who had advised him to flee. In his attempts to find out where Bruno is, he quickly learns that he disappeared before his arrival and is now in danger. Although <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> he is exactly, after visiting a fortune teller, George spots a building that caught fire, and goes to deal with it, saving an old man trapped within it. [...] When they chat, he quickly learns that the old man's name is Bruno Ostvald, the scientist he met in the Hotel Ubu in Paris, and a Neo-Templar. [...] Bruno reveals to George that he left the group after the events of Shadows of the Templar, and that they are now led by Susarro, who took over and renamed it the Cult of the Dragon. Susarro is seeking to gain immortality through the use of the Earth’s ley lines, which Cholmondely was using in his experiments, and Bruno explains that he is able to track these with a special device he has, believing Susarro may be going to a site in Paris to find something important, prompting the pair to follow after him.|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to start off with bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E
