These wastes often provoke environmental pollution to groundwater, soils, and other local geologic units which causes serious health risk. In order to prevent the environmental pollution, <b>natural</b> <b>zeolites</b> and clay minerals with calcium compounds can be applied in two ways: One is mixing treatment of these materials to in situ remedy for toxic metals pollution within wastes. Ion-exchange property of zeolites and adsorption of clay minerals are effective in this treatment, which makes geochemically very stable state that reduces leaching of the toxic metals. The other is more physical way, that is a use of a mixture of clay minerals and <b>natural</b> <b>zeolites</b> for liner materials at solid waste disposal site of which impermeable property as well as adsorption successfully shields migration of toxic metals from waste sites. In this paper we report typical results of laboratory experiment and {{a case study of}} the remediation techniques by using <b>natural</b> <b>zeolites</b> and clay minerals in solid waste disposal sites in Japan...|$|R
