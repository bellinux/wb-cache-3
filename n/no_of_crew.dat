50|$|There are no minimum crew requirements, however J/30s are {{typically}} raced with a <b>crew</b> <b>of</b> up to 7.

The J/30 is notable for its ease of sailing, being well handled with far fewer than 7 crew members if conditions permit.|$|R
50|$|The high {{death toll}} was blamed {{largely on the}} ineptitude and cowardice <b>of</b> the <b>crew.</b> Too few crew members were on duty {{at the time of}} the fire, and none {{attempted}} to wake the passengers. Also, many crew members fled the ship at the first alarm, and <b>no</b> member <b>of</b> the <b>crew</b> ever called the fire department. Passengers had never been informed of evacuation routes or procedures.|$|R

2500|$|The Saturn V (spoken as [...] "Saturn five") was an American human-rated {{expendable}} rocket used by NASA between 1967 and 1973.

The Saturn V was launched 13 times from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with <b>no</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> or payload. As of 2017,the Saturn V remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest total impulse) rocket ever brought to operational status, and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit (LEO) of , which included the third stage and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo Command/Service Module and Lunar Module to the Moon.|$|R
50|$|Several {{ground-based}} paradigms {{have been}} used to emulate the effects of microgravity unloading on human skeletal muscle, including complete horizontal or 6° head-down-tilt bed rest, dry immersion, and unilateral upper- and lower-limb unloading with or without joint immobilization. In general, skeletal muscle responses to unloading have been similar in all of these models. Although <b>no</b> perfect simulation <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> activities and the microgravity environment can be adequately achieved, Adams and colleagues have suggested that bed rest is an appropriate model of spaceflight for studying skeletal muscle physiologic adaptations and countermeasures.|$|R

5000|$|... "As {{there were}} <b>no</b> {{survivors}} <b>of</b> the <b>crew,</b> the cause <b>of</b> the Lifeboat capsizing {{is a matter}} of conjecture, but from the evidence available we are of the opinion that whilst attempting to make the Harbour on a strong flood tide and in high and dangerous breaking sea, she was suddenly capsized and the crew were thrown into the water, two men being entangled under the boat. The broken water and heavy surf caused the loss of the crew".|$|R

5000|$|Three {{days later}} the Japanese {{executed}} the carefully planned, devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. Moored next to Mugford (DD-389) in berth B6 of the Navy yard for minor repairs, Jarvis opened fire with 5-inch guns and machine guns and made preparations to get underway. Within minutes of the initial attack, her 5-inch guns {{were among the first}} to challenge the enemy raiders, and her gunners proudly claimed four planes. As the first wave of enemy bombers raked Battleship Row with torpedoes and bombs, Ensign W. F. Greene laconically appraised the situation with the following entry in Jarvis Deck Log: [...] "0758 Hostilities with Japan commenced with air raid on Pearl Harbor. Went to General Quarters." [...] Emerging from the attack with <b>no</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> and only superficial damage, Jarvis sortied that morning with several cruisers and destroyers to conduct surveillance and ASW patrols.|$|R

60|$|As before, the Ghost swung {{out of the}} trough, {{lifting her}} deck again out of the sea, and dashed before the howling blast. It was now half-past five, and half-an-hour later, when {{the last of the}} day lost itself in a dim and furious twilight, I sighted a third boat. It was bottom up, and there was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> its <b>crew.</b> Wolf Larsen {{repeated}} his manœuvre, holding off and then rounding up to windward and drifting down upon it. But this time he missed by forty feet, the boat passing astern.|$|R
50|$|On 27 October 2002, before {{entering}} operational service, St Albans {{was struck by}} the P&O ferry Pride of Portsmouth when gale force winds pushed the ferry into the ship whilst secure on her berth in Portsmouth. St Albans suffered damage to the gun deck, the sea boat supports (davits) and the bridge wing. However, <b>no</b> members <b>of</b> the <b>crew</b> were injured. In 2004, Commander Steve Dainton RN took command and the ship was deployed on Operation Oracle duties in the Arabian Sea. In July that year the crew were granted Freedom of the City by the Mayor of St Albans.|$|R
50|$|Sensing {{something}} amiss, Smith gave chase and, after {{a four-hour}} pursuit {{in which he}} fired seven shells at his quarry, overtook and boarded Mary Campbell. He learned that earlier that day, presumably before daylight since <b>no</b> member <b>of</b> Venice’s <b>crew</b> had observed the action, a Confederate raiding party of 16 men under Acting Master James Duke, CSN, had captured Mary Campbell and Norman and probably entertained covetous designs upon Venice when Bermuda hove into view. Duke—already notorious because of earlier captures of Union vessels—fled toward land in Norman with 10 members <b>of</b> the lugger’s <b>crew</b> and, after running that schooner aground and setting her afire, escaped ashore. Smith returned Mary Campbell to her original master and crew and permitted them to complete their original voyage to Pensacola.|$|R
50|$|Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons {{began to}} operate {{separately}} again in June 1950, following the return <b>of</b> <b>crews</b> from Berlin and No. 38 Squadron's departure for {{service in the}} Malayan Emergency. No. 36 Squadron assumed control of the Governor-General's Flight in October 1950. On 21 November 1952, the squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup for its proficiency. The return <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 38 Squadron from Malaya in December stripped <b>No.</b> 36 Squadron <b>of</b> <b>crews</b> to ensure an even distribution of personnel among the two units. This led to No. 36 Squadron again merging with No. 38 Squadron. The former disbanded at Richmond on 9 March 1953, re-forming the next day from No. 30 Transport Unit at Iwakuni, Japan. Here it was part <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 91 (Composite) Wing, which controlled the RAAF's units during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath. Its complement included eight Dakotas and one CAC Wirraway. In July and August, the squadron evacuated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war. It departed Japan on 13 March 1955, having carried over 42,000 passengers and 6000000 lbs kg of cargo, and was re-established on 1 May at RAAF Base Canberra, where No. 86 Wing had transferred the previous year.|$|R
5000|$|In late January 2009, {{speculation}} arose {{surrounding a}} potential collaboration between Silambarasan, Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman, but none confirmed the news. In a surprise move, in early February 2009 a poster appeared in Indian papers featuring Silambarasan, but with <b>no</b> names <b>of</b> <b>crew</b> members. This {{was a significant}} move as this was Gautham's first project after his split with Harris Jayaraj. Furthermore, the early poster suggested that the film was titled Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, in homage to the song [...] "Vennilavae Vennilavae" [...] from the 1997 film, Minsaara Kanavu. Subsequently, each day leading up to Valentine's Day saw the launch of a new poster, still without details <b>of</b> the <b>crew</b> except the inclusion of Trisha Krishnan as the lead actress; posters released after the one tributing Minsara Kanavu were those of stills from Dil Se.., Alaipayuthey, Kaakha Kaakha and Geethanjali. It eventually surfaced as a Gautham Menon film, with music by Rahman and cinematography by Manoj Paramahamsa. Gautham stated that the movie would be {{his return to the}} love genre after having directed action thriller post his debut venture, Minnale. Nagarjuna Akkineni approached Gautham Menon to do a Telugu version simultaneously. He agreed and the scenes were shot at the same time. Menon cited that he was [...] "a week away from starting the film with a newcomer" [...] before his producer insisted they looked at Silambarasan.|$|R
