500|$|The Centuriate Assembly was {{supposedly}} {{founded by the}} legendary Roman King Servius Tullius, less than a century before {{the founding of the}} Roman Republic in 509 BC. As such, the original design of the Centuriate Assembly was known as the [...] "Servian organization". Under this organization, the assembly {{was supposedly}} designed to mirror the Roman army {{during the time of the}} Roman Kingdom. Soldiers in the Roman army were classified on the basis of the amount of property that they owned, and as such, soldiers with more property had more influence than soldiers with less property. The 193 Centuries in the assembly under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class, the enlisted class, and a class of unarmed adjuncts. The officer class was grouped into eighteen Centuries. The enlisted class was grouped into five separate property classes, for a total of 170 Centuries. The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five Centuries. Of five enlisted classes, the wealthiest controlled 80 of the votes. During a vote, all of the Centuries of one class had to vote before the Centuries of the <b>next</b> <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> could vote. The first candidate to reach a majority of 97 votes was victorious. [...] When a measure or candidate received 97 votes, a majority of the centuries, the voting ended, and as such, many lower ranking Centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote. Combined the 18 equites and the 80 centuries of the first property class had one more century than needed, and a unanimous vote from the elite would thus elect a candidate.|$|E

Assuming the availability of different service classes, we propose that a real-time application always selects the lowest / cheapest service class that still can meet the application requirements.

50|$|Classes in DDS {{are based}} on the {{entrance}} test score, with A as the highest, B as the <b>next</b> <b>lower,</b> etc. It is possible for a student to be transferred to higher or <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> depending on their academic performances. However, Class Q is a special case. As the name might suggest, Class Q is for the Qualified students (i.e. the specially chosen few) who are viewed as the most potential candidates for the successor of Morihiko Dan in the future. Yet, the same rules as the other classes also apply to Class Q. Any member of Class Q may be transferred to a <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> if his/her academic performance declines. Since Class A was generally regarded as the top class of the DDS before Class Q was formed, there has been a tense rivalry between the two classes since.|$|R
25|$|Lower-class {{families}} are disproportionately {{made up of}} single mother households. According to Kathryn Edin, {{this is because of}} the lack of incentive to marry other <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> men among <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects. Unlike middle <b>class</b> women, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> mothers have less incentive to delay their childbearing to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents are disproportionately felt by the <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> for these very reasons.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandUnwanted {{resonances}} {{can make}} analysis of crash instrumentation extremely difficult. These resonances are {{a natural part}} of the acceleration measurements and in many cases are allowed to be present to maintain the needed high-frequency responses. Crystal accelerometers are, for instance, essentially undamped, and have resonance humps 40 dB above unity in order to maintain a flat response to approximately one-half the resonance or natural frequency of the accelerometer. This resonance also allows the phase angle response to be close to zero well out towards the natural frequency. Additional resonance problems exist in the mounting brackets, or as frame resonances which carry little or no information. The process of removing them, however, can produce extreme errors in both amplitude and phase. The SAE J 211 a Recommended Practice recommends four channel classes for impact tests: c 1 asses 60, 180, 600, and 1000. The frequency response is flat to + 1 / 2, - 1 dB to these frequencies, and to + 1, - 4 dB to the break frequencies of 100, 300, 1000, and 1650 Hertz. The filter rolloff is nominally 12 dB/octave (second order) from these break points. Second order filters are normally used for impact tests since accelerometers have second order response. This filtering will provide satisfactory results, if no resonance is present at less than several times the class frequency. Often the <b>next</b> <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> is used to remove a resonance, a step that may cause large errors. A better solution is to follow the typical class filter with a sharper cutoff filter that will remove the resonance without affecting the amplitude and phase of the initial impulse. A method that determines when data is lost by excessive filtering is presented and demonstrated on two crashes. One crash has a resonance about 15 times higher than the class; one is less than 3 times higher...|$|E

50|$|Blue-collar {{crime is}} a term used to {{identify}} crime, normally of a small scale nature in contrast to “white-collar crime”, and is generally attributed to people of the <b>lower</b> <b>class.</b> During the 1910s through to the 1920s in America, manual labourers often opted for blue shirts, so that stains gained from days at work were less visible. As during that time period and geographic location manual labour was often or almost exclusively assigned to the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> the term was more permanently attributed to them as defining low income earners. This has carried on to the modern day, therefore meaning crime committed by <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> It {{is important to note}} that blue-collar crime does not exclusively address low income earners in work, but also includes the unemployed who are also members of the <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R
