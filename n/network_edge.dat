50|$|This {{advantage}} may {{be offset}} {{by the fact that}} an OBS <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> router is likely to be more complex than an OPS <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> router, due to the possible need for a burst assembly/aggregation and a sorting stage. Consequently, energy consumption at the edge of an OBS network may be higher than in an OPS network.|$|E

Many services are provided at <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> and are increas-ing in number. The open framework is needed for efficient service management and uniform deployment of personal services at <b>network</b> <b>edges.</b> In this paper, we propose the open service framework, which can be implemented as a plat-form for the personal service at <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> by using Open Pluggable Edge Service (OPES) concept.

40|$|Detection of the modular {{structure}} of biological networks {{is of interest}} to researchers adopting a systems perspective {{for the analysis of}} omics data. Computational systems biology has provided a rich array of methods for network clustering. To date, the majority of approaches address this task through a network node classification based on topological or external quantifiable properties of network nodes. Conversely, numerical properties of <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> are underused, even though the information content which can be associated with <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> has augmented due to steady advances in molecular biology technology over the last decade. Properly accounting for <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> in the development of clustering approaches can become crucial to improve quantitative interpretation of omics data. We present a novel technique for network module detection, named WG-Cluster (Weighted Graph CLUSTERing). WG-Cluster's notable features are the: (1) simultaneous exploitation of <b>network</b> node and <b>edge</b> weights to improve the biological interpretability of connected components detected, (2) assessment of their statistical significance, and (3) identification of emerging topological properties in the connected components. Applying WG-Cluster to a protein-protein network weighted by measurements of differential gene expression permitted to explore the changes in network topology under two distinct (normal vs tumour) conditions...|$|R

50|$|Edge {{computing}} pushes applications, {{data and}} computing power (services) away from centralized {{points to the}} logical extremes of a <b>network.</b> <b>Edge</b> computing replicates fragments of information across distributed networks of web servers, which may spread over a vast area.

5000|$|Unlike {{traditional}} STPs, Edge STPs process packet traffic {{away from}} the network core, where sensitive applications and customer information reside. They can either perform simple packet routing or deep packet inspection (DPI) that supports content-based routing. DPI is a time-consuming and processor-intensive function that can bog down core network functions and reduce customer response times. Shifting it to the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> improves overall network performance.|$|E

40|$|A content {{delivery}} network (CDN) circumvents the congested Internet by pushing important content to large caches at the <b>network</b> <b>edges.</b> Content, produced at single points of origin, is sent to multiple points at the <b>network</b> <b>edges,</b> constituting point-to-multipoint (multicast) connections. For international wide area networks, such a scheme is most effectively implemented by using the intrinsic multicasting capabilities of a satellite. In this paper we describe the European project CODIS, which aims at implementing and testing a satellite based {{content delivery}} network. We also describe a framework for measuring the quality of service of CODIS and define rules for digital television broadcasters, yielding optimal bitrates to use in order to guarantee customer satisfaction.

The technology reduces redundant transmissions within the backhaul network by caching and predictively distributing content to the <b>network</b> <b>edge.</b> To maintain integrity within the network core, all caching is performed on a symmetrical basis; traffic that is reduced over the backhaul network is faithfully replicated into the core network.|$|E

It has fewer architectural problems than traditional IPv4 NAT; it is for example stateless and preserves the reachability attributed to the end-to-end principle. However, the method still lacks solutions to translate embedding IPv6 addresses, for example in IPsec, and requires a more complex DNS setup (split-horizon DNS).|$|E

40|$|Congestion {{control in}} the {{internet}} is usually decomposed into an end-system controller (eg: TCP) and a bottleneck controller (AQM or Drop-Tail queueing) which generates feedback. This paper asks an architectural question: can the active queue management (AQM) function be moved to the <b>edges</b> of the <b>network</b> so that the core routers focus simply on packet forwarding? The question is interesting {{in the light of}} recent trends to consolidate traffic management functions at <b>network</b> <b>edges.</b> We develop a theoretical framework to answer this question in the affirmative. The idea is to use a notion of path capacity and path demand to build an edge-based virtual queue AQM (called EVQ) at the <b>network</b> <b>edges.</b> We show that such a scheme can achieve the usual steady state objectives: high utilization, low persisten...|$|R

There are also virtual appliances that can work on existing network hardware, or the appliance can be deployed as a virtual appliance on the cloud in environments such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

40|$|We study {{a typical}} network {{environment}} where TCP traffic is generated {{from a source}} connected to a LAN (e. g.

Congestion at the edge router occurs when the bandwidth available in the access network cannot support the aggregated traffic generated from the LAN. Current implementations of TCP rely on packet drop {{as an indication of}} congestion to throttle the source rates. Recent research [2] has shown that incorporating explicit congestion notification mechanisms into TCP can significantly improve its throughput. This paper presents a different approach to improve TCP performance. In particular, we propose new techniques that regulate TCP acknowledgments at <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> without changing existing TCP implementations at the end systems.
