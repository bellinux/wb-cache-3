25|$|The Soviet Union (USSR) honoured Maclean with {{an avenue}} in central Leningrad - Maklin Prospekt, which ran north from the Fontanka towards the Moika. It has <b>now,</b> <b>like</b> Leningrad/St Petersburg itself, reverted to its {{original}} name, Angliisky Prospekt (English Avenue). In 1979, on the centenary of his birth, the USSR issued a 4 kopek commemorative postage stamp depicting Maclean in a portrait by Peter Emilevich Bendel.|$|E
25|$|The museums also {{house the}} {{artifacts}} {{brought to the}} United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. Peru would <b>now</b> <b>like</b> to have the items returned; Yale has so far declined. In November 2010, a Yale University representative agreed to return the artifacts to a Peruvian university.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} shot in Almeria, Spain in {{widescreen}} on locations built for the Westerns made by Sergio Leone. Its production was particularly traumatic for cast and crew. Whity, a mixture of Euro-western and American South melodrama, was badly received by the critics and became Fassbinder's biggest flop. The film was neither picked up for theatrical release nor was there interest for broadcasting it on television. As a result, Whity was only seen as its premiere. It remained unavailable until the 1990s when it began to be screened and <b>now,</b> <b>like</b> almost all of Fassbinder's films, is available on DVD.|$|E

25|$|United Airlines Flight 718, a Douglas DC-7 Mainliner named Mainliner Vancouver, and {{flown by}} Captain Robert Shirley, First Officer Robert Harms, and Flight Engineer Gerard Fiore, {{departed}} Los Angeles International Airport at 9:04am PST with 53 passengers and five crew members aboard (including two flight attendants), bound for Chicago's Midway Airport. Climbing to an authorized altitude of 21,000 feet, Captain Shirley flew under IFR in controlled airspace {{to a point}} northeast of Palm Springs, California, where he turned left toward a radio beacon near Needles, California, after which his flight plan was direct to Durango in southwestern Colorado. The DC-7, although still operating under IFR, was <b>now,</b> <b>like</b> the Constellation, flying in uncontrolled airspace.|$|E
25|$|Croydon is {{also home}} to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The {{formerly}} independent John Fisher School in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and written statements. The school ended its selection policy in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a points system, which discriminates in favour of those who have high mass attendance and whose families are most involved in the Catholic Church. Coloma Convent Girls' School is one of England's Catholic girls' schools: formerly a grammar school, it has <b>now,</b> <b>like</b> John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria. St. Joseph's College, located on Beulah Hill in Upper Norwood, is a boys' school with a mixed sixth form.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the defeat}} on Malvern Hill, the Seven Days Battles {{accomplished}} the original Confederate goal of removing any {{direct threat to}} Richmond from the Union Army. The three newspapers in Richmond exulted in this strategic victory and lionized Robert E. Lee as a national hero: [...] "No captain that ever lived," [...] opined the Richmond Dispatch, [...] "could have planned or executed a better plan." [...] Similarly, Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory said, [...] "the Great McClelland [...] the young Napoleon <b>now</b> <b>like</b> a whipped cur lies {{on the banks of}} the James River crouched under his Gun Boats." [...] Throughout Richmond and the once-beleaguered South, there was a triumphant mood, and scant attention was paid to the flaws in Lee's tactics or execution.|$|E

Cyrus West's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name West: Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar (Lucien Littlefield). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is <b>now</b> <b>like</b> her uncle, [...] "in a cage surrounded by cats." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{entered the}} Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother's Milk.

[...] "I was still a little bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're <b>now</b> <b>like</b> an eight armed cosmic octopus!" [...] Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Pérez {{played for}} Liga Mercedes in the Dominican Republic. The Colorado Rockies signed {{him as an}} undrafted free agent in 1992 {{at the age of}} 18. Assigned to the single-A Bend Rockies for the 1993 season, Pérez posted a [...]260 batting average and stole 19 bases. The Rockies, {{confident}} in Pérez's potential, promoted him to the single-A Central Valley Rockies. Pérez exhibited strong defensive skills, executing the first unassisted triple play {{in the history of the}} California League in a game against the Bakersfield Blaze. Pérez batted just [...]239 on the year but made the California League All-Star game and was considered to be one of the Rockies' top prospects on the basis of his defense. Rockies player development chief Dick Balderson expressed confidence that Pérez's hitting would improve: [...] "He's got all the skills...He's just in a rush right <b>now,</b> <b>like</b> most young guys." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite this support, RWE {{announced}} in November 2009 {{that they have}} postponed their plans for the new power station. They are not yet going make a formal planning application for the plant, saying that the time is not right for such a huge investment. Dave Carlton, RWE's project manager, has said that they [...] "see the site as an important one, both for RWE npower {{and in terms of}} the UK’s future power generation”, and so RWE npower have retained the site for a possible future power station. Malcolm Reid of People Against New Coal Stations, a group opposed to the power station development, said: [...] "We would <b>now</b> <b>like</b> to see Northumberland County Council re-designate the Cambois site for green, clean technology, to match what is happening at the New and Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC) in Blyth. It is a perfect area for a factory for offshore wind turbines and housing development. If Cambois is re-designated then the prospect of the area being regenerated rises colossally." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it <b>now,</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} book you are a master but if you {{commence}} as master in writing anyway, you end as a bloody bore." [...] Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease. By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents, [...] he was having trouble remembering the trip. [...] In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of The Old Man and the Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book. [...] He wrote to his editor, [...] "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book." [...] Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe-deposit box in Havana, although after the 1959 [...] Cuban revolution he feared the manuscript lost.|$|E

500|$|As Friedman noted, if {{the price}} of silver had {{remained}} high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously." [...] One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, Thomas F. Bayard, in 1878, [...] "at the beginning... I was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find <b>now</b> <b>like</b> almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger welcomed Chelsea's emergence, {{describing}} {{them as the}} [...] "third force" [...] in English football, but {{he raised}} concerns over their conduct and what he perceived as artificial growth. Asked whether Chelsea could dominate for the foreseeable, Wenger said: [...] "I feel yes, because they are a financially doped club. [...] They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's a kind of doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources." [...] Despite the absence of Thierry Henry, ruled out through injury, and Arsenal's poor recent record against Manchester United, Wenger believed his team were more than capable of winning the match: [...] "What is good in football {{is that it is not}} predictable. [...] You act <b>now</b> <b>like</b> it is a decade that we haven’t beaten Manchester United – it's not true. It's two games."

[...] Phoebe needs the [...] "wakewater," [...] which is said {{to be able to help}} free Aquaria. [...] Benjamin and Phoebe head to the (aptly named) Wintry Cave and defeat a monster to obtain the Libra Crest. [...] Using this crest to enter the Libra Temple, they find that the source of the [...] "wakewater" [...] has dried up. [...] Finding the Old Man in the back of the Libra Temple, they find that he holds the only bag (water skin, actually) of wakewater, and to use it on the plant in the center of town. [...] Back in Aquaria, they find that the wakewater doesn't work, and reviving the crystal is the only thing that will save the town and Spencer. [...] They head off for the Ice Pyramid and defeat the second of the Vile Evils, the Ice Golem. [...] The Ice Crystal is saved, and Benjamin and Phoebe head back to Aquaria. [...] They find the town is <b>now</b> <b>like</b> Foresta (after the crystal is revived there) and Spencer is back and digging his tunnel to save Captain Mac (Kaeli's Father). [...] Upon leaving, Spencer hands the Venus Key to Benjamin, and tells him to head for Fireburg.|$|E
