5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar <b>Natural</b> <b>Park</b> {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E

50|$|Heavy {{restrictions}} {{have been}} put on land development in protected areas and on historic sites designated as <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> for public interest. However, building tourist facilities such as accommodation was also limited, causing inconveniences to local residents and visitors.Constructing condominiums in <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> has been restricted since early 1990, because such buildings could lead to a sense of inequality among different social classes. But recent surveys on local residents near <b>natural</b> <b>parks</b> and the general public showed that the majority of respondents were in favor of building condominiums in <b>natural</b> <b>parks.</b> And the demand for tourism has been increasing since the introduction of a 5-day workweek system. For these reasons, the government decided to lift restrictions on building condominiums in natural parks.Also, the government has eased regulations on establishing cable cars in <b>natural</b> <b>parks.</b> In the latter half of 2009, limits on distance will be lowered from 2 km to 5 km, which will lead to more cable cars in <b>natural</b> <b>parks.</b> Such deregulation will enable more convenient trips for visitors and attract investment from the private sector for local development.|$|R
