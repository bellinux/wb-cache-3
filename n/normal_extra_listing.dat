50|$|Some leagues {{have used}} shootout tiebreakers after drawn matches. Major League Soccer (1996-2000) used three points for a win, one {{point for a}} shootout win, no points for a shootout loss, none for a loss. The Norwegian First Division (in 1987) and the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and its lower {{divisions}} (in 1988) used three points for a win, two points for a shootout win, one point for a shootout loss, none for a loss. The same system will be adopted in the group stages of the 2016-17 EFL Trophy and 2016-17 Scottish League Cup (in both cases, no extra time will be played). The Iraqi Premier League has used two different variants of this system. The first was in the 1988-89 season, where three points were awarded for a win by two or more goals (after <b>normal</b> or <b>extra</b> time), two points were awarded for a one-goal win (after <b>normal</b> or <b>extra</b> time), one point was awarded for a penalty shootout win and zero points were awarded for penalty shootout defeats or defeats after <b>normal</b> or <b>extra</b> time. The second variant {{was used in the}} 1994-95 season, where three points were awarded for a one-goal or two-goal win, but four points were awarded for a win by three or more goals.|$|R
50|$|In the 1999 election, Blincoe {{missed out}} on a seat, as a list {{candidate}} under mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation, by a narrow margin once special votes had been counted. Initially it appeared that Blincoe would have a seat in Parliament, {{as well as a}} party member directly following him on the Labour party's list. With the counting of special votes, however, the Green Party crossed the minimum 5% threshold of votes and received an electorate MP, which in turn allowed them to have seats in Parliament. In addition, Winston Peters won the constituency seat of Tauranga by a narrow margin of sixty-two votes over a National Party candidate, and this enabled his New Zealand First party to acquire <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> seats in Parliament.|$|R

50|$|The {{first time}} that the Iraqi Premier League was not held in a {{round-robin}} format was when it was split into four regional groups in the 1988-89 season, which were followed by another group stage, semi-finals, a third place match and a final. During this season, if a match ended in a draw, it would go to extra time and then penalties if necessary. A team would earn three points if they won a game by two goals or more (after <b>normal</b> or <b>extra</b> time). They would earn two points if they won a game by just one goal (after <b>normal</b> or <b>extra</b> time), and they would gain one point for winning a penalty shootout.

During this season, if a match ended in a draw, it would go to extra time and then penalties if necessary. A team would earn three points if they won a game by two goals or more (after <b>normal</b> or <b>extra</b> time).

50|$|In {{association}} football contests, many matches {{are allowed}} to end in a draw, but in cases where a winner must be chosen, there are three methods of deciding this. The usual method is <b>Normal</b> <b>Extra</b> Time, where each team will play two 15-minute periods of extra time (but see also Golden goal). The team that leads {{at the end of}} 30 minutes wins the tie. If, at the end of extra time, no winner can be decided, the match goes to a penalty shootout. Occasionally, in matches such as the Community Shield in England, the match can go straight to a penalty shootout after 90 minutes' play has been completed. Alternatively, in tournaments such as the English FA Cup, the match is replayed in its entirety, going through the aforementioned stages of extra time and penalties if the second match is drawn. This method is no longer used from the quarter finals onwards.|$|R

Analyses of variance, with specified contrasts, found the DAT patients to demonstrate a pervasive memory impairment affecting both the qualitative and quantitative memory indices compared to depressed and normal elderly. The depressed elderly demonstrated impairment, compared to normal elderly, on tasks requiring effortful processing. Findings support pervasive memory loss in DAT patients and do not support clear memory impairment in the present depressed sample...|$|R
