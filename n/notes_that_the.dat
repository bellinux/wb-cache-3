Jassin <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> works in Nyanyi Sunyi appear more developed and mature {{than those in the}} later collection. Teeuw <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> later collection was more explicitly about romantic love, rather than the religious love of Nyanyi Sunyi.|$|E

5|$|However, von Rhein <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theater's size poses a {{challenge}} to the performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. In 2009–2010, the theater introduced a pair of discounted ticket programs: a five dollar lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a discounted ten dollar ticket program was initiated for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances.|$|E

5|$|M.I.A.'s {{commentary}} on the oppression of Sri Lankan Tamils, Palestinians and African Americans has drawn praise and criticism. The United States has restricted her access {{into and out of}} the country during her career since the release of her debut album. M.I.A. <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voicelessness she felt as a child dictated her role as a refugee advocate and voice lender to civilians in war during her career.|$|E
5|$|Scholar Jesse Byock <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> goddess Skaði is also {{associated}} with winter and hunting, and that the episode in Volsunga saga involving the male Skaði, Sigi, and Breði has been theorized as stemming from an otherwise lost myth.|$|E

5|$|Some {{commentators}} see {{the conservative}} readings of Forrest Gump as indicants {{of the death}} of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film's humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience's historical (self-) consciousness.|$|E

5|$|The clock dial {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|E
