5|$|Atomic line {{filters are}} most often used in LIDAR and other {{exercises}} in laser tracking and detection, {{for their ability to}} filter daylight and effectively discern weak, <b>narrowband</b> signals; however, they may be used for filtering out the earth's thermal background, measuring the efficiencies of antibiotics and general filtering applications.|$|E
5|$|In modern designs it {{is common}} to use quartz crystal filters, {{especially}} for <b>narrowband</b> filtering applications. The signal exists as a mechanical acoustic wave while it is in the crystal and is converted by transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains at the terminals of the crystal.|$|E
5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including <b>narrowband</b> filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
25|$|The lamps used in {{phototherapy}} {{contain a}} phosphor that emits only UVB ultraviolet light. There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306nm, and <b>narrowband</b> UVB that gives 311–313 nanometer. Due to its longer wavelength the <b>narrowband</b> UVB requires a 10 times higher dose to the skin, {{compared to the}} broadband. The <b>narrowband</b> is good for psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), vitiligo, lichen planus, and some other skin diseases. The broadband is better for increasing Vitamin D3 in the body.|$|E

25|$|FM is {{commonly}} used at VHF radio frequencies for high-fidelity broadcasts of music and speech. Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM. <b>Narrowband</b> FM is used for voice communications in commercial and amateur radio settings. In broadcast services, where audio fidelity is important, wideband FM is generally used. In two-way radio, <b>narrowband</b> FM (NBFM) is used to conserve bandwidth for land mobile, marine mobile and other radio services.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 4.33 million broadband subscribers in Australia and 2.09 million <b>narrowband</b> subscribers. Between December 2007 and June 2008 {{there was an}} increase in the number of wireless internet subscribers from 433,000 to 809,000.|$|E
25|$|A {{wideband}} amplifier has {{a precise}} amplification factor {{over a wide}} frequency range, and {{is often used to}} boost signals for relay in communications systems. A <b>narrowband</b> amp amplifies a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies.|$|E
25|$|However, time {{interleaving}} is {{of little}} benefit in slowly fading channels, such as for stationary reception, and frequency interleaving offers little to no benefit for <b>narrowband</b> channels that suffer from flat-fading (where the whole channel bandwidth fades at the same time).|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{modulation}} can {{be classified}} as <b>narrowband</b> if {{the change in the}} carrier frequency is about the same as the signal frequency, or as wideband if the change in the carrier frequency is much higher (modulation indexnbsp&>nbsp&1) than the signal frequency.|$|E
25|$|Mainly, the {{sidelobe}} {{levels of}} W-OFDM are lower. This results in less ICI, {{as well as}} greater robustness to <b>narrowband</b> interference. These two properties are especially useful in PLC, {{where most of the}} lines aren't shielded against EM-noise, which creates noisy channels and noise spikes.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{telephone network}} (PSTN) is generally limited to <b>narrowband</b> audio by the intrinsic {{nature of its}} transmission technology, TDM (time-division multiplexing), and by the analogue-to-digital converters used {{at the edge of}} the network, as well as the speakers, microphones and other elements in the endpoints themselves.|$|E
25|$|When {{processing}} signals, such as audio, radio waves, light waves, seismic waves, {{and even}} images, Fourier analysis can isolate <b>narrowband</b> {{components of a}} compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection or removal. A large family of signal processing techniques consist of Fourier-transforming a signal, manipulating the Fourier-transformed data in a simple way, and reversing the transformation.|$|E
25|$|For {{indirect}} FM modulation, {{the message}} signal is integrated {{to generate a}} phase-modulated signal. This is used to modulate a crystal-controlled oscillator, {{and the result is}} passed through a frequency multiplier to produce an FM signal. In this modulation, <b>narrowband</b> FM is generated leading to wideband FM later and hence the modulation is known as indirect FM modulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{conformal}} passive hydrophones are hard-mounted {{to each side}} of the hull, using the AN/BQR-24 internal processor. The system uses FLIT (frequency line integration tracking) which homes in on precise <b>narrowband</b> frequencies of sound and, using the Doppler principle, can accurately provide firing solutions against very quiet submarines. The AN/BQQ-5’s hull array doubled the performance of its predecessors.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of OFDM over single-carrier schemes {{is its ability}} to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, <b>narrowband</b> interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated <b>narrowband</b> signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.|$|E
25|$|A {{burglar alarm}} {{contains}} sensors which {{are connected to}} a control unit via a low-voltage hardwire or <b>narrowband</b> RF signal {{which is used to}} interact with a response device. The alarm was patented (U.S. patent #9,802) on June 21, 1853, by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope of Somerville, Massachusetts. As the first person to commercialize Pope's invention, Edwin Holmes acquired Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1,500.|$|E
25|$|Amplitude-companded single {{sideband}} (ACSSB) is a <b>narrowband</b> modulation method using a {{single sideband}} with a pilot tone, allowing an expander in {{the receiver to}} restore the amplitude that was severely compressed by the transmitter. It offers improved effective range over standard SSB modulation while simultaneously retaining backwards compatibility with standard SSB radios. ACSSB also offers reduced bandwidth and improved range for a given power level compared with narrow band FM modulation.|$|E
25|$|A literal {{term for}} SSTV is <b>narrowband</b> television. Analog {{broadcast}} television requires at least 6MHz wide channels, because it transmits 25 or 30 picture {{frames per second}} (in the NTSC, PAL or SECAM color systems), but SSTV usually only takes up {{to a maximum of}} 3kHz of bandwidth. It is a much slower method of still picture transmission, usually taking from about eight seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the mode used, to transmit one image frame.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{very wide}} band in HF terms, many {{different}} transmission modes {{can be found on}} 10 meters. Morse code and other <b>narrowband</b> modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, SSB from 28.300MHz up, and wideband modes (AM and FM) are found near {{the upper part of the}} bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as PSK-31, are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{is used in}} many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, {{the most}} common sort of flat panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through {{rotation}} of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the intensity of light through electrically induced birefringence of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The Lyot filter is a specialized <b>narrowband</b> spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. Wave plates are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.|$|E

On 14 July 2010 RTÉ NL outlined detailed plans for the Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) infrastructure project and Digital Satellite Television (DST) using Ka <b>narrowband</b> which will see the shut- down of the existing analogue system and launch of a domestic only satellite service {{for the first time since}} establishment of RTÉ covering the area not possible due to terrain issues by DTT.|$|E
25|$|As Microsoft {{developed}} the original Xbox console, online gaming was designated {{as one of}} the key pillars for the greater Xbox strategy. Sega had made an attempt to capitalize on the ever-growing online gaming scene when it launched the Dreamcast video game console in 1999, including online support as standard, called SegaNet and Dreamarena. Nevertheless, due to lack of widespread broadband adoption at the time, the Dreamcast shipped with only a dial-up modem while a later-released broadband adapter was neither widely supported nor widely available. Downloadable content was available, though limited in size due to the <b>narrowband</b> connection and the size limitations of a memory card. The online features, while praised as innovative, were largely considered a failure, and the Dreamcast's immediate competitor, the PlayStation 2, did not initially ship with built-in networking capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Saturn is {{the source}} of rather strong low {{frequency}} radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar wind pressure. For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometeric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotron Maser Instability of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally diffuse emissions as well as <b>narrowband</b> tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like {{in the case of the}} Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1GW.|$|E

500|$|For diplexers {{dealing with}} {{contiguous}} passbands proper {{account of the}} crossover characteristics of filters needs {{to be considered in}} the design. [...] An especially common case of this is where the diplexer is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands. [...] Here a low-pass and a high-pass filter are used instead of band-pass filters. [...] The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to <b>narrowband</b> multiplexers and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line filters can be {{considered}} the optical equivalent of lock-in amplifiers; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a <b>narrowband</b> signal (almost always laser light) {{that would otherwise be}} obscured by broadband sources, such as daylight. [...] They are used regularly in Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems. Atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as interference filters and Lyot filters, but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background-limited detection, where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background. [...] Compared to etalons, another high-end optical filter, Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around US$15,000 per unit.|$|E
500|$|Measurements of {{microwave}} {{power can be}} made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter. [...] However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with a slotted line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter. [...] The {{microwave power}} source is amplitude modulated with, typically, a [...] signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe {{and sent to the}} VSWR meter. [...] This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated carrier directly, which would result in a DC output, because a stable, <b>narrowband,</b> tuned amplifier can be used to amplify the [...] signal. [...] A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law range of the detector diode is no more than [...]|$|E
500|$|An iris {{is a thin}} {{metal plate}} across the {{waveguide}} {{with one or more}} holes in it. [...] It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. [...] Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5. [...] An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance. [...] An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC resonant circuit. [...] A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide. [...] <b>Narrowband</b> filters frequently use irises with small holes. [...] These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris. [...] Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes {{in the shape of a}} cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling.|$|E
500|$|Two widely spaced <b>narrowband</b> signals can be diplexed {{by joining}} {{together}} the outputs of two appropriate band-pass filters. [...] Steps {{need to be}} taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance. [...] This can be achieved by appropriate spacing. [...] For instance, if the filters are of the iris-coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed λgb/4 from the junction where λgb is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B. [...] Likewise, the nearest iris of filter B is placed λga/4 from the junction. [...] This works because when filter A is at resonance, filter B is in its stopband and only loosely coupled and vice versa. [...] An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions. [...] A decoupling resonator is placed λg/4 from the junction of each filter. [...] This can be {{in the form of a}} short-circuited stub tuned to the resonant frequency of that filter. [...] This arrangement can be extended to multiplexers with any number of bands.|$|E
