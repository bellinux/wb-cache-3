In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E

500|$|As {{the number}} of First World War {{veterans}} dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place {{after the death of}} the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the prospect, but has also been quoted as saying [...] "I don't mind— as long as it's not me." [...] Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the fact that we went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, {{said he would like to}} try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E

2500|$|Ironic control theory, {{also known}} as [...] "ironic process theory", states that thought {{suppression}} [...] "leads to an increased occurrence of the suppressed content in waking states". The irony {{lies in the fact}} that although people try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a particular subject, there is a high probability that it will appear in one's dreams regardless. There is a difference for individuals who have a higher tendency of suppression; they are more prone to psychopathological responses such as [...] "intrusive thoughts, including depression, anxiety and obsessional thinking". Due to these individuals having higher instances of thought suppression, they experience dream rebound more often.|$|E

Sometimes they have a wistful melancholy, a sense of struggling to carry on, {{trying to find some}} meaning in life ("Backseat", [...] "Feelin' Massachusetts").

2500|$|Thought {{suppression}} {{also has}} the capability to change our behavior. Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, and Jetten found that when people were asked <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the stereotypes of a certain group (e.g. a [...] "skinhead"), their written descriptions about a group member's typical day contained less stereotypical thoughts. However, when they were told {{they were going to}} meet an individual they had just written about, those in the suppression group sat significantly farther away from the [...] "skinhead" [...] (just by virtue of his clothes being present). These results show that even though there may have been an initial enhancement of the stereotype, participants were able to prevent this from being communicated in their writing; this was not true for their behavior though.|$|E

Adewunmi remarked that [...] "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: {{you may be a}} racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight."

2500|$|The fifth season {{once again}} {{received}} mostly positive critical reception. Season 5 {{was given a}} weighted average of 78 out of 100 by Metacritic. Variety said that [...] "The ABC series remains one of primetime's most uncompromising efforts, and this year's latest wrinkle on flashbacks, flash-forwards and island-disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Newark Star Ledger said that season 5 may finally be [...] "a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings, and those who prefer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> them." [...] Sepinwall also related that [...] "I loved every minute. But I'm also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that [...] "when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture, then uses it without restraint, the story loses its anchor to real life." [...] The critic also asked [...] "Why does it matter what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does, when they all seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers? How can these characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds?" [...] The New York Times also commented that [...] "what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot: the struggles between faith and reason; the indictments of extreme capitalism, the futility of recovery. All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out, now, in Jack Shephard's belief that returning to the island is his Destiny." [...] The A.V. Club said of the fifth-season finale, [...] "Me? I found the ending frustrating, but in a good way. This finale was entertaining as all get-out to me, and despite the occasional groaner moment, I think this may be Lost's most purposeful, surprising finale." ...|$|E
