5000|$|The strap or chain {{can have}} various forms. Some straps {{are made of}} polymers, and are smooth, highly flexible, <b>non-marring,</b> high-friction straps. (Before the era of {{commercial}} polymers, the straps were of leather or rubber.) Other straps are bands of spring steel, moderately flexible, slightly firmer {{and more likely to}} mar than the polymer variants. The chains tend to be of the roller chain type (like a bicycle chain).|$|E
50|$|In this method, {{the bottom}} V-die is {{replaced}} by a flat pad of urethane or rubber. As the punch forms the part, the urethane deflects and allows the material to form around the punch. This bending method has a number of advantages. The urethane will wrap the material around the punch and the end bend radius will be very close to the actual radius on the punch. It provides a <b>non-marring</b> bend and is suitable for pre-painted or sensitive materials. Using a special punch called a radius ruler with relieved areas on the urethane U-bends greater than 180° can be achieved in \ne hit, something that is not possible with conventional press tooling. Urethane tooling should be considered a consumable item and while they are not cheap, they are {{a fraction of the cost}} of dedicated steel. It also has some drawbacks, this method requires tonnage similar to bottoming and coining and does not do well on flanges that are irregular in shape, that is where the edge of the bent flange is not parallel to the bend and is short enough to engage the urethane pad.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the potential for clinical application of digital linear tomosynthesis in imaging hip prostheses. Volumetric x-ray digital linear tomosysnthesis was used to image hip prostheses. The tomosynthesis was compared to metal artifact reduction (MAR) computed tomography (CT), and <b>non-MAR</b> CT scans of a prosthesis case. The effectiveness of this method in enhancing visibility of a prosthesis case was quantified {{in terms of the}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and removal of ghosting artifacts in a prosthesis case was quantified in terms of the artifact spread function (ASF). In the near in-focus plane, the contrast is greater in the MAR CT or tomosynthesis relative to the <b>non-MAR</b> CT. The order of ASF performance of the algorithm was as follows: (1) tomosynthesis; (2) MAR-CT; (3) <b>non-MAR</b> CT. The potential usefulness of digital linear tomosynthesis for evaluation of hip prostheses was demonstrated. Further studies are required to determine the ability of digital linear tomosynthesis to quantify the spatial relationships between the metallic components of these devices as well as to identify bony changes with diagnostic consequences...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out to address {{possible}} cellular mecha-nisms by which merbarone, a catalytic inhibitor of DNA topo-isomerase II, can block tumor cell growth without inducing extensive DNA cleavage. Merbarone induced the release of high molecular weight DNA fragments from the nuclear matrix of HL- 60 leukemia cells, which preceded the internucleosomal-size DNA fragmentation characteristic of late-stage apoptosis. The chromatin fragments were enriched in a matrix attachment region (MAR) sequence compared with a <b>non-MAR</b> sequence and were similar in size to DNA loops extracted from nuclear matrices. However, merbarone did not directly induce the ex-cision of high molecular weight DNA fragments from the nu-clear matrix by promoting topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA cleavage, because the drug inhibited topoisomerase II-medi...|$|R
40|$|Mar (multiple {{antibiotic}} resistant) mutants of Escherichia coli express chromosomally mediated {{resistance to}} a variety of structurally unrelated hydrophilic and hydrophobic antibiotics. Insertion of transposon Tn 5 into the marA locus at min 34. 05 on the chromosome completely reverses the Mar phenotype (A. M. George and S. B. Levy, J. Bacteriol. 155 : 531 - 540, 1983). We found that among changes in the outer membrane of Mar mutants, porin OmpF was greatly reduced, although Mar mutants were more resistant than cells lacking only OmpF. Transduction of the marA region from a Mar strain, but not a wild-type strain, led to loss of OmpF. P 1 transduction of marA::Tn 5 into a Mar mutant partially restored OmpF levels. Therefore, OmpF reduction required a mutation in the marA region. Mar mutants of an ompF-lacZ operon fusion strain expressed 50 to 75 % of the beta-galactosidase activity of the isogenic <b>non-Mar</b> parental strain, while Mar mutants of a protein fusion strain expressed less than 10 % of the enzyme activity in the <b>non-Mar</b> strain. These changes were completely reversed by insertion of marA::Tn 5. The responsiveness of OmpF-LacZ to osmolarity and temperature changes was similar in Mar and wild-type strains. Although some transcriptional control may have been present, OmpF reduction appeared to occur primarily by a posttranscriptional mechanism. The steady-state levels of ompF mRNA were twofold lower and the mRNA was five times less stable in the Mar mutant than in the wild-type strain. Expression of micF, which lowers ompF mRNA levels, was elevated in Mar strains, as revealed by a micF-lacZ fusion. Studies with strains deleted for the micF locus showed that the marA-dependent reduction of OmpF required an intact micF locus. Our findings suggest that the marA locus directly or indirectly increases micF expression, causing a posttranscriptional decrease in ompF mRNA and reduced amounts of OmpF...|$|R
40|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of mandatory audit firm rotation (MAR) on companies' investment decision and auditor choice in a capital market setting. We compare a MAR regime with a <b>non-MAR</b> regime in a setting in which auditors' independence and companies' opinion shopping are real concerns. To capture auditor independence and opinion shopping, we model auditor biases (a conservative bias or an aggressive bias) and client firms' incentives to engage auditors with desired biases. We find that when firms engage in opinion shopping, MAR improves investment efficiency for some firms but impairs investment efficiency for other firms. More generally, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating the real effects of auditing on corporate resource allocation decisions.

40|$|Missing {{values to}} income {{questions}} {{are common in}} survey data. When the probabilities of nonresponse are assumed {{to depend on the}} observed information and not on the underlining unobserved amounts, the missing income values are missing at random (MAR), and methods such as sequential multiple imputation can be applied. However, the MAR assumption is often considered questionable in this context, since missingness of income is thought {{to be related to the}} value of income itself, after conditioning on available covariates. In this article we describe a sensitivity analysis based on a pattern-mixture model for deviations from MAR, in the context of missing income values in a rotating panel survey. The sensitivity analysis avoids the well-known problems of underidentification of parameters of <b>non-MAR</b> models, is easy to carry out using existing sequential multiple imputation software and has a number of novel features...|$|R
40|$|Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{autosomal}} recessive genetic disorders, with the majority of patients born to couples unaware of their carrier status. Carrier screenings might help reducing the incidence of CF. Methods We used a semi-automated reverse-dot blot assay identifying the 47 most common CFTR gene mutations followed by DGGE/dHPLC analysis. Results Results of a 10 -year (1996 – 2006) CF carrier screening on 57, 999 individuals with no prior family history of CF are reported. Of these, 25, 104 were couples and 7791 singles, with 77. 9 % from the Italian Veneto region. CFTR mutations were found in 1879 carriers (frequency 1 / 31), with ΔF 508 being the most common (42. 6 %). Subjects undergoing medically assisted reproduction (MAR) had significantly (p < 0. 0001) higher CF carrier frequency (1 / 22 vs 1 / 32) compared to <b>non-MAR</b> subjects. Conclusions If coupled to counselling programmes, CF carrier screening tests might help reducing the CF incidence...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{increments}} (LI) {{are used}} to analyse repeated outcome data with missing values. Previously, two LI methods have been proposed, one allowing non-monotone missingness but not independent measurement error and one allowing independent measurement error but only monotone missingness. In both, {{it was suggested that}} the expected increment could depend on current outcome. We show that LI can allow non-monotone missingness and either independent measurement error of unknown variance or dependence of expected increment on current outcome but not both. A popular alternative to LI is a multivariate normal model ignoring the missingness pattern. This gives consistent estimation when data are normally distributed and missing at random (MAR). We clarify the relation between MAR and the assumptions of LI and show that for continuous outcomes multivariate normal estimators are also consistent under (<b>non-MAR</b> and non-normal) assumptions not much stronger than those of LI. Moreover, when missingness is non-monotone, they are typically more efficient...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study's {{goal was}} to {{determine}} the pathophysiology of the retinopathy that occurs in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma and sudden onset of night blindness, the so-called melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that sera from two MAR patients contained autoantibodies that reacted with "on " bipolar cells of the human retina. Methods. Immunofluorescence was performed on cryostat sections of unfixed normal human retinas. Sera and IgG fractions were tested from the two MAR patients and 38 control subjects (28 patients with metastatic melanoma, but no visual symptoms; two patients with <b>non-MAR</b> retinopathy; and eight normal subjects). Results. The sera and IgG fractions from both MAR patients but from none of the control subjects produced heavy immunostaining of bipolar cells, which were identified as rod bipolars by a double labeling procedure using anti-protein kinase C. Conclusions. We hypothesize that MAR patients generate autoantibodies against a melanoma antigen that cross react with bipolar cells of the retina. These antibodies, by an unknown mechanism, may cause abnormalities of the rod and cone systems that are characteristic o...|$|R
40|$|Using {{validation}} {{sets for}} outcomes can greatly improve {{the estimation of}} vaccine efficacy (VE) in the field (Halloran and Longini 2001; Halloran et al. 2003). Most statistical methods for using validation sets rely {{on the assumption that}} outcomes on those with no cultures are missing at random. However, often the validation sets will not be chosen at random. For example, confirmational cultures are often done on people with influenza-like illness as part of routine influenza surveillance. VE estimates based on such <b>non-MAR</b> validation sets could be biased. Here we propose frequentist and Bayesian approaches for estimating vaccine efficacy in the presence of validation bias. Our work builds on the ideas of Rotnitzky et al. (1998, 2001), Scharfstein et al. (1999, 2003) and Robins et al. (2000). Our methods require expert opinion {{about the nature of the}} validation selection bias. In a re-analysis of an influenza vaccine study we found, using the beliefs of a flu expert, that within any plausible range of selection bias the VE estimate based on the validation sets is much higher than the point estimate using just the nonspecific case definition. Our approach is generally applicable to studies with missing binary outcomes with categorical covariates...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of chromatin with the nuclear matrix via matrix attachment regions (MARs) on the DNA {{is considered to}} be of fundamental importance for higher order chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression. Here, we report a novel nuclear matrix-localized MAR DNA binding protein, designated MAR binding filament-like protein 1 (MFP 1), from tomato. In contrast to the few animal MAR DNA binding proteins thus far identified, MFP 1 contains a predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain and a long filament-like alpha-helical domain that is similar to diverse nuclear and cytoplasmic filament proteins from animals and yeast. DNA binding assays established that MFP 1 can discriminate between animal and plant MAR DNAs and <b>non-MAR</b> DNA fragments of similar size and AT content. Deletion mutants of MFP 1 revealed a novel, discrete DNA binding domain near the C terminus of the protein. MFP 1 is an in vitro substrate for casein kinase II, a nuclear matrix-associated protein kinase. Its structure, MAR DNA binding activity, and nuclear matrix localization suggest that MFP 1 is likely to participate in nuclear architecture by connecting chromatin with the nuclear matrix and potentially with the nuclear envelope...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Two {{techniques}} for metal artefact reduction for computed tomography were studied {{in order to}} identify their impact on tumour delineation in radiotherapy. Materials and methods: Using specially designed phantoms containing metal implants (dental, spine and hip) as well as patient images, we investigated the impact of two methods for metal artefact reduction on (A) the size and severity of metal artefacts and the accuracy of Hounsfield Unit (HU) representation, (B) the visual impact of metal artefacts on image quality and (C) delineation accuracy. A metal artefact reduction algorithm (MAR) and two types of dual energy virtual monochromatic (DECT VM) reconstructions were used separately and in combination to identify the optimal technique for each implant site. Results: The artefact area and severity was reduced (by 48 – 76 % and 58 – 79 %, MAR and DECT VM respectively) and accurate Hounsfield-value representation was increased by 22 – 82 %. For each energy, the observers preferred MAR over <b>non-MAR</b> reconstructions (p < 0. 01 for dental and hip cases, p < 0. 05 for the spine case). In addition, DECT VM was preferred for spine implants (p < 0. 01). In all cases, techniques that improved target delineation significantly (p < 0. 05) were identified. Conclusions: DECT VM and MAR techniques improve delineation accuracy and the optimal of reconstruction technique depends on the type of metal implant...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of an Escherichia coli with the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotype to withstand the stresses of slaughter compared to an isogenic progenitor strain. A wild type E. coli isolate (345 - 2 RifC) of porcine origin was used to derive 3 isogenic MAR mutants. Escherichia coli 345 - 2 RifC and its MAR derivatives were inoculated into separate groups of pigs. Once colonisation was established, the pigs were slaughtered and persistence of the E. coli strains in the abattoir environment and on the pig carcasses was monitored and compared. No significant difference (P> 0. 05) was detected between the shedding of the different E. coli strains from the live pigs. Both the parent strain and its MAR derivatives persisted in the abattoir environment, however the parent strain was recovered from 6 of the 13 locations sampled while the MAR derivatives were recovered from 11 of 13 and the number of MAR E. coil recovered was 10 -fold higher than the parent strain at half of the locations. The parent strain was not recovered from any of the 6 chilled carcasses whereas the MAR derivatives were recovered from 3 out of 5 (P< 0. 001). This study demonstrates that the expression of MAR in 345 - 2 RifC increased its ability to survive the stresses of the slaughter and chilling processes. Therefore in E. coli, MAR can give a selective advantage, compared to <b>non-MAR</b> strains, for persistence on chilled carcasses thereby facilitating transit of these strains through the food chain.
