50|$|Melinis repens is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names rose <b>Natal</b> <b>grass,</b> or simply <b>Natal</b> <b>grass,</b> and Natal red top. It is native to {{southern}} Africa but {{it is well known}} on other continents, including North America and Australia, as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed. It is an annual or perennial grass which may grow up to a meter tall, its growth rate dependent on temperature. The inflorescence is an open array of branches bearing spikelets which are densely coated in silky white or pink hairs.|$|E
50|$|It {{was home}} to the giant Wood's cycad which is extinct in the wild since the early 1900s, but the oNgoye dwarf cycad, ground cycad and <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> cycad still occur.|$|E
40|$|Plants of 11 {{sugarcane}} varieties {{were grown}} in pots {{during the winter}} at a <b>Natal</b> Midlands site. <b>Grass</b> minimum temperature went below zero on 40 nights {{during the period of}} the experiment. Proportionately fewer primary shoots survived the winter in the more tropical varieties than in those commonly grown in or recommended for the midlands. There was a close relationship between shoot survival and both increase in shoot height during the winter and degree of necrosis of the spindle leaf. The relationship between shoot survival and attributes observed early in the winter-the leaf striping caused by frost and degree of necrosis of the first leaf- was comparatively weak...|$|R

The vegetation of Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park was surveyed in 1992 - 93 as part of a monitoring study of plants, birds, mammals, and invertebrates of three Kona parks. One hundred thirty four vascular plant species were found in the Park, including six endemic species (4 %), 17 (13 %) indigenous species, 15 (11 %) Polynesian introductions, and 96 (72 %) alien or non-indigenous species introduced after 1778. Thirty-three species were additions to the known flora of the Park since the previous plant checklist (Smith et al. 1986). Alien woody species were the dominant elements in the Park's vegetation. Ekoa (Leucaena leucocephala) was the most abundant alien shrub species in the Park, occurring in 93 % of vegetation plots often with > 75 % estimated cover. 'Opiuma (Pithecellobium dulce) was found in 70 % of vegetation plots and had cover values ranging from 75 %. Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) grew in 33 % of all vegetation plots, and had its greatest cover (> 50 %) south of Alahaka Pali. <b>Natal</b> redtop <b>grass</b> (Rhynchelytrum repens) occurred in 67 % of plots, primarily north of Alahaka Pali. Redtop cover was variable and was highest near the 1871 trail. Six other herbaceous species were seen in many plots, but had low estimated cover. All non-cultivated native plants and several naturalized Polynesian introductions were mapped along transects, trails, the coast, and near brackish pools. The most notable native plant was maiapilo (Capparis sandwichiana), a candidate endangered species; only one maiapilo shrub was found within the Park. Fourteen non-cultivated, indigenous species were located during this survey; eight of these were found along the coast or near brackish pools, and six others were on transects upslope. Pili (Heteropogon contortus) was among the indigenous plants found upslope in the Park, and the grass was also planted near the visitor center. Vegetation types were similar to those mapped by Leishmann in 1986. Ekoa shrubland was the most widespread vegetation type in the Park; {{in the northern part of}} the Park this shrubland has become more closed since 1986. Natal redtop grasslands also appear to have decreased in extent since 1986, probably through the invasion of Ekoa and other alien shrubs.

50|$|Appropriate land {{management}} in the pine rocklands involves controlled burns to mimic the natural pattern. Fire also helps to prevent the encroachment of invasive plants. One of the worst offenders is <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens).|$|E
5000|$|The {{binomial}} {{name comes}} from the Greek prefix erio-, meaning [...] "woolly", and suffix -pus, [...] "footed", referring to the woolly petiole bases. It was named in honour of William Stanger, a former surveyor-general of Natal. Common names includes <b>Natal</b> <b>Grass</b> Cycad, Hottentot's Head and Stangeria.|$|E
5000|$|This {{plant is}} {{threatened}} by invasive species of introduced plants in its habitat, including lantana (Lantana camara), molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora), and <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Rhyncelytrum repens). The habitat is degraded by feral goats. Also, the species faces the loss of reproductive vigor because so few individuals remain in the breeding pool.|$|E
50|$|There are {{not many}} predators that {{tolerate}} the strong oils of this mint, so herbivory is not a serious problem. Mildew affects the flowers sometimes, however, causing fruit destruction. Invasive plant species that threaten the habitat include Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), rosary pea (Abrus precatorius), <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Rhynchelytrum repens), and Guinea grass (Panicum maximum).|$|E
50|$|The worst {{threat to}} the species is the {{invasion}} of non-native plant species, such as ice plant (Carpobrotus edulis) and <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens). The plant is threatened by its limited number of populations and small population size, which {{increase the likelihood of}} extinction; the plant may be naturally rare, but its rarity is exacerbated by other conditions, such as fire suppression.|$|E
50|$|Dominant {{vegetation}} includes longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), American {{turkey oak}} (Quercus laevis), and wiregrass (Aristida stricta). A number of rare animals {{are typical of}} this habitat including the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), Sherman's fox squirrel (Sciurus niger shermani), and striped newt (Notophthalmus perstriatus). Invasive species that are a problem on sandhills include Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), and <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens).|$|E
5000|$|Weeds {{including}} lantana (Lantana camara), blue {{morning glory}} (Ipomoea indica) and red <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens) are common on the disturbed {{edges of the}} park and roadsides. Lantana is a Class 3 Pest in the state of Queensland, and is recognised as a weed of national significance [...] (Mackay Regional Pest Management Group 2013). Other highly-flammable weeds common in the park include guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus), ratâ€™s tail grasses (Sporobolus spp.), para grass (Urochloa mutica) and molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora).|$|E
50|$|The snail {{lives on}} rocky {{mountain}} slopes, taking shelter in talus and rockslides. During the dry conditions common in its habitat, the snail seals its shell aperture to solid rock to avoid desiccation. The rock should be rich in calcium carbonate, which the snail uses to form its shell. It {{is associated with}} local plant species such as saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea), yellow paloverde (Parkinsonia microphylla), brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), foxtail brome (Bromus madritensis), <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens), creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and Coulter's lupine (Lupinus sparsiflorus).|$|E
50|$|Threats to {{the species}} include fire suppression, a {{practice}} which prevents the normal fire regime {{on which the}} plant depends. A number of exotic plant species have moved in, including <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Rhynchelytrum repens). The worst threat to the species is habitat destruction, as land is consumed for development {{and the establishment of}} citrus groves. Remaining habitat is not managed properly. Fires are prevented, resulting in the buildup of leaf litter and the encroachment of large and woody vegetation that shades out the herb layer. Drought may be a threat, because the plant appears to be most abundant when there is abundant rainfall.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} a poor {{competitor}} with vigorous species such as saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) and introduced and invasive species such as <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens), and Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum). The plant also does not tolerate shade, so, when tall or woody vegetation grows up around it, it often cannot survive. The natural fire regime of the Florida scrub features periodic wildfire that sweeps through and clears overgrown vegetation, allowing shade-intolerant plants of the understory to thrive. Many of these fires are started by summer lightning. This species {{has been shown to}} flower more profusely when its habitat has been recently burned, so natural or controlled burns are part of the recovery plan.|$|E
50|$|The loss of this Florida scrub {{habitat is}} the {{greatest}} threat to the survival of this species. Six of the fifteen remaining occurrences are in protected areas. Land is lost to urban development. The remaining territory is degraded {{because of the lack of}} proper land management. Although fire in the area is rare, it is required in this fire-adapted habitat type to maintain the ecosystem. Periodic fire clears out overgrown vegetation and creates the openings in the pine and oak canopy that this and many other species require. Controlled burns would be beneficial but these are difficult in this region because of nearby residential neighborhoods. Fires that start naturally are extinguished. Other threats to the plant include introduced plant species such as <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Rhynchelytrum repens).|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{analyzed}} the effects in floristic composition and vegetation structure in grassland of the Semi-arid region of Durango, Mexico under continuous grazing for 28 years. Researchers carried out quantitative {{sampling of the}} vegetation in two cycles, Autumn, 1979 and repeated in Autumn, 2007. Data set obtained for relative density, dominance and frequency of species were analyzed in terms of cycles and sampling sites. Researchers analyzed changes in diversity through Shannon-Wieners index while for spatial distribution Wards algorithm and principal component analysis were used. An increase in soil vegetation cover (25. 46 %) resulted {{as well as an}} increase in biomass (161 %) mainly due to the greater precipitation that occurred in 2007 (550 mm) compared to that of 1979 (293. 4 mm). However, a decrease of native grass diversity occurred while the African introduced species (Melinis repens) Zizka rose <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> increased in dominance from 4 - 30 %. That gave us a major change in the vegetation structure going from Bouteloua bothriochloa association to Melinis heteropogon...|$|E
40|$|Bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia L.) is an {{invasive}} weed {{that poses}} {{economic and environmental}} problems in northern Australia. Competition between pasture and bellyache bush was examined in North Queensland using combinations of five pasture treatments (uncut (control); cut as low, medium, and high pasture; and no pasture) and four bellyache bush densities (0, 2, 6 and 12 plantsm(- 2)) in a buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) dominated pasture. The pasture treatments were applied approximately once per year but no treatments were applied directly to the bellyache bush plants. Measurements of bellyache bush flowering, seed formation, and mortality were undertaken over a 9 -year period, along with monitoring the pasture basal cover and plant species diversity. Maximum flowering rates of bellyache bush occurred after 9 years (97 %) in plots containing no pasture, with the lowest rates of 9 % in uncut control plots. Earliest flowering (322 days after planting) and seed formation (411 days) also occurred in plots with no pasture compared with all other pasture treatments (range 1314 - 1393 days for seed formation to occur). No seeds were produced in uncut plots. At the end of 9 years, mortality rates of bellyache bush plants initially planted averaged 73 % for treatments with some pasture compared with 55 % under the no-pasture treatment. The percentage of herbaceous plant basal cover in uncut plots was increased 5 -fold after 9 years, {{much greater than the}} average 2 % increase recorded across the low, medium, and high pasture treatments. The number of herbaceous species in uncut plots remained largely unchanged, whereas there was an average reduction of 46 % in the cut pasture treatments. Buffel grass remained the species with the greatest basal cover across all cut pasture treatments, followed by sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy) and then red <b>Natal</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis repens (Willd.) Ziska). These results suggest that grazing strategies that maintain a healthy and competitive pasture layer may contribute to reducing the rate of spread of bellyache bush and complement traditional control techniques {{such as the use of}} herbicides...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in central inland Queensland, Australia of 108 sites that were deemed to contain Aristida/Bothriochloa native pastures to quantitatively describe the pastures and attempt to delineate possible sub-types. The pastures were {{described in terms of}} their floristic composition, plant density and crown cover. There were generally ~ 20 (range 5 â€“ 33) main pasture species at a site. A single dominant perennial grass was rare with three to six prominent species the norm. Chrysopogon fallax (golden-beard grass) was the perennial grass most consistently found in all pastures whereas Aristida calycina (dark wiregrass), Enneapogon spp. (bottlewasher grasses), Brunoniella australis (blue trumpet) and Panicum effusum (hairy panic) were all regularly present. The pastures did not readily separate into broad floristic sub-groups, but three groups that landholders could recognise from a combination of the dominant tree and soil type were identified. The three groups were Eucalyptus crebra (narrow-leaved ironbark), E. melanophloia (silver-leaved ironbark) and E. populnea (poplar box). The pastures of the three main sub-groups were then characterised by the prominent presence, singly or in combination, of Bothriochloa ewartiana (desert bluegrass), Eremochloa bimaculata (poverty grass), Bothriochloa decipiens (pitted bluegrass) or Heteropogon contortus (black speargrass). The poplar box group had the greatest diversity of prominent grasses whereas the narrow-leaved ironbark group had the least. Non-native Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel grass) and Melinis repens (red <b>Natal</b> <b>grass)</b> were generally present at low densities. Describing pastures in terms of frequency of a few species or species groups sometimes failed to capture {{the true nature of the}} pasture but plant abundance for most species, as density, herbage mass of dry matter or plant crown cover, was correlated with its recorded frequency. A quantitative description of an average pasture in fair condition is provided but it was not possible to explain why some species often occur together or fail to co-exist in Aristida/Bothriochloa pastures, for example C. ciliaris and E. bimaculata rarely co-exist whereas Tragus australianus (small burrgrass) and Enneapogon spp. are frequently recorded together. Most crown cover was provided by perennial grasses but many of these are Aristida spp. (wiregrasses) and not regarded as useful forage for livestock. No new or improved categorisation of the great variation evident in the Aristida/Bothriochloa native pasture type can be given despite the much improved detail provided of the floristic composition by this survey...|$|E
