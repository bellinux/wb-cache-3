50|$|All U.S. {{real estate}} (and other assets) owned by <b>non-resident</b> <b>aliens</b> (and others) {{are subject to}} an estate tax.

However, U.S. {{citizens}} and residents are permitted a $5 million exclusion from estate taxes. <b>Non-resident</b> <b>aliens</b> are allowed a $60,000 exclusion (prior planning may change the exclusion level to that of a citizen/resident).|$|R

A day after the bank account freeze, the BIR also issued an order to freeze all of Pacquiao's Philippine properties, whereupon Pacquiao presented documents to the press showing the income tax for <b>non-resident</b> <b>alien</b> payment by his promoter to the BIR's US counterpart, the Internal Revenue Service, as well as a letter from Bob Arum. [...] In April 2017, Pacquiao, now a senator, approached Philippine authorities in an attempt to settle the case.

30|$|None of the {{participants}} was asked to report his or her native language, thus we can only report general statistics. Among Texas Tech engineering majors, 94 out of 2971 (3 %) reported being <b>non-resident</b> <b>aliens</b> (Data were not available for the University of Wyoming). Thus, it appears that {{only a very small}} percentage of the U.S. sample was likely to be non-native English speakers. Hardly anyone in India is a native speaker of English. However, of the IIT applicants in 2011, about 60 % were from English-medium schools, which are schools that use English as the medium of instruction where English is not the native language of the students. This suggests that a significant proportion of IIT students may have a working knowledge of English.|$|R
