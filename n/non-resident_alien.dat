50|$|All U.S. {{real estate}} (and other assets) owned by <b>non-resident</b> <b>aliens</b> (and others) {{are subject to}} an estate tax.

However, U.S. {{citizens}} and residents are permitted a $5 million exclusion from estate taxes. <b>Non-resident</b> <b>aliens</b> are allowed a $60,000 exclusion (prior planning may change the exclusion level to that of a citizen/resident).|$|R

30|$|None of the {{participants}} was asked to report his or her native language, thus we can only report general statistics. Among Texas Tech engineering majors, 94 out of 2971 (3 %) reported being <b>non-resident</b> <b>aliens</b> (Data were not available for the University of Wyoming). Thus, it appears that {{only a very small}} percentage of the U.S. sample was likely to be non-native English speakers. Hardly anyone in India is a native speaker of English. However, of the IIT applicants in 2011, about 60 % were from English-medium schools, which are schools that use English as the medium of instruction where English is not the native language of the students. This suggests that a significant proportion of IIT students may have a working knowledge of English.|$|R
