5000|$|<b>Natamycin</b> was {{originally}} named pimaricin to honor Pietermartizburg, where Streptomyces natalensis was acquired. Pimaricin was later renamed <b>natamycin</b> after the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that antibiotics produced by Streptomyces end in -mycin. The name {{also related to}} the organism producing the compound, Streptomyces natalensis, hence the name <b>natamycin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Natamycin,</b> {{also known}} as {{pimaricin}} and sometimes sold as Natacyn, is a naturally occurring antifungal agent produced during fermentation by the bacterium Streptomyces natalensis, commonly found in soil. <b>Natamycin</b> has a very low solubility in water; however, <b>natamycin</b> is effective at very low levels. Its minimum inhibitory concentration is less than 10 ppm for most molds. <b>Natamycin</b> is classified as a macrolide polyene antifungal, and as a drug, is used to treat fungal keratitis, an infection of the eye. It is especially effective against Aspergillus and Fusarium corneal infections. Other common members of the polyene macrolide antifungal family are amphotericin B, nystatin, and filipin. <b>Natamycin</b> is also used in the food industry as a natural preservative.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natamycin</b> {{does not}} have acute toxicity. In animal studies, the lowest [...] found was 2.5-4.5 mg/kg. In rats, the LD50 is ≥2300 mg/kg, and doses of 500 mg/kg/day over 2 years caused no {{detectable}} differences in survival rate, growth, or incidence of tumors. The metabolites of <b>natamycin</b> also lack toxicity. The breakdown products of <b>natamycin</b> under various storage conditions may have a lower LD50 than <b>natamycin,</b> but in all cases, the numbers are quite high. In humans, a dose of 500 mg/kg/day repeated over multiple days caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.|$|E
5000|$|No {{evidence}} shows <b>natamycin,</b> at either pharmacological levels or levels encountered {{as a food}} additive, can harm normal intestinal flora, but definitive research may not be available. However, some people are very allergic to <b>natamycin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natamycin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1955 from fermentation broth of a Streptomyces natalensis cell culture. The discovery and properties of <b>natamycin</b> where {{announced in the}} article, “Pimaricin, a new antifungal antibiotic” in Antibiotics Annual in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natamycin</b> is used {{to treat}} fungal infections, {{including}} Candida, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium, and Penicillium. It is applied topically as a cream, in eye drops, or (for oral infections) in a lozenge. <b>Natamycin</b> shows negligible absorption into the body when administered in these ways. When taken orally, little or none is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, making it inappropriate for systemic infections. <b>Natamycin</b> lozenges are also prescribed to treat yeast infections and oral thrush.|$|E
50|$|<b>Natamycin</b> {{has been}} used for decades in the food {{industry}} as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products and other foods. Potential advantages for the usage of <b>natamycin</b> might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives. It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a brine) sprayed on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an anticaking agent such as cellulose) sprinkled on or mixed into the product. While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow <b>natamycin</b> to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing. Also, <b>natamycin</b> is approved for various dairy applications in the United States. More specifically, <b>natamycin</b> is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese slices, and packaged salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use <b>natamycin</b> is to replace the artificial preservative sorbic acid.|$|E

50|$|Polyene antimycotics, {{sometimes}} referred to as polyene antibiotics, are a class of antimicrobial polyene compounds that target fungi. These polyene antimycotics are typically obtained from some species of Streptomyces bacteria. The polyenes bind to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and thus weakens it, causing leakage of K+ and Na+ ions, which may contribute to fungal cell death. Amphotericin B, nystatin, and <b>natamycin</b> are examples of polyene antimycotics. They are a subgroup of macrolides.|$|E
50|$|A {{presumptive}} diagnosis of fungal keratitis requires immediate empirical therapy. <b>Natamycin</b> ophthalmic suspension is the {{drug of choice}} for filamentous fungal infection. Fluconazole ophthalmic solution is recommended for Candida infection of the cornea. Amphotericin B eye drops may be required for non-responding cases, but can be quite toxic and requires expert pharmacist for preparation. Other medications have also been tried with moderate success. Consult your eye care professional in any case as {{they will have the}} best treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{diagnosis}} is accessed, [...] "specific anti-fungal therapy" [...] can be administered.

[...] For the treatment of yeast keratitis, [...] "topical amphotericin B is usually the first choice." [...] Current advances in further treatments include evaluations of triazoles such as itraconazole and fluconazole [...] "as therapeutic options in ophthalmic mycoses." ...|$|E
5000|$|Like {{amphotericin}} B and <b>natamycin,</b> nystatin binds to ergosterol, a {{major component}} of the fungal cell membrane. When present in sufficient concentrations, it forms pores in the membrane that lead to K+ leakage, acidification, and death of the fungus. [...] Ergosterol is a sterol unique to fungi, so the drug does not have such catastrophic effects on animals or plants. However, many of the systemic/toxic effects of nystatin in humans are attributable to its binding to mammalian sterols, namely cholesterol. This is the effect that accounts for the nephrotoxicity observed when high serum levels of nystatin are achieved.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to deep mycotic disease, C. atrobrunneum {{is known to}} eye diseases including retinitis and keratitis, manifesting with symptoms of pain, redness and watering of the eye, and swelling of the eyelid and surrounding tissues. Corneal infections have responded to dual therapy with topical <b>natamycin</b> and oral ketoconazole. This species has been reported from infections of the skin surrounding the eye. Co-administration of the antifungal drugs fluconazole (delivered topically) and itraconazole (delivered orally) have been effective {{in the treatment of}} cutaneous disease. Skin infections are thought to result from direct contact with environmental reservoirs of C. atrobrunneum such as soil, and accordingly farmers or children may have greater susceptibility.|$|E
50|$|Farrell's {{medium is}} a {{selective}} bacteriological medium for Brucella species which is {{prepared by the}} addition of six antibiotics to a basal bacteriological medium such as serum dextrose agar. In order to prepare 1 liter of the Farrell's medium, the following quantities are added to 1 liter of serum dextrose agar: polymyxin B sulfate (5000 units =5 mg), bacitracin (25,000 units = 25 mg), <b>natamycin</b> (50 mg), nalidixic acid (5 mg), nystatin (100,000 units), and vancomycin (20 mg). Vancomycin inhibits the growth of Gram positive bacteria on this medium, while nystatin inhibits the growth of fungi. Other antibiotics inhibit the growth of Gram negative bacteria other than Brucella species, thus favoring the exclusive growth of the latter in this medium.|$|E

40|$|<b>Natamycin</b> {{is a type}} of polyene {{macrolide}} antibiotic and has been produced in submerged microbial cultures of some natural Streptomyces strains. <b>Natamycin</b> extraction from cellular biomass is greatly affected by the molecular and solubilization characteristics of the extraction solvent, and this is a major reason for the routine attainment of low volumetric titers, resulting from sparing <b>natamycin</b> solubility. In this work, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the solubility of <b>natamycin</b> in some selected organic solvents in order to assess the influence on <b>natamycin</b> extraction yield. <b>Natamycin</b> showed the highest solubility in 75 % aqueous methanol under the conditions of pH 2, 30 degrees C and 1 atm. Furthermore, the extraction of <b>natamycin</b> using 75 % aqueous methanol was performed and the highest extraction yield of 45. 7 % was obtained under pH 2.

40|$|The polyene {{macrolide}} antibiotic <b>natamycin</b> (Antibiotic A- 5283) {{is commonly used}} to retard the growth of surface molds on various cheese varieties. <b>Natamycin</b> is commonly applied {{to the surface of}} cheese by dipping or spraying, using an aqueous dispersion containing 200 to 300 ppm of the additive. The large molecular weight of <b>natamycin,</b> 666 g/mol, and conjugated double bond structure causes it to be extremely insoluble in water and most food grade solvents. The inability to apply <b>natamycin</b> in true solution creates void non-treated areas on the food surface. These non-treated areas promote the growth of fungal organisms.

40|$|The {{antifungal}} antibiotic <b>natamycin</b> {{belongs to}} the family of polyene antibiotics. Its antifungal activity arises via a specific interaction with ergosterol in the plasma membrane (te Welscher et al., J. Biol. Chem. 283 : 6393 - 6401, 2008). However, this activity does not involve disruption of the membrane barrier function, a well-known property of other members of the polyene antibiotic family, such as filipin and nystatin. Here we tested the effect of <b>natamycin</b> on vacuole membrane fusion, which is known to be ergosterol dependent. <b>Natamycin</b> blocked the fusion of isolated vacuoles without compromising the barrier function of the vacuolar membrane. Sublethal doses of <b>natamycin</b> perturbed the cellular vacuole morphology, causing the formation of many more small vacuolar structures in yeast cells. Using vacuoles isolated from yeast strains deficient in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, we showed that the inhibitory activity of <b>natamycin</b> was dependent on the presence of specific chemical features in the structure of ergosterol that allow the binding of <b>natamycin.</b> We found that <b>natamycin</b> inhibited the priming stage of vacuole fusion. Similar results were obtained with nystatin. These results suggest a novel mode of action of <b>natamycin</b> and perhaps all polyene antibiotics, which involves the impairment of membrane fusion via perturbation of ergosterol-dependent priming reactions that precede membrane fusion, and they may point to an effect of <b>natamycin</b> on ergosterol-dependent protein function in genera...|$|E
