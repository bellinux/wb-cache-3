He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E

A Quebec Court judge acquitted a Deputy Returning Officer charged with illegally rejecting 53% of the ballots cast at his Chomedey polling district.|$|E

On October 24, 2013, Keef was released ten days early for good behavior. However, again on November 6, 2013, Keef {{was sent back to}} jail on another probation violation. Then following a stint in rehab, Keef was arrested on March 5, 2014 in Highland Park, Illinois for DUI of marijuana, driving on a suspended license and cited for having <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> insurance.|$|E

50|$|The castle {{was built}} in an unknown age, {{although}} not after the 12th century, since Arab sources mention it in 1172. It has been speculated that the fortification could have been built over a Roman castrum or villa, but <b>no</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> this have been found.|$|R
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{stands at}} a {{strategic}} location overlooking {{the point where the}} River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on the hill in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E

5|$|Folkvord {{is the son}} {{of school}} {{principal}} Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them of misconduct and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. <b>No</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her {{a false sense of security}} while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E

5|$|Mickiewicz {{welcomed the}} Crimean War of 1853-1856, which {{he hoped would}} lead to a new European order {{including}} a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum, honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in the Åland Islands in August 1854. Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Michał Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand Lévy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the Pera (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> this, and he probably contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.|$|E
