Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of Mysteries of the Siths {{content was}} {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; one of the game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, <b>new</b> <b>dialogue</b> was recorded for Mysteries of the Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts in Dark Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi {{and elsewhere in the}} Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Casino Royale {{became the}} first Bond film ever to be shown in {{mainland}} Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and <b>new</b> <b>dialogue</b> added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that {{was added to the}} 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). Casino Royale has earned approximately $11.7million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5million.|$|E

Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the <b>new</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a <b>new</b> <b>dialogue</b> format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E

25|$|Broken Steel is {{the third}} and most {{significant}} downloadable content pack, altering the original ending of Fallout 3 and allowing the player to continue playing past {{the end of the}} main quest line. If the player personally activates Project Purity, their character no longer dies but instead wakes up after a two-week coma to join the ranks of the Brotherhood of Steel and helps rid the Capital Wasteland of the Enclave once and for all. The pack raises the game's level cap from 20 to 30. It includes three main quests and three side-quests. Three Dog has <b>new</b> <b>dialogue</b> in this expansion, but no new songs are added.

25|$|Initial story drafts for Alpha Protocol {{were done}} by Brian Mitsoda. He decided which {{locations}} {{would appear in}} the game and also created all of the story characters, along with Annie Carlson and Brian Menze, who created their visual design. However, the narrative in the released game was primarily written by Avellone, who took over the main creative role on the project two years after development began. This resulted in a substantial rewriting and repurposing of the plot; namely, player choice was given more importance, intertwining of gameplay and reactivity became a forefront design philosophy, and the core and motivations of several narrative threads were changed. The new narrative team, which consisted of Avellone, Travis Stout, and Matt MacLean, wrote <b>new</b> <b>dialogue</b> for the characters previously created by Mitsoda and Carlson, and wrote a new story and script using the locations previously determined by Mitsoda. Each writer was given a set amount of work; MacLean wrote the majority of the in-game emails, and Stout was the lead writer for the Taipei hub, writing for characters such as Steven Heck, Omen Deng, and Hong Shi. Stout was also responsible for writing several secondary characters in the Rome hub, while Avellone designed most other characters.|$|E

500|$|Pollack and Rosenberg {{sent the}} script to Alan J. Pakula, {{who felt that}} it needed {{improvement}} and spent a year rewriting it with Pierson. Regarding the screenwriting process, Turow said, [...] "There were three large narrative problems to solve. Point of view; getting around the first person narrative; time sequence; it's all flashback and Hollywood doesn't like that; and then just {{an awful lot of}} plot." [...] Pierson originally envisioned the film adaptation as being [...] "a movie full of sex and blood". Pakula felt that the concept of justice was more central to the story. He also wanted to present the film in a visual style that echoed the novel's narrative. In making various changes from the novel, Pakula and Pierson added <b>new</b> <b>dialogue</b> and rewrote the ending. Pakula signed on to direct the film in January 1989.|$|E

500|$|In Japan, Pocket Monsters: Red and Green {{were the}} first {{versions}} released, having been completed by October 1995 and officially released on February 27, 1996. They sold rapidly, {{due in part to}} Nintendo's idea of producing the two versions of the game instead of a single title, prompting consumers to buy both. Several months later, the [...] version was released in Japan as a mail-order-only special edition, featuring updated in-game artwork and <b>new</b> <b>dialogue.</b> To create more hype and challenge to the games, Tajiri revealed an extra Pokémon called Mew hidden within the games, which he believed [...] "created a lot of rumors and myths about the game" [...] and [...] "kept the interest alive". The creature was originally added by Shigeki Morimoto as an internal prank and wasn't supposed to be exposed to consumers. It was not until later that Nintendo decided to distribute Mew through a Nintendo promotional event. However, in 2003 a glitch became widely known and could be exploited so anyone could obtain the elusive Pokémon.|$|E

In an Anime News Network interview, Foster said he [...] "made some changes {{to make the}} jokes more accessible". Mays also said, [...] "The animation is breathtaking. Shinkai's backgrounds have very few equals. The character designs look uninspired, but paired with the animator's beautifully realized worlds, the generic appearance fades into the magnificence of the scene." [...] He said Shinkai's use of lighting is [...] "masterful", [...] "incredibly realistic" [...] and conveys the characters' moods well. He called the characters [...] "unoriginal". DVD Verdict's Rob Lineberger commended the music, saying [...] "the simple score infuses the animation with meaning. Solitary piano notes are sluggish, as though the pianist lacked the enthusiasm needed {{to pick up his}} fingers. When the action kicks in, it arrives with a sonic punch from 5.1 speakers. Rockets scream around you, birds move overhead, engines thrum quietly in your wake. The soundtrack does what it is supposed to do: transport you to another world".|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} July 1995 in New York City. A second unit gathered plate shots and establishing shots of Manhattan, Washington D.C., an RV community in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Very Large Array on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico. The main crew also filmed in nearby Cliffside Park, New Jersey {{before moving to}} the former Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences. The production then moved to Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nevada, where the deserts doubled for Imperial Valley, and the Wendover Airport doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors. It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add [...] "Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!"
