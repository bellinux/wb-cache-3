5|$|Though Povenmire {{started on}} Rocko simply to occupy his {{downtime}} from The Simpsons, {{he found the}} greater creative freedom he enjoyed on his temporary job compelling, and quit The Simpsons to work on Rocko full-time. There, he reunited with Jeff Marsh, this time as a writing partner; Marsh claimed the crew hoped Povenmire's <b>neatness</b> would offset his own sloppy storyboarding. The pair developed a distinctive style characterized by characteristic musical numbers and chase scenes. Povenmire and Marsh won an Environmental Achievement Award for a 1996 Rocko episode they had written.|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate <b>neatness</b> and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E
25|$|The <b>neatness</b> of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe {{a speck of}} dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, {{had been in his}} time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
25|$|Much {{importance}} is placed upon the <b>neatness</b> of boys' appearance. School colours {{are black and}} white and/or green {{if you have been}} awarded major honours which enables you to acquire a green blazer accompanied by a green pullover if you so wish. The school uniform consists of a black badged blazer, House tie (with colour representing house), black trousers, black shoes with an optional V-neck pullover.|$|E
25|$|A sugar packet is a {{delivery}} method for one 'serving' of sugar. Sugar packets are commonly supplied in restaurants and coffee bars in preference to sugar bowls or sugar dispensers {{for reasons of}} <b>neatness,</b> spill control, {{and to some extent}} portion control. In 1957, the sugar packet that consisted of a granulated low-calorie sugar substitute, was invented by Benjamin Eisenstadt, the founder of Cumberland Packing or better known today as the Sweet 'N Low company.|$|E
25|$|Two smaller {{works are}} the Conceptos del Amor ("Concepts of Love") and Exclamaciones. In addition, there are Las Cartas (Saragossa, 1671), or her correspondence, {{of which there}} are 342 extant letters and 87 {{fragments}} of others. St Teresa's prose is marked by an unaffected grace, an ornate <b>neatness,</b> and charming power of expression, together placing her in the front rank of Spanish prose writers; and her rare poems ("Todas las poesías", Munster, 1854) are distinguished for tenderness of feeling and rhythm of thought.|$|E
25|$|The Epistle to a Friend {{concerning}} Poetry {{is neither}} startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, {{much more to}} say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both <b>neatness</b> and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but such was {{the tradition of the}} poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we are not aware of its having had much effect.|$|E
25|$|A temple {{built by}} Birla group is {{dedicated}} to the Sun god, the Sun Temple is located near residency at Morar, Gwalior. It is a facsimile of the Sun temple of Konark, Odisha and now this sun temple is one among the significant pilgrimage centres in Gwalior. It is the place which gives best examples of peace and <b>neatness</b> in Gwalior. The temple is located in a serene ambience and a well-maintained garden within the temple premises is very attractive. This holy temple draws the locals and tourists alike who gather here to render their prayers. It makes one astounded that a shrine of comparatively modern origin holds such a highest regard, and became one among the most sought after pilgrimage centres in the city.|$|E

500|$|Domestic {{critical}} {{reception of}} Darah dan Doa, which was advertised as showing [...] "fierce {{fighting against the}} colonials!" [...] and [...] "the joys and sorrows in guerrilla warfare", was predominantly negative. A review in the newspaper Merdeka considered Darah dan Doa unsatisfying, {{with only a few}} acceptable scenes. Armijn Pane, writing four years after the film's release, criticised the troops' <b>neatness</b> during their march, writing that their uniforms should have become progressively dirtier. Foreign reception, however, has been more positive. The Japanese film critic Tadao Sato, for instance, praised the film's concept, comparing it to the work of Andrzej Wajda.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, Milton Bradley {{developed}} {{a radically different}} concept of success in The Checkered Game of Life, the first American board game rewarding players for worldly ventures such as attending college, being elected to Congress, and getting rich. Virtue became {{a means to an}} end rather than an end in itself. [...] Daily life was the focus of the game with secular virtues such as thrift, ambition, and <b>neatness</b> receiving more emphasis than religious virtues. Indeed, the only suggestion of religion in Bradley's game was the marriage altar. [...] The Checkered Game of Life was wildly popular, selling 40,000 copies in its first year.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich {{established}} {{his reputation as}} an artist when he won a prize in 1805 at the Weimar competition organised by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. At the time, the Weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and now-forgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neo-classical and pseudo-Greek styles. The poor quality of the entries began to prove damaging to Goethe's reputation, so when Friedrich entered two sepia drawings—Procession at Dawn and Fisher-Folk by the Sea—the poet responded enthusiastically and wrote, [...] "We must praise the artist's resourcefulness in this picture fairly. The drawing is well done, the procession is ingenious and appropriate... his treatment combines {{a great deal of}} firmness, diligence and <b>neatness...</b> the ingenious watercolour... is also worthy of praise." ...|$|E
500|$|Other fictional inspirations include Columbo and Sherlock Holmes, and his {{obsession}} with <b>neatness</b> and order {{may be an}} homage to Hercule Poirot. Like Holmes, and occasionally Poirot, Monk is accompanied by an earnest assistant {{with little or no}} detective ability, similar to Doctor Watson and Captain Hastings, respectively; Monk's two major allies from the police department, Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher (credited as [...] "Deacon" [...] in the pilot episode), are reminiscent of Inspector Lestrade and Chief Inspector Japp, Holmes's and Poirot's well-meaning but ineffectual respective police counterparts. In addition, Monk has a brother whose abilities of deduction are even more amazing than his, yet much more geographically limited due to his own personal problems, somewhat in the style of Mycroft Holmes (who is more adept than Sherlock but also notoriously lazy).|$|E
500|$|Adam {{suggests}} that Lie is best remembered for {{his contributions to}} Indonesian literature, with his publications well received by his contemporaries. Tio writes that [...] "old and young intimately read his (Lie's) writings, which were praised for their simple language, rhythm, clarity, freshness, and strength. The skill and accuracy with which he chose his words, the <b>neatness</b> and orderliness with which he arranged his sentences.... People {{said that he was}} ahead of his time. He was likened to a large shining star, a stark contrast to the small, faded stars in the dark sky." [...] Further praise was awarded by other contemporaries, both native and Chinese, such as Ibrahim gelar Marah Soetan and Agus Salim. When ethnic Chinese writers became common in the early 1900s, critics named Lie the [...] "father of Chinese Malay literature" [...] for his contributions, including Siti Akbari and Tjhit Liap Seng.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1847, the clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville Jones {{said that}} St Mary's was [...] "remarkable {{for being in}} one of the sweetest spots in the isle of Anglesey" [...] The interior, he said, was [...] "greatly blocked up with pews", but was in [...] "excellent repair", with [...] "a degree of <b>neatness</b> and comfort about it quite unusual in this district." [...] The roof timbers, he commented, were [...] "closely set together, light in section, but producing a good effect." [...] The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited a couple of years later, in 1849. [...] He described St Mary's as being in a [...] "pretty" [...] situation, [...] "surrounded by trees". He noted the [...] "fair" [...] east window and the [...] "rude timber framework" [...] of the roof. In 2006, a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that the red sandstone used in the windows and in the bellcote was showing signs of [...] "severe weathering" [...] in places.|$|E
500|$|Bell-Bottom George was {{described}} 60 years {{later by the}} academic Baz Kershaw as being [...] "unashamedly gay and... peppered with homoerotic scenes"; Bret concurs, and notes that [...] "the majority of the cast and {{almost every one of}} the male extras was unashamedly gay", The film was a hit with what Bret describes as Formby's [...] "surprisingly large, closeted gay following". The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian was impressed with the film, and wrote that [...] "there is a new <b>neatness</b> of execution and lightness of touch about this production... while George himself can no longer be accused of trailing clouds of vaudevillian glory". The reviewer also considered Formby [...] "our first authentic and strictly indigenous film comedian". After completing filming, the Formbys undertook a further ENSA tour. Although Dean personally disliked the Formbys, he greatly admired the tireless work they did for the organisation. In August Formby undertook a 53-day tour in {{a significant portion of the}} Mediterranean, including Italy, Sicily, Malta, Gibraltar, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine; visiting 750,000 troops in thirteen countries, touring [...] in the process and returning to England in October. The couple travelled around the countryside in a Ford Mercury that Formby had purchased from the racing driver Sir Malcolm Campbell, which had been converted to sleep two in the back.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was first}} published when in 1806 it was taken to London and displayed when a letter on it by the Rev. J. Milner, presumably Bishop John Milner, Catholic Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District, was read to {{a meeting of the}} London Society of Antiquaries, which was subsequently printed in their journal Archaeologia. [...] Milner followed the medieval note in relating the book to Cuthbert, and compared its script to that of the Lindisfarne Gospels, by then in the British Museum, examining the two side by side. [...] However he thought that [...] "the binding seems to be of the time of Queen Elizabeth"! [...] After the lecture it took some years to return to Stonyhurst as an intermediary forgot to forward it. [...] That the binding was original, and the earliest European example, was realised during the 19th century, and when exhibited in 1862 it was described in the catalogue as [...] "In unique coeval (?) binding". [...] The whole appearance and feel of the book, and the accuracy of the text and beauty of the script was highly praised by scholars such as Bishop Christopher Wordsworth (1807–1885), nephew of the poet and an important New Testament textual scholar, who described the book as [...] "surpassing in delicate simplicity of <b>neatness</b> every manuscript that I have seen".|$|E
500|$|Handlen {{felt that}} the {{character}} development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; [...] "Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying <b>neatness,</b> {{and serves as a}} reminder that for all their talk, Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make." [...] Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; [...] "Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia," [...] asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded {{that it was one of}} the episode highlights, writing, [...] "He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, but ever since the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that barn door, he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself." [...] Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he [...] "realizes [...] that he's still very much a kid".|$|E
2500|$|The {{composer}} Benjamin Britten {{wrote in}} 1951, [...] "fter {{four or five}} performances I never wanted to hear Bohème again. In spite of its <b>neatness,</b> I became sickened by the cheapness and emptiness of the music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bullseye {{cancellation}} {{also called}} [...] "Socked on the nose" [...] or SOTN, is a stamp collector's {{term for a}} cancellation, typically of circular design, centered on the postage stamp.

[...] Although {{it might be possible to}} see [...] > [...] , [...] > [...] and [...] > [...] as a similar group of three, both the chronology and the differing phonetic conditions under which these changes occur speak against such a grouping.|$|E
2500|$|He would {{monitor the}} extracurricular {{behavior}} of students judging their character faults and strengths.

He did not want the image of the poor, tattered, down-trodden yeshiva bochur (yeshiva student) {{to be associated with the}} alumni of his institution.

2500|$|Les Fêtes Chinoises was {{presented}} in London with new machinery and décor by Boquet under the title Les Métamorphoses Chinoises on 8November 1755 following negotiations between David Garrick, proprietor of Drury Lane Theatre (who appreciated ballet, had married a ballerina, and {{was looking for a}} theatrical novelty), and Jean Monnet, the licence holder at the Opéra-Comique. One commentator remarked:The sets were superb and the costumes magnificent. Ninety persons appeared in the march. The palanquin and the cars were richly decorated. All the wings were embellished with balconies filled with Chinese men and women spectators of the fete. The corps de ballet were well composed and well grouped, the individual pas agreeably varied, and the contredanse was executed with a precision and <b>neatness</b> unusual in grands ballets [...]|$|E
2500|$|From his {{earliest}} years Lucas {{had been a}} martyr to hereditary gout, which rendered him a complete cripple, and latterly obliged him to be carried to the House of Commons. Nevertheless, says an eye-witness, [...] "the gravity and uncommon <b>neatness</b> of his dress, his grey, venerable locks, blending with a pale but interesting countenance, in which an air of beauty was still visible, altogether excited attention, and I never saw a stranger come into the house without asking who he was." [...] He died at his residence in Henry Street, Dublin, on Monday 4 November 1771. His remains were honoured with a public funeral of imposing solemnity. He was interred in the family burial-ground in St. Michan's churchyard. Lucas’s son Henry and other relatives were in attendance at his funeral, as were his friends Lord Charlemont, Flood and Adderley. The mourners also included officers and many hundred brethren of the guilds and the Lord Mayor {{with representatives of the}} Corporation and the Vice-Provost and scholars of Trinity College.|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, critic Jonathan Culler {{questions}} the New Critical emphasis on self-reference, {{the idea that}} by [...] "enacting or performing what it asserts or describes, the poem becomes complete in itself, accounts for itself, and stands free as a self-contained fusion of being and doing". [...] For Brooks, [...] "The Canonization" [...] serves as a monument, a [...] "well-wrought urn" [...] to the lovers, just as the speaker describes his canonisation through love: the lovers' [...] "legend, their story, will gain them canonization". [...] To Culler, however, this self-referentiality reveals [...] "an uncanny <b>neatness</b> that generates paradox, a self-reference that ultimately brings out the inability of any discourse to account for itself", {{as well as the}} [...] "failure" [...] of being and doing to [...] "coincide". Instead of a tidy, [...] "self-contained urn", the poem depicts a [...] "chain of discourses and representations", such as the legend about the lovers, poems about their love, praise from those who read these poems, the saintly invocations of the lovers, and their responses to these requests. In a larger sense, self-referentiality affords not closure but a long chain of references, such as Brooks's naming his New Critical treatise The Well-Wrought Urn to parallel the urn in the poem.n ...|$|E
2500|$|The final goal {{pursued by}} the Vienna Circle was unified science, that is the {{construction}} of a [...] "constitutive system" [...] in which every legitimate statement is reduced to the concepts of lower level which refer directly to the given experience. [...] "The endeavour is to link and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science". From this aim follows the search for clarity, <b>neatness,</b> and for a symbolic language that eliminates the problems arising from the ambiguity of natural language. The Vienna Circle published a collection, called Einheitswissenschaft (Unified science), edited by Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, Joergen Joergensen (after Hahn's death) and Charles W. Morris (from 1938), whose aim was to present a unified vision of science. After the publication in Europe of seven monographs from 1933 to 1939, the collection was dismissed, because of the problems arising from the World War II. In 1938 a new series of publications started in USA. It was the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, an ambitious project never completed devoted to unified science. Only the first section Foundations of the Unity of Sciences was published; it contains two volumes for a total of twenty monographs published from 1938 to 1969. As remembered by Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris in the Preface to the 1969 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science: ...|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of {{the advice}} of his bowlers Ted Dexter {{preferred}} to continue with the successful bowling attack from Melbourne, and may have been swayed by the Australians who dropped Peter Burge and Ken Mackay in favour of debutants Barry Shepherd and Colin Guest. Mackay was a loyal - if dour - servant of Australia and a great man in a crisis, but public opinion was vocal against his stonewalling and he and Burge were unfairly blamed for the defeat at Melbourne. The inclusion of the energetic captain of Western Australia pleased the England team, who had tried to play him into the Tests, but kept getting him out. Colin Guest was a fast-medium bowler who was brought into to support Alan Davidson and Garth McKenzie instead of Mackay. That Richie Benaud was content with three pace bowlers and the leg-spin of himself and Bobby Simpson on his home ground signalled that the wicket was not as flat as Trueman thought. Dexter was never a man to favour spinners and was disinclined to include the out-of-form David Allen or Ray Illingworth in the team. John Murray's <b>neatness</b> behind the stumps was finally recognised and he replaced the much criticised Alan Smith as wicket-keeper. [...] Peter Parfitt was back in the England team as Tom Graveney had picked up a viral infection.|$|E
2500|$|As {{established}} and successful songwriters Flanders and Swann {{were invited to}} lecture on their craft at Dartington International Summer School [...] in 1956. Flanders found that his spoken introductions were as well received by the audience as the songs themselves. He and Swann decided to give a show along similar lines in London. They took the New Lindsey Theatre for a limited three-week run; the New Lindsey, holding about 150 people, was situated outside the London West End theatre district. The show opened on 31 December 1956. The press notices were good, the box-office did excellent business, and the pair were offered a West End transfer. Swann recalled in 1977, [...] "We turned it down unanimously. It seemed to spell the end of Michael's radio career (he had by that time done at least a thousand broadcasts) {{and the end of}} Swann as composer." [...] After each had spent two or three sleepless nights worrying, they reconsidered; the show transferred to the Fortune Theatre in Covent Garden on 24 January 1957, where, according to The Times, [...] "it took the audience by storm". The critic J. C. Trewin wrote, [...] "I feel that even [...] Gilbert might have applauded the intricate <b>neatness</b> of their numbers. … I urge you to hear Mr Flanders as he explains the precise derivation of 'Greensleeves'." [...] The show ran for 808 performances at the Fortune, until 2 May 1959.|$|E
2500|$|Colby edited a {{department}} in the Beatrice Express called [...] "Woman's Work," [...] and in 1883, she founded, published, and edited The Woman's Tribune. For several years, she was deeply interested in the movement for woman's enfranchisement, devoting her journal to the advocacy of this reform. The Woman's Tribune took the prize at the Paris Exposition in 1900 for its <b>neatness</b> and workman-like appearance, and it filled an important place {{in the history of}} the suffragist cause, being for a time the recognized organ of the National Woman Suffrage Association. A contemporary and friend of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, Colby lectured extensively not only to general audiences, but before legislative and congressional committees. In 1888, at the time of the great International Council of Women in Washington, D.C. Colby published the Tribune daily during the week of the council, and continued it through the Woman's Suffrage Convention the following week. It is probably the first instance of a daily woman's paper being published by a woman. During the period of 1885-98, she served as president of the Nebraska Woman Suffrage Association, and in 1895, she served as the chair of the Federal Suffrage Committee. She spoke in behalf of the soldiers of the Spanish–American War (1898); during the Spanish–American War, she was officially appointed as war correspondent, the first woman to be so recognized. She was also an advocate of peace at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California in 1915.|$|E
2500|$|J. des Boulmiers, an {{eyewitness}} to {{a performance of}} Les Fêtes Chinoises wrote: a public square decorated for a festival with, in the background, an amphitheatre on which are seated sixteen Chinese [...] thirty-two are seen on the gradins (stepped tiers) going through a pantomime. As the first group descends, sixteen further Chinese, both mandarins and slaves, {{come out of their}} habitations [...] All these form eight rows of dancers who, rising and dipping in succession, imitate fairly well the billows of a stormy sea. All the Chinese, having descended, begin a character march. [...] There are a mandarin, borne in a rich palanquin by six white slaves, whilst two negros draw a chariot on which a young Chinese woman is seated. They are preceded and followed by a host of Chinese playing various musical instruments [...] This march concluded, the ballet begins and leaves nothing to be desired either in the diversity or in the <b>neatness</b> of the figures. It ends in a contredanse of thirty-two persons whose movements trace a prodigious number of new and perfectly designed attitudes, which form and dissolve with the greatest of ease. At the end [...] the Chinese return to their place on the amphitheatre, which is transformed into a china cabinet. Thirty-two vases, which rise up, conceal [...] the thirty-two Chinese one saw before. Considering that most performances (theatrical and ballet) before this took place in either the royal courts or in inn yards, taverns, or pubs, having that many people on the stage at one time was unheard of. However, Lincoln Kirstein adds that it [...] "consisted of dance pictures with little plot, incorporating elements of the real and ideal, including the exotic China of travelers and explorers and the fantastic Cathay of Rococo chinoiserie designers." [...] Furthermore, the costumes were [...] "untraditional"—they were based on Roman armor and had Chinese embellishments on them.|$|E
