40|$|The EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone) {{programme}} {{ran from}} 1994 to 2004, and involved over 150 scientists {{from more than}} 17 countries. The main scientific aim was an integrated study of the water column and benthos, linked by bentho-pelagic coupling, of the Antarctic continental shelf. Because water-column studies were well served by existing international programmes (SO-JGOFS, SO-GLOBEC) and <b>national</b> biological <b>oceanographic</b> <b>programmes,</b> EASIZ itself concentrated on the benthos and bentho-pelagic coupling. Work in the EASIZ programme {{has led to the}} overturning of some previous paradigms, for example that the Antarctic is species-poor, and replaced these with a revised picture linking the assemblage structure and population dynamics to the glacial-marine setting. The legacy of EASIZ is a wide-ranging reassessment of the diversity, history and ecology of the Antarctic benthos, the coupling of this system to water-column processes, and a fundamental revision of our view of physiological adaptation to temperature in polar marine organisms...|$|R

The intensity and directionality of the biosonar beam defines the field of view of echolocating animals by affecting the acoustic detection range and angular coverage. However, the spatial relationship between an echolocating predator and its prey changes rapidly, resulting in different biosonar requirements throughout prey pursuit and capture. Here, we measured single-click beam patterns using a parametric fit procedure to test whether free-ranging Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) modify their biosonar beam width. We recorded echolocation clicks using a linear array of receivers and estimated the beam width of individual clicks using a parametric spectral fit, cross-validated with well-established composite beam pattern estimates. The dolphins apparently increased the biosonar beam width, to a large degree without changing the signal frequency, when they approached the recording array. This is comparable to bats that also expand their field of view during prey capture, but achieve this by decreasing biosonar frequency. This behaviour may serve to decrease the risk that rapid escape movements of prey take them outside the biosonar beam of the predator. It is likely that shared sensory requirements have resulted in bats and toothed whales expanding their acoustic field of view at close range to increase the likelihood of successfully acquiring prey using echolocation, representing a case of convergent evolution of echolocation behaviour between these two taxa.
