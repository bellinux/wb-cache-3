We can be sure that our beloved pope is {{standing}} today at the window of the Father's house that he sees us and blesses us. Yes, bless us, Holy Father. We entrust your dear soul to the Mother of God, your Mother, who guided you each day and who will guide you now to the eternal glory of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

Kennedy was reported in The New York Times as saying, [...] "an injured, maimed, or dead child is a price that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> afford to pay", although adding, [...] "I believe that everyone understands their just grievances must be resolved." [...] Malcolm X criticized the decision, saying, [...] "Real men don't put their children on the firing line." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{urged that}} {{presently}} polarized national debate be conducted [...] "in {{a way that}} heals, not {{in a way that}} wounds." [...] Quoting the Book of Job 30:26, he observed that [...] "terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding." [...] He then said, [...] "For the truth is that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> know exactly what triggered this vicious attack", and that no one can know [...] "what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man's mind". Urging his listeners to avoid using the tragedy as [...] "one more occasion to turn on one another", he recommended humility, empathy and especially reflection instead, urging people to consider whether they have [...] "shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives".|$|E

Introduction: Some one has said, “keep {{house in order}} to live comfortably, don’t live in order to keep house. ” The advance of society rests on the {{personal}} health, sanity and happiness of its members, whose bet growth require quiet comfortable homes; with peace and health order and beauty. Upon the house keeper lays the responsibility of providing such conditions together with good wholesome nourishing food. Innumerable theories have been advanced as regards methods and management of house hold duties but there are <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that <b>can</b> select one particular plan and execute our tasks according to its specific guidance. Each housekeeper is compelled to outline a system of work according to her own environments...|$|R
6000|$|Another head is {{the saving}} on {{the army and}} {{ordnance}} extraordinaries, particularly in the American branch. What or how much reduction may be made, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I believe, <b>can</b> with any fairness pretend to say; very little, I am convinced. The state of America is extremely unsettled; more troops have been sent thither; new dispositions have been made; and this augmentation of number, and change of disposition, has rarely, I believe, the effect of lessening the bill for extraordinaries, which, if not this year, yet in the next we must certainly feel. Care has not been wanting to introduce economy into {{that part of the}} service. The author's great friend has made, I admit, some regulations: his immediate successors have made more and better. This part will be handled more ably and more minutely at another time: but no one can cut down this bill of extraordinaries at his pleasure. The author has given us nothing, but his word, for any certain or considerable reduction; and this we ought to be the more cautious in taking, as he has promised great savings in his [...] "Considerations," [...] which he has not chosen to abide by in his [...] "State of the Nation." ...|$|R

40|$|Altruism is {{embedded}} in our biology and in our culture. We offer our bus seats to the disabled and elderly, give directions to disoriented tourists, and donate a portion of our income charity. Yet {{for all the good}} it does, there are deep problems with altruism as it is practiced today. Nearly all <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> when asked, will say that we care about practicing altruism in a way that effectively improves the lives <b>of</b> others. Almost <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> when asked, <b>can</b> honestly say that we have made a serious effort to ensure that we are practicing altruism in a way that effectively improves the lives of others. Disparities like these are indicative of flaws in our cognitive architecture - biases which ensure that the traditional practice of altruism is incongruous with our own values. This disconnect between our values and our actions causes our altruistic efforts to help fewer people to a lesser extent than they otherwise could. I argue that traditional altruism is in need of reformation and defend a social and philosophical movement aimed at achieving this reformation known as effective altruism. The reason effective altruism is such a promising alternative to traditional altruism is its application of economic thinking to the realm of altruism and morality. An economist’s mentality is, I suggest, a necessary instrument for bridging the gap between our values and our actions, allowing us to practice altruism in a way that more effectively improves the lives of others...|$|R
6000|$|My {{talk with}} Florac lasted for some time: at its close, {{when we went}} to join the ladies in the drawing-room, we found Ethel cloaked and shawled, and {{prepared}} for her departure with her young ones, who were already asleep. The little festival was over, and had ended in melancholy--even in weeping. Our hostess sate in her accustomed seat by her lamp and her worktable; but, neglecting her needle, she was having perpetual recourse to her pocket-handkerchief, and uttering ejaculations of pity between the intervals of her gushes of tears. Madame de Florac was in her usual place, her head cast downwards, and her hands folded. My wife was at her side, a grave commiseration showing itself in Laura's countenance, whilst I read a yet deeper sadness in Ethel's pale face. Miss Newcome's carriage had been announced; the attendants had already carried the young ones asleep to the vehicle; and she was in the act of taking leave. We looked round at this disturbed party, guessing very likely what the subject of their talk had been, to which, however, Miss Ethel did not allude: but, announcing that she had intended to depart without disturbing the two gentlemen, she bade us farewell and good night. [...] "I wish I could say a merry Christmas," [...] she added gravely, [...] "but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I fear, <b>can</b> hope for that." [...] It was evident that Laura had told the last chapter of the Colonel's story.|$|R

Police responded that their response was [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "clearly disciplined."
