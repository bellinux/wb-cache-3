50|$|Beginning in 2003, Prof. Taflove has {{collaborated with}} Prof. Vadim Backman of Northwestern University's Biomedical Engineering Department in {{research}} {{aimed at the}} minimally invasive detection of early-stage human cancers of the colon, pancreas, lung, and ovaries. The techniques being pursued are based upon a spectroscopic microscopy analysis of light backscattered from histologically normal tissue located away from a <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesion</b> {{in what has been}} termed the field effect. This may lead to a new paradigm in cancer screening where, for example, lung cancer could be reliably detected by analyzing a few cells brushed from the interior surface of a person's cheek. On May 5, 2008, a large collaboration headed by Prof. Backman (with Prof. Taflove as a co-investigator) was awarded a five-year, $7.5-million grant from the National Institutes of Health to pursue this biophotonics technology to develop a noninvasive test for population-wide colon cancer screening.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and nineteen orchidectomy specimens were received in the Pathology Department of Gandhi Medical College from July 2008 to June 2013. The patients clinical details were noted. The gross examination findings of the excised specimens along with the histopathological findings were analysed. RESULTS: Out of 119 orchidectomy specimens 7 are neoplastic lesions& 112 non - <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Among non - <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> 24 are chronic non - specific epididymo orchitis, 5 - caseating granulomatous orchitis, 1 - filarial orchitis, 1 - syphilitic orchitis, 20 acute suppurative epididymo orchitis (pyoceole), 16 – torsions, 4 - traumatic, 6 - atrophic, 10 - maturation arrests and 25 showed normal histology. <b>Neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> included 2 - seminomas, 1 - spermatocytic seminoma, 1 - yolk sac tumor, 1 - mixed germ cell tumor and 2 - Non Hodgkins lymphomas.

In the present study, the activity of G 6 PD, and the other NADPH-producing enzymes, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) and malate dehydrogenase (MD) was investigated in (pre) <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> by metabolic mapping. Transketolase (TKT), the reversible rate-limiting enzyme of the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, mainly responsible for ribose production, was studied as well. Activity of G 6 PD in (pre) <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> was highest, whereas activity of PGD and ICD was only 10 % and of MD 5 % of G 6 PD activity, respectively. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity in (pre) <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> was increased 25 times compared with extralesional parenchyma, which was also the highest activity increase of the four NADPH-producing dehydrogenases. Transketolase activity was 0. 1 % of G 6 PD activity in lesions and was increased 2. 5 -fold as compared with normal parenchyma. Transketolase activity was localized by electron microscopy exclusively at membranes of granular endoplasmic reticulum in rat hepatoma cells where G 6 PD activity is localized as well. It is concluded that NADPH in (pre) <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> is mainly produced by G 6 PD, whereas elevated TKT activity in (pre) <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> is responsible for ribose formation with concomitant energy supply by glycolysis.

Aims: This study was designed to determine the prevalence of HPV in biopsies from inflammatory and neoplastic lesions of oesophagus and correlate it with expression of p 16 INK 4 a. Materials and Methods: The study included 102 oesophageal biopsies. Haematoxylin & Eosin stained sections were examined for morphological details including koilocytosis. Immunohistochemistry for HPV and p 16 INK 4 a were done on 50 biopsies. HPV positivity was graded and scoring for p 16 INK 4 a was done. Results: Various grades of koilocytosis was noted in 68. 75 %, 94. 73 % and 72. 91 % controls, inflammatory and neoplastic lesions respectively. IHC for HPV was positive in 80 % control, 75 % inflammatory and 100 % cases of <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesion.</b> Complete score for p 16 INK 4 a was 0. 60, 0. 59 and 3. 63 in control, inflammatory and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesion.</b> The difference in expression of p 16 INK 4 a between neoplastic and inflammatory lesion was statistically significant.

40|$|Estrogens {{have been}} implicated to play certain but yet {{undefined}} {{roles in the}} normal and neoplastic growth of prostate gland. Studies of perinatal exposure in rodents demonstrate that effects of perinatal estrogenization are permanent and carcinogenic in prostate gland. In the Noble (Nb) rat model, prostatic dysplasia and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> can be induced by a chronic treatment with both testosterone and estrogen at adulthood. However, by this conventional protocol, <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> are mostly confined to the lateral (LP) and ventral (VP) prostates, while gross prostatic tumors are rarely induced. Based on these two experimental models, we developed a modified treatment protocol for the enhancement of prostate cancer induction in Nb rat model by combining neonatal estrogen exposure of male offspring followed by the hormonal treatment at adulthood (NeoE + T-E 2). Using this modified protocol, {{we were able to}} induce more extensive development of <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> in all three prostatic lobes and also gross tumors at relatively high incidence within 6 - 9 months. Western blottings and immunohistochemistry showed that ERalpha expression was increased in the hypertrophic peri-acinar and -ductal smooth muscle cells while ERbeta and AR expressions are markedly decreased in dysplastic and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> in NeoE + T-E 2 -treated prostates. Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of three tumor suppressors (BRCA 2, PTEN, and Rap 1) and tubulin-alpha are markedly decreased in dysplastic and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions.</b> In addition, loss of expression of smooth muscle differentiation markers (desmin, alpha-actin, and vinculin) and defects of basement membranes were also seen in the reactive stroma.

Aims: To investigate at long-term follow-up the behaviour of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia and the occurrence of <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> in atrophic body gastritis patients. Methods: Overall 106 atrophic body gastritis patients with >= 4 -year follow-up were studied; 38 were Helicobacter pylori-positive at histology + serology and cured of infection (group A), 36 were positive at serology and not treated (group B) and 32 were H. pylori-negative (group C).

METHODS: One hundred patients with pleural or peripheral pulmonary lesions underwent thoracic CEUS. An 8 microliters/mL solution of sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles stabilized by a phospholipid shell (SonoVue®) was used as US contrast agent. The clips were stored and independently reviewed by two readers, who recorded the following parameters: presence/absence of arterial enhancement, time to enhancement (TE), extent of enhancement (EE), pattern of enhancement (PE), presence/absence of wash-out, time to wash-out, and extent of wash-out. After the final diagnosis (based on histopathologic findings or follow-up of at least 15 mo) was reached, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of each CEUS parameter in the differential diagnosis between <b>neoplastic</b> and non-neoplastic <b>lesions</b> were calculated. Furthermore, an arbitrary score based on the ratio between the PPVs of each CEUS parameter was calculated, to evaluate if some relationship could exist between overall CEUS behaviour and neoplastic or non-neoplastic nature of the lesions. RESULTS: Five patients were lost at follow-up before a conclusive diagnosis was reached, 53 <b>lesions</b> resulted <b>neoplastic</b> and 42 non-neoplastic. Enhancement in the arterial phase was observed in 53 / 53 <b>neoplastic</b> <b>lesions</b> and 30 / 42 non-neoplastic lesions.
