40|$|The {{incubation}} of a cell-free protein-synthesizing system prepared from rabbit reticulocytes with cytoplasmic RNA from {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) -infected cells resulted in increased thymidine kinase activity. This enzyme activity was specifically inhibited by anti-HSV antiserum and was relatively unaffected by TTP, an inhibitor of cellular thymidine kinases. Induction of the <b>new</b> <b>activity</b> was prevented by addition of inhibitors of eucaryotic protein synthesis, and <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>activity</b> was detected when RNA from cells infected with pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinase-deficient mutants, instead of wild-type HSV, was added. An increased deoxycytidine kinase activity with similar properties to the HSV-specified enzyme activity was also present in cell-free systems incubated with RNA from HSV-infected cells. Phosphorylation of thymidine and deoxycytidine at 30 degrees C continued for longer than 11 h. The {{findings are consistent with}} the accurate synthesis in vitro of enzymically active HSV-specified pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinase...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the prevalence, duration and effect on damage accrual of the 'Lupus Low Disease Activity State' (LLDAS) in a monocentric cohort {{of patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We studied 293 Caucasian patients with SLE during a 7 -year follow-up period. Disease activity was assessed by SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI- 2 K) and SELENA-SLEDAI physician global assessment (PGA), and damage by Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI). We considered the following definition of LLDAS: SLEDAI- 2 K ≤ 4 without major organ <b>activity,</b> <b>no</b> <b>new</b> disease <b>activity,</b> PGA (0 - 3) ≤ 1, prednisone ≤ 7. 5 [*]mg/day and well-tolerated immunosuppressant dosages.

40|$|Excerpt] The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program {{provides}} technical assistance and cash benefits to producers of farm commodities and fishermen who experience adverse economic effects from increased imports. Congress first authorized this program in 2002, and made significant changes {{to it in}} the 2009 economic stimulus package (P. L. 111 - 5). The 2009 revisions were aimed at making it easier for farmers and fishermen to qualify for program benefits, and provided over $ 200 million in funding through December 2010. Subsequently, P. L. 112 - 40 (enacted in October 2011) authorized $ 202. 5 million through December 2013, but <b>no</b> <b>new</b> program <b>activity</b> has occurred since December 2010 for lack of appropriated funds. In June 2015, Congress passed H. R. 1295, the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, authorizing TAAF through FY 2021, and the President signed the bill into law on June 29, 2015, as P.

40|$|Two active lysine {{transport}} systems were detected in Saccharomycopsis lipolytica. No excretion of lysine {{out of the}} cells could be obtained, even by chasing with L-lysine or by poisoning with sodium azide. The kinetic properties {{of one of the}} permeases, the high-affinity lysine permease, were studied in detail. Its Km was 1. 91 +/- 0. 23 X 10 (- 5) M. It proved highly specific, the only potent competitive inhibitors being (i) arginine and its analogs L-canavanine and L-ornithine, and (ii) the lysine analogs L- 5 aminoethylcysteine and L- 4, 5 -transdehydrolysine. It is suggested that the high-affinity lysine permease is common to L-lysine, L-ornithine, and L-arginine. The other amino acids tested behaved as noncompetitive inhibitors. The variation of uptake during a growth cycle was studied on ammonia-rich, ammonia-poor, and ammonia-free media. In each case, the uptake exhibited a peak in the early exponential growth phase. <b>No</b> <b>new</b> permease <b>activity</b> was detected during the lag phase or the stationary phase.

[...] What little had survived was destroyed a week later by a fire that engulfed the facility, forcing Bidtopia to run its operations from its two other locations, in Mississippi and Utah. Bidtopia, which had been reportedly doing well to that point, sought out and agreed upon a partnership with Ken May and Bill Doherty, a former CEO and executive, respectively, of FedEx, and seemed on to be on the road to recovery.

[...] With <b>no</b> <b>new</b> auctions, <b>activity</b> on the site slowed to a crawl and then died. In June 2010 Bidtopia announced plans to restructure the site once again as a private marketplace, but some time thereafter the site was made inaccessible to visitors, and it has not reappeared since.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of yeast strain collections expressing individually tagged proteins to facilitate one-step purification provides a powerful approach to identify proteins with particular biochemical activities. To identify novel exo- and endo-nucleases that might function in DNA repair, we undertook a proteomic screen {{making use of}} the movable ORF (MORF) library of yeast expression plasmids. This library consists of 5, 854 yeast strains each expressing a unique yeast ORF fused to a tripartite tag consisting of His 6, an HA epitope, a protease 3 C cleavage site, and the IgG-binding domain (ZZ) from protein A, {{under the control of}} the GAL 1 promoter for inducible expression. Pools of proteins were partially purified on IgG sepharose and tested for nuclease activity using three different radiolabeled DNA substrates. Several known nucleases and phosphatases were identified, as well as two new members of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, which includes phosphoglycerate mutases and phosphatases. Subsequent characterization revealed YDR 051 c/Det 1 to be an acid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity, whereas YOR 283 w has a broad pH range and hydrolyzes hydrophilic phosphorylated substrates. Although <b>no</b> <b>new</b> nuclease <b>activities</b> were identified from this screen, we did find phosphatase activity associated with a protein of unknown function, YOR 283 w, and with the recently characterized protein Det 1. This knowledge should guide further genetic and biochemical characterization of these proteins...|$|R
40|$|Student, EEB 4839, 2009 In {{this study}} we {{examined}} and quantified the effects plains pocket gophers had on vegetation.

We predicted the correct outcome as there was an average diversity of 3. 183 plants on our control plots and more than double that with 6. 700 plants on abandoned gopher mounds. This diversity is mainly due to the natural succession of plants with the pocket gophers being a natural disturbance and allowing early succession plants to grow...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} has highlighted {{the importance of}} <b>new</b> <b>activities</b> in development and growth. It was shown that trade distortions such as tariffs are associated with first-order costs stemming from the induced drop {{in the formation of}} <b>new</b> <b>activities.</b> This paper demonstrates that uncertainty may induce similar costs. This argument is illustrated in the context of Romer's model of a dependent economy, where foreign direct investment is needed to enable the importation of capital goods and intermediate products used in domestic production. The present paper shows that uncertainty acts as an implicit tax on <b>new</b> <b>activities,</b> whose incidence is (in a certain sense) worse than that of a tariff in Romer's framework. As with a tariff, uncertainty inhibits the formation of <b>new</b> <b>activities.</b> Unlike the tariff, however, uncertainty does not benefit the government with revenue. The welfare cost of uncertainty applies also for a closed economy. The paper shows that uncertainty-averse entrepreneurs discount using a 'hurdle rate' that exceeds the risk-free interest rate. The gap between the two rates increases with the uncertainty embodied in the investment, being determined by the vagueness of the information and by the range of possible outcomes. Hence, growth may be inhibited by business uncertainty, where the 'rules of the game' for <b>new</b> <b>activities</b> are vague. ...|$|R
