5|$|The Long Range Strike Bomber {{program is}} {{intended}} to yield a stealthy successor for the B-52 and B-1 that would begin service in the 2020s; it {{is intended to}} produce 80 to 100 aircraft. Two competitors, <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> and a joint team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, submitted proposals in 2014; <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> was awarded a contract in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> E-10 MC2A {{was to be}} a 767-400ER-based {{replacement}} for the USAF's 707-based E-3 Sentry AWACS, <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> E-8 Joint STARS, and RC-135 SIGINT aircraft. The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful active electronically scanned array (AESA) that was also capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.|$|E
5|$|<b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> Shipyard in Newport News {{constructed}} a full-scale non-seaworthy static replica of Monitor. The replica was {{laid down in}} February 2005 and completed just two months later {{on the grounds of}} the Mariners' Museum. The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary conducts occasional dives on the wreck to monitor and record any changes in its condition and its environment.|$|E
5|$|Soriano {{served with}} {{infantry}} units throughout the United States, Korea, and in Germany. Later Soriano was a liaison officer during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and deployed during Operation Joint Endeavor; {{he retired in}} March 2005. Since retiring from the Army, Soriano {{has worked for the}} aerospace and defense technology company <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> and has sat on various boards of directors.|$|E
5|$|YF-23A PAV-2, AF ser. no. 87-0801, {{registration}} number N232YF, was on {{exhibit at the}} Western Museum of Flight until 2004, when it was reclaimed by <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> and used as a display model for a YF-23-based bomber. PAV-2 was returned to the Western Museum of Flight and was on display as of 2010 at the museum's new location at Zamperini Field, Torrance, California.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> {{proposed}} a YF-23-based bomber {{to meet a}} USAF need for an interim bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing. Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 {{to serve as a}} display model for its proposed interim bomber. The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber program.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron is {{responsible}} for aerial refuelling and long-range transport. It is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No.86 Wing, {{which is part of}} Air Mobility Group. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular aircraft service. Heavier maintenance is conducted by <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> Integrated Defence Services (formerly Qantas Defence Services).|$|E
5|$|Other funded {{improvements}} to the A-10 fleet include a new data link, the ability to employ smart weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, {{and the ability to}} carry an integrated targeting pod such as the <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> LITENING or the Lockheed Martin Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). Also included is the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) to provide sensor data to personnel on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The F-16E/F is {{outfitted}} with Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-80 {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar. <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> developed the latest AESA radar upgrade for the F-16 (selected for USAF and Taiwan Air Force F-16 upgrades), named the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). In July 2007, Raytheon {{announced that it}} was developing a Next Generation Radar (RANGR) based on its earlier AN/APG-79 AESA radar as a competitor to Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-68 and AN/APG-80 for the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The Space Interferometry Mission, or SIM, {{also known}} as SIM Lite (formerly known as SIM PlanetQuest), was a planned space {{telescope}} proposed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in conjunction with contractor <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman.</b> One of the main goals of the mission was the hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars other than the Sun. SIM was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The A330-300, {{the first}} variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered {{passenger}} service with Air Inter in January 1994. Airbus {{followed up with}} the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently-developed A330 variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, a military tanker, the A330 MRTT, and a corporate jet, ACJ330. The A330 MRTT {{formed the basis of}} the proposed KC-45, entered into the US Air Force's KC-X competition in conjunction with <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman,</b> where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker.|$|E
5|$|The EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 was a {{proposed}} {{version of the}} A330 MRTT for the United States Air Force (USAF)'s KC-X aerial refuelling programme. In February 2008, the USAF selected the aircraft to replace the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The replacement process was mired in controversy, instances of corruption, and allegations of favouritism. In July 2010, EADS submitted a tanker bid to the USAF without <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> as a partner. However, on 24 February 2011, the USAF picked the Boeing KC-767 proposal, later named KC-46, as the winner because of its lower cost.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} with no buyers, in late 1986 Northrop {{canceled}} the $1.2billion project. Northrop {{was reluctant to}} protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the project for the <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of new AN/APG-73 radars was announced on 17 August 1998. The Commonwealth accepted a United States Foreign Military Sales case in October 1999, {{and then the}} prototype modification commenced on 21 August 2001. The first production modified aircraft was completed in August 2002 and the last aircraft was completed on 27 August 2003. Phase 2.2, the Multi-purpose Display Group Upgrade (MDGU) and the remaining equipment will be installed in the 2006/2007 time frame. Phase 2.3, various systems, from BAE Systems, SAAB, and Elta has not been announced. Phase 2.4, commercial contract with <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> for the Litening AT targeting pod, will receive the targeting pods during 2007/2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
5|$|The first USAF E-3 was {{delivered}} in March 1977, {{and during the}} next seven years, a total of 34 aircraft were manufactured. NATO, as a single identity, also had 18 aircraft manufactured, basing them in Germany. The E-3 was also sold to the United Kingdom (seven) and France (four) and Saudi Arabia (five, plus eight E-3-derived tanker aircraft). In 1991, when the last aircraft had been delivered, E-3s participated in Operation Desert Storm, playing a crucial role of directing coalition aircraft against the enemy. Throughout the aircraft's service life, numerous upgrades were performed to enhance its capabilities. In 1996, Westinghouse Electric's Defense & Electronic Systems division, was acquired by Northrop Corporation before its being renamed <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> Electronic Systems, which currently supports the E-3's radar.|$|E
5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.|$|E
5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E

25|$|On 7 November 2001, <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> {{entered an}} {{agreement}} to purchase Newport News Shipbuilding {{for a total of}} $2.6 billion. This acquisition created a $4 billion shipyard called <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> Newport News.|$|E
25|$|However, in 2015, it was {{reported}} that <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> was no longer submitting the Hawk for T-X consideration, primarily due to airframe performance shortcomings with maneuvers such as high angle-of-attack and sustained accelerations, as well as concerns regarding affordability. Instead, <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> had secretly begun a new clean-sheet design to closely match the evolving T-X requirements. Scaled Composites, a subsidiary of <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman,</b> was to construct the prototype, with a first flight expected in late 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Switchblade was a {{proposed}} {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} developed by <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> for the United States.

25|$|The plan is {{that the}} F-35 will be {{produced}} under license in Turkey by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). TAI {{is one of the}} two international suppliers to <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> (the other being Terma in Denmark). A Letter of Intent (LOI) was signed between TAI and <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> ISS (NGISS) International on 6 February 2007. With the LOI, TAI became the second source for the F-35 center fuselage. The number of center fuselages to be produced by TAI will depend on the number of F-35s Turkey procures and the number of F-35s produced worldwide. On 10 December 2007, TAI was authorized by <b>Northrop</b> <b>Grumman</b> to commence fabricating access doors and composite parts for the first two F-35 production aircraft.
