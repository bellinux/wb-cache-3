In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E

25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the negatives of the practice, the {{presence}} of NASCAR's top-level drivers attracts sponsorship to the lower series that may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> without them, adds credibility to the series, and {{makes it easier for}} tracks to promote races. Many series regulars have also pointed out that the presence of Cup regulars allows them to improve their own driving styles and compete against the best in the sport. The series does still serve its purpose for driver development, with a steady influx of successful new drivers into the Sprint Cup Series: e.g., in 2007 three of the Top 10 drivers had less than four years of Cup experience, eight of the ten had less than 10 years of Cup experience, and only one (Jeff Burton) was over 40 years of age. All eight drivers of the 2014 Sprint Cup Rookie class (Kyle Larson, Austin Dillon, Justin Allgaier, Cole Whitt, Alex Bowman, Michael Annett, Ryan Truex, Parker Kligerman) had significant experience in the Nationwide Series, with six of them running at least one full season. The series also continues to provide an outlet for former Cup drivers (such as Elliott Sadler, Regan Smith, and Sam Hornish, Jr.) to rebuild their careers, as does the Truck Series for drivers such as Ron Hornaday, Jr. and Johnny Sauter.|$|E
500|$|Back in Auburn, Seward {{began his}} memoirs, but only reached his thirties before putting it aside to write of his travels. [...] In these months he was {{steadily}} growing weaker. On October 10, 1872, {{he worked at}} his desk in the morning as usual, then complained of trouble breathing. [...] Seward grew worse during the day, as his family gathered around him. [...] Asked {{if he had any}} final words, he said, [...] "Love one another." [...] Seward died that afternoon. His funeral a few days later was preceded by the people of Auburn and nearby filing past his open casket for four hours. Thurlow Weed was there for the burial of his friend, and Harriet Tubman, a former slave whom the Sewards had aided, sent flowers. President Grant sent his regrets he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{setting in}} the manga {{was based on a}} shrine in the Kumamoto Prefecture of Japan, known as Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine, which is {{dedicated}} to Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto from Japanese mythology. [...] The animation crew spent two hours searching the location for settings on which they could base their art. [...] Because the story was set in the forest of a mountain god, Omori intended the art to represent a [...] "different world" [...] where the background scenery was obscure and the blue sky was slightly brighter than normal. [...] Omori and his crew devoted extra attention to lighting and coloring, making the forest dim with light coming through the canopy and landing on the characters with the appropriate intensity. [...] The contrast between light and dark was also used during the festival scene to emphasize its bizarre nature, reminding the audience that Hotaru should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> [...] Because of the significance of the summer season to the story, Omori deliberately loaded the film with summer scenes, such as rustling leaves and chirring of cicadas.|$|E

SpongeBob heads to the Krusty Krab but ends up creating a mishap that results in getting two dollars fried and reduced to bits, with a furious Mr. Krabs kicking him out of the restaurant and like the others did, Mr. Krabs furiously calls SpongeBob [...] "Idiot Boy". SpongeBob decides to leave Bikini Bottom and tells Gary that he has a year's supply of snail food to eat since SpongeBob will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to feed him. After leaving Bikini Bottom, he is frightened by bizarre people and as he runs in fear, SpongeBob falls off a cliff and bumps his head, knocking himself unconscious. Back in Bikini Bottom, Patrick and Sandy enter SpongeBob's house and Sandy finds that Gary's food bowl has a note from SpongeBob, saying he has left so that he will not bother anyone ever again.

500|$|Both Editor and Publisher and Salon, which {{published}} {{extensive and}} early {{coverage of the}} Colbert speech, drew record and near-record numbers of viewers to their web sites. 70,000 articles were posted to blogs about Colbert's roast of Bush on the Thursday after the event, {{the most of any}} topic, and [...] "Colbert" [...] remained the top search term at Technorati for days. Chicago Sun-Times TV critic Doug Elfman credited the Internet with promoting an event that would have otherwise been overlooked, stating that [...] "Internet stables for liberals, like the behemoth dailykos.com, began rumbling as soon as the correspondents' dinner was reported in the mainstream press, with scant word of Colbert's combustive address". Three weeks after the dinner, audio of Colbert's performance went on sale at the iTunes Music Store and became the No. 1 album purchased, outselling new releases by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and Paul Simon. The CEO of Audible.com, which provided the recording sold at iTunes, explained its success by saying, [...] "you had to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to get it". It continued to be a top download at iTunes for the next five months.|$|E
500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E

[...] One of Rajinikanth's climactic dialogues in the film [...] "En Vazhi Thani Vazhi" [...] was used as the title of a 2015 film directed by Shaji Kailas. It was also used as the title of a 2010 book on branding by Sridhar Ramanujam. Scenes from the film were parodied in various other films, notable of which are Thirupathi Ezhumalai Venkatesa (1999), En Purushan Kuzhandhai Maadhiri (2001), Annai Kaligambal (2003), Sivaji (2007). Vel (2007), Siva Manasula Sakthi (2009), Malai Malai (2009), Vanakkam Chennai (2013), and All in All Azhagu Raja (2013). Padayappa was also parodied in the Star Vijay comedy series Lollu Sabha, in an episode appropriately named Vadayappa.|$|E
500|$|Hart {{and nine}} others were {{teachers}} at Malvern College, where from 1983 to 1986 they {{took advantage of}} a [...] "concessionary fee" [...] scheme, which allowed their children to be educated at rates one fifth of those paid by other pupils. They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 Finance Act, Section 63 of which said that: [...] The Inland Revenue, attempting to tax this benefit, argued that the [...] "cost" [...] of the benefit meant an average {{of the cost of}} providing it; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £1,000,000 a year to run, the [...] "cost" [...] per pupil was £10,000. Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead marginal cost, saying that other than food, stationery, laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children's presence that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> already. The Special Commissioners (an appellate body for income tax claims), ruling in favour of Hart, noted that not only was the school not full to capacity, with the teachers' children having no impact on waiting lists, but that the [...] "concessionary fee" [...] covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating those particular pupils.
