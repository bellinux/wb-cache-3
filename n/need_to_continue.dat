5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took place within the party. The role of the Central Committee in decision-making was strengthened, {{and the role of the}} Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened. Inner-party accountability was strengthened. The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E

The congress mainly stated the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the quest for socialism in Portugal and the need to defend the achievements of the revolution against what the party considered to be a political step backward, led by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the right-wing Centro Democrático Social, who opposed the agrarian reform process.|$|E

However, when, in 380 BCE, Evagoras himself came to Egypt to beg other aid, Hakor saw no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> supporting him and sent him back to Cyprus with merely some more money. Evagoras surrendered to Artaxerxes soon after, but Hakor promptly joined a short-lived alliance with Sparta and Glos, son of the Egyptian admiral Tamos, himself {{a supporter of the}} pretender Cyrus the Younger against Artaxerxes II. Hakor managed to get the Athenian general Chabrias into his service, but the Persian general Pharnabazus II lobbied on Athens in order to repatriate him.|$|E
25|$|Garson Romalis (October 23, 1937 – January 31, 2014) was a Canadian {{gynecologist}} {{who specialized}} in providing abortions. (See Abortion in Canada.) He was twice wounded in attempts on his life. The first attempt on his life {{was by far the}} most violent antiabortion crime in Canada, according to the National Post. The second attempt was made by an unknown assailant who stabbed him and fled. Since being personally attacked, Romalis became more outspoken and more determined to provide abortions to women who want them. As such, he was a notable public figure in the Canadian abortion debate. The University of Toronto Law School invited him to speak at their Symposium to mark the 20th Anniversary of R. vs. Morgentaler. He worked to convince medical students of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> providing abortions.|$|E
25|$|He {{introduced}} {{ideas that}} indirectly challenged the discriminatory taxes imposed by Islamic authorities. For example, Aurangzeb had imposed taxes on non-Muslims that {{were collected from}} the Sikhs as well, for example the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims), pilgrim tax and Bhaddar tax – the last being a {{tax to be paid}} by anyone following the Hindu ritual of shaving the head after the death of a loved one and cremation. Guru Gobind Singh declared that Khalsa do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> this practice, because Bhaddar is not dharam, but a bharam (illusion). Not shaving the head also meant not having to pay the taxes by Sikhs who lived in Delhi {{and other parts of the}} Mughal Empire. However, the new code of conduct also led to internal disagreements between Sikhs in the 18th century, particularly between the Nanakpanthi and the Khalsa.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Deng Xiaoping's {{policies}} continued {{beyond the}} initial reforms. Controls on private businesses and government intervention continued to decrease, {{and there was}} small-scale privatization of state enterprises which had become unviable. A notable development was the decentralization of state control, leaving local provincial leaders to experiment with ways to increase economic growth and privatize the state sector. Township and village enterprises, firms nominally owned by local governments but effectively private, began to gain market share {{at the expense of}} the state sector. Conservative elder opposition, led by Chen Yun, prevented many major reforms which would have damaged the interests of special interest groups in the government bureaucracy. Corruption and increased inflation increased discontent, contributing to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and a conservative backlash after that event which ousted several key reformers and threatened to reverse many of Deng's reforms. However, Deng stood by his reforms and in 1992, he affirmed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> reforms in his southern tour. He also reopened the Shanghai Stock Exchange closed by Mao 40 years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Nomad {{is ordered}} to repair {{one of the}} carrier's damaged nuclear reactors. The Nanosuit is {{resistant}} {{to high levels of}} radiation, although prolonged exposure proves deadly. While Nomad is in the reactor room, Helena sends an experimental signal through Nomad's suit that causes several alien machines to absorb too much power and overload, destroying them. As Nomad returns to the flight deck, Admiral Morrison is killed and Nomad takes the prototype TAC-Cannon. On the flight deck, Nomad fights an alien exosuit similar to the one that killed Strickland. A massive alien warship then emerges from the sea, and Helena manages to deactivate its shields by sending a signal through Nomad's Nanosuit. Nomad then uses the TAC-Cannon to destroy the alien warship, which crashes down onto the carrier and begins to sink it. Nomad runs across the flight deck and jumps off the carrier into the waiting VTOL, which is piloted by Psycho. As they fly away, Helena is nearly pulled out of the aircraft by the energy field created by the destroyed alien warship. The ship drags the Constitution beneath the surface and vaporizes, creating a massive vortex that engulfs and destroys the entire carrier fleet. Psycho then receives a transmission that there is another carrier strike group en route to the island and suggests meeting them. Nomad protests, claiming that since they now know how to defeat the aliens, they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> fighting. A transmission from Prophet, who is inside the energy field on the island, is then received. The VTOL is then seen turning around and heading back to the island.|$|E
