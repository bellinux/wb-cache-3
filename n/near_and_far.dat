5|$|The first {{infrared}} {{observations were}} published in 1998, in which both <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> infrared spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by {{a sharp decline in}} 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|On the Silk Road caravans with Chinese silk; pepper, ginger, cinnamon, {{and nutmeg}} {{came to the}} West from the Spice Islands via the transcontinental trade routes. Eastern diets were {{introduced}} to Europeans as well. Indian muslins, cottons, pearls, and precious stones were sold in Europe, as well as weapons, carpets, and leather goods from Iran. Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that {{was involved in the}} trade system. Μany of the cities participating in the 13th century world trade system grew rapidly in size.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

25|$|When the POF is rotated, the <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> {{limits of}} DOF {{are no longer}} parallel; the DOF becomes wedge-shaped, with {{the apex of the}} wedge nearest the camera (Merklinger 1993, 31–32; Tillmanns 1997, 71).

25|$|The focus spread {{is related}} to the depth of focus. Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter. The first is the tolerance of the position of the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; the second is that the limits of depth of focus are the image-side conjugates of the <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth of focus are usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth of focus are the same.|$|E
25|$|During the night, the Brumby herd gallops {{close to}} the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them.

25|$|If {{the marks}} for the <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> {{distances}} fall outside the marks {{for the largest}} f-number on the DOF scale, the desired DOF cannot be obtained; for example, with the 35mm lens above, {{it is not possible}} to have the DOF extend from 0.7m to infinity. The DOF limits can be determined visually, by focusing on the farthest object to be within the DOF and noting the distance mark on the lens distance scale, and repeating the process for the nearest object to be within the DOF.|$|E

25|$|Megacities, {{cities with}} {{population}} in the multi-millions, have proliferated into the dozens, arising especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

25|$|At the {{undergraduate}} level, there are separate student governments {{on the two}} campuses. Although the two student governments are separate, they work closely in coordinating joint events. The men's schools are represented overall by the Yeshiva Student Union, and specifically by the Yeshiva College Student Association, the Syms Student Council, the Student Organization of Yeshiva (SOY, which represents both undergraduate MYP {{students as well as}} RIETS students), and student councils for SBMP, IBC, and JSS. The latter four run most Jewish-related activities on campus, including holiday celebrations and the famed SOY Seforim (Jewish book) Sale annually around February, which is open to the general public and attracts large crowds from <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far.</b> There are also individual councils for each class, council committees, a Student Court, and clubs.|$|E
25|$|Traditional depth-of-field {{formulas}} {{and tables}} assume equal circles of confusion for <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> objects. Some authors, such as Merklinger (1992), {{have suggested that}} distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, {{do not need to}} be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a traffic bollard in the foreground, this approach, termed the object field method by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.|$|E
25|$|Central and {{peripheral}} are {{terms that}} {{are closely related to}} concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>far,</b> inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between central- and peripheral nervous systems, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid residues are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include Central and peripheral circadian clocks, and central versus peripheral vision.|$|E
