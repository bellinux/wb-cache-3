Clear knot-free lumber has a higher value. Pruning has been extensively carried out in the Radiata pine plantations of New Zealand and Chile, however the development of Finger joint technology in the production of lumber and mouldings has led to many forestry companies reconsidering their pruning practices. [...] "Brashing" [...] is an alternative name for the same process.Pruning can be done to all trees, or more cost effectively to a limited number of trees. There are two types of pruning: natural or self-pruning and artificial pruning. Most cases of self-pruning happen when branches do not receive enough sunlight and die. Wind can also take part in <b>natural</b> <b>pruning</b> which can break branches. Artificial pruning is where people are paid to come and cut the branches.

All treatments were replicated three times. Stump heights averaged 10, 90 or 230 cm, respectively. Pre-treatment stem number (live trees) varied from 17, 500 to 41, 000 per ha.

Following two growth seasons, the quantity of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the rate of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the diameter growth of potential crop trees increased with decreasing stump height, the increase in stand height did not depend on stump height or post-treatment stem number, and the <b>natural</b> <b>pruning</b> of potential crop trees increased with increasing stump height.

Dissertation advisor: Gavin C. Conant. Vita. The sheer complexity of evolutionary systems biology requires us to develop more sophisticated tools for analysis, {{as well as more}} probing and biologically relevant representations of the data. My research has focused on three aspects of evolutionary systems biology. I ask whether a gene's position in the human metabolic network affects the degree to which <b>natural</b> selection <b>prunes</b> variation in that gene. I estimated the selective constraint (the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions) on 80. 2 % of the genes in the metabolic network using a maximum likelihood model of codon evolution and compared this value to the betweenness centrality of each enzyme. Second, I have focused on the evolution of metabolic systems in the presence of gene and genome duplication. I show that increases in a particular gene's copy number are correlated with limiting metabolic flux in the reaction associated with that gene. Finally, I have investigated the proliferative cell programs present in 6 different cancers (breast, colorectal, gastrointestinal, lung, oral squamous and prostate cancers). I found an overabundance of genes that share expression between cancer and embryonic tissue and that these genes form modular units within regulatory, proteininteraction, and metabolic networks. This despite the fact that these genes, as well as the proteins they encode and reactions they catalyze show little overlap among cancers, suggesting parallel independent reversion to an embryonic pattern of gene expression.

30|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} here, MALDI biotyping alone {{was able to}} directly identify M. fructicola, M. laxa and M. fructigena/M. polystroma infections on apples, cherries and prunes, without a prior cultivation in vitro. The same approach also used to identify Monilinia brown rot from naturally infected apricots and prunes collected in Switzerland. As for the experimentally infected apples, cherries and prunes, Monilinia species were correctly identified (as confirmed by PCR) solely with material obtained from fruit (e.g. without prior cultivation) (data not shown). This indicates that the MALDI-based identification of natural Monilinia brown rot infections is possible {{as long as a}} particular lesion is caused by one fungal species. However, <b>natural</b> apricot and <b>prune</b> infections were almost exclusively due to M. laxa and M. polystroma, respectively, which prevented assessing the MALDI-based distinction between the four Monilinia brown rot species. Therefore, we only collected and show quantitative data obtained from experimentally infected fruits. The results obtained by these studies are in contrast to earlier reports, where a combination of MALDI-TOF MS and electrophoresis methods was suggested for the identification of Monilinia species on fruit samples, because the MALDI-TOF results were affected by the host [22]. It cannot be excluded that other hosts than apple, cherry or prune would affect the MALDI biotyping results and prevent a correct identification. However, the three hosts used in this study include different fruit types that minimally affected the performance of the MALDI biotyping. We thus expect that a correct MALDI biotyping with host-derived material is possible as long as the pathogen forms aerial mycelium and conidia on the host surface. We can only speculate on the factors that allowed the reliable identification of Monilinia brown rot fungi on host tissue by MALDI biotyping in this study. First of all, several isolates (18 altogether) were used to generate the MSP; the reference spectra for species identification. Importantly, the extraction procedure was identically performed for the processing of the samples used for the generation of MSP, for the fungal material cultivated in vitro, {{as well as for the}} fungal material from infected hosts. The extraction protocol itself has also been optimized by reducing the amount of fungal material that was extracted, the extraction of conidia and mycelium, and the addition of glass beads during the formic acid/acetonitrile extraction step. Finally, the parameters for the actual MALDI-TOF MS measurement, data processing and data analysis were adjusted (laser intensity, peak exclusion criterion, number of shots per spot, intensity correction for identification). In combination, this optimization led to a time-saving procedure and the reliable identification of M. fructicola, M. laxa and M. fructigena/M. polystroma. The fact that M. fructigena and M. polystroma could not be distinguished by the workflow described in this study underlines the close relatedness of these two species, which are set apart only by five base transitions in their ITS region [6]. It is thus laborious to distinguish these two species, even by molecular methods [7, 39]. The low intensity of most signals for M. polystroma, as well as the intense peak with a mass of 4377  Da that was shared with M. fructigena (4378  Da), may explain the difficulty in separating these two species by MALDI biotyping (Fig.  1 a).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a successive-cancellation list decoder for polar codes, {{which is a}} generalization of the classic successive-cancellation decoder of Arıkan. In the proposed list decoder, up to L decoding paths are considered concurrently at each decoding stage. Simulation {{results show that the}} resulting performance is very close to that of a maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of L. Thus it appears that the proposed list decoder bridges the gap between successive-cancellation and maximum-likelihood decoding of polar codes. The specific list-decoding algorithm that achieves this perfor-mance doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step, and then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the L “best ” paths. In order to implement this algorithm, we introduce a <b>natural</b> <b>pruning</b> criterion that can be easily evaluated. Never-theless, straightforward implementation still requires O(L · n 2) time, which is in stark contrast with the O(n logn) complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder.

For the purpose of clear-wood production, knot attributes and branch occlusion of Betula alnoides under <b>natural</b> <b>pruning</b> were investigated in a 14 -year-old experimental plantation with five planting densities ranging from 500 to 3333 stems per hectare in southern China, and a total of 1325 occluded branches from 30 trees were sampled and dissected. The mean occluded branch diameter (OBD), radius of knots and branch insertion angle (IA) decreased significantly with increasing planting density. Planting with high stocking density significantly reduced the frequency of thick occluded branches (diameter ≥ 20 mm) while increasing the frequency of small ones (diameter < 10 mm). Branch occlusion time (OT) also tended to increase with decreasing planting density. The results of generalized linear mixed models showed that OBD was the major factor influencing OT, radius of dead portion of knot (RDP), total radius of knot (TRK) and IA. In addition, OT was positively correlated with RDP but negatively correlated with stem diameter growth rate during branch occlusion (SDGR).

30|$|In {{studies of}} sugi cultivars, we {{reported}} that crown length {{had a significant}} positive effect on IAA amounts in cambial-region tissues, and that distance from crown base had {{a negative effect on}} IAA amounts in cambial-region tissues [31]. The effect of distance from crown was larger than that of crown length. As plantation trees grow taller, crown base move up to higher position by <b>natural</b> <b>pruning.</b> Therefore, it is assumed that as trees grow taller, the amounts of IAA in the trunk become smaller, because IAA is synthesized at and transported from the crown. In our previous study on juvenile and mature sugi trees, we reported that put together all samples (juvenile and mature sugi trees), MFA increased with IAA amounts in samples with IAA < 200  ng/cm 2 [32]. The samples at lower trunk in juvenile trees had significantly larger IAA amounts, larger MFA, and larger latewood width than the samples in mature trees (p <  0.01). From these results, we hypothesized that as trees grew taller, IAA amounts in the cambial-region tissues decreased, and that as IAA in these tissues decreased, MFA became smaller. If the hypothesis in sugi trees holds true for hinoki trees, taller tree height might have induce smaller amounts of IAA in cambial-region tissues in the ring-formed year, resulting in smaller MFA.|$|E

Shoots were up to 160 % and 125 % longer after natural (elephant) and simulated pruning and leaves ~ 25 % longer in regrowth after <b>natural</b> <b>pruning</b> (n = 13 – 15 trees per treatment).

40|$|Wild {{service tree}} {{receives}} much attention in German silviculture, but is rarely planted. Four examples illustrate {{some of the}} challenges with wild service tree. Example 1 - A mixed plantation problem In 1979 wild service tree was planted in a mixed forest experiment near Lutter in Lower Saxony. The stand was established as single-tree mix of wild service tree (every other tree in the row), beech, cherry, sycamore, field maple and small-leaved lime. The spacing was 1. 5 m x 0. 9 m. We visited the experiment in 2011. The stand was clearly under-thinned and wild service tree generally had straight stems and fewer forks than in an adjacent provenance experiment (Skoven 2013 / 5). In accordance with observations of mixed forest experiments with wild service tree in Denmark (Skoven 2013 / 2, 3 and 4) {{there appears to be}} a need for early interventions in planted stands that include wild service tree (Figure 1, showing a wild service tree in need of crown release). Example 2 - A near-natural mixture In 2004 a mixed stand of wild service tree, hornbeam and field maple was planted near Sailershausen in northern Bavaria. The stand was established as a row-wise mix of wild service tree and hornbeam with groups of field maple (Figure 2). The management objective is to produce high-quality timber of wild service tree, while hornbeam and field maple are 'serving' species. Due to the strong focus on wild service tree at Sailershausen this objective can undoubtedly be fulfilled. However, we generally recommend including oak (the usual main companion species for this type of mixture) as an insurance against unforeseen problems. On wind-exposed sites we furthermore recommend including a slow-growing conifer such as cypress to provide lee (for improved growth) and shade (against epicormic branches on the oak). Example 3 - Sailershausen: optimal site and silviculture for wild service tree Sailershausen Forest Estate (2, 200 ha) is owned by the University of Würzburg. Oak is a main species, but wild service tree also contributes substantially to the economic revenue. Wild service tree is found mainly on calcareous sites. It is being regenerated through natural seed fall as well as from root suckers. It is now also being planted in reforestations to increase its share of the forest area (Figure 3). The estate maintains a standing stock of more than 1, 500 wild service trees with a dbh of over 30 cm. These are clearly marked and numbered to avoid mistakes during forest operations and to allow for regular inventory updates and improved growth and harvesting prognoses (Figure 4, dbh = 46, 5 cm, height = 32 m). High-quality timber of wild service tree is auctioned and sells at an average of 600 €/m 3, with top prices going up to 14, 500 €/m 3. Example 4 - QD silviculture The state forests of Rhineland-Palatinate are managed according to so-called QD silviculture. Q stands for qualifying and D stands for dimensioning. First, trees qualify for quality through <b>natural</b> <b>pruning.</b> Next, pre-selected trees are thinned for selectively to allow for maximum diameter growth. Thinnings are usually initiated when <b>natural</b> <b>pruning</b> has reached 25 percent of the expected final height. The number of pre-selected crop trees may be as low as 40 - 50 per ha (Figure 5, showing a wild service tree (T) and a cherry (K) at too close range). When looking up in the canopy, the crown of a crop tree should be surrounded by an unbroken ring of blue sky. The idea is that this will ensure optimal crown development, thereby utilizing the full growth potential of the best trees. The QD concept is considered very suitable for wild service tree...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Front {{the study}} of sample plots {{situated}} in the north-east, theeast ant the center of France; the following provisory conclusionscan be drawn. 1 ° The Douglas is a fast growing species which can reach a highproductivity, greater {{than the one that}} can be expected from ourindigenous conifers: the annual increment being as much as 30 or 40 cubic meters — total volume — per hectare and per year. 2 ° This high productivity can only be expected in favourable ecologicalconditions. 3 ° From the climatic stand point, the Douglas proves to be anaccomodating tree susceptible of thriving and giving large yieldsunder a wide range of climates, and even in the mountains underalready rather severe conditions. In this respect the question of thewater requirements of the plant is capital. 4 ° Like all the species growing vigorously and quickly, the Douglas is particularly sensible to the edaphic conditions. It prefers arich, deep, porous and cool soil which induces an unusual growthand high yields. 5 ° Its rather shallow rooting; exposes it to wind-storms, chieflyif the ground on which it grows is not deep (rocky bed or layer ofGley forcing it to develop a shallow root system) and if the soilis temporarily softened by rain. 6 ° The Douglas must not be planted too closely — 3 000 plantsper hectare seems quite sufficient. A greater number is not onlyexpensive but detrimental. 7 ° Being a fast-growing species the Douglas requises a sufficientgrowing space. It fears the competition of its associates and in itsyoung, age, that of the other species. It is particularly sensible to repeated thinnings. Too rare or toomoderate thinnings are immediately followed by a considerable. decreasein the yield. 8 ° It would not be reasonable to maintain a dense stand with aview to favour <b>natural</b> <b>pruning.</b> In any way, the Douglas does notprune well naturally. On the contrary a careful artificial pruning is advised. It is profitable,for it corresponds to an important increase in the qualityof the products. 9 ° The question of productivity being put apart a great densityof the forest does not favour the elongation of the stems. The heightof the mean tree seems to be independent of this density-. Inversely, a moderately 'dense stand brings about an increase ofthe girth and consequently, interesting marketable products may beobtained earlier. 10 ° The question of the races plays centainly a part in the possibilitiesof introducing the species under varied conditions, but perhapsalso from the stand point of mere productivity. 11 ° The use of « slow » volume tables established by L. SCHAEFFER,seems more suitable, for the determination of the volume ofstanding trees, than that of the ALGAN tables. 12 ° If the Douglas is to be introduced in mixture with otherconiferous species growing less quickly (particularly with indigenousconifers), it must be considered than the Douglas outgrowsits competitors rapidly and completely. A mixture in alternate rowsor alternatively in each row is not at all recommended. The secondaryspecies will disappear 'rapidly without any profitable productand its only use will have been to hamper the Douglas in its growth. A mixture in groups will be better or the Doug-las will be scatteredin small groups widely apart from one another (8 to to meters) {{in the middle of the}} secondary stand. 13 °' The proportion of bark in the volume of the standing treesit about 10 per cent. 14 ° The experiments undertaken have shown the importance ofthe « border effect » and the usefulness of an efficient shelter almgthe edge exposed to the wind.
