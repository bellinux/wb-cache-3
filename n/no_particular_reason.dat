25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s, transformations like HSV or HSI were used as a {{compromise}} between effectiveness for segmentation and computational complexity.

John Kender’s 1976 master’s thesis proposed the HSI model. Ohta et al. (1980) instead used a model made up of dimensions similar to those we have called I, α, and β. In recent years, such models have continued to see wide use, as their performance compares favorably with more complex models, and their computational simplicity remains compelling.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition has a point over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E

Joseph Smith vehemently denied Bennett's account, speculating that Boggs — no longer governor, but campaigning for state senate — was attacked by an election opponent. Mormon writer Monte B.

500|$|After a {{few years}} in Kievan Rus', Harald and his force of around 500 men moved on south to Constantinople (Miklagard), {{the capital of the}} Byzantine Empire, {{probably}} in 1033 or 1034, where they joined the Varangian Guard. Although the Flateyjarbók maintains that Harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret, most sources agree that Harald and his men's reputation was well known in the east at the time. While the Varangian Guard was primarily meant to function as the emperor's bodyguard, Harald was found fighting on [...] "nearly every frontier" [...] of the empire. He first saw action in campaigns against Arab pirates in the Mediterranean, and then in inland towns in Asia Minor that had supported the pirates. By this time, he had according to Snorri Sturluson become the [...] "leader over all the Varangians". By 1035, the Byzantines had pushed the Arabs out of Asia Minor, and Harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as the Euphrates, where according to his skald (poet) Þjóðólfr Arnórsson (recounted in the sagas) he participated in the capture of eighty Arab strongholds, a number which historians Sigfus Blöndal and Benedikt Benedikz see <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to question. Although not holding independent command of an army as the sagas imply, it is not unlikely that Harald and the Varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town. During the first four years of the reign of Byzantine Emperor Michael IV, Harald probably also fought in campaigns against the Pechenegs.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{experience}} and practise of contraceptive methods, reasons for contraceptive failure and knowledge about emergency contraception among young women seeking abortion. Methods: The interviewees were a group of women ranging from 16 - 20 years of age and who were coming for their first consultation for induced abortion. In the interviews the women were asked about contraception at the time of conception and whether they were using contraceptive methods consistently. They were also asked about previous experience with different contraceptive methods and advantages and disadvantages with these methods. Another important issue discussed with the women was whether or not they had been using emergency contraception in current and in previous situations and their knowledge of this method. Results: Nine of the women had been using contraception during the time of conception, eleven had not. Of those using contraception six utilized OC and three utilized the male condom. The most common reason given for unwanted pregnancy during use of OC’s was that they kept forgetting to take the pills consistently. Two of the condom-users had experienced ruptured condoms. Eight of the nine users reported using contraception regularly. Among the eleven non-users, six women were using contraception generally, utilizing the male condom. Five of the women in this group had recently stopped taking OC altogether. Stated reasons for this were experiences of side effects of the contraceptive, and “I didn’t think I would become pregnant”, others again gave <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reasons.</b> We experienced that the women had good knowledge of emergency contraception but only one woman had been using it in current situation. Reasons for not using the emergency pill were that they didn’t think they would become pregnant. Fourteen women had been using the emergency pill at an earlier occasion. Conclusion: The women in this study were using most frequently OC and condom. Even though their knowledge about contraceptive methods was rather good, there seemed to be little connection between their knowledge and actual use. Adolescent women tend to take more risks with little thoughts for possible negative outcomes. Another possibility may be that many of these women are not responsible enough to use contraceptive methods consistently. Other contraceptive alternatives could be a better solution for some of these women, for example the contraceptive ring, plaster or hormone injection or implants. Contraceptive counselling may be improved by including information about the most frequent reasons for contraceptive failure and unwanted pregnancy. Another important issue in counselling is the importance of using additional contraception if the primary contraceptive method has failed...|$|R

500|$|Richard Dawkins {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding rates of change. His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism — understood {{in the sense that}} evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called [...] "constant speedism" [...] by Dawkins — is a [...] "caricature of Darwinism" [...] and [...] "does not really exist." [...] His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of [...] "constant speedism" [...] is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms [...] "variable speedism." [...] Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: [...] "discrete variable speedism" [...] and [...] "continuously variable speedism." [...] Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as [...] "discrete variable speedists," [...] and [...] "in this respect they are genuinely radical." [...] They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. [...] "Continuously variable speedists," [...] on the other hand advance that [...] "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis." [...] Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that [...] "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it." [...] It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.|$|E
500|$|South Park animators {{spent the}} first four episodes of the show trying to perfect the {{animation}} of the characters. By [...] "Volcano" [...] – which was produced after [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] –, Parker and Stone felt the textures were improved, as well as smaller details like the lines around {{the eyes of the}} characters. While the series pilot [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] was animated with construction paper, subsequent episodes were made using computers. Nevertheless, Parker and Stone wanted the show to maintain its crude paper look; for example, they specifically asked for the night sky in this episode to look like a black piece of paper with holes cut into it for stars, just {{as it was in the}} pilot episode. Stone and Parker were especially proud of the animation of the lava, which they said took hours to perfect, although they acknowledged it ended up simply resembling orange construction paper. The lava ball shooting out of the volcano and almost killing Kenny was directly inspired by the Volcano film. Parker and Stone came up with the character of Scuzzlebutt during a random conversation with Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling. While meeting with her, they simply started drawing the character, and decided to add a celery hand and Patrick Duffy leg for <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reason.</b> Scuzzlebutt also appeared in a second episode, [...] "City on the Edge of Forever" [...] from the second season.

60|$|This {{morning was}} a {{peculiar}} occasion, and the Frate's audience, always multifarious, had represented even more completely than usual the various classes {{and political parties}} of Florence. There were men of high birth, accustomed to public charges at home and abroad, who had become newly conspicuous not only as enemies of the Medici and friends of popular government, but as thorough Piagnoni, espousing to the utmost the doctrines and practical teaching of the Frate, and frequenting San Marco as the seat of another Samuel: some of them men of authoritative and handsome presence, like Francesco Valori, and perhaps also of a hot and arrogant temper, very much gratified by an immediate divine authority for bringing about freedom in their own way; others, like Soderini, with less of the ardent Piagnone, {{and more of the}} wise politician. There were men, also of family, like Piero Capponi, simply brave undoctrinal lovers of a sober republican liberty, who preferred fighting to arguing, and had <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>reasons</b> for thinking any ideas false that kept out the Medici and made room for public spirit. At their elbows were doctors of law whose studies of Accursius and his brethren had not so entirely consumed their ardour as to prevent them from becoming enthusiastic Piagnoni: Messer Luca Corsini himself, for example, who on a memorable occasion yet to come was to raise his learned arms in street stone-throwing for the cause of religion, freedom, and the Frate. And among the dignities who carried their black lucco or furred mantle with an air of habitual authority, there was an abundant sprinkling of men with more contemplative and sensitive faces: scholars inheriting such high names as Strozzi and Acciajoli, who were already minded to take the cowl and join the community of San Marco; artists, wrought to a new and higher ambition by the teaching of Savonarola, like that young painter who had lately surpassed himself in his fresco of the divine child {{on the wall of the}} Frate's bare cell-- unconscious yet that he would one day himself wear the tonsure and the cowl, and be called Fra Bartolommeo. There was the mystic poet Girolamo Benevieni hastening, perhaps, to carry tidings of the beloved Frate's speedy coming to his friend Pico della Mirandola, who was never to see the light of another morning. There were well-born women attired with such scrupulous plainness that their more refined grace was the chief distinction between them and their less aristocratic sisters. There was a predominant proportion of the genuine popolani or middle class, belonging both to the Major and Minor Arts, conscious of purses threatened by war-taxes. And more striking and various, perhaps, than all the other classes of the Frate's disciples, there was the long stream of poorer tradesmen and artisans, whose faith and hope in his Divine message varied from the rude and undiscriminating trust in him as the friend of the poor and the enemy of the luxurious oppressive rich, to that eager tasting of all the subtleties of biblical interpretation which takes a peculiarly strong hold on the sedentary artisan, illuminating the long dim spaces beyond the board where he stitches, with a pale flame that seems to him the light of Divine science.|$|R
