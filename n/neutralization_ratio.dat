Carboxymethyl {{cellulose}} (CMC) {{made from}} bagasse pulp was treated by low-temperature plasma, then reacted grafting polymerization with acrylic acid (AA) to produce super absorbent polymer. The effects of discharge power, plasma treatment time, initiator dosage, acrylic acid dosage, vacuum degree and <b>neutralization</b> <b>ratio</b> on water absorbency and grafting reaction {{time of the}} products were studied by single factor experiments.

40|$|The {{performance}} of nitrogen vacancy (NV^-) based magnetic sensors strongly {{depends on the}} stability of nitrogen vacancy centers near the diamond surface. The sensitivity of magnetic field detection is diminished as the NV^- turns into the neutralized charge state NV^ 0. We investigate the neutralization of NV^- and calculate the ratio of NV^ 0 to total NV (NV^-+NV^ 0) caused by a hydrogen terminated diamond with a surface water layer. We find that NV^- neutralization exhibits two distinct regions: near the surface, where the NV^- is completely neutralized, and in the bulk, where the <b>neutralization</b> <b>ratio</b> is inversely proportional to depth following the electrostatic force law. In addition, small changes in concentration can lead to large differences in neutralization behavior. This phenomenon allows one to carefully control the concentration to decrease the NV^- neutralization. The presence of nitrogen dopant greatly reduces NV^- neutralization as the nitrogen ionizes in preference to NV^- neutralization at the same depth. The water layer pH also affects neutralization. If the pH is very low due to cleaning agent residue, then we see {{a change in the}} band bending and the reduction of the 2 -dimensional hole gas (DHG) region. Finally, we find that dissolved carbon dioxide resulting from direct contact with the atmosphere at room temperature hardly affects the NV^- neutralization. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{relationships between}} three bovine rotaviruses, UK, CP- 1 and PP- 1, and a porcine rotavirus were investigated; their pathogenicity for piglets was also assessed. After propagation and cloning in cell culture, the four viruses {{were used to}} produce convalescent and hyperimmune antisera in gnotobiotic animals. For the UK and PP- 1 viruses, reciprocal virus <b>neutralization</b> tests gave <b>ratios</b> of homologous to heterologous titres in the range 57 to> 2300. Taking a 20 -fold difference in titre to be the criterion of heterogeneity, these two viruses could be regarded as separate serotypes. The third bovine virus, CP- 1, was identical to PP- 1 in reciprocal neutralization tests but gave a one-way cross-reaction with UK convalescent sera, i. e. {{it appeared to be}} intermediate between the two serotypes. UK and CP- 1 differed antigenically from the porcine virus as shown by. homologous:heterologous <b>neutralization</b> titre <b>ratios</b> of 30 to 12 600. The bovine virus, PP- 1, however, had a closer relationship with the porcine virus, the homologous: heterologous ratios ranging from 4 to 110. Oral inoculation of piglets with the bovine viruses revealed differences in their pathogenicity. Isolates UK and CP- 1 caused no clinical disease and could not be passaged. However, on the first and second passages in pigs, the bovine virus PP- 1 and the porcine virus produced clinical disease, excretion of virus in the faeces and seroconversion. The results suggest that PP- 1 may be a natural hybrid between a bovine and a porcine rotavirus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sepiolite/poly (sodium acrylate-acrylamide) {{composite}} was synthesized {{by using}} inverse suspending polymerization method under different dispersant content, <b>neutralization</b> degree and <b>ratio</b> of monomer with orthogonal experiments. The surface morphology, structure and humidity controlling properties of composite were observed and determined. The {{results show that}} sepiolite/ poly (sodium acrylate-acrylamide) composite is in a fine particle with rough surface. During the polymerization process, acrylate and acrylamide monomer is grafted with hydroxyl {{on the surface of}} sepiolite and then intercalated successfully into the silica layers of sepiolite. The impact of three factors on the humidity controlling behavior of composites increases by the order of dispersant content, ratio of monomer and neutralization degree. The optimum preparation parameters are dispersant content of 10 %, neutralization degree of 85 % and ratio of monomer 2 : 1...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a {{ubiquitous}} intracellular protozoan parasite {{that causes}} adverse pregnancy outcomes. Its infection downregulates the Treg cell population and TGF-β level, which {{may contribute to}} adverse pregnancy outcomes. TGF-β plays {{a critical role in}} Treg cell development, but whether TGF-β treatment can affect the number and function of Treg cells and hence alleviate adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by T. gondii infection remains elusive. In this study, T. gondii-infected pregnant mice were treated with TGF-β or TGF-β-neutralizing antibody. The pregnancy outcomes were observed on gestational day 14. The numbers of Treg cells and pSmad 3, programmed death 1 (PD- 1), and Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4) expression of Treg cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histological changes were assessed using HE staining, while IL- 10 and TNF-α levels were measured using ELISA. The results indicated that TGF-β treatment improved the T. gondii-induced adverse pregnancy outcomes, with alleviation of hemorrhage, restoration of uterine spiral arteries of the placenta, and increased Treg cell numbers; meanwhile, TGF-β neutralization resulted in more serious adverse pregnancy outcomes, with serious hemorrhage, more dilated uterine spiral arteries, and decreased Treg cell numbers. pSmad 3 expression in CD 4 + cells and CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 levels on Treg cells were upregulated by TGF-β treatment, but downregulated by TGF-β <b>neutralization.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of IL- 10 /TNF-α also increased after TGF-β treatment, but decreased after TGF-β neutralization. Our data indicate that TGF-β treatment could improve adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by T. gondii infection by upregulating Treg cell differentiation and function via the TGF-β/Smad 3 signaling pathway, but not the proliferation of Treg cells...|$|R
40|$|Clinical trials infusing Bone Marrow Cells (BMCs) into injured hearts have {{produced}} measureable improvements in cardiac performance, but were insufficient to improve patient outcomes. Low engraftment rates are cited as probable contributor to limited improvements. To understand the mechanisms that control myocardial engraftment of BMCs following ischemia-reperfusion injury, in isolated–perfused mouse hearts, stop-flow ischemia {{was followed by}} variable-duration reperfusion (0 – 60 min) before addition of labeled syngenic BMCs to the perfusate. After a buffer-only wash, the heart was disaggregated. Retained BMCs (digest) and infused BMCs (aliquot) were compared by flow cytometry for c-kit and CD 45 expression to determine the proportion of cell subtypes engrafted versus delivered (selectivity ratio). In these studies, a time-dependent selective retention of c-kit+ cells was apparent starting at 30 min of reperfusion, at which time c-kit+/CD 45 + BMCs showed a selectivity ratio of 18 ± 2 (versus 2 ± 1 in sham-ischemic controls). To study the underlying mechanism for this selective retention, neutralizing antibodies for P-selectin or L-selectin were infused into the heart preparation and incubated with BMCs prior to BMC infusion. Blocking P-selectin in ischemic hearts ablated selectivity for c-kit+/CD 45 + BMCs at 30 min reperfusion (selectivity ratio of 3 ± 1) while selectivity persisted {{in the presence of}} L-selectin <b>neutralization</b> (selectivity <b>ratio</b> of 17 ± 2). To corroborate this finding, a parallel plate flow chamber was used to study capture and rolling dynamics of purified c-kit+ versus c-kit- BMCs on various selectin molecules. C-kit+ BMCs interacted weakly with L-selectin substrates (0. 03 ± 0. 01 % adhered) but adhered strongly to P-selectin (0. 28 ± 0. 04 % adhered). C-kit- BMCs showed intermediate binding regardless of substrate (0. 18 ± 0. 04 % adhered on L-selectin versus 0. 17 ± 0. 04 % adhered on P-selectin).

40|$|It {{has proved}} {{possible}} to elicit passive immunity to B. typhosus reacting factors {{by means of}} normal and immune homologous neutralizing antibodies. The in vivo serum protection against these factors followed the law of multiple proportions. There was observed a considerable loss of antibodies from the blood stream. Passive immunity was best obtained when the immune serum was injected intravenously ½ hour before the intravenous injection of the reacting factors. It was possible {{to prevent the occurrence}} of the local skin reaction by an intravenous injection of serum after the intravenous injection of the reacting factors, provided the serum dose was very large and provided the serum injection was made immediately after the filtrate injection. A number of experiments clearly demonstrated the interesting fact that the greater the amount of antiserum injected intravenously, the more efficient was the in vivo <b>neutralization,</b> in a <b>ratio</b> distinctly greater than the quantitative increase of serum. It is suggested {{that there may be a}} practical value of the observation in relation to serum therapy. The results also demonstrated passive serum protection against the lethal effect of B. typhosus "agar washings" filtrates, in a ratio which seemed to suggest the law of multiple proportions...|$|R
40|$|Waste rock is a {{potential}} source of low quality drainage resulting from oxidation of naturally occurring sulfide minerals. Sulfide oxidation may result in the generation of effluent with elevated concentrations of SO 4 and dissolved metals and low pH. The sulfide content of waste rock is typically much {{lower than that of}} tailings; however, the large volumes of waste rock produced during mining may create a large environmental liability. Improving the understanding of the processes affecting the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD) from waste rock will facilitate improved prediction, mitigation, and remediation strategies. Three waste-rock test piles were constructed at the Diavik Diamond Mine, Northwest Territories to investigate the potential for AMD generation in a permafrost environment. The test piles were constructed in 2006 and consisted of low sulfide (0. 035 wt. % S), high sulfide (0. 53 wt. % S), and covered test piles. The covered test pile was constructed to model the mine closure plan and consisted of a high sulfide (0. 082 wt. %) core, covered by a low-permeability layer, and a low-sulfide thermal insulation layer. In 2014, the low-sulfide Type I test pile was systematically deconstructed to investigate the geochemical, hydrogeological, and geotechnical evolution of the waste rock. Samples were collected for microbial community analysis, mineralogical characterization, pore-water extraction, ice distribution, volumetric moisture content, and particle-size distribution. The geochemical evolution of the test pile was investigated using mineral saturation index calculations, <b>neutralization</b> potential <b>ratios,</b> aqueous geochemistry, most probable number enumeration, adsorption isotherm modeling within the test pile, and mass loading calculations at the basal drain. Regions of low pH with elevated dissolved metal and SO 4 concentration developed within the test pile {{as a result of the}} heterogeneity inherent in the waste rock. Sulfide oxidation rates were depressed in regions that remained frozen for a larger part of the year. Depression of sulfide oxidation rates allowed neutralization reactions within the waste rock to maintain circumneutral pH in these regions. Saturation index calculations indicate circumneutral pH regions were conducive to precipitation of Fe (oxy) hydroxides which have a large capacity to adsorb cations. Adsorption isotherm modeling indicates that adsorption of Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni on ferrihydrite can account for the observed attenuation of these metals with increasing pH. Attenuation reactions resulted in reduced mass loading of metals and SO 4 in effluent compared to the higher sulfide waste-rock pile...|$|R

DOI: 10. 1039 /b 805157 gMass, major ionic {{components}} (MICs) of PM 2. 5, and related gaseous pollutants (SO 2, NOx, NH 3, HNO 2, and HNO 3) were monitored over six locations of different anthropogenic influence (industrial, urban, suburban, and rural) in Belgium. SO 42 -, NO 3 - NH 4 +, and Na+ were the primary ions of PM 2. 5 with averages diurnal concentrations ranging from 0. 4 - 4. 5, 0. 3 - 7. 6, 0. 9 - 4. 9, and 0. 4 - 1. 2 ???g/m 3, respectively. MICs formed 39 % of PM 2. 5 on an average, but it could reach up to 80 - 98 %. The SO 2, NO, NO 2, HNO 2, and HNO 3 levels showed high seasonal and site-specific fluctuations. The NH 3 levels were similar over all the sites (2 - 6 ???g/m 3), indicating its relation to the evenly distributed animal husbandry activities. The sulfur and nitrogen oxidation ratios for PM 2. 5 point towards a low-to-moderate formation of secondary sulfate and nitrate aerosols over five cities/towns, but their fairly intensive formation at the rural Wingene. Cluster analysis revealed the association of three groups of compounds in PM 2. 5; (i) NH 4 NO 3, KNO 3; (ii) Na 2 SO 4; and (iii) MgCl 2, CaCl 2, MgF 2, CaF 2, corresponding to anthropogenic, sea-salt, and mixed (sea-salt + anthropogenic) aerosols, respectively. The <b>neutralization</b> and cation-to-anion <b>ratios</b> indicate that MICs of PM 2. 5 appeared mostly as (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and NH 4 NO 3 salts. Sea-salt input was maximal during winter reaching up to 12 % of PM 2. 5. The overall average Cl-loss for sea-salt particles of PM 2. 5 at the six sites varied between 69 and 96 % {{with an average of}} 87 %. Principal component analysis revealed vehicular emission, coal/wood burning and animal farming as the dominating sources for the ionic components of PM 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|Four of the {{historic}} waste rock stockpiles (WRS # 1 -# 4) at the Detour Lake mine site were studied to determine the potential for generation of acid rock drainage (ARD). The stockpiles were constructed during the original mine operations (1983 - 1999) and were covered with 1 - 1. 5 m of local overburden in 2000 to provide a reclamation cover. Waste rock was composed primarily of plagioclase, horneblende, quartz and clinochlore, with small amounts of biotite. The principal sulfide minerals identified were pyrite and pyrrhotite, with small amounts of chalcopyrite and covellite. Measurements of sulfur content ranged from 0 - 2. 2 wt. %, whereas the carbon content ranged from 0 - 2. 5 wt. %. The <b>neutralization</b> potential <b>ratios</b> (NPR) of WRS# 1 and WRS# 2 ranged from 0 - 61. 1 {{with an average of}} 1. 6 and 0. 7 in profile excavation samples. Over 50 % of samples from WRS# 1 and WRS# 2 were potential acid generating (PAG). WRS# 3 and WRS# 4 were slightly less sulfidic resulting in average NPR of 43 and 10, respectively. None of the samples from WRS# 3 were PAG, and 45 % of WRS# 4 samples were PAG. The hydrology of the piles is typical of waste rock piles, with a large unsaturated zone. The water tables at WRS# 3 and WRS# 4 are approximately 16 and 22 mBGS, respectively. The waste rock is usually near residual saturation (5 vol. %), but the passage of wetting fronts commonly increased moisture content to near matrix saturation (~ 25 vol. %). The cover material retains more moisture than the waste rock, and usually 10 - 20 vol. %. Thermal profiles indicate that both stockpiles remain > 0 ˚C throughout the year, except within the cover. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature are dampened and delayed with greater depth in the stockpile, except near the edge of WRS# 4 where the cover was damaged suggesting the cover plays a role in regulating the temperature of the stockpiles. Air-permability testing of the cover material and waste rock indicates that the cover material impedes advective gas and heat flow. Waste rock at WRS# 3 and WRS# 4 had air-permeability coefficients of 10 - 9 - 10 - 10 m 2, whereas the cover material had air-permeability coefficients of approximately 10 - 11 m 2 indicating that air flow through the cover is primarily by diffusion. This observation is in agreement with pore-gas trends at WRS# 3 which show O 2 depletion and CO 2 enrichment with depth. Pore gas at WRS# 4 is at atmospheric concentrations throughout, since the destruction of the cover material has removed the barrier to advective gas flow. The results of pore-gas monitoring indicate that the installation of a simple, unengineered cover made from local material may be a cost-effective tool in the management of sulfide oxidation and potential ARD generation at this site. Pore-water quality at WRS# 3 and WRS# 4 is characterized as neutral mine drainage, and compares favourably to other neutral mine drainage sites. The pore-wate throughout WRS# 3 and WRS# 4 is neutral pH. Concentrations of SO 42 - between 200 and 1500 mg/L are caused by sulfide oxidation. Circumneutral pH and depletion of alkalinity in the unsaturated zone indicate that acidity released through sulfide oxidation is neutralized through carbonate dissolution. Pore-water at both piles was saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite. Metal concentrations (i. e. Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn) in the unsaturated zone were usually 1000 µg/L) and Mn (> 500 µg/L) below the water table at WRS# 4 indicate that these metals are released by reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides. Overall the concentration of dissolved metals in the pore-water of WRS# 3 and WRS# 4 is much lower than concentrations measured at other sites characterized by neutral mine drainage. Several genera of fungi were identified in the waste rock of WRS# 1 using 18 S rRNA analysis, including Pycnopeziza, Leptosphaeria, Tetracladium and Cucurbitaria. None of the encountered fungi were ubiquitous or have been shown to impact pore-water geochemistry through sulfide oxidation. Bacterial enumerations were performed on samples from WRS# 1 to evaluate the presence of iron and sulfur oxidizing organisms. The enumerated species are common waste rock bacteria including acidophilic sulfur oxidizers (Thiobacillus thiooxidans and related species; SOBa), neutrophilic sulfur oxidizers (Thiobacillus thiparus and related species; SOBn) and acidophilic iron oxidizers (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and related species; FeO) oxidizers. The most numerous were FeO with an average abundance of 9. 0 x 105 bacteria/g. The average abundance of SOBn was 5. 5 x 105 bacteria/g. The SOBa were much less numerous with an average abundance of 1. 2 x 103 bacteria/g. A 16 S rRNA analysis confirmed the presence of Thiobacillus and Acidithiobacillus species. Bacterial diversity was greatest in samples of the cover material. Unoxidized waste rock samples were usually characterized by a dominant iron or sulfur oxidizing genera even at neutral pH (i. e. Thiobacillus), whereas oxidized and acidic waste rock samples saw a shift to a dominant acidophilic genera (i. e. Acidithiobacillus) ...|$|R
