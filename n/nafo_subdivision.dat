40|$|Endoparasitic helminths were {{inventoried}} in 483 American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) {{collected from}} the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, NAFO (North Atlantic Fisheries Organization) division 4 T, and Cape Breton Shelf (<b>NAFO</b> <b>subdivision</b> 4 Vn) in September 2004 and May 2003, respectively. Forward stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA) of the 4 T samples indicated that abundances of the acanthocephalans Echinorhynchus gadi and Corynosoma strumosum were significant in the classification of plaice to western or eastern 4 T. Cross validation yielded a correct classification rate of 79...|$|E
40|$|Bayesian {{approaches}} {{to the analysis of}} population dynamics are becoming more common in some areas of fisheries research. The search for a stock-recruitment relationship is considered a central problem of fish population dynamics and has been explored in many studies. In this study, posterior distributions are estimated for both the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment curves, using the Normal, Log-normal and Poisson distributions, for both the Baltic Areas 22 - 24 and <b>NAFO</b> <b>subdivision</b> 3 Ps cod stocks. Prior distributions were changed and the sensitivity of the results were investigated. The posterior estimates are sensitive to our choice of prior distribution, which can have an important practical effect on the study of stock-recruitment issues {{in a number of different}} fisheries. The Gibbs sampler was used to overcome difficulties in calculating the posterior distributions...|$|E
40|$|Using data {{collected}} in fishery-independent bottom-trawl surveys of cod in <b>NAFO</b> <b>subdivision</b> 3 Ps, we examine (1) {{the variations in}} growth and maturation of cod among year classes from 1969 to 1990 and (2) inter-relationships between growth and maturation of cod. To reduce impacts of outliers on data analyses, a robust maximum likelihood estimator is used to fit the von Bertalanffy growth function to size-at-age data. An overall indicator for pre-maturity growth of cod is developed using a robust principal component analysis. This study suggests that cod born during 1980 s have smaller length-at-age values when compared with cod born in 1970 s. The age at maturity declined steadily from the highest of 7 yr old for the 1981 year-class to 5 yr old for the 1990 year-class. Growth and maturation {{were significantly related to}} each other. A cohort of cod that had a higher growth rate in their young ages tended to mature earlier. The impacts of the findings in this study on the management o...|$|E
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} trends of larval sealworm (Pseudoterranova decipiens) infection in eastern Canadian groundfish were monitored in an indicator host, Canadian plaice (Hippoglossoides pla-tessoides), in the 31 to 40 cm length range. Between February 1993 and September 1999, {{a total of}} 8, 482 plaice were collected from 33 locations in Canadian Maritime waters (<b>NAFO</b> <b>Subdivisions</b> 4 TVWX- 5 ZE), and their fillets and napes were examined for sealworm. Prevalence (P) and abun-dance (A) of the parasite were greatest (P ranging from 95 to 100 %, A from 7. 48 to 15. 60) in fish collected from the central Scotian shelf (4 VSW) near Sable Island, site of the largest grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) colony in the northwest Atlantic, and from Jordan Basin in the northeastern Gulf of Maine (4 X). The infection of greatest intensity (I= 158) occurred in a fish from “The Gully” slopewaters of Banquereau (4 VS), a few kilometres northeast of Sable Island. By 1995 - 99, seal-worm prevalence and/or abundance had increased significantly in plaice from most locations where stable or declining infection parameters were observed from 1989 to 1993, but abundance of the parasite continued to decline in the Sable Island area. While spatial {{and temporal}} distributions of larval sealworm in plaice seemed largely related to the distribution and growth of grey seal po-pulations, the influence of definitive hosts was probably mitigated by other factors such as changes in environmental temperature and parasite density limiting effects in the indicator host.

40|$|Discriminant {{function}} {{analyses of}} infection parameters of parasitic helminths revealed that abundances of seven helminth species {{contributed significantly to}} the delineation of four host populations of winter flounder Pleuronectes americanus from the central and southwest Scotian Shelf and the northeast Gulf of Maine (<b>NAFO</b> <b>subdivision</b> 4 WX 5 Z). These were adult digeneans, Derogenes varicus, Genolinea laticauda, Steganoderma formosum and Steringophorus furciger, metacercariae of the digenean, Stephanostomum baccatum, and larval nematodes, Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. The correct classification rate was 84 % overall, with Georges Bank (5 Z) and Sable Island Bank (4 W) winter flounder being the most accurately classified samples at 98 and 88 %, respectively. Winter flounder from southwest Nova Scotia (4 X), an inshore sample from St Marys Bay and offshore fish from Browns Bank, had the lowest rates of correct classification (76 and 71 %, respectively) due, primarily, to crossmisclassification between the two samples. Winter pairwise comparisons of four microsatellite markers identified significant genetic differences between all populations sampled with the Georges Bank population being the most genetically distinct overall, and St Marys Bay and Browns Bank fish being the least dissimilar.

40|$|Monitoring {{temporal}} and/or spatial {{variations in}} fish size-at-age data can often provide fisheries managers with important {{information about the}} status of fish stocks and therefore help them identify necessary changes in management policies. However, due to the multivariate nature of size-at-age data, commonly used single-age-based approaches ignore covariance between sizes of different age groups. Different results may therefore be derived when evaluating temporal variations using different age groups for the comparison. The possibility of atypical errors in size-at-age data due to ageing and measurement errors further complicates the comparison. We propose a two-step approach for developing an indicator for monitoring temporal and/or spatial variation in size-at-age data. A robust approach, minimum volume ellipsoid analysis, is used to identify possible outliers in size-at-age data. Then a weighted principal component analysis is applied to the data with the identified outliers down-weighted. An indicator is defined from the resultant principal components for monitoring temporal/spatial variations in size-at-age data. We illustrate the proposed approach with size-at-age data for cod (Gadus morhua) in the northwest Atlantic, <b>NAFO</b> <b>subdivision</b> 3 Ps. The overall size-at-age indicator identified shows that the pre- 1980 year classes tend to have a much higher size-at-age than the post- 1980 year classes...|$|E
