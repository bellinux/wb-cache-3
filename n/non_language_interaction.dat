40|$|The general aim of {{the work}} {{reported}} in this thesis is to investigate the viability of applying theories and principles {{from the field of}} natural language pragmatics to that of human-computer interaction. In pursuing this aim, the research falls broadly into three phases. The first of these is the exploitation and adaptation of the Gricean Cooperative Principle, its maxims and inferential rules to situations of computer use which do not employ natural language as the medium of communication. The purpose of this endeavour is to provide a novel and revealing analysis of <b>non</b> natural <b>language</b> <b>interaction</b> and to establish principles for dialogue design, the application of which enhance the quality of communication between system and user in such situations. The second phase concerns the application of the adapted Gricean principles to the design of a dialogue management system, intended to address some of the problems which other research has revealed users to experience in using the standard UNIX® shell interface. This second phase resulted in the production of the QDOS system, which is both a simulation of part of the UNIX® file system and an implementation of the proposed dialogue management system. This software acts as the vehicle for all subsequent evaluative exercises constituting the third phase. This takes the form of an evaluation of the QDOS system and its theoretical underpinning, based on a two-condition experiment and a protocol analysis, involving a number of experimental subjects. This research provides an original application of the Gricean Cooperative Principle in human-computer interaction and a theoretical and practical demonstration of the validity of this endeavour. It also adduces an analysis of the UNIX® interface and its vagaries in terms of a principled and consistent set of criteria as well as identifying a significant class of dialogue breakdown, the circumstances and incidence of which cut across issues of interface style. </p...|$|R

40|$|As {{language}} is the venue for the concretisation of concepts and entities in information systems development (ISD), language unambiguousness {{is understood as}} an ideal basis {{for the success of}} the consolidation process in information systems development. In contrast, a fundamental postulation of language theories is the inherent ambiguity of natural language. Therefore, the analysis of how language consensus can be reached in an effective manner is of particular interest for collaborative ISD. We claim that the effectiveness of ISD depends on the ability to manage the question of how people deal with language in practice and reach consensus in the concrete ISD process. This requirement leads us to the point of emergence of language: the <b>language</b> <b>interaction</b> setting.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} development of young children's behaviors on swings in the outdoor play environment and their emerging understanding of the physics principles associated with those behaviors. The children's <b>language</b> <b>interactions</b> were also examined {{in an effort to}} determine the relationship between language and cognitive development in their construction of physical knowledge. The procedures involved observing the children's behaviors and collecting samples of their spontaneous <b>language</b> <b>interactions</b> during their swinging activities. Informal interviews were also conducted with individual and groups of children. The findings indicate that young children's swinging behaviors develop in eight hierarchical stages. As these behaviors develop, children experiment with the physics principles of balance, gravity, force, resistance, and resonance. Children's swinging behaviors develop in a social context. Many early behaviors are acquired through observing and modeling other children. Language provides the medium for more-experienced peers to assist novice swingers through encouragement and direct instruction. The stage development of swinging behaviors is compared to Cratty's Theory of Perceptual-Motor Development and Harrow's Taxonomy of the Psychomotor Domain.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{contributes}} new empirical {{knowledge to}} the question of what paths bilingual acquisition of sound structure can take in early simultaneous bilinguals. The issues of <b>language</b> differentiation and <b>interaction</b> are considered in their relationship to language input, crosslinguistic structure and longitudinal effects. Two Russian-Scottish English subjects aged between 3; 4 and 4; 5 were recorded longitudinally. Russian was spoken in their families, and Scottish English in the community (Edinburgh, UK). The family environments were similar, but one subject had received substantially more input in Russian than the other one. We addressed the detail of their production of prominent syllable-nuclear vowels in Scottish English and in Russian with regard to their vowel quality, duration and vocal effort. <b>Language</b> differentiation and <b>interaction</b> patterns were derived by accounting for the language mode, and by statistical comparison of the crosslinguistic structures to the speech of monolingual peers (n= 7) and adults (n= 14). Subjects' bilingual results revealed both substantial language differentiation and systematic <b>language</b> <b>interaction</b> patterns. The extent of language differentiation and directionality of interaction depended on the amount of language exposure. Its directionality did not necessarily depend on the markedness of the crosslinguistic structures, and could be bi-directional for the same properties. Longitudinally, language differentiation increased, while interaction reduced. The amount of reduction depended on both language input and the structural complexity of the languages with segmental tense/lax contract and complex postvocalic vowel duration conditioning showing more persistent <b>language</b> <b>interaction</b> effects. The results confirmed the importance of language input. We showed that in bilingual phonological development <b>language</b> <b>interaction</b> should be considered as a normal but non-obligatory process. Besides, some structurally complex processes potentially explainable by 'markedness' (applied to isolated segments) could rather be explained by lexical and phonotactic factors.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} a proposed theory of AI. The theory postulates that a machine can be programmed to predict aspects of human behaviour by selecting and processing stored, concrete examples of previously experienced patterns of behaviour. Validity is tested {{in the domain of}} natural language. Externalisations that model the resulting theory of NLP entail fuzzy components. Fuzzy formalisms may exhibit inaccuracy and/or over productivity. A research strategy is developed, designed to investigate this aspect of the theory. The strategy includes two experimental hypotheses designed to test, 1) whether the model can process simple <b>language</b> <b>interaction,</b> and 2) the effect of fuzzy processes on such <b>language</b> <b>interaction.</b> Experimental design requires three implementations, each with progressive degrees of fuzziness in their processes. They are respectively named: Nonfuzz Babe, CorrBab and FuzzBabe. Nonfuzz Babe is used to test the first hypothesis and all three implementations are used to test the second hypothesis. A system description is presented for Nonfuzz Babe. Testing the first hypothesis provides results that show NonfuzzBabe is able to process simple <b>language</b> <b>interaction.</b> A system description for CorrBabe and FuzzBabe is presented. Testing the second hypothesis, provides results that show a positive correlation between degree of fuzzy processes and improved simple language performance. FuzzBabe's ability to process more complex <b>language</b> <b>interaction</b> is then investigated and model-intrinsic limitations are found. Research to overcome this problem is designed to illustrate the potential of externalisation of the theory and is conducted less rigorously than previous part of this investigation. Augmenting FuzzBabe to include fuzzy evaluation of non-pattern elements of interaction is hypothesised as a possible solution. The term FuzzyBaby was coined for augmented implementation. Results of a pilot study designed to measure FuzzyBaby's reading comprehension are given. Little research has been conducted that investigates NLP by the fuzzy processing of concrete patterns in language. Consequently, it is proposed that this research contributes to the intellectual disciplines of NLP and AI in general. ...|$|R
