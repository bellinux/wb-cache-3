5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, but there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress {{the leader of the}} group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E

25|$|Captain Turner gave {{evidence}} in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that {{up until the}} time of the sinking he had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of the Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he celebrated mass.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference in}} Latin literature to a marriage between males {{occurs in the}} Philippics of Cicero, who insulted Mark Antony for being a slut in his youth until Curio [...] "established you in a fixed and stable marriage (matrimonium), {{as if he had}} given you a stola", the traditional garment of a married woman. Although Cicero's sexual implications are clear, the point of the passage is to cast Antony in the submissive role in the relationship and to impugn his manhood in various ways; there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> actual marriage rites were performed.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{detailed}} 1965 {{article in the}} journal Theological Studies examining whether Jesus was ever called [...] "God" [...] in the New Testament, Brown concluded that [...] "Even the fourth Gospel never portrays Jesus as saying specifically that he is God" [...] and [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was called God in the earliest layers of New Testament tradition."

2500|$|However, {{a number}} of {{problems}} are inherent in intentionalism, and a fortiori when that theory is applied to the Constitution. [...] For example, most of the Founders did not leave detailed discussions of what their intent was in 1787, and while a few did, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they should be dispositive of what the rest thought. [...] Moreover, the discussions of the drafters may have been recorded; however they were not available to the ratifiers in each state. [...] The theory of original intent was challenged in a string of law review articles in the 1980s. Specifically, original intent was seen as lacking good answers to three important questions: whether a diverse group such as the framers even had a single intent; if they did, whether it could be determined from two centuries' distance; and whether the framers themselves would have supported original intent.|$|E

Hannah Allam calls the investigation [...] "callous," [...] but also wrote that [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the shooting {{had anything to do}} with [...] reporting work." [...] James Cogan, writing for the World Socialist Web Site, states that Salihee's [...] "last assignment gives reason to suspect that it was," [...] citing Salihee's effort to investigate alleged death squads. Davies writes that [...] "the links between the forces Yasser Salihee was investigating and the ones that killed him cast a long dark shadow over his death." [...] According to the Daily Kos blog, three journalists, including Steve Vincent, Yasser Salihee and Fakher Haider, were shot to death in Iraq in 2005 while investigating Interior Ministry commandos. After interviewing the American soldier and nearby witnesses, Robertson concluded that the death was tragic but [...] "a typical misunderstanding, of the sort that happens all the time in Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Stove's {{argument}} for induction, {{based on the}} statistical syllogism, was presented in the Rationality of Induction and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late Donald Cary Williams (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book The Ground of Induction. Stove argued {{that it is a}} statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, {{as long as it is}} not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset [...] "matches" [...] the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or [...] "representative" [...] ones. So as long as you have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.|$|E
2500|$|At , the [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] warning again sounded on {{the flight}} deck. The crew {{continued}} the descent. According to MAK's report, at [...] (Decision Height) there was no [...] "landing" [...] or [...] "go-around" [...] call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, {{take control of the}} airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point the captain said [...] "Go around", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying [...] "go around". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. [...] One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert [...] "PULL UP" [...] activated and continued to sound {{for the remainder of the}} flight. [...] "PULL UP" [...] only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when [...] "PULL UP" [...] sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as [...] "terrain inhibit" [...] mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a [...] "SINK RATE" [...] warning followed by a [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to [...] and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, [...] "landing additionally, 120, 3 m"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.|$|E
