500|$|Mellor made a brief {{appearance}} in the 1976 television documentary presented by actor and wrestler Brian Glover entitled It's <b>no</b> <b>joke</b> living in Barnsley, in which he demonstrated ferret-legging. During his appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May 1996, actor Paul Hogan (Crocodile Dundee) {{spent much of the}} interview with Leno talking about ferret-legging, which he identified as [...] "a new Australian Olympics event." [...] In November 1992, the J. Walter Thompson advertising firm produced television commercials for the California State Lottery that compared keno with ferret-legging. One of the commercials concludes that keno [...] "as you can imagine, is lots better than a ferret in your trousers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hopkins' column {{also drew}} {{criticism}} on Twitter, including from Russell Brand, to whom Hopkins responded by accusing Brand's [...] "champagne socialist humanity" [...] of neglecting taxpayers. Simon Usborne, writing in The Independent, compared {{her use of}} the word [...] "cockroach" [...] to previous uses by the Nazis and just before the Rwandan Genocide by its perpetrators. He suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece {{it would not have been}} published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper. Zoe Williams commented in The Guardian: [...] "It is <b>no</b> <b>joke</b> when people start talking like this. We are not 'giving her what she wants' when we make manifest our disgust. It is not a free speech issue. I'm not saying gag her: I’m saying fight her".|$|E
2500|$|While {{mentoring}} what Barlow {{called the}} 'joke category', he showed {{strong support for}} self-confessed [...] "pantomime villain" [...] Christopher Maloney right through to the grand final, despite strong criticism form fellow judges Louis Walsh and Tulisa for his cabaret performances. The format was changed for series 10 with <b>no</b> <b>joke</b> contestant in the final 12. Writing for The Telegraph, Olly Mann felt that this change was unwelcoming. He wrote: [...] "The fact that the joke contestants made it through to the live shows {{used to be the}} most gloriously British part of The X Factor. We love an underdog... It was {{a vital part of the}} format." [...] However, the 'joke act' returned to series 13 with Honey G. The rapper from Harrow, North London was described by Isabel Mohan in The Telegraph as [...] "the biggest joke in X Factor history." ...|$|E

50|$|While {{the current}} version and most {{previous}} instances have {{made use of}} a comedic spiel, filled with intentionally bad puns, the original intent of the ride {{was to provide a}} realistic, believable voyage through the world's jungles. Until 1962, the original spiel had <b>no</b> <b>jokes</b> and sounded much like the narration of a nature documentary.|$|R
60|$|While {{the search}} was being thus {{diligently}} though needlessly prosecuted in the neighbourhood of the Hot Swamp by Gadarn, who was dearly fond of a practical joke, another chief, who was in <b>no</b> <b>joking</b> humour, paid a visit one evening to his mother.

60|$|He was {{a serious}} divinity, and so were all the mid-Western human-beings about him. One heard <b>no</b> <b>joking</b> either of the dapper or cockney sort of cities, or the quaint graphic phrasing of Eastern country folk; {{and it may have}} been not far enough West for the true Western humor. At any rate, when they were not silent these men still were serious.|$|R

50|$|It’s said that, {{death is}} <b>no</b> <b>joking</b> matter. The thing is, with Beckett {{it is and}} this play is crammed full of {{references}} to it. The play’s setting is realistic enough and the characters too, if a little grotesque, but hardly anyone’s life has not rubbed shoulders with Death, from the unfortunate hen mowed down by Slocum’s car to the poor child thrown from the train. It is the dominant theme but far from the only one.|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to describe the image of family life presented in post-socialist jokelore. Contemporary material (from the late 1990 s till the present day) consisting of jokes published in books, booklets, newspapers and on the Internet was collected and analysed for this study, altogether 600 jokes. As there is no special cycle of jokes connected with family life, texts of different series were taken into account in which the words “woman”, “man”, “child” or their synonyms were present. The results showed that there exist a number of stable targets, e. g. aggressive mothers-in-law or adulterous wives. New targets are reluctant to arise: there are <b>no</b> <b>jokes</b> about the paternal leave which was recently introduced and widely discussed in the media, and there are also <b>no</b> <b>jokes</b> about women drinking alcohol, although this problem exists in the society that gives more and more permission to women drinking in public places. We can conclude {{on the basis of this}} research that family jokes do not deal with current and topical issues; instead, they have remained mostly traditional with certain recurring cycles being at the core of the Polish cultural heritage...|$|R
