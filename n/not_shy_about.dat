However, this bird is <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E

They are all very curious about him and <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{is highly}} affectionate, playful, {{extremely}} patient {{and eager to}} please. [...] As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs. Cavaliers are <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses {{with more than one}} breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.|$|E

5000|$|The play's {{prominence}} in theatrical history has won it {{the attention of}} scholars and critics. Some of the criticism has been favourable; one editor judged it [...] "a highly finished, integrated piece of work, with everything handsomely symmetrical about it." [...] Yet critics have <b>not</b> been <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> finding faults; one called Sir Giles Over-reach [...] "the character whom his author could not control." [...] Massinger's blending of lighter dramatic materials, like comedy of intrigue, with the play's more serious aspects, has also been faulted.|$|R

Although the deed of cession recognized his authority and gave him the title of Acting Governor, as far as the United States government was concerned, he was officially responsible only for the naval station. As the first naval governor, Tilley laid the groundwork for much of the future governance of the territory, which did not yet even have a formal name. The American Samoa government includes Tilley and the other pre-1905 station commandants in its list of territorial governors.|$|E
500|$|Emily Berman, {{counsel at}} the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law commented that [...] "' {{potential}} consequences are as predictable as night following day: Police will interrogate criminal suspects {{who do not}} explicitly invoke their rights—often, those will be suspects who are unsophisticated, poorly educated or mentally ill—for hours on end. This will lead, just as inevitably, to more coerced—and therefore unreliable—confessions... the very phenomenon that Miranda aimed to eliminate." [...] She noted the attorney general's comment that Miranda warnings had not deterred terrorism suspects such as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad from talking and providing [...] "valuable intelligence". The positive observation was a reflection upon attempts by Congress to amend Miranda legislatively, that the decision [...] "sends a strong signal" [...] that [...] "the Supreme Court is <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> curtailing Miranda protections, even without prodding from Congress". She concluded that [...] "hile it might look with hostility on congressional attempts {{to rein in the}} scope of the Miranda rule, the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants. And it is willing to reach relatively far to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, <b>not</b> usually <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|R

The members have <b>not</b> been <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> courting controversy and have periodically attracted condemnation from morality campaigners. Till and Flake's stage act earned them a night in jail in June 1999 after a liquid-ejecting dildo was used in a concert in Worcester, Massachusetts.

MTV Germany studied the lyrics, talked to the band and came away satisfied that Rammstein are apolitical; Peter Ruppert, then head of Music Programming at MTV Germany, stated that the band [...] "aren't in any way connected with any right-wing activities". Such criticism may be unavoidable for a German band that deals in harsh, militaristic-style imagery.|$|R
40|$|The {{formalization}} {{of music}} {{has not always}} covered so readily the form of music, particularly from a psychological angle that takes the listener into account. Some novel forms have been organizational by-products of the top-down application of grammars or probability distributions. Many works have utilized bottom-up generation of material ready for human arrangement, or accepted existing stylistic templates from music theories. Whilst material might be generated to fill particular sections, the relations between sections and between hierarchical layers, and particularly the control of musical tension through transition, have received far less attention. Algorithmic music often seems stuck in a static moment form, able to abruptly jump between composed sections but unable to demonstrate much real dramatic direction. In part, this is because such ebb and flow engages with seemingly unformalizable attributes of the human musical experience, with musical expectancy, memory and emotion. Nevertheless, since automated music has <b>not</b> been <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> formalizing other aspects of musical structure, and human beings are intimately involved in authoring musical systems, it would seem a highly productive avenue to explore further the possibilities of algorithmic musical form from a psychological angle...|$|R

But while the move may have been unusual, there is nothing in the text of the Constitution’s pardons clause to suggest that he exceeded his authority. The president, the clause says, 'shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.' The pardon power extends only to federal crimes. Otherwise, presidents are free to use it as they see fit.

40|$|Stadiums {{are more}} than just {{facilities}} for organized sport; they offer a gathering site for people with shared interest, provide economic benefits to the surrounding community, and most importantly represent the advancements in architecture and engineering. When stadiums were first developed, their main focus was to provide enclosure for athletes' play and little attention was given to spectators. Most Greek and Roman athletic facilities are guilty of this. While the general geometry of stadiums remains the same today, the structure itself has changed tremendously. As this thesis will point out, there is a multitude of structural systems that have been employed in the design of stadiums. As very big structures attracting a lot of attention, stadiums require good architecture. Designers have <b>not</b> been <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> attacking this problem head on resulting in an abundance of spectacularly designed and built stadiums, many with their own unique features. After introducing significant design constraints and possible design solutions, this thesis will present a handful of case studies. Stadiums from across America and Europe will be discussed in varying detail in the hopes of opening the reader's eyes to the advancements in stadium design. Upon reading this thesis, readers should gain knowledge on the growth of stadium development and hopefully an understanding of where stadium design will go in the future. by Erika Yaroni. Thesis (M.
