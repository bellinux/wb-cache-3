40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme to {{implement}} Controlled <b>Not-gate</b> for topological qubits in a quantum-dot-Majorana-fermion hybrid system. Quantum information is encoded on pairs of Majorana fermions, which live on the the interface between topologically trivial and nontrivial sections of a quantum nanowire deposited on an s-wave superconductor. A measurement-based two-qubit Controlled-Not gate is produced {{with the help of}} parity measurements assisted by the quantum-dot and followed by prescribed single-qubit gates.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} that optimal control algorithms {{can be used}} to speed up the implementation of modules of quantum algorithms or quantum simulations in networks of coupled qubits. The gain is most prominent in realistic cases, where the qubits are not all mutually coupled. Thus the shortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology {{as well as on the}} characteristicratio of the time scales for local controls vs non-local (i. e. coupling) evolutions in the specific experimental setting. Relating these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown, time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the usual gate complexity. In the limit of fast local controls (as e. g. in NMR), time-optimised realisations are shown for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the multiply controlled <b>not-gate</b> (c^n- 1 not) in various coupling topologies of n qubits. The speed-ups are substantial: in a chain of six qubits the quantum Fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight times faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase, Hadamard and swap gates, while the c^n- 1 <b>not-gate</b> for completely coupled network of six qubits is nearly seven times faster.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{the edge of a}} {{two-dimensional}} topological insulator can be used to construct a solid state Stern-Gerlach spin-splitter. By threading such a Stern-Gerlach apparatus with a magnetic flux, Ahranov-Bohm like interference effects are introduced. Using ferromagnetic leads, the setup can be used to both measure magnetic flux and as a spintronics switch. With normal metallic leads a switchable spintronics <b>NOT-gate</b> can be implemented. Furthermore, we show that a sequence of such devices can be used to construct a single-qubit SU(2) -gate, one of the two gates required for a universal quantum computer.

40|$|Variation in the DNA {{sequence}} upstream {{of bacterial}} promoters {{is known to}} affect the expression levels of the products they regulate, sometimes dramatically. While neutral synthetic insulator sequences {{have been found to}} buffer promoters from upstream DNA context, there are no established methods for designing effective insulator sequences with predictable effects on expression levels. We address this problem with Degenerate Insulation Screening (DIS), a novel method based on a randomized 36 -nucleotide insulator library and a simple, high-throughput, flow-cytometry-based screen that randomly samples from a library of 436 potential insulated promoters. The results of this screen can then be compared against a reference uninsulated device to select a set of insulated promoters providing a precise level of expression. We verify this method by insulating the constitutive, inducible, and repressible promotors of a four transcriptional-unit inverter (<b>NOT-gate)</b> circuit, finding both that order dependence is largely eliminated by insulation and that circuit performance is also significantly improved, with a 5. 8 -fold mean improvement in on/off ratio...|$|E
40|$|We study Gaifman and Hanf {{locality}} of {{an extension}} of first-order logic with modulo p counting quantifiers (FO+MODp, for short) with arbitrary numerical predicates. We require that the validity of formulas is independent of the particular interpretation of the numerical predicates and refer to such formulas as arb-invariant formulas. This paper gives a detailed picture of locality and non-locality properties of arb-invariant FO+MODp. For example, on the class of all finite structures, for any p >= 2, arb-invariant FO+MODp is neither Hanf nor Gaifman local {{with respect to a}} sublinear locality radius. However, in case that p is an odd prime power, it is weakly Gaifman local with a polylogarithmic locality radius. And when restricting attention to the class of string structures, for odd prime powers p, arb-invariant FO+MODp is both Hanf and Gaifman local with a polylogarithmic locality radius. Our negative results build on examples of order-invariant FO+MODp formulas presented in Niemistö 2 ̆ 7 s PhD thesis.

40|$|Background: Conformational {{thoracic}} radiotherapy (CTR) is a key-treatment in locally advanced nonsmall cell {{lung cancer}} (LA-NSCLC). Acute radiation pneumonitis (ARP) {{is one of}} the major complications. Aims: To evaluate the predictors of ARP after CTR in the treatment of LA-NSCLC. Materials and methods: A total of 47 consecutive patients (pts) were treated with CTR for LA-NSCLC and retrospectively analyzed. The mean total dose of radiation therapy (RT) was 65 Gy, with respiratory gating (RG) in 19 cases. Induction and concomitant chemotherapy was performed in 33 pts (70 %) and 41 pts (87 %), respectively. Results: Eleven pts (23 %) had an ARP resulting in death for one pt. In univariate analysis, age, sex, pretherapeutic value of forced expiratory volume (FEV), <b>not-gated</b> radiotherapy and type of concomitant chemotherapy did not appear as contributing factors in contrast to the administration of induction gemcitabine (p = 0. 03). The occurrence of ARP was significantly associated with nontumor lung volumes irradiated to 13 Gy (V 13, p = 0. 04), 20 Gy (V 20, p = 0. 02), and 25 Gy (V 25, p = 0. 006), the mean lung dose (p = 0. 008) and lung normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) (p = 0. 004). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the occurrence of ARP was significantly associated with age > 75 years (odds ratio (OR) = 16. 72, confidence interval (CI) 95 % 1. 77 - 157. 87) and administration of induction gemcitabine (OR = 18. 08, CI 95 % 1. 09 - 300. 08). Conclusion: ARP is a common acute complication, requiring close posttreatment follow-up, particularly for elderly patients. The use of gemcitabine before radiation should be avoided. The benefits and risks of CTR must be carefully analyzed, according to the dosimetric parameters...|$|R

40|$|After {{introducing}} the no-cloning theorem {{and the most}} common forms of approximate quantum cloning, universal quantum cloning is considered in detail. The connections it has with universal <b>NOT-gate,</b> quantum cryptography and state estimation are presented and briefly discussed. The state estimation connection is used {{to show that the}} amount of extractable classical information and total Bloch vector length are conserved in universal quantum cloning. The 1  2 qubit cloner is also shown to obey a complementarity relation between local and nonlocal information. These are interpreted to be a consequence of the conservation of total information in cloning. Finally, the performance of the 1  M cloning network discovered by Bužek, Hillery and Knight is studied in the presence of decoherence using the Barenco et al. approach where random phase fluctuations are attached to 2 -qubit gates. The expression for average fidelity is calculated for three cases and it is found to depend on the optimal fidelity and the average of the phase fluctuations in a specific way. It is conjectured to be the form of the average fidelity in the general case. While the cloning network is found to be rather robust, it is nevertheless argued that the scalability of the quantum network implementation is poor by studying the effect of decoherence during the preparation of the initial state of the cloning machine in the 1 ! 2 case and observing that the loss in average fidelity can be large. This affirms the result by Maruyama and Knight, who reached the same conclusion in a slightly different manner...|$|E
40|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{realization of}} the Universal Optimal Quantum Cloning Machine (UOQCM) and of the Universal-NOT gate by a quantum injected optical parametric amplification (QIOPA), is reported. The two processes, forbidden in their exact form for fundamental quantum limitations, are found universal and optimal, and the measured fidelity F < 1 is found close to the limit values evaluated by quantum theory. This work may enlighten the yet little explored interconnections of fundamental axiomatic properties within the deep structure of quantum mechanics. Typeset using REVTEX 1 A most interesting aspects of quantum information consists of its insightful enlightening the deep structure of quantum mechanics, the cornerstone of our yet uncertain understanding of the Universe. Because of its key role in various branches of science and of the immediate confrontation with its well alive ”classical ” counterpart, Quantum Information (QI) has indeed become the training field for intriguing questions, apparent contradictions and paradoxes, ”forbidden ” processes. It is then not surprising that after a century long quantum endeavour the inner structure of the theory has been drawn recently to a profound investigation. For instance, several unexpected quantum ”bounds ” were discovered mostly in quantum measurement theory. A renowned example is the ”no-cloning ” theorem implying the impossibility of using of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations for the superluminal communication of significant messages [1 – 3]. Another important, recently discovered forbidden QI process consists of the impossibility of realizing in a 2 -dimensional Hilbert space the Universal <b>NOT-gate,</b> i. e. a spin-flip map by which any input qubit |Ψ〉 is transformed into the corresponding orthogonal qubit ∣ ⊥ Ψ 〉 [4].

40|$|Building {{reliable}} genetic {{devices in}} synthetic biology {{is still a}} major challenge despite the various advances {{that have been made}} in the field since its inception. In principle, genetic devices with matching input and output expression levels can be assembled from well-characterized genetic parts. In practice, a priori genetic circuit design continues to be difficult in synthetic biology due to the lack of foundational work in this area. Currently, a successful genetic device is typically created by manually building and testing many combinatorial variants of the target device and then picking the best one. While this process is slow and error-prone, as synthetic genetic devices grow in complexity, this approach also becomes unmanageable and impractical. Fluctuations in genetic context have been identified as a major cause of rational genetic circuit design failures. Promoter elements often behave unpredictably as they are moved from the context in which they were originally characterized. Thus, the ordered location of parts in a synthetic device impacts expected performance. Synthetic spacer DNA sequences have been reported to successfully buffer promoters from their neighboring DNA sequence but design rules for these sequences are lacking. I address this problem with a novel method based on a randomized insulator library. I have developed a high-throughput, flow cytometry-based screen that randomly samples from a library of 4 ^ 36 potential insulators created in a single cloning step. This method provides precise control over genetic circuit expression. I further show that insulating the promoters in a genetic <b>NOT-gate</b> improves circuit performance and nearly eliminates the effect of the order in which the promoters are organized in the device. This foundational work will help improve the design of reliable genetic devices in E. coli. Finally, automated DNA assembly using liquid-handling robots can help increase the speed at which combinatorial synthetic device variants are assembled. However, these systems require significant investment in optimizing the handling parameters for handling very small volumes of the various liquids in DNA assembly protocols. I have optimized and validated these liquid-handling parameters on the Tecan EVO liquid handling robotic platform. These materials have been made available to the larger community. 2017 - 12 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
