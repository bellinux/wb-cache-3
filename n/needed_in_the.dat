5|$|Tallon did not concede a bye in England's first {{innings of}} 215 and his diving was {{estimated}} to have saved around 40runs. He caught Washbrook from Lindwall to leave England at 1/17, and later caught Laker from Johnson. Tallon was not <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings; Lindwall was promoted above Tallon because Australia needed quick runs and Lindwall was a big-hitter. Australia declared at 7/460, leaving England a target of 509.|$|E

5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began {{operating in the}} months following the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans were was a massive trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; in turn, the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked down {{to make room for the}} 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.|$|E
5|$|Despite Michaels {{winning the}} right to be escorted by Pamela Anderson to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Diesel at WrestleMania, Anderson came to the ring with Diesel instead. Michaels's bodyguard, Sycho Sid, {{attempted}} to interfere on Michaels's behalf but ultimately helped Diesel retain the title. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid {{that he would not be}} <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upcoming match. Upset with Michaels, Sid attacked Michaels until Diesel came to Michaels's rescue. Diesel and Michaels became allies once again and teamed up to win the WWF Tag Team Championship later that year.|$|E

5|$|Implacables {{construction}} was suspended in 1940 {{in favour of}} escorts <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Atlantic so that the two carriers were launched within days of each other. She embarked portions of her air wing for training in late August and {{was assigned to the}} Home Fleet on 7 October at Scapa Flow after working up. She joined ships searching for Tirpitz a week later and some of her Fairey Fireflies spotted the battleship off Håkøya Island near Tromsø. Subsequently, her Fireflies successfully attacked targets in Norway. In late October, the carrier's Seafires arrived and she participated in Operation Athletic off the Norwegian coast, sinking four warships and two merchant ships and damaging a German submarine. In November and December, Implacable provided air cover for minelaying operations and attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast. On 15 December she began a refit at Rosyth preparatory to her transfer to the BPF, which included augmenting her light AA armament.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition <b>needed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} Test, which England won comfortably, Kilner scored 79, his highest Test score, adding 133 with Dodger Whysall, the largest {{partnership}} of the match. When Australia batted, Kilner took five wickets in the match and stood out {{as one of}} the best bowlers. In the final Test, Kilner took four for 97 in Australia's first innings, but could not prevent the home team's fourth victory of the series. Kilner finished the series with 129 runs and averaged 29.80, batting mainly at number eight in the order, and Wisden noted he scored runs when they were <b>needed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Tests, he captured 17 wickets at an average of 23.47. Wisden noted that no-one but Kilner could take wickets to support Tate, the most successful bowler. Apart from these two, no other bowler could manage more than 11 wickets and the other main bowlers averaged around 50. In all first-class matches, Kilner scored 488 runs at 24.88 and took 40 wickets at 25.17.|$|E

5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} second leg with a one-goal lead, {{although}} Brugge needed to score only one clear goal {{to win the}} competition {{by virtue of the}} away goals rule. The Belgians scored the goal they <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th minute. Liverpool defender Smith was adjudged to have handled the ball in the Liverpool penalty area and Brugge were awarded a penalty kick. Lambert converted the opportunity to give Brugge a 1–0 lead and level the aggregate tie at 3–3. Responding to the setback, Liverpool equalised four minutes later. They were awarded a free-kick outside the Brugge penalty area. Hughes rolled the ball to Keegan whose right-footed shot went into the Brugge goal to level the scores at 1–1 and give Liverpool a 4–3 aggregate lead. The goal incidentally was the first Brugge had conceded at home in the UEFA Cup all season.|$|E

Under Fuhito's control, {{the remainder of}} AVALANCHE is turned into a vicious army of uncontrollable Ravens, and he manages to steal all the materia <b>needed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final battle, Fuhito summons Zirconiade, fusing the summon with his own body, and Shears sacrifices himself to save Elfé. Fuhito transforms into a monster, but he is defeated by the Turks. After the battle, Tseng falsely claims that both Veld and Elfé are dead, so as {{to protect them from}} being hunted by Shinra. The Turks are then reorganized, with Tseng reinstated as their immediate leader, but they are now sworn to loyalty to Shinra as part of the bargain for their survival. The original Turks find new lives for themselves in hiding, and are later seen helping in the evacuation of Midgar during the events of VII.|$|E
5|$|Temporary {{space was}} <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim, {{and the school}} {{relocated}} its 550 fourth through ninth grade students to rented space in Roselawn, the epicenter of Cincinnati's Jewish Community. The school was divided between two buildings, the Yavneh Day School building at 1636 Summit Road and the nearby Jewish Community Center. The Yavneh Day school, founded in 1952 by parents who wanted to combine secular and Jewish education for their children, moved to Roselawn in 1958 but had outgrown that facility. The school had no lockers; students carried their belongings between buildings. Lunches were delivered from another school and served at a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer <b>needed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E

5|$|The Markendeya Purana praises Varahi as a granter of boons and the regent of the Northern direction, in a hymn {{where the}} Matrikas are {{declared}} as the protectors of the directions. In another instance {{in the same}} Purana, she is described as riding a buffalo. The Devi Bhagavata Purana says Varahi, with the other Matrikas, is created by the Supreme Mother. The Mother promises the gods that the Matrikas will fight demons when <b>needed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Raktabija episode, Varahi is described as having a boar form, fighting demons with her tusks while seated on a preta (corpse).|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches {{for the same reasons}} as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
