25|$|Because of the {{introduced}} Nile perch (Lates niloticus), <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis niloticus), {{and water}} hyacinth, deforestation {{that led to}} water siltation, and overfishing, many Lake Victoria cichlid species have become extinct or been drastically reduced. By around 1980, lake fisheries yielded only 1% cichlids, a drastic decline from 80% in earlier years.|$|E
25|$|The {{fish fauna}} in Lake Kivu is {{relatively}} poor with 28 described species, including four introduced species. The natives are the Lake Rukwa minnow (Raiamas moorii), four species of barb (Ripon barbel, Barbus altianalis, East African red-finned barb, Enteromius. apleurogramma, Redspot barb, Enteromius kerstenii and Pellegrin's barb, Enteromius pellegrini), an Amphilius catfish, two Clarias catfish (C. liocephalus and C. gariepinus), <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis niloticus) and 15 endemic Haplochromis cichlids. Another c. 20 possibly undescribed species of cichlids are {{known from the}} lake. The introduced species are three cichlids, the longfin tilapia (Oreochromis macrochir), O. leucostictus and redbreast tilapia (Coptodon rendalli), and a clupeid, the Lake Tanganyika sardine, Limnothrissa miodon.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in the 1950s, {{several species}} have been {{introduced}} to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids. Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (Coptodon rendalli), redbelly (C. zillii), and [...] Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus), and O. leucostictus. Although these {{have contributed to the}} extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapia)</b> possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus).|$|E

2500|$|Lake Victoria {{supports}} Africa's largest inland fishery (as of 1997). Initially {{the fishery}} involved native species, especially tilapia and haplochromine cichlids, but also catfish (Bagrus, Clarias, Synodontis and silver butter catfish), elephantfish, ningu (Labeo victorianus) and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus). Some of these, including tilapia and ningu (Labeo victorianus), had already {{declined in the}} first half of the 20th century due to overfishing. To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and Nile perch were introduced to the lake in the 1950s. Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapia</b> (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent). Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives. At the peak in the early 1990s, [...] of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a model of}} a pilot {{constructed}} treatment wetland in Uganda is described. Fishes (<b>Nile</b> <b>tilapias)</b> are being cultured in order to recover the cost of the construction and maintenance. The purpose of the model is to assist in the management of constructed wetlands. The pilot constructed wetland is modeled as two modules, the first describing wastewater treatment ponds and the second module describing the ponds for fish culture. The model has been validated with data from literature and an experiment. The predictions of the modules are analyzed under several conditions that can be influenced by the designer of treatment wetlands. The factors determined as major influences on the treatment efficiency and fish growth are the nutrient load applied to the constructed wetland, the availability of dissolved oxygen and photosynthesis. The design of future CTW should be based on the amount of nutrients in the wastewater and the volume of wastewater that is available on a regular basis. For the design and maintenance of fish culture ponds the open surface area and measures to prevent excessive algal growth should be considered. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the body composition of <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapias</b> in different length classes of Thai and Commercial strains, being the latter derived from the GIFT program (Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia) on the levels of moisture, crude protein, ether extract, ash and energy. The fish were cultivated in cages in a dam in Presidente Prudente, SP – Brazil. With the growth, fish sampled randomly from each strain were weighed and measured in length. The body composition showed differences between the strains in the levels of moisture, carbohydrates, ether extract and energy as the fish grew (P< 0. 05). The content of protein and ash was similar in the strains, but the percentage of ash increased with the fish growth. A decrease in the percentage of moisture and increased in the percentage of ether extract and in the energetic content were observed in the larger class length. Differences in rates of growth of tilapia strains influence the metabolic rates of mobilization, particularly of water and ether extract, changing the dynamics of deposition of these elements and the energy content...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of seafood by bacteria of fecal origin, especially Escherichia coli, {{is a widely}} documented sanitary problem. The objective {{of the present study}} was to isolate E. coli strains from the gills, muscle, and body surface of farmed <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapias</b> (Oreochromis niloticus) fresh-marketed in supermarkets in Fortaleza (Ceará, Brazil), to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics of different families (amikacin, gentamicin, imipenem, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and sulfametoxazol-trimetoprim), and to determine the nature of resistance by plasmid curing. Forty-four strains (body surface = 25, gills = 15, muscle = 4) were isolated, all of which were susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and imipenem. Gill and body surface samples yielded 11 isolates resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and sulfametoxazol-trimetoprim, 4 of which of plasmidial nature. The multiple antibiotic resistance index was higher for strains isolated from body surface than from gills. The overall high antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains isolated from fresh-marketed tilapia was satisfactory, although the occasional finding of plasmidial resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming, handling, and marketing conditions of aquaculture products...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{correlation}} between growth rate before and after a food deprivation phase in twelve single held <b>Nile</b> <b>tilapias,</b> Oreochromis niloticus. The experiment was divided into three phases: Before food deprivation (phase 1 : 15 d), food deprivation (phase 2 : 12 d) and refeeding (phase 3 : 15 d). The specific growth rate - SGR, food conversion efficiency - FCE and feed ingestion increased significantly during phase 3. Positive and significant correlations were found either to SGR or to feed ingestion between Phase 1 and 3 but not for FCE. The SGR on phase 3, moreover, were positively correlated to FCE and feed ingestion, while on phase 1 SGR was positively correlated to FCE only. Thus, high pre-fasting SGR or feed ingestion reflects in likewise high post-fasting SGR or feed ingestion values. Moreover, since SGR and FCE are correlated {{to each other in}} both phase 1 and 3, but phase 3 SGR is also correlated to feed ingestion; We could suppose that hyperphagic behaviour could be the main compensatory mechanism. Accordingly, we suggest that a fish with an elevated growth performance shall display a proportionally raised post-fasting growth response in order to normalize its predetermined growth trajectory and resume its normal growth rate. © GSP.
