5|$|<b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> {{offered a}} tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but Harold's {{continued}} illness {{and the need}} for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather. Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm. Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families, but <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society. In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker. In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Richard Milhous <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, in a {{house that}} was built by his father. His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father {{converted}} from Methodism to the Quaker faith. <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates.|$|E

5000|$|Since <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> both a Republican and a Quaker, both {{defaults}} can be applied. However, {{applying the}} first default {{leads to the}} conclusion that <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> not a pacifist, which makes the second default not applicable. In the same way, applying the second default we obtain that <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> a pacifist, thus making the first default not applicable. This particular default theory has therefore two extensions, one in which [...] is true, and one in which [...] is false.|$|R
5|$|Although Pat <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> a Methodist, she and {{her husband}} {{attended}} whichever Protestant Church was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional Baptist services with the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, and Norman Vincent Peale's Marble Collegiate Church.|$|E
5|$|Nixon in China {{formally}} premiered on the Brown Stage {{at the new}} Wortham Theater Center in Houston on October 22, 1987, with John DeMain {{conducting the}} Houston Grand Opera. Former president <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> invited, and was sent {{a copy of the}} libretto; however, his staff indicated that he was unable to attend, due to illness and an impending publication deadline. A Nixon representative later stated that the former president disliked seeing himself on television or other media, and had little interest in opera. According to Adams, he was later told by former Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment that <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> highly interested in everything written about him, and so likely saw the Houston production when it was televised on PBS' Great Performances.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election.|$|E

5|$|Pat Nixon died on June 22, 1993, of {{emphysema}} {{and lung}} cancer. Her funeral services were {{held on the}} grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace.

5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{sentences}} like <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> guilty, if Haldeman is guilty too, first discussed by Soames (1982) and Karttunen and Peters (1979), which raise three problems. First, they are felicitous {{and do not}} appear to have presuppositions. However all major theories of presuppositions predict that they should presuppose what the antecedent presupposes (e. g., the sentence above should presuppose that <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> guilty). Second, there is a contrast between these sentences and the corresponding sentence-initial conditionals like if Haldeman <b>is</b> guilty too, <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> guilty. Finally, a way to solve the problem would be to locally accommodate the presupposition in the antecedent. However, this wrongly predicts tautological truth-conditions. In the case above, the predicted meaning could be paraphrased as “Nixon is guilty, if both Haldeman and <b>Nixon</b> <b>are</b> guilty. ” As a solution to these three problems, I propose that the presupposition is nonetheless locally accommodated in the antecedent and furthermore that the sentence is also interpreted exhaustively, which gives rise to a non-presuppositional and non-tautological meaning analogous to <b>Nixon</b> <b>is</b> guilty, only if both Haldeman and <b>Nixon</b> <b>are</b> guilty. Furthermore, I argue that the degraded status of the sentence-initial case is an independent fact rooted in the topic-focus structure of sentence-final conditionals. Finally, the present proposal can also be extended to treat related non-presuppositional cases like I will go, if we go together. 32 page(s...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas and Nixon {{announced}} their candidacies in late 1949. In March 1950 Downey withdrew from a vicious primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement, after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race. Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist {{and was the}} first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who was accused of being a communist. Boddy, Nixon, and Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as cross-filing. In the Republican primary, <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates.|$|E
5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost {{to him in the}} 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.|$|E

5|$|In Congress, Nixon {{supported}} the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, {{a federal law}} that monitors the activities and power of labor unions, and he served on the Education and Labor Committee.

Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|In late 1970, Vicki Cole {{indicated}} {{in an interview}} <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> doing the best he could. During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> born in Yorba Linda, California. After {{completing}} his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, {{he graduated from}} Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 {{to work for the}} federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president – at 40, the second-youngest vice president in history. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey.|$|E
5|$|After President <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> {{elected in}} November 1968, Ford's role shifted {{to being an}} {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E
