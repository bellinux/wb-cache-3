5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E

2500|$|Adaptation is {{primarily}} a process rather than a physical form or part of a body. An internal parasite (such as a liver fluke) can illustrate the distinction: such a parasite may have a very simple bodily structure, but nevertheless the organism is highly adapted to its specific environment. From this we see that adaptation is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations {{take place in the}} life cycle, which is often quite complex. However, as a practical term, [...] "adaptation" [...] often refers to a product: those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function remains in doubt. By using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process, and adaptive trait for the bodily part or function (the product), one may distinguish the two different senses of the word.|$|E

2500|$|Programmers in the Scheme dialect often express loops using tail recursion. Scheme's {{commonality}} {{in academic}} computer science {{has led some}} students to believe that tail recursion is the only, or the most common, way to write iterations in Lisp, but this is incorrect. All oft-seen Lisp dialects have imperative-style iteration constructs, from Scheme's [...] loop to Common Lisp's complex [...] expressions. Moreover, the key issue that makes this an objective rather than subjective matter is that Scheme makes specific requirements for the handling of tail calls, and thus {{the reason that the}} use of tail recursion is generally encouraged for Scheme is that the practice is expressly supported by the language definition. By contrast, ANSI Common Lisp does not require the optimization commonly termed a tail call elimination. Thus, the fact that tail recursive style as a casual replacement for the use of more traditional iteration constructs (such as , [...] or [...] ) is discouraged in Common Lisp is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> stylistic preference, but potentially one of efficiency (since an apparent tail call in Common Lisp may not compile as a simple jump) and program correctness (since tail recursion may increase stack use in Common Lisp, risking stack overflow).|$|E
2500|$|The {{rejection}} of the dynastic claims of the House of Orange therefore was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> defending the political patronage of one particular political faction, against the aspirations to lucrative political office of another faction. It {{was a matter of}} principle to the States Party: they were against the notion of any [...] "eminent head" [...] of the Dutch state, not just the Prince of Orange. The absence of such an [...] "eminent head" [...] was to them a mark of superiority of the Dutch political system over other forms of government. The fact that compromise was a constant feature of the Dutch political landscape, and that often the pace of decision-making was glacial, was also viewed in a not necessarily negative light. (Besides, as was abundantly proved during the reign of William III, when he had obtained the stadtholdership after 1672, an [...] "eminent head" [...] did not necessarily eliminate the need for compromise, or speed up decision-making). Like his contemporaries as statesmen, such as Mazarin, De Witt was a raison d'état statesman, but his raison d'état had a different content. Unlike the princely version, his disdained territorial aggrandizement, military capability for its own sake, and concentration of power in the central state. Instead, he strove to ensure security of the Dutch state, its independence from outside interference, and advancement of its trade and industry, all elements being intended to benefit the society of which the regent class were the proper representatives. The Republic, in De Witt's view, sought to attain goals which were commensurate with the interests of its citizens, not in conflict with them, as the goals of absolutist rulers often were.|$|E
2500|$|Several social {{thinkers and}} {{academics}} have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it in toto. The French hermeneutic philosopher Paul Ricœur (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping {{the limits of}} validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as [...] "a Kantianism without a transcendental subject". Anthropologist Adam Kuper (1973) argued that [...] "'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement {{and some of its}} adherents felt that they formed a secret society of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation." [...] Philip Noel Pettit (1975) called for an abandoning of [...] "the positivist dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for semiology" [...] arguing that semiology is not to be placed among the natural sciences. Cornelius Castoriadis (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain symbolic mediation in the social world; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the [...] "logicist" [...] theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations {{on the basis of the}} binary logic of oppositions. Critical theorist Jürgen Habermas (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science (see Performative contradiction and Foucault–Habermas debate). Sociologist Anthony Giddens (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of social systems is merely [...] "a mechanical outcome".|$|E

2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Brazilian Bahá'í community has members and activities and external interests in issues affecting the religion. And the community continues programs of outreach. In 1986 the Brazilian Society of Physicians for Peace was formed on the initiative of a number of Bahá'í physicians (some 120 medical professionals attend the convocation.) In 2002 the National Spiritual Assembly prepared a list of some 44 names of national religious leaders, theologians, and religious academics, and then sent the letter Letter to the World's Religious Leaders out by mail or personal delivery.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the author {{discusses}} the legitimation {{of judicial review}} of legislation. He argues that such <b>a</b> legitimation is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> moral <b>matter</b> but is to be considered more generally in terms of societal acceptability, since {{it is based on}} a wide range of reasons including moral, social and pragmatic concerns. Moreover, the paper stresses that the legitimation of judicial decisions should be properly viewed in a circular perspective, so that the relationship between legislators and judges cannot be reduced to an absolute supremacy of those who are democratically elected over those who apply the law. On the contrary, the law is constantly made, adapted and developed in legal practice and legal decisions are basically legitimated through several processes of deliberative communication. * In this paper, 1 I will discuss the legitimation of judicial review of legislation in the perspective of its societal acceptability. To be widely accepted in society, the content of the judicial decision must meet certain minimum moral standards that are prevalent in that society. However, this acceptability is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> moral <b>matter.</b> It is <b>a</b> mixture of morals, sociology and pragmatic reasoning. Morally neutral forms and procedures may be decisive for such acceptability. One can, of course, accept that following certain kinds of procedures and other formal rules, may have some moral value in its own right, as it makes it more probable that the content of the rules which will be the outcome of such procedures will also be morally acceptable. Neverthe-less the moral value of procedural rules is limited. Therefore, it seems *Abstract by Antonino Rotolo...|$|R
