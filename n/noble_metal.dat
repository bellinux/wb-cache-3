5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a <b>noble</b> <b>metal.</b> Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion resistant and chemically inert transition metal. It is a <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> {{and a member}} of the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as {{a chemical}} compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.|$|E
40|$|In the {{continuing}} effort {{to support the}} Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), the <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> issue is addressed. There is an additional concern {{about the amount of}} <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> expected to be present in the future batches that will be considered for vitrification in the DWPF. Several laboratory, as well as melter-scale, studies have been completed by various organizations (mainly PNNL, SRTC, and WVDP in the USA).

50|$|More {{inclusive}} lists {{include one}} or more of mercury (Hg), rhenium (Re) and copper (Cu) as <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> On the other hand, titanium (Ti), niobium (Nb), and tantalum (Ta) are not included as <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> although they are very resistant to corrosion.|$|R
5|$|Platinum {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{reactive}} metals. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a <b>noble</b> <b>metal.</b> Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, {{but it was not until}} Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very <b>noble</b> <b>metal.</b> Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E

40|$|There the {{metallic}} {{secondary raw material}} containing the <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> has been studied. The purpose is to develop the process of gold production and of silver production from the second raw material contaning the <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> The oxidation-reduction processes taking place on the gallium surface and on the surfaces of their alloys with the silver during the cathode polarization and during the anode polarization have been explored. The wettability of <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> in the alkali medium by the molten gallium has been studied. The interaction of molten gallium with the silver and with the gold in the alkali medium has been explored. The structure of gold gallides has been studied. The processing scheme of multicomponent wastes of electronic and electrical industries, which contain the <b>noble</b> <b>metals,</b> by the gallamation method (by the processing of molten gallium) has been suggeted. The experimental-industrial tests have been performed at the Schelkovo Works of Secondary <b>Noble</b> <b>Metals.</b> The application field is the metallurgy of noble metalsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|Significant {{quantities}} {{of the three}} light platinum group metals—ruthenium, rhodium and palladium—are formed as fission products in nuclear reactors. With escalating prices and increasing global demand, reactor-produced <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> are emerging as an alternative source. Various reports {{are available on the}} possibility of recovering fission <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> from spent nuclear fuel.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a <b>noble</b> <b>metal,</b> but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{does not}} react with air, even at red heat, and thus was {{considered}} by alchemists as a <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air {{to form the}} black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, {{with the exception of}} the notoriously reactive fluorine gas, with which it forms the difluoride. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.|$|E
5|$|William Hyde Wollaston {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of a new <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> in July 1802 in his lab-book and named it palladium in August of the same year. Wollaston purified enough of the material and offered it, without naming the discoverer, in a small shop in Soho in April 1803. After harsh criticism from Richard Chenevix that palladium is an alloy of platinum and mercury, Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of 20 British pounds for 20 grains of synthetic palladium alloy. Chenevix received the Copley Medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium. Wollaston published {{the discovery of}} rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium. He disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805.|$|E

5000|$|Arsenic, {{antimony}} and tellurium {{are considered}} to be metalloids and thus cannot be <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> Also chemists and metallurgists consider copper and bismuth to not be <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> because they easily oxidize due to the reaction [...] + 2 + 4e− ⇄ 4(aq) + 0.40 V which is possible in moist air.|$|R
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a <b>noble</b> <b>metal.</b> Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.|$|E
30|$|Currently, the {{combination}} of a trap with an oxidative catalyst is commonly adopted. This involves the deposition of <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> on carriers with a high surface area, such as zeolites or γ-alumina, or those with redox properties, like ceria (CeO 2) in pure or doped form[8, 9]. It is common knowledge that rare earth metals, like ceria, are less expensive than classic <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> and leave a lower transformation carbon footprint, which makes these materials more sustainable. Replacing <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> with rare earth ones, or lowering the content of the former, would be a remarkable result in economic and environmental terms.|$|R
50|$|For {{many reasons}} known and unknown, protein {{adsorption}} varies from material to material. Two {{of the biggest}} determining factors that have been observed are surface roughness and surface free energy. In the case of exposed electrodes, it is desirable to have the adsorbed protein layer as thin as possible to increase sensitivity and performance. <b>Noble</b> <b>metals</b> are an obvious choice for achieving biocompatibility; however, when acting as electrodes, some of these <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> will actually participate in the reaction, deteriorate, and trigger adverse effects via lost particles. The most (<b>noble</b> <b>metals)</b> are gold (Au), platinum (Pt), and iridium (Ir).|$|R

50|$|In chemistry, the <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> are metals {{that are}} {{resistant}} to corrosion and oxidation in moist air (unlike most base metals). The short list of chemically <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> (those elements upon which almost all chemists agree) comprises ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), and gold (Au).|$|R

The composite showed a modest hydrogen production performance.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} reason for removing sulfur from the naphtha streams within a petroleum refinery is that sulfur, even in extremely low concentrations, poisons the <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts (platinum and rhenium) in the catalytic reforming units that are subsequently used to upgrade the octane rating of the naphtha streams.|$|E
25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under ultra-high vacuum, or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the ultra-high vacuum is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy ion beam strikes the sample. Ultra-high vacuum solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, another thing that should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a <b>noble</b> <b>metal,</b> analysis should be successful. If the film thickness is too large, which is common in real world analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a <b>noble</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E
