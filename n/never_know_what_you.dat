With food and drink, you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are getting, but you can consult experts for advice before consuming anything that might be dangerous (313a–314c).|$|E

"I {{will not}} deny, kind master," [...] he said pleasantly, [...] "that you might cause me {{a vast amount}} of unpleasantness just now ... {{although}} of a truth, I do not perceive that you would benefit yourself overmuch thereby.

[...] A former colleague later recalled Douglass's brief stint in Washington as follows:"Lou Douglass was {{the representative of the}} Commissioner of Reclamation at the meetings of the Tripartite Agreement, but he decided early on after just a few months that the Washington maelstrom was not his cup of tea.

Then Angel and Bear were against every one, and Alda set them against Clem, and fancied he did against her, which was not true.

There is nothing visible out of which you may not get useful practice.|$|R
5000|$|The band began {{recording}} the album on January 3, 2013, almost exactly {{three years after}} they began {{recording the}}ir previous album Lawless Darkness, and took about four months to complete. The exact order of the songs was left open during the recording of the album. The band also decided to record in multiple studios rather than just one as they had done for previous albums because [...] "being in the studio for that long, working in various places, and traveling around {{like a bunch of}} fucking gypsies with equipment (laughs), it left its mark on the album." [...] Danielsson added that the recording process was [...] "emotionally very demanding and challenging", crediting this for [...] "that extra dimension of diversity and you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expect from it really. I think the whole recording process actually colored the album a lot." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 2014 {{press release}} announcing the album, Wilton {{described}} the band's {{attitude towards the}} album as: [...] "We’re taking the songs in the classic Queensrÿche direction but {{maybe a little more}} progressive and heavier at times. The thing is, you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really have until it’s complete." [...] Already before the release of their self-titled album in June 2013, La Torre said that Condition Hüman will probably contain several songs that are heavier and longer than on Queensrÿche, though stressing that [...] "melody is key". Several of the demos from the writing sessions for Queensrÿche are indeed heavier, according to Dutch metal magazine Aardschok co-founder [...] "Metal Mike" [...] van Rijswijk, who had heard seventeen demos in August 2012, and after listening to Queensrÿche remarked: [...] "many of the fast-paced 'Queen of the Reich'-like tracks didn't make the album", in favor of the more mid-tempo songs that would have fitted well on Operation: Mindcrime or Empire.|$|E

You were my teacher and my queen; I walked with you, I talked with you, I rode with you; I lived in your shadow; I saw with your eyes.

At night I lay awake and worshipped you; in my dreams I saw you, and you loved me; and you remember, when we told each other stories--you have not forgotten, dearest--that Princess Hawthorn that was still the heroine of mine: who was she? I was not bold enough to tell, but she was you! You, my virgin huntress, my Diana, my queen.|$|R

5000|$|Hacker meets Sir Humphrey and is {{at first}} more {{concerned}} with his plummeting opinion poll ratings. He wishes to be more relevant, but Sir Humphrey {{points out that the}} only topic occupying the nation at present is the lost dog on Salisbury Plain. The PM then turns to his [...] "security matter". Sir Humphrey readily admits that government security inquiries are primarily designed to kill press speculation, and in any case, he was certain of Sir John Halstead’s integrity. He is therefore unprepared for the truth, and still can’t quite believe it when Hacker enlightens him. He protests that he was a busy man at the time and couldn’t look into everything, as [...] "you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> might find". Nevertheless, Hacker tells him, he was either in collusion or incompetent. The PM is minded to send Sir Humphrey on gardening leave until the matter is fully investigated. However, Hacker confesses that he has no experience of such things and wishes to speak to Sir Humphrey’s predecessor, Sir Arnold Robinson, to ask his advice. He forbids Sir Humphrey to contact Sir Arnold beforehand, and the mandarin states that he [...] "wouldn’t dream of it".|$|E

60|$|L. My dear, {{it is the}} proverb of proverbs; Apollo's proverb, and the sun's--but do {{you think}} you can know {{yourself}} by looking INTO yourself? <b>Never.</b> <b>You</b> can <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are, only by looking OUT of yourself. Measure your own powers with those of others; compare your own interests with those of others; try to understand <b>what</b> <b>you</b> appear to them, as well as what they appear to you; and judge of yourselves, in all things, relatively and subordinately; not positively: starting always with a wholesome conviction of the probability that there is nothing particular about you. For instance, some of you perhaps think you can write poetry. Dwell on your own feelings; and doings:--and you will soon think yourselves Tenth Muses; but forget your own feeling; and try, instead, to understand a line or two of Chaucer or Dante: and you will soon begin to feel yourselves very foolish girls--which is much like the fact.|$|R
