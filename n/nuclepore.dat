50|$|A <b>nuclepore</b> filter (brand name <b>Nuclepore</b> from Whatman, part of GE Healthcare) {{is a kind}} of filter {{in which}} holes a few micrometres in size have been created in a plastic (e.g. polycarbonate) membrane. These filters are {{generally}} created by exposing the membrane to radiation that weakens the plastic and creates specific areas that can be removed by dousing the membrane in acid (or other chemicals). The technique and patent were developed by Robert L. Fleischer, P. Buford Price, and Robert M. Walker as an outgrowth of their research on radiation effects in solids, with a special focus on materials exposed to energetic particles in space. The technique allows for creating uniform holes of any desired diameter to allow even a virus to be filtered.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{advancement}} in instrumentation after the 1960s came the improvement of filters and there use for sampling aerosols. This came along with the invention and application of polycarbonate filters, also called <b>Nuclepore</b> filters or NPFs. [...] This development was important to the field especially to off-line methods, because to obtain a representative measurement and analysis of a sample, you must {{have the ability to}} collect, store, and transport sample without disturbing the physical and chemical state of the particles.|$|E
40|$|We report {{observations}} {{of the behavior of}} superfluid 4 He in two porous membranes, <b>Nuclepore</b> and Anopore. Using capacitive measurements, M. P. Lilly had observed hysteresis, return-point memory and avalanche behavior in <b>Nuclepore</b> [49] when superfluid 4 He in capillary condensed in its pores. Additionally, he found that the avalanches of draining pores were global on the substrate, and the pore-pore connections as well as the superfluid film enabled the avalanches. We have continued that work to characterize the statistics of the avalanches in <b>Nuclepore.</b> We have seen that the statistics of the avalanches in <b>Nuclepore</b> are dependent on temperature and rate of removal of 4 He from the sample cell. We have also observed two distinct regions of avalanche type in <b>Nuclepore,</b> which we propose is due to the pore-pore connections. We have observed power law behavior in the statistics of the avalanche size and measured the correlation of the avalanche events and sizes under various conditions. ^ We have also observed hysteresis, return-point memory and avalanche behavior in Anopore using the same type of capacitive measurement. Anopore differs from <b>Nuclepore</b> in that nominally it has no pore-pore connections. In Anopore, we observed only one type of avalanche draining, and exponential behavior in the statistics of the avalanches instead of power law tendencies. We also measured the correlation of the avalanche events and sizes, and compared our results to those for <b>Nuclepore.</b> ^ We performed simulations of draining on <b>Nuclepore,</b> artificially including and excluding third sound from our “avalanches”. We find that our results are similar to our laboratory measurements. We also performed a simple version of semi-local draining on Anopore, and saw some similarities to our measured results. ^ We conclude that the behavior and statistics of the avalanches in a porous material are good indications of whether one is looking at a substrate that is percolated (<b>Nuclepore)</b> or a substrate that has no internal connections (Anopore). ...|$|E
40|$|Polycarbonate <b>Nuclepore</b> {{filters are}} better than {{cellulose}} filters for the direct counting of bacteria because they have uniform pore size and a flat surface that retains all of the bacteria {{on top of the}} filter. Although cellulose filters also retain all of the bacteria, many are trapped inside the filter where they cannot be counted. Before use, the <b>Nuclepore</b> filters must be dyed with irgalan black to eliminate autofluorescence. Direct counts of bacteria in lake and ocean waters are twice as high with <b>Nuclepore</b> filters as with cellulose filters...|$|E
40|$|We report {{capacitive}} {{measurements of}} the hysteresis and avalanche properties of 4 He in <b>Nuclepore.</b> Hysteresis was measured on global loops and subloops for <b>Nuclepore</b> with 30 nm and 200 nm diameter pores. Subloops exhibit the property of return point memory, but subloops between the same chemical potential end points were not congruent. The failure of congruence showed that the Preisach model, in which the pores do not interact, does not describe this system. Modification of the Preisach model to allow for pore intersection within the membrane resulted in qualitative agreement with the data. Using a model for hystersis by Mason which included pore-pore interactions, we calculated the pore size distribution for <b>Nuclepore.</b> ^ Close examination of the primary desorption curve resulted in the observation of large groups of pores draining together. This was the first observation of avalanches in the draining of fluid from a porous material. The properties of the avalanches were documented for 200 nm and 30 nm pore diameter <b>Nuclepore.</b> Using two capacitors on the same <b>Nuclepore</b> substrate, we found that avalanche events were spatially extended involving a low density of pores. With a composite porous/nonporous sample we showed that pore coupling occurred via the superfluid 4 He film. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{matching}} {{relation between}} HPAM (partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide) polymer DQ 3500 and the pores of reservoir rock was investigated using <b>nuclepore</b> film filtration, core flooding, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The {{results indicated that}} when the polymer DQ 3500 solution passed through <b>nuclepore</b> films with different pore diameters, {{the figure of the}} filtration curves, the solution viscosity and concentration before and after filtration, and the size variation of polymer molecular clews differed. Sharp changes {{in the shape of the}} solution filtration curve, concentration and viscosity of the solution and size of the polymer molecular clews occurred at a <b>nuclepore</b> film pore diameter of 0. 6 - 0. 7 μm, where retention of the polymer molecules began to occur. Pores less than 0. 7 μm could be readily blocked by the polymer molecules, while pores larger than that showed good matching with the polymer DQ 3500 without blocking. For tests with conglomerate core, cores with a gas permeability of 136 × 10 - 3 μm 2 were readily blocked by the polymer molecules, while cores with a gas permeability of not less than 316 × 10 - 3 μm 2 were blocking-free. It may be concluded from this study that the polymer DQ 3500 has good matching only with large <b>nuclepore</b> film pores and large reservoir rock pores...|$|E

40|$|Bacteria {{were either}} heat fixed on {{microscope}} slides or filtered with 0. 2 micron-pore-size <b>Nuclepore</b> filters. The samples were stained with 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) for total staining and with polyvalent rabbit antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibodies for specific staining. By switching between two different optical filter packages in the microscope, only one sample {{was needed for}} determining both total and specific counts of bacteria. False-positive counts and other artifacts that occur with antibody staining were easily distinguished when individual fluorescent particles were checked for DAPI fluorescence.

40|$|The {{fractional}} penetrations of aerosols between 10 and 100 nm through <b>nuclepore</b> {{filters are}} measured for four different aerosols. <b>Nuclepore</b> filter pore diameters varied from 2 to 12 μm while superficial facial velocities ranged from 0. 8 to 6. 6 cm s− 1. Qualitatively, differences were observed between aerosols greater than 40 nm and the condensation aerosols with diameters less than 30 nm. For the smaller particles, the aerosols were widely distributed over the filter face while the larger aerosols were concentrated near the rims of the pore.

40|$|Coarse stage <b>Nuclepore</b> filters used in GENT aerosol {{sampling}} {{units were}} {{coated with a}} thin film of Apiezon L-type grease in order to minimise the loss of particles on the filters due to 'bounce off'. Originally Freon {{was used as the}} solvent to dissolve the Apiezon grease in the coating process. Because of the environmental impact, Freon was discontinued and replaced with Fluorinert. Apiezon grease did not dissolve freely in the Fluorinert and it was replaced by Fomblin grease in 1995. This increased production costs and coated <b>Nuclepore</b> coarse filters ceased production in 2004. Users were concerned that their stocks of coated <b>Nuclepore</b> filters were diminishing and as no alternative supply was available the feasibility of coating the coarse filters in house needed to be investigated. This report describes experiments conducted at ANSTO and the results obtained during the investigation of the coating process under laboratory conditions. Apiezon grease and Toluene were used in this process. Experiments were based on the procedure proposed by Prof P. Hopke and Dr A.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{migration}} of bovine blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in vitro on their phagocytic activity was studied. PMNs were examined before and after migration through various membranes for rosette formation with sensitized sheep erythrocytes to detect Fc receptors (FcRs), phagocytic activity mediated through FcRs with opsonized staphylococci (Smith strain), and phagocytic activity mediated through nonimmunological receptors with unopsonized staphylococci (strain 305). Migration of PMNs was observed from the upper to the lower compartment of the blind well chamber through Millipore and <b>Nuclepore</b> membranes; through Millipore, <b>Nuclepore,</b> and nylon membranes coated with collagen; and through collagen-coated Millipore, <b>Nuclepore,</b> and nylon membranes overlaid with MA- 104, BHK- 21, MDBK- 99, TB, or FBHE cells. Random migration of PMNs toward the plain medium (the same medium in {{the upper and lower}} compartments) through the membranes with and without a monolayer of cells increased the percentage of PMNs forming rosettes. In contrast, migration toward the medium containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP), or zymosan-activated serum (Act. serum) did not change the percentage of PMNs forming rosettes. The increased percentage of PMNs forming rosettes was associated with the enhanced phagocytosis of opsonized staphylococci (mediated by FcRs). In contrast, migration of PMNs toward LPS, FMLP, or Act. serum did not enhance phagocytosis mediated through FcRs. However, PMNs after migration toward LPS, FMLP, Act. serum, and plain medium enhanced phagocytosis of unopsonized staphylococci (mediated through the nonimmunological receptors) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Nuclepore</b> {{filters are}} {{capillary}} pore membrane filters {{with an array}} of microscopic cylindrical holes of uniform diameters. Their structure is suitable for particle collection and ensuing offline analyses, therefore they are being widely used for exposure assessment of engineered nanoparticles, ambient PM 2. 5, virus, bacteria, asbestos, etc., as well as in powder manufacturing industries. However, there exists a particle size range in which all the filtration capture mechanisms are not effective. This size is the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), which corresponds to the minimum efficiency (ME) of the filter. Both MPPS and ME are important parameters for a user to select an adequate <b>Nuclepore</b> filter and preferred operating conditions. For rapid estimation of the MPPS and ME, we derived their explicit expressions by simplifying the formulas for the impaction, diffusion and interception deposition and differentiating the combined efficiency with respect to the particle size. The comparison between the experimental data and the prediction from the explicit expressions shows the explicit expressions can provide MPPS {{for a wide range of}} filter properties (pore radius, porosity and length) and filtration conditions (particle density, face velocity and temperature). The ME can also be estimated satisfactorily when a simplified term of filter surface diffusion deposition is further considered. By the explicit expressions of MPPS and ME, a quick screening for selecting a <b>Nuclepore</b> filter with the proper properties and suitable filtration conditions can be easily achieved. From the theoretical point of view, the explicit expressions facilitate better understanding of the effects of filter properties and conditions on the filtration characteristic...|$|E

40|$|This work {{extends the}} study of helium films with the {{description}} of two experiments performed on different substrates. The primary experiment involves 4 He and 3 He- 4 He mixture films on a solid H 2 substrate. The secondary experiment {{is concerned with the}} behavior of mixture films on <b>Nuclepore.</b> ^ The substrate for the helium-on-hydrogen experiment was chosen for the weak binding potential for helium on hydrogen. Unlike most substrates, H 2 will support a superfluid 4 He film less dense than a single bulk-density atomic layer. In recent years, interesting effects have been observed for helium-on-hydrogen systems. ^ The H 2 experiment is presented with the results of quartz crystal microbalance measurements and attempted third sound measurements. The quartz crystal microbalance technique measures mass coupling and reveals several interesting features in monolayer and submonolayer helium films on H 2. Submonolayer superfluidity and possible phase separation of two-dimensional submonolayer 4 He films on solid H 2 is reported. 3 He– 4 He mixture films on the H 2 substrate reveal novel dependence of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature on 3 He coverage and an unexpected feature at lower temperature. ^ Third sound resonance and NMR measurements are reported for the <b>Nuclepore</b> experiment. The <b>Nuclepore</b> experiment is the continuation of a long-term study of multilayer 3 He- 4 He mixture films. NMR relaxation times, magnetization, and spin diffusion measurements are discussed over a range of temperatures and mixture film coverages. Third sound measurements taken at the same mixture film coverages reveal interesting structure as a function of temperature. Third sound frequency data at temperatures near 150 mK and at 3 He coverages greater than one atomic layer exhibit a local maximum that responds to changes in both 3 He and 4 He coverage. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{inertial}} {{separation of}} cylindrical particles from laminar flows was studied theoretically and experimentally. The calculational method introduced {{was based on}} the simultaneous solution of the equations of particle translation and rotation, in which the expression for the operating fluid-dynamic force and torque was obtained from slender body theory. The collecting obstacles chosen for the exemplification of the method were a long circular cylinder and a <b>nuclepore</b> hole. The necessary undisturbed flow fields in the vicinity of these obstacles were derived by a numerical solution of the full Navier-Stokes equation.

As compared with multisatisfactory results obtained with explants transfered in submerged culture, others cultured on <b>Nuclepore</b> membranes following the Trowell technique exhibited growth and pattern formation performances which could be correlated with the CR length of their donor embryos. According to the case, their distal segment appeared hypotrophic and strongly necrotic, triangular shaped with 2 or 3 converging digital rays, four toed shaped with 3 or 4 digital rays, and pentadactylous. Insufficient distal morphogenesis observed in younger limb buds {{could be related to}} selective cell death in the A. E. R. and subridge mesoderm, as well as to early dilation of the marginal vein. Prospective area of digit I proved to be particularly sensitive to culture conditions. However, observations made in explants excised from potentially polydactylous embryos showed that the X-linked polydactyly (Xpl) phenotype can be expressed in vitro.
