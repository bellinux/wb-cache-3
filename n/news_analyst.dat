40|$|ALMOST all feminist {{political}} activists believe that women's {{support for the}} Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) {{played a major role}} in producing the gender gap in the 1980 presidential election. This view was prompted by a virtual consensus among <b>news</b> <b>analysts</b> after the election, and bolstered by problematic data from the political science profession. This paper argues that the gender differences in 1980 presidential voting were not due to attitudes toward the ERA. It then asks why the "ERA explanation " of the gender gap persisted, despite much evidence against it. The analysis relies primarily on data from the CBS News/New York Times 1980 Election Day Survey (hereafter called the 1980 exit poll). Abstract Attitudes toward the Equal Rights Amendment were not an important factor in the emergence of the "gender gap " in the 1980 presidential election.

We find that the benefit of analyst access to an economist is concentrated in firms that are high in cyclicality relative to their industry, high in cyclicality in general, and that are smaller in size. In addition, analysts who are exposed to more accurate or award winning in-house macroeconomists benefit more.
