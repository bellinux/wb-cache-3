5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had <b>no</b> <b>real</b> interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak.

5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933.

In his physical prime but with <b>no</b> <b>real</b> prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland since all political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, <b>no</b> <b>real</b> opposition candidates were permitted to run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E
5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had <b>no</b> <b>real</b> loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E

They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois.

As a result, the priests had <b>no</b> <b>real</b> idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study.
