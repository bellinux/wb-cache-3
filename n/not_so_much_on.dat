They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E

Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> the field of play as off it".|$|E

25|$|Canadian {{religious}} historian,Barrie Wilson {{has proposed}} a different paradigm for understanding the relationship of Paul to Jesus, the Jesus Movement led by Jesus' brother James and Judaism. In How Jesus Became Christian, Wilson suggests that Paul's religion differed from that of Jesus in terms of origins, teachings and practices. Paul's was a new religion. His Christ Movement became linked to Jesus, James' Jesus Movement and Judaism in general through the creative historical fiction of the Book of Acts. In Wilson's view, Paul's non-Torah religion supplanted that of Jesus and took the movement well outside the Jewish orbit, focusing <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> a Jewish Messiah or {{the teachings of the}} historical Jesus but on the worship of a dying-rising savior God-human figure.|$|E
25|$|A red-light {{perspective}} of administrative law embodies deep-rooted suspicion of governmental {{power and a}} desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of individuals. This envisions the courts being locked in an adversarial or combative relationship with the Executive and functioning as a check on administrative power. Where a green-light perspective is concerned, the focus is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> actively resisting administrative bodies as a form of negative control (as in the red-light perspective), but instead raising areas where public bodies may improve their various administrative procedures. This approach is derived from the utilitarian tradition, and the priority in achieving the greatest good for the greatest number is to encourage the contribution of the state through means of egalitarian and ameliorative social reform so as to deliver communitarian goals. Thus, the red-light perspective is more conservative and control-oriented, while the green-light perspective is more liberal or socialist in orientation and facilitative in nature.|$|E
25|$|For a {{brief period}} in mid-1996 a {{vigorous}} debate was ignited in Mexico when it emerged that Guillermo Schulenburg, who {{at that time was}} 80 years of age, did not believe that Juan Diego was a historical person or (which follows from it) that it is his mantle which is conserved and venerated at the Basilica. That debate, however, was focused <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> the weight to be accorded to the historical sources which attest to Juan Diego's existence as on the propriety of Abbot Schulenburg retaining an official position which – so it was objected – his advanced age, allegedly extravagant life-style and heterodox views disqualified him from holding. Abbot Schulenburg's resignation (announced on September 6, 1996) terminated that debate. The scandal, however, re-erupted in January 2002 when the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli published in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale a confidential letter dated December 4, 2001 which Schulenburg (among others) had sent to Cardinal Sodano, the then Secretary of State at the Vatican, reprising reservations over the historicity of Juan Diego.|$|E

All that was to come of life was theirs. [...] Their hopes were of air, their desires of fire." [...] In many beautiful poetic passages, [...] "the feelings of youth and of the spring are [...] blended together like the breath of opening flowers." [...] Assessing the character of the play as a whole, he states: [...] "This play presents a beautiful coup-d'oeil of the progress of human life.

500|$|Kevin Courtney {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The Irish Times, and observed: [...] "For fans of Van Morrison's music, No Surrender might seem somewhat blasphemous, focusing <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> Van the artist, but on Van the not-very-nice man. But Rogan also pays tribute to Morrison's pure, untainted artistry, and details the development – and subsequent decline – of Morrison's muse over the past 40 years or so. For the serious Van-ologist, Rogan's painstaking research yields an abundance of detail about Morrison's early years". Graeme Green of the Daily Express noted that Rogan [...] "concentrates far more on Van the man than it does on his music, with the singer largely portrayed as difficult, selfish and aloof". He noted that Morrison would turn 60 the year the book was published, and commented [...] "When the singer celebrates his landmark birthday this year, it's a safe bet Rogan's name won't be on the invite list." ...|$|E
500|$|Poe had a keen {{interest}} in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing" [...] in Graham's Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] incorporating ciphers as {{an essential part of the}} story. Poe's success with cryptography relied <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.|$|E

[...] He notes that some of the graduates of the est training [...] "treat him [...] with the love and awe normally associated with that of disciples for spiritual teachers".

500|$|The {{theme of}} women and death is evident in stories as early as [...] "Indian Camp". The theme of death {{permeates}} Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a [...] "badly scarred and nervous young man". Hemingway sets the events in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] that shape the Adams persona. Young believes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] holds the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with {{a representation of the}} truth inherent in existentialism: if [...] "nothingness" [...] is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an [...] "authentic life", and the [...] "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".|$|E
