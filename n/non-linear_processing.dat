40|$|The {{spurious}} {{increase in}} coherence of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals between distant electrode points {{has long been}} understood {{to be due to}} volume conduction of the EEG signal. Reducing the volume conduction components of EEG recordings in pre-processing attenuates this. However, the effect of volume conduction on <b>non-linear</b> signal <b>processing</b> of EEG signals is yet to be fully described. This pilot study aimed to investigate the impact of volume conduction on results calculated with a distance based, bivariate form of Lempel-Ziv Complexity (dLZC) by analyzing EEG signals from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy age-matched controls with and without pre-processing with Current Source Density (CSD) transformation. Spurious statistically significant differences between AD patients and control's EEG signals seen without CSD pre-processing were not seen with CSD volume conduction mitigation. There was, however, overlap in the region of electrodes which were seen to hold this statistically significant information. These results show that, while previously published findings are still valid, volume conduction mitigation is required to ensure <b>non-linear</b> signal <b>processing</b> methods identify changes in signals only due to the purely local signal alone...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the issue of energy {{efficiency}} in wireless data networks through a game theoretic approach. The case considered is that in which each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in which linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first, and, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback multiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be obtained through both <b>non-linear</b> <b>processing</b> and spreading code optimization; in particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of <b>non-linear</b> <b>processing.</b> In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are shown to outperform competing alternatives.

40|$|Many {{objective}} {{measures have}} been reported to predict speech intelligibility in noise, most of which were designed and evaluated with English speech corpora. Given the different perceptual cues used by native listeners of different languages, examining whether there is any language effect when the same objective measure is used to predict speech intelligibility in different languages is of great interest, particularly when <b>non-linear</b> noise-reduction <b>processing</b> is involved. In the present study, an extensive evaluation is taken of objective measures for speech intelligibility prediction of noisy speech processed by noise-reduction algorithms in Chinese, Japanese, and English. Of all the objective measures tested, the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure produced the most accurate results in speech intelligibility prediction for Chinese, while the normalized covariance metric (NCM) and middle-level coherence speech intelligibility index (CSII_m) incorporating the signal-dependent band-importance functions (BIFs) produced the most accurate results for Japanese and English, respectively. The objective measures that performed best in predicting the effect of <b>non-linear</b> noise-reduction <b>processing</b> in speech intelligibility were found to be the BIF-modified NCM measure for Chinese, the STOI measure for Japanese, and the BIF-modified CSII_m measure for English.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{applicability}} of neural networks to <b>non-linear</b> image <b>processing</b> problems is studied. As an example, the Kuwahara filtering for edge-preserving smoothing was chosen. This filter is interesting due to its non-linear nature and natural modularity. A number of modular networks were constructed and trained, incorporating prior knowledge in various degrees and their performance was compared to standard feed-forward neural networks (MLPs). Based on results obtained in these experiments, it is shown that several key factors influence neural network behaviour {{in this kind of}} task. First, it is demonstrated that the mean squared error criterion used in neural network training is not representative for the problem. To be able to discern performance differences better, a new error measure for edge-preserving smoothing operations is proposed. Secondly, using this measure, it is shown that modular networks perform better than standard feed-forward networks. The latter type often ends up in linear approximations to the filter. Finally, inspection of the modular networks shows that, although analysis is difficult due to their non-linearity, one can draw some conclusions regarding the effect of design and training choices. The main conclusion is that neural networks can be applied to <b>non-linear</b> image <b>processing</b> problems, provided that careful attention is paid to network architecture, training set sampling and parameter choice. Only if prior knowledge is used in constructing the networks and sampling the datasets can one expect to obtain a well performing neural network filter.
