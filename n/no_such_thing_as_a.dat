25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation, all Post-Soviet {{states that}} buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies. Lamy stated {{that it would have}} been easier to resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, he added that the problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect that there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
25|$|Stilwell’s home, {{built in}} 1933–1934 on Carmel Point, Carmel, California, remains a private home. A number of streets, buildings, and areas {{across the country}} have been named for Stilwell over the years, {{including}} Joseph Stilwell Middle School in Jacksonville, Florida. The Soldiers’ Club he envisioned in 1940 (a time when there was <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> soldiers’ club in the Army) was completed in 1943 at Fort Ord on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay. Many years later the building was renamed “Stilwell Hall” in his honor, but because of the erosion of the bluffs over the decades, the building was taken down in 2003. Stilwell's former residence in Chongqing – a city along the Yangtze River to which Chiang's government retreated after being forced from Nanjing by Japanese troops – has now been converted to the General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum in his honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} some {{languages}} {{are superior to}} others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century. American linguist William Dwight Whitney, for example, actively strove to eradicate Native American languages, arguing that their speakers were savages and {{would be better off}} learning English and adopting a civilized way of life. The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was Franz Boas. While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the Inuit people and decided to become an ethnographer. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he {{was among the first to}} require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as myths and legends in the original language.|$|E

25|$|Check hook : A check hook is {{employed}} to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part {{consists of a}} regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking {{it has been said}} that there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. Floyd Mayweather, Jr. employed the use of a check hook against Ricky Hatton, which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.|$|E
25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E
