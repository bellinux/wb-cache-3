5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or <b>nuclear</b> <b>winter</b> effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E

40|$|Measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory have {{revealed}} strong {{modification of the}} jet structure in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which {{can be attributed to}} the interaction of hard scattered partons with the hot and dense QCD matter. The study of heavy-quark (charm and bottom) production in such collisions provides key tests of parton energy-loss models and, thus, yields profound insight into the properties of the produced matter. The high-pT yield of heavy-flavor decay electrons exhibits an unexpected large suppression. Since those single electrons have contributions from charm and bottom decays an experimental method is needed to investigate them separately. Heavy-flavor particle correlations provide information about the underlying production mechanism. In this contribution, a review on recent measurements on azimuthal correlations of single electrons and open charmed mesons at RHIC and perspectives of such measurements at the CERN-Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. Moreover, it has been shown that next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD processes, such as gluon splitting, become important at LHC energies. It will be demonstrated how this contribution can be determined through the measurement of the charm content in jets.

40|$|Description of parton {{interaction}} with the hot and dense nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions at high energies is a complex task, which requires a detailed knowledge of jet production in p+p and d+Au collisions. Measurements in these collision systems are therefore essential to disentangle initial state nuclear effects from cold nuclear matter effects, medium-induced k_T broadening and jet quenching. To obtain complete description of the p+p (d+Au) collision {{it is also important}} to study particle production in the underlying event. The measured properties of underlying event can be used to tune the QCD based Monte-Carlo models. In this paper some of the recent results on jet and underlying event properties in p+p and d+Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 200 GeV measured by the STAR experiment are presented. In particular, the preliminary results on charged and strange particle fragmentation functions in p+p collisions are discussed and confronted with PYTHIA simulations. Next, the measurement of inclusive jet spectrum and di-jet correlations in d+Au collisions is presented and compared with the measurements in p+p collisions to estimate the size of cold nuclear matter effects. Finally, the study of underlying event properties in p+p collisions is shown and compared to PYTHIA simulation.

50|$|In November 2006, in {{the midst}} of accusations {{concerning}} Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan's equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of LeTourneau University presented two papers at the American <b>Nuclear</b> Society <b>Winter</b> Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, deuterated benzene, tetrachloroethylene and uranyl nitrate. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of neutron detectors. They claimed a liquid scintillation detector measured neutron levels at 8 standard deviations above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated control liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid. William M. Bugg, emeritus physics professor at the University of Tennessee also traveled to Taleyarkhan's lab to repeat the experiment with his equipment. He also reported neutron emission, using plastic neutron detectors. Taleyarkhan claimed these visits counted as independent replications by experts, but Forringer later recognized that he was not an expert, and Bugg later said that Taleyarkhan performed the experiments and he had only watched.|$|R
40|$|The {{tufted titmouse}} (Baeolophus bicolor, TUTI) is a <b>nuclear</b> species in <b>winter</b> {{foraging}} flocks whose antipredator calls {{are used to}} manage predation risk by diverse heterospecifics. We hypothesized that satellite species in mixed flocks follow TUTI (not vice versa), thereby defining the role of TUTI as a “passive” nuclear species. We followed 20 winter mixed-species flocks in North-Central Florida and assessed angular-angular correlations between overall flock, TUTI, and satellite species movement directions. We observed significant correlations between overall flock movement directions and those of TUTI, confirming our central prediction. Within flocks, however, fine-scale movement directions of satellite species were often more highly correlated {{with those of other}} satellites than with TUTI movements. We conclude that TUTI are passive nuclear species whose movements define flock paths, but within flocks, TUTI movements may have less influence on satellite movements than do other factors...|$|R
40|$|The Lorentz {{contraction}} of ultrarelativistic nuclei entails a spatial overlap and fusion (recombination, saturation) of partons belonging to different nucleons {{at the same}} impact parameter. In these lectures we present a consistent description of the fusion of partons in terms of nuclear attenuation of color dipole states of the photon and collective Weizsäcker-Williams (WW) gluon structure function of a nucleus. The point that all observables for DIS off nuclei are uniquely calculable {{in terms of the}} nuclear WW glue amounts to a new form of factorization in the saturation regime. We start with the theory of multichannel propagation of color dipoles in a nuclear medium including the color-singlet to color-octet to color-octet transitions. We show how the Glauber-Gribov formulas are recovered from the multichannel formalism. Then we derive the two-plateau momentum distribution of final state (FS) quarks produced in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclei in the saturation regime. Then we comment on the signatures of saturation in exclusive diffractive DIS. A large body of these lectures is on the recent theory of jet-jet inclusive cross sections. We show that for hard dijets the decorrelation momentum is of the order of the nuclear saturation momentum Q_A. For minijets with the transverse momentum below the saturation scale we predict a complete disappearance of the azimuthal jet-jet correlation. We conclude with comment on a possible relevance of the decorrelation of jets to the experimental data from the STAR-RHIC Collaboration. Comment: The notes of lectures presented by N. N.

40|$|Overview Fast {{reactors}} {{were evaluated}} {{to enable the}} transmutation of transuranic isotopes generated by nuclear energy systems. The motivation for this was that TRU isotopes have high radiotoxicity and relatively long half-lives, making them unattractive for disposal in a long-term geologic repository. Fast reactors provide an efficient means to utilize the energy content of the TRUs while destroying them. An enabling technology that requires research and development is the fabrication metallic fuel containing TRU isotopes using powder metallurgy methods. This project focused upon developing a powder metallurgical fabrication method to produce U-Zr-transuranic (TRU) alloys at relatively low processing temperatures (500 ºC to 600 ºC) using either hot extrusion or alpha-phase sintering for charecterization. Researchers quantified the fundamental aspects of both processing methods using surrogate metals to simulate the TRU elements. The process produced novel solutions {{to some of the}} issues relating to metallic fuels, such as fuel-cladding chemical interactions, fuel swelling, volatility losses during casting, and casting mold material losses.
