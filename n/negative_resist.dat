40|$|The {{performance}} {{of positive and}} <b>negative</b> tone <b>resists</b> on the critical levels of a 0. 35 mum CMOS process has been evaluated. The use of a darkfield reticle suppresses reflections in lens and resist. Therefore reflection problems are reduced for poly gate patterning with a <b>negative</b> tone <b>resist.</b> If a positive resist is used it should be combined with a bottom ARC. For the contact hole level a positive tone resist is required. Good performance, including batch uniformity is obtained for 0. 5 mum holes.

50|$|Negative {{photoresists}} {{are composed}} of a poly(cis-isoprene) matrix, xylene solvent, and bis-arylazide as the photoactive compound. Negative photoresists react to light by polymerizing. The unexposed portions can be removed by using a developer solution. <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> has better adhesion and is great for features greater than 2 µm in size.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{photoresists}} {{are composed}} of a novolac resin, ethyl lactate solvent, and Diazonaphthaquinone (DQ) as the photoactive compound. [...] Positive photoresist reacts with light to cause the polymer to break down and become soluble in a developer solution. Positive resist has better resistance to etchant than negative photoresist. Positive resists are better for producing small feature size, but does not adhere to silicon wafers as well as <b>negative</b> <b>resist.</b> When making small features {{it is critical to}} have good adhesion.|$|E
50|$|Photoresists are coatings, or oligomers, {{that are}} {{deposited}} on a surface and {{are designed to}} change properties upon irradiation of light. These changes either polymerize the liquid oligomers into insoluble cross-linked network polymers or decompose the already solid polymers into liquid products. Polymers that form networks during photopolymerization {{are referred to as}} <b>negative</b> <b>resist.</b> Conversely, polymers that decompose during photopolymerization are referred to as positive resists. Both positive and negative resists have found many applications including the design and production of micro fabicated chips. The ability to pattern the resist using a focused light source has driven the field of photolithography.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{mechanisms}} for producing structures in resist materials is, in general, bond scissioning in positive resists such as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), or cross-linking in <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> such as SU-8. In positive resists the regions damaged by protons are removed by chemical development to produce structures, whereas in <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> the development procedures remove the undamaged resist leaving the cross-linked structures behind. In e-beam writing, {{the primary and}} secondary electrons create the scissioning or cross-linking, whereas in p-beam writing the damage is caused by short range proton-induced secondary electrons. The proton fluence required for exposure varies from 30-150 nCmm−2 depending on the resist material, and is around 80-100 times less than that required by e-beam writing. Remark: The unit of the fluence in proton beam writing is usually given in [...] "charge/area". It can be converted into [...] "particles/area" [...] by dividing [...] "charge/area" [...] by the charge of a proton, Q = 1,602·10−19C.|$|R
5000|$|The {{processing}} of SU-8 {{is similar to}} other <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> with particular attention on {{the control of the}} temperature in the baking steps. The baking times depend on the SU-8 layer thickness; the thicker the layer, the longer the baking time. The temperature is controlled during the baking in order to reduce stress formation in the thick layer (leading to cracks) as the solvent evaporates.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} blend <b>resists</b> in {{cross-linking}} <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> is presented, and chloromethylstyrene-based bl nd re-sists are newly proposed {{on the basis}} of reaction mechanism. In chloromethylstyrene-based bl nd resists, almost the same sensitivity mprovement as that for copolymer resists is obtained. Furthermore, the ~ value does not depend on the dispersivity of blend systems, but depends on the dispersivity of the higher molecular weight polymer with stronger electron donating ring-substituents. Based on this concept, a new class of blend resist, poly(p-methoxystyrene) (Mw = 1. 1 • 105, Mw/Mn = 1. 2) - poly(p-chloromethylstyrene) (Mw = 2. 0 • 104, Mw/Mn = 1. 3) [monomer unit ratio is 1 : 1] is demonstrated as a highly sensitive chloromethylstyrene-based resist. A high 7 value is obtained in spite of the broad dispersivity of the system, and submicron patterns are resolved at 3 ~C/cm'-'. Chloromethylstyrene-based copolymer <b>negative</b> <b>resists,</b> such as chloromethylated polystyrene (CMS) (1) and chlo-rinated poly(vinyltoluene) (CPMS) (2), are widely used in semiconductor manufacturing, asthey have high dry etch resistance, as well as high resolution and high sensitivity.

50|$|As mentioned, {{negative}} resists are photopolymers {{that become}} insoluble upon exposure to radiation. They {{have found a}} variety of commercial applications. Especially {{in the area of}} designing and printing small chips for electronics. A characteristic found in most negative tone resists is the presence of multifunctional branches on the polymers used. Radiation of the polymers in the presence of an intiator results in the formation of chemically resistant network polymer. A common functional group used in <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> is epoxy functional groups. An example of a widely used polymer of this class is SU-8.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{nanofabrication}} process using novel electron beam resists. First, in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, the nanofabrication process using grafted polymer monolayer brush as e-beam resist was examined. Then, in Chapter 5, characteristics {{of the mixture of}} polystyrene (PS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as <b>negative</b> tone e-beam <b>resist</b> with high dry etch resistance were studied. The main advantage of grafted polymer brush as electron beam is that it is applicable on non-flat or irregular surfaces. Although nanofabrication on non-flat surfaces has a lot of applications such as nanofabrication on AFM tips and optical fibers, there is no versatile method for nanofabrication on non-flat surfaces. In this thesis, nanofabrication on non-flat surfaces of an AFM cantilever was demonstrated using grafted polymer brush. Grafted polymer brush includes grafted poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) brush and grafted PS brush; PMMA brush was used as <b>negative</b> tone e-beam <b>resist,</b> and PS monolayer brush was used as both positive and <b>negative</b> tone e-beam <b>resist</b> in this study. When PMMA brush and PS brush are used as <b>negative</b> tone <b>resist,</b> a development method plays an important role. Although solvent development is the most common development method to develop thick PMMA film or PS film as <b>negative</b> tone <b>resist,</b> solvent does not work as a developer for PMMA brush and PS brush. Instead, thermal treatment was used to develop monolayer PMMA brush or PS brush to achieve negative tone behavior. Since cross-linked PMMA and PS has higher thermal stability than uncross-linked ones, only unexposed polymer was vaporized at proper temperature. Thus, the polymer brush works as <b>negative</b> tone <b>resist.</b> Positive tone behavior of PS brush was achieved by changing the development method. When PS is exposed to electron beam, it loses the resistance to wet etch. Therefore, when the PS brush was grafted on an intermediate Al mask layer and developed by diluted HF solution, Al layer underneath the exposed PS brush was etched directly by HF. Since Al layer underneath unexposed PS was protected from wet etch, the resulting patterns on the Al mask layer showed negative tone behavior. In Chapter 5, the mixture of PS and PDMS was studied as <b>negative</b> tone e-beam <b>resist</b> with high dry etch resistance. High dry etch resistance {{is one of the most}} important characteristics of e-beam resist because resist with high resistance can be used as dry etch mask, and the patterns on the resist can be transferred to the substrate using direct dry etch. Recently, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) has been vigorously studied as <b>negative</b> tone <b>resist</b> with high dry etch resistance and high resolution. However, it has several drawbacks: it is very expensive, the shelf life is very short, and the processes should be done very quickly to obtain reproducible results. Here, it was demonstrated that PS that contains PDMS can be used as <b>negative</b> tone e-beam <b>resist</b> with high dry etch resistance. It was confirmed that by adding PDMS into PS, the resistance to the dry etch dramatically increased, but the sensitivity and contrast remained nearly the same. Thus, PS-PDMS can be a low-cost replacement of HSQ <b>resist</b> when <b>negative</b> tone e-beam <b>resist</b> with high dry etch resistance is required...|$|R
