5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
25|$|Quite often, {{textbook}} {{problems will}} treat the population standard deviation {{as if it}} were known and thereby avoid the need to use the Student's t-distribution. These problems are generally of two kinds: (1) those in which the sample size is so large that one may treat a data-based estimate of the variance {{as if it were}} certain, and (2) those that illustrate mathematical reasoning, in which the problem of estimating the standard deviation is temporarily ignored because that is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the author or instructor is then explaining.|$|E
25|$|Milky Way DHDs {{have sparked}} {{numerous}} discussions as {{the design and}} operation of the device has resulted in contradiction. In the Milky Way, the Dial Home Device contains 38 of the 39 symbols on the Stargate, meaning {{there is always a}} missing glyph on each DHD. This missing glyph, however, is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin for the planet. This means that only certain addresses can be reached from specific positions in the galaxy safely. The only way to intervene and reach all destinations in the Milky Way from a specific stargate, is to manually dial the gate using an external power source. Another method for reaching any stargate is to use a Dialing computer like Stargate Command- however, this could lead to unforeseen side effects such as wormholes traveling through stars or solar flares. DHDs are designed to prevent these incidents from taking place by only allowing access to certain stargates from specific locations in the galaxy.|$|E

500|$|In 1957 Angelou {{appeared}} in an off-Broadway revue that inspired her first film, Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. [...] Also in 1957, the album Miss Calypso was completed and released; it was reissued as a CD in 1995. [...] According to reviewer Hilton Als, Angelou sang and performed calypso because she [...] "had followed {{the fashion of}} the time", and not to develop as an artist. Als states about Miss Calypso: [...] "But {{it was clear that}} the album itself was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> Developing her artistry was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> Fame, not art, was her spur..." [...] In 1958, Angelou met blues singer Billie Holiday, who after walking out during one of Angelou's calypso performances, told her, [...] "You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing".|$|E

The characters—especially Edgar, Georg, and Kurt—are quite deliberately not developed in great detail, as noted by critics. [...] "Characterization is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> here. Müller is primarily a poet", and this poetic interest likewise is said to explain the lack of chapter organization and of transitional phrases. Only two of the six main characters who suffer oppression survive {{at the end of}} the book: Lola dies by hanging, Georg commits suicide after fleeing to Germany, Kurt is found hanged, and Tereza, the narrator's friend who betrays her to the Securitate, dies of cancer.|$|E

500|$|A bid of £1m {{offered by}} Damien Hirst {{for the entire}} {{collection}} had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying [...] "You can see he {{knew very little about}} anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher" [...] He also showed appreciation for the displays: [...] "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket." [...] About the auction, Hirst said, [...] "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fringe's own {{position}} on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book Sore Throats & Overdrafts, [...] "No-one can say what the quality will be like overall.

Some venues do influence or decide on the content of their programme, such as the Traverse and Aurora Nova, who used to run their own venue but are now just a production group.|$|E
2500|$|According to Morris, Arab leaders, such as Emir Abdullah of Transjordan and Nuri as-Said of Iraq, {{supported}} {{the idea of}} a population transfer. However, while Ben-Gurion was in favor of the Peel plan, he and other Zionist leaders considered it important that it be publicized as a British plan and not a Zionist plan. To this end, Morris quotes Moshe Sharett, director of the Jewish Agency's Political Department, who said (during a meeting of the Jewish Agency Executive on 7 May 1944) to consider the British Labour Party Executive's resolution supporting transfer: [...] "Transfer could be the crowning achievements, the final stage in the development of [...] policy, but certainly <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of departure.

You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you."

2500|$|The comic series Predator and Aliens vs Predator: Three World War {{introduce}} a clan of Predators {{referred to as}} [...] "Killers", who are enemies of mainstream Predators (here referred to as [...] "Hunters") because of their tradition of training Aliens as attack animals rather than hunting them, {{as well as their}} desire for killing as opposed to honorable hunting. The character Machiko Noguchi notes in issue #1 of Three World War that [...] "You have to understand the mindset of the Hunters, and the honor they place on facing a worthy opponent on an equal footing... a kill is the end result, but it's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of a hunt.... For the 'Killers,' that wasn't the case. They were all about the killing." [...] They are first seen in the 2009 Predator series, where a number interfere in an East African civil war, coming into conflict with both humans and their Hunter counterparts. By the time of Three World War the Killers are assumed to have been wiped out by the Hunters, but some survive and begin attacking human colonies, forcing Noguchi to forge an alliance between humans and the Hunters {{in order to deal with}} them.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ [...] "a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment." [...] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the most violent film [...] ha ever seen" [...] as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying [...] "What Gibson has provided for me, {{for the first time}} in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it." [...] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was [...] "the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie [...] "too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 14, 1939, Imperial Japanese Army {{forces of}} the Japanese Northern China Area Army {{surrounded}} and blockaded the foreign concessions over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over four Chinese who had assassinated a Japanese collaborator and taken refuge within the British concession. Anyone wishing to leave or enter the concession was publicly stripsearched by Japanese soldiers while food and fuel were not permitted to enter the concession. To cut the concession off, the Japanese Army built an electrified wire fence around it. The Japanese government declared {{the issue of the}} accused killers was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the blockade and that handing over the four would not end the blockade. A Japanese spokesmen stated: [...] "The arrow is already off the bow and therefore the question cannot be settled by the mere transfer of the four suspect assassins". The Japanese demanded the British government to turn over all silver reserves belonging to the Chinese government within British banks to them, forbid all anti-Japanese radio broadcasts from anywhere in the British Empire, ban school textbooks that the Japanese government considered offensive, and end the issuing of fapi currency. The real aim of the Japanese was not the handing over of the assassins but the end of British financial support of China. On 16 June 1939, the British Foreign Office in a press statement stated that the acceptance of the Japanese demands would [...] "...mean the abandonment under the threats of force of the policy His Majesty's Government has pursued in the past, which is {{the same as that of}} the other Great Powers with interests in the Far East." [...] On 20 June 1939, Lord Halifax told the House of Lords that the Japanese had failed to produce any evidence independent of the confessions gained by torture, and Britain would not hand over the four accused assassins until such evidence emerged.|$|E
