40|$|International audienceFor {{manufacturers}} and importers that generally have {{to comply with}} a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals for their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great expectancy. The Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] concerning the placing on the market and the use of pyrotechnic articles could fulfil those dealing with automotive occupant restraint systems (mainly airbags and seat belts pretensioners). By introducing harmonised Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) this new Directive offers the possibilities to replace the <b>National</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> concerned by a single legal framework throughout the European Union (EU) for these pyrotechnic articles. Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody by introducing the CE marking and certification procedure, its substitution and application in replacement of the current National regulatory frameworks may create difficulties at the beginning. In this paper we present the different parts of the Directive specifically these concerning pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety and how to comply with it. As Notified Body and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and pyrotechnic devices. In order to ease the understanding of the CE marking and certification procedure for automotive pyrotechnic articles, we suggest and give examples of known test procedures to cope with the Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUp to now {{the common}} {{material}} used for flexible plug joints of bridges {{has been based}} on bituminous mixtures consisting of aggregates and elastomeric-modified binders. All existing national regulations and also the European Guideline for Expansion Joints ETAG 032 are restricting flexible plug joints to these traditional bituminous mixtures. All existing asphaltic mixtures are susceptible for plastic deformations at higher temperatures including rutting whereas they cause significant reaction forces at low temperatures. These properties limit the application of the traditional joints to areas with moderate climate. In practice asphaltic plug expansion joints also often fail in the intersection between adjacent pavement and joint, causing cracks and leakages. The new expansion joint system shows essential improvements in the intersection pavement/joint by mechanical means and uses a new material based on polyurethane, which does not show negative temperature affine properties and can be processed in cold condition. The new flexible plug joint system also enables new applications, both for a wider climatic range and more complicated geometries. Furthermore the new flexible plug joint allows for larger movements up to more than 100 mm and addresses a longer design working life. As the new design is not covered by existing standards and verification methods in the first phase a comprehensive research had to executed after consultation with leading European experts from Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The paper covers reports on material and system tests executed during <b>national</b> and European <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> at several European testing institutes and shows examples of installation...|$|R

30|$|The table {{shows that}} in the sector of railway construction, the public display of project {{documents}} is as rare as in procedures according to the Federal Immission Control Act. In road construction, public participation differs from federal state to federal state. In the state of Saxony, 216 public planning permission procedures and 205 planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> took place between 1990 and 2002.15 In the sector of road construction in Rhineland-Palatinate, there were 295 planning permission procedures and only 28 administration-internal planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> between 1994 and 2001 (Ahlborn 2006 : 303). In Thuringia, however, the proportion of planning permission <b>procedures</b> to planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> between 1992 and 2000 was 123 – 381. Generally, there is the tendency that in the Eastern states more road construction projects are approved within the administration only than in the Western states.|$|R

30|$|Formalised public {{participation}} in project <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> is rarely addressed in technology assessment. Empirical data about {{public participation}} processes {{are taken into}} account even more rarely. This article explores the practice of public participation in infrastructure projects in the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of empirical data from the period of 1990 to 2010. The author compares the empirical data about participation processes with the targets of the public participation and asks for the reasons for the lack of participation in formalised <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Furthermore, the author contrasts participation formats used in technology assessment with formalised public participation. In his conclusions, he advocates for a stronger combination of formalised and informal public participation in technology assessment.|$|R
30|$|Even though {{environment}}-relevant <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> are of high {{environment and}} socio-political importance, systematic {{research into the}} actual participation in formalised <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> was carried out only marginally in Germany over the last 20  years (Wende 2001; UfU 1993, 2002). The public debate {{on the effectiveness of}} formalised participation procedures in Germany is conducted without knowledge of the concrete practice of environment-relevant <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Even though it is important and correct to discuss and develop new formats and designs of participation and to address the question about how to combine formalised participation procedures with informal formats of participation, the current experience with formalised participation procedures should not be ignored (see Dialogics 2011; Bertelsmann-Stiftung 2011). To ensure the necessary blending of formalised participation procedures and informal formats of participation, it is important to research and analyse the practise of the formalised participation as it is now. The relevant questions in this context are how many permission procedures with public participation are taking place, what are the topics objections and comments from citizens or recognised environmental organisations in the context of technology-related permission procedures, and what effects the objections and comments have on the permission process.|$|R

The EU Commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive, technical and environmental standards between all the member states. EU legislation defines the standards in the areas of noise, particle emissions and safety. In addition, the EU’s directive on Type Approval (EU Council Directive 92/53) eliminates the need for <b>national</b> type <b>approval</b> requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the EU. This directive aims at the clarification of the type <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> for motor vehicles, separate technical units (i.e., trailers), and components.|$|R

30|$|Amongst the {{planning}} permission procedures, {{there is a}} larger proportion of projects with public participation, as the conditions for ruling out public participation are stricter than in the Federal Immission Control Act.

There are no empirical data for some sectors in which planning permission procedures take place. Thus, only certain sectors can be presented here.
