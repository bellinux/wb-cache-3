First {{there was a}} citation of VALUE study 1, where valsartan produced a significant statistical increase of 19 % in the myocardial infarction (MI) incidence, fatal and non-fatal.

40|$|AbstractThe quantum Fourier {{transform}} (QFT) is {{a powerful}} tool in quantum computing. The main ingredients of QFT are formed by the Walsh–Hadamard transform H and phase shifts P(·), {{both of which are}} 2 × 2 unitary matrices as operators on the two-dimensional 1 -qubit space. In this paper, we show that H and P(·) suffice to generate the unitary group U(2) and, consequently, through controlled-U operations and their concatenations, the entire unitary group U(2 n) on n qubits can be generated.

We also show how to generate Dorey’s dyonic magnon directly in the S n sigma model via the dressing method without resorting to the isomorphism with the SU(2) principle chiral model when n = 3.

40|$|AbstractIn many {{applications}} {{it has been}} observed that hybrid-Monte Carlo sequences perform better than Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sequences, especially in difficult problems. For a mixed s-dimensional sequence m, whose elements are vectors obtained by concatenating d-dimensional vectors from a low-discrepancy sequence q with (s−d) -dimensional random vectors, probabilistic upper bounds for its star discrepancy have been provided. In a paper of G. Ökten, B. Tuffin and V. Burago [G. Ökten, B. Tuffin, V. Burago, J. Complexity 22 (2006), 435 – 458] it was shown that for arbitrary ε> 0 the difference of the star discrepancies of the first N points of m and q is bounded by ε with probability at least 1 − 2 exp(−ε 2 N/ 2) for N sufficiently large. The authors did not study how large N actually has to be and if and how this actually depends on the parameters s and ε. In this note we derive a lower bound for N, which significantly depends on s and ε. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic bound for the difference of the star discrepancies of the first N points of m and q, which holds without any restrictions on <b>N.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> it improves on the bound of Ökten, Tuffin and Burago and is more helpful in practice, especially for small sample sizes <b>N.</b> We compare <b>this</b> bound to other known bounds...|$|R
40|$|We prove an Ω(lg n) cell-probe {{lower bound}} on {{maintaining}} connectivity in dynamic graphs, {{as well as}} a more general trade-off between updates and queries. Our bound holds even if the graph is formed by disjoint paths, and thus also applies to trees and plane graphs. The bound is known to be tight for these restricted cases, proving optimality of these data structures (e. g., Sleator and Tarjan’s dynamic trees). Our trade-off is known to be tight for trees, and the best two data structures for dynamic connectivity in general graphs are points on our trade-off curve. In <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> these two data structures are optimal, and this tightness serves as strong evidence that our lower bounds are the best possible. From a more theoretical perspective, our result is the first logarithmic cell-probe lower bound for any problem in the natural class of dynamic language membership problems, breaking the long standing record of Ω(lg n / lg lg <b>n).</b> In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> our result is the first data-structure lower bound that is “truly ” logarithmic, i. e., logarithmic in the problem size counted in bits. Obtaining such a bound is listed as one of three major challenges for future research by Miltersen [13] (the other two challenges remain unsolved). Our techniques form a general framework for proving cell-probe lower bounds on dynamic data structures. We show how our framework also applies to the partial-sums problem to obtain a nearly complete understanding of the problem in cell-probe and algebraic models, solving several previously posed open problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{spanning}} tree packing number of a graph G is {{the maximum number}} of edge-disjoint {{spanning tree}}s contained in G. Let k≥ 1 be a fixed integer. Palmer and Spencer proved that in almost every random graph process, the hitting time for having k edge-disjoint spanning trees equals the hitting time for having minimum degree k. In this paper, we prove that for any p such that (n+ω(1)) /n≤ p≤ (1. 1 n) /n, almost surely the random graph G(n,p) satisfies that the spanning tree packing number is equal to the minimum degree. Note that this bound for p will allow the minimum degree to be a function of <b>n,</b> and in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> we improve the result of Palmer and Spencer. Moreover, we also obtain that for any p such that p≥ (51 n) /n, almost surely the random graph G(n,p) satisfies that the spanning tree packing number is less than the minimum degree.

40|$|The {{convenient}} {{setting for}} quasianalytic Denjoy-Carleman differentiable mappings. (English summary) J. Funct. Anal. 261 (2011), no. 7, 1799 – 1834. Given a sequence M: = {Mk} {{and an open}} set U ⊂ R n, the Denjoy-Carleman class C M (U) is defined to be the set of all f ∈ C ∞ (U) such that for every compact set K ⊂ U, | ∂ α f | ≤ Cρ |α | |α|!M |α|, ∀α ∈ N n and all x ∈ K, for some constants C and ρ. When Mk = 1, ∀k, C M (U) coincides with C ω (U), the class of real-analytic functions on U. Under some mild conditions on M, the classes of Denjoy-Carleman differentiable functions are wider than the real-analytic class. A class C M (U) is called a quasianalytic class if, like C ω (U), it does not contain any nonzero flat function. A function f ∈ C ω (R n) {{if and only if}} f ∈ C ∞ and the restriction f | L ∈ C ω for every line segment L in R <b>n.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> the restrictions of C ∞ functions to curves are ‘convenient settings’ for C ω.

40|$|We have {{recently}} performed a relativistic O(q^ 4) chiral {{expansion of the}} two-pion exchange NN potential, and here we explore its configuration space content. Interactions are determined by three families of diagrams, two of which involve just g_A and f_π, whereas the third one depends on empirical coefficients fixed by subthreshold π <b>N</b> data. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> the calculation has no adjusted parameters and gives rise to predictions, which are tested against phenomenological potentials. The dynamical structure of the eight leading non-relativistic components of the interaction is investigated and, in most cases, found to be clearly dominated by a well defined class of diagrams. In particular, the central isovector and spin-orbit, spin-spin, and tensor isoscalar terms are almost completely fixed by just g_A and f_π. The convergence of the chiral series in powers of the ratio (pion mass/nucleon mass) is studied {{as a function of}} the internucleon distance and, for r> 1 fm, found to be adequate for most components of the potential. An important exception is the dominant central isoscalar term, where the convergence is evident only for r> 2. 5 fm. Finally, we compare the spatial behavior of the functions that enter the relativistic and heavy baryon formulations of the interaction and find that, in the region of physical interest, they differ by about 5...|$|R
40|$|The Nyström {{method is}} {{routinely}} used for out-of-sample extension of kernel matrices. We describe how this method {{can be applied}} to find the singular value decomposition (SVD) of general matrices and the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of square matrices. We take as an input a matrix M ∈ Rm×n, a user defined integer s ≤ min(m, n) and AM ∈ Rs×s, a matrix sampled from columns and rows of M. These are used to construct an approximate rank-s SVD of M in O (s 2 (m + n)) operations. If M is square, the rank-s EVD can be similarly constructed in O (s 2 <b>n)</b> operations. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> AM is a compressed version of M. We discuss theoretical considerations for the choice of AM and how it relates to the approximation error. Finally, we propose an algorithm that selects a good initial sample for a pivoted version of M. The algorithm relies on a previously computed approximate rank-s decomposition of M, termed Mdecomp. We show that ||Mdecomp − M|| 2 is related to the Nyström approximation error when the selected sample is employed. Then, the user can choose a more computationally expensive algorithm for computing Mdecomp when higher accuracy is required. We present experimental results that evaluate our sample selection algorithm for general matrices and kernel matrices.
