25|$|FidoNet {{addresses}} explicitly {{consist of}} a zone number, a network number (or region number), and a <b>node</b> <b>number.</b> They are written in the form Zone:Network/Node. The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address.|$|E
25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer. FIDO was {{modified}} to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a <b>node</b> <b>number</b> for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular <b>node</b> <b>number</b> into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{there was}} no {{specific}} relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the <b>node</b> <b>number</b> to the hub number if the network {{is large enough to}} contain any hubs. This effect may be seen in the nodelist by looking at the structure of Net 2410 where node 2:2410/330 is listed under Hub 300. This is not the case in other zones.|$|E

30|$|It {{is noted}} that the {{computation}} time is approximately proportional to the hidden <b>nodes</b> <b>number.</b> When the hidden <b>nodes</b> <b>number</b> is 3, the computation time is 1.5377  s, including the time for training model with 41072 data points and forecasting 6336 data points. That indicates a high computational efficiency for wind power forecasting, which can satisfy the practical needs.|$|R
25|$|The team {{settled on}} the concept of adding a new network number {{patterned}} on the idea of area codes. A complete network address would now consist of the network and <b>node</b> <b>number</b> pair, which would be written with a slash between them. All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local network host, someone who volunteered to pay for any long distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. They would then call any required network admin sites and deliver the packet to them. That site would then process the mail as normal, although all of the messages in the packet would be guaranteed to be local calls.|$|E
25|$|In August 1984 Jennings handed {{off control}} of the nodelist to the group in St. Louis, mostly Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker. Kaplan had come across Fido as part of finding a BBS {{solution}} for his company, which worked with DEC computers and {{had been given a}} Rainbow computer and a USRobotics 1200bit/s modem. From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured {{that at least some of}} the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned <b>node</b> <b>number.</b> If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist. The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984.|$|E

At the end of this paper we propose a <b>node</b> <b>numbering</b> and classification technique (NNC) to restrict the search in XML document to small portion of the XML data.

Optimization is performed relative to minimal values of average depth, depth, <b>number</b> of <b>nodes,</b> <b>number</b> of terminal <b>nodes,</b> and <b>number</b> of nonterminal <b>nodes</b> of decision trees. We compare average depth, depth, <b>number</b> of <b>nodes,</b> <b>number</b> of terminal <b>nodes</b> and <b>number</b> of nonterminal <b>nodes</b> of constructed trees with minimum values of the considered parameters obtained based on a dynamic programming approach.

5000|$|Registration also {{provided}} permission to {{link to the}} main network, WWIVnet, which soon connected thousands of boards together into a network spread across several nations. Boards in a WWIV network are identified within the network by a <b>node</b> <b>number.</b> Local e-mail within a board was sent by {{sending a message to}} a BBS user's user number (the sysop always being user 1). However, to e-mail a user at another board within a WWIV network, the @ sign would be added (similar to an internet e-mail address), followed by the <b>node</b> <b>number.</b> In the case of WWIVnet, <b>node</b> <b>number</b> 1 was a WWIV BBS named Amber, the BBS run by Wayne Bell in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, California.

Of these, only the network number required any configuration, being obtained from a router. Each node dynamically chose its own <b>node</b> <b>number,</b> according to a protocol (originally the LocalTalk Link Access Protocol LLAP and later the AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol, AARP) which handled contention between different nodes accidentally choosing the same number. For socket numbers, a few well-known numbers were reserved for special purposes specific to the AppleTalk protocol itself. Apart from these, all application-level protocols were expected to use dynamically-assigned socket numbers at both the client and server end.|$|E
