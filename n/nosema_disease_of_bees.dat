40|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{is presented to}} explain the developments <b>of</b> epizootics <b>of</b> <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the honey <b>bee,</b> Apis mellifera Linnaeus. It is assumed that most hives contain some lightly infected carrier bees in which the numbers of the parasite increase very slowly. But {{under the influence of}} certain conditions the parasites within these bees increase in numbers very quickly, and, if other conditions are favorable, an epizootic <b>of</b> the <b>disease</b> will develop. A hypothetical course of development of an epizootic is described. It is suggested that the numbers of the parasite increase when the metabolism <b>of</b> infected <b>bees</b> is changed so as to change the environment of the intracellular parasites. Changes in the metabolism <b>of</b> infected <b>bees</b> are considered to be stress reactions in the bees as a result of disruption of their behavior patterns when the hive is disturbed.

A bibliography of 39 titles is included. Chapter I. American foulbrood is the most serious <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>bees.</b> It is an infectious <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the later larval stages and pupal stage caused by Bacillus larvae. The disease is practically always fatal to the colonies contracting it, no race <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> is resistant to it, it is spread largely by beekeepers in manipulating their bees, can be spread in package bees and in commercial honey although neither are important factors {{and it is difficult to}} control except by burning diseased colonies as soon as they are found. Some work is being done on breeding resistant stock and this work has some prospect of being successful since a method of controlling the mating of the queen has been discovered. Chapter II. European foulbrood is an infectious <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> attacking the brood <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> in the earlier larval stages while the sugar content of the digestive tract is still relatively high. It is caused by Bacillus alvei, a germ that assumes quite variable morphological forms during its development. Italian, Caucasian and Carniolan bees are usually resistant taken as colonies and not as individuals. The disease may be spread in honey and pollen and on equipment. It may be controlled by strengthening infected colonies and requeening with queens of resistant stock. Chapter III. Sac brood is an infectious disease caused by a filterable virus which does not live long in honey, pollen nor in dead larvae. Its principal damage is in weakening colonies and its seriousness is not usually realized because most of the dead larvae are removed by the bees. Nosema-disease and paralysis are <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>bees,</b> both <b>of</b> them are present in Oregon but are of little importance. Dissentery <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> in winter and early spring is due to stores with too high a water content. Parafoulbrood is not present in Oregon. Isle <b>of</b> Wight <b>disease,</b> caused by a mite in the trachea, is not present in North America. Septicemia and fungus <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> are <b>of</b> little importance. Chapter IV. Instructions are given for methods of diagnosing the common bee diseases in the apiary with a chart listing symptoms <b>of</b> the common <b>diseases.</b> Chapter V. Bee diseases have been known since before the Christian era but it was not until 1903 that the different types <b>of</b> brood <b>diseases</b> were separated and their causative organisms isolated. It is not known just when or how American foulbrood was brought to Oregon but it was present in Malheur county in 1907 and was found in nearly all parts of the state by 1920. It is now present in every county in the state. There was a virulent type of European foulbrood in Clatsop county in 1908 and the disease was common in western Oregon by 1920. At present it is decreasing in importance and is seldom found in central and eastern Oregon. Sac brood is found all over the state but is generally confused with poisoning. Spray poisoning is serious only in Jackson, Hood River and Wasco counties. The first inspection law was passed in 1905, the next in 1917, another in 1920 and the present law in 1933.

40|$|There are {{thousands}} of different species <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> in the world, but {{the two most important}} for beekeeping are the western honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the eastern honey bee, A. cerana. Bees are social insects living in hives consisting of one queen, many workers, all female, and a few drones, the males whose only role is to mate with the queen. The queen, the only fertile female, lays eggs in the hexagonal cells made of beeswax in the comb. These quickly hatch into larvae, which are fed royal jelly by the workers for the first few days. When they pupate the cells are capped, and the adults emerge several days later. The life cycle <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> can be as little as 12 days. The term brood is used to refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages. Bees, like all animals including humans, are susceptible to bacteria, viruses, and parasites. When in a state of optimum health and nourishment their resistance to adverse factors is higher. Environmental challenges, including chemical products to protect crops from insects and weeds, can have detrimental effects on bee health, particularly when they host pathogens. <b>Diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>bees</b> are listed in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and member countrie...|$|R

The rediscovery of an external acarapis mite in the United States in 1959, raised the question as to the actual relationship of acarapis mites to bees. The two external mites, Acarapis dorsalis Morgenthaler and Acarapis externus Morgenthaler were subsequently found to be widely scattered in Canada and the United States without any visible symptoms of injury to the bees. It is concluded that they must have been present for many years before any quarantine was levied. The external mites can be distinguished from A. woodi by morphological as well as ecological characters. No evidence of A. woodi was found, and none has ever been reported from either the United States or Canada.

The nuances of the relationship between two solitary bee pathogens were examined more closely to determine how the two pathogens interact in this bee. In this case, under varying conditions of infection, one pathogen always maintained a similar level of virulence and spore production, while the other pathogen varied in these measures. In addition, when doses of these fungi were fed to bee larvae at different times, more bees survived than when the doses were given at the same time, suggesting that bee immune responses are very important.

A description <b>Nosema</b> <b>disease,</b> such as preventive and disinfecting measures to prezent it {{and how you can}} treat already established disease. The findings described by ptrotozoa Nosema apis imply that this protozoa is explored in the vast majority. Nosema ceranae is a recently discovered species and its research is not yet complete.

These factors include, fluctuating number of individuals in a hive, honey yields lower, in some cases death of the colony and it also changed the behavior <b>of</b> honey <b>bees...</b>|$|R
