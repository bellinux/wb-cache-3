He {{wrote that the}} intuitionistic <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> NJ {{in the case of}} intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK). Then he said that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem ("Hauptsatz").|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} multi-context focused sequent {{calculus}} whose derivations are in bijective correspondence with normal <b>natural</b> <b>deductions</b> in the propositional fragment of the intuitionistic modal logic IS 4. This calculus, {{suitable for the}} enumeration of normal proofs, is {{the starting point for}} the development of a sequent calculus-based bidirectional decision procedure for propositional IS 4. In this system, relevant derived inference rules are constructed in a forward direction prior to proof search, while derivations constructed using these derived rules are searched over in a backward direction. We also present a variant which searches directly over normal <b>natural</b> <b>deductions.</b> Experimental results show that on most problems, the bidirectional prover is competitive with both conventional backward provers using loop-detection and inverse method provers, significantly outperforming them in a number of cases. ...|$|R

25|$|Gentzen-style {{systems have}} {{significant}} practical and theoretical advantages compared to Hilbert-style systems. For example, both <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> and sequent calculus systems facilitate the elimination and introduction of universal and existential quantifiers so that unquantified logical expressions {{can be manipulated}} according to the much simpler rules of propositional calculus. In a typical argument, quantifiers are eliminated, then propositional calculus is applied to unquantified expressions (which typically contain free variables), and then the quantifiers are reintroduced. This very much parallels {{the way in which}} mathematical proofs are carried out in practice by mathematicians. Predicate calculus proofs are generally much easier to discover with this approach, and are often shorter. <b>Natural</b> <b>deduction</b> systems are more suited to practical theorem-proving. Sequent calculus systems are more suited to theoretical analysis.|$|E
25|$|In other words, <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> and sequent {{calculus}} {{systems are}} particular distinct kinds of Gentzen-style systems. Hilbert-style systems typically {{have a very}} small number of inference rules, relying more on sets of axioms. Gentzen-style systems typically have very few axioms, if any, relying more on sets of rules.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} example of a propositional calculus, the transformation rules are intended to be interpreted as the inference rules of a so-called <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> system. The particular system presented here has no initial points, which means that its interpretation for logical applications derives its theorems from an empty axiom set.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} translating between different styles of proof systems in higherorder logic: analytic proofs which are well suited for automated theorem proving, and nonanalytic deductions which are well suited for the mathematician. Analytic proofs are represented as expansion proofs, H, a form of the sequent calculus we define, non-analytic proofs are represented by <b>natural</b> <b>deductions.</b> A non-deterministic translation algorithm between expansion proofs and H-deductions is presented and its correctness is proven. We also present an algorithm for translation {{in the other direction}} and prove its correctness. A cut-elimination algorithm for expansion proofs is given and its partial correctness is proven. Strong termination of this algorithm remains a conjecture for the full higher-order system, but is proven for the first-order fragment. We extend the translations to a non-analytic proof system which contains a primitive notion of equality, while leaving the notion of expansion proof unaltered. This is possible, since a non-extensional equality is definable in our system of type theory. Next we extend analytic and non-analytic proof systems and the translations between them to include extensionality. Finally, we show how the methods and notions used so far apply to the problem of translating expansion proofs into <b>natural</b> <b>deductions.</b> Much care is taken to specify this translation in...|$|R

25|$|The {{price paid}} for the simple syntax of a Hilbert-style system is that {{complete}} formal proofs tend to get extremely long.

25|$|Sequent {{calculus}} is, in essence, a {{style of}} formal logical argumentation where every line of a proof is a conditional tautology (called a sequent by Gerhard Gentzen) instead of an unconditional tautology. Each conditional tautology is inferred from other conditional tautologies on earlier lines in a formal argument according to rules and procedures of inference, giving a better approximation to the style of <b>natural</b> <b>deduction</b> used by mathematicians than David Hilbert's earlier style of formal logic where every line was an unconditional tautology. There may be more subtle distinctions to be made; for example, there may be non-logical axioms upon which all propositions are implicitly dependent. Then sequents signify conditional theorems in a first-order language rather than conditional tautologies.|$|E

In this interpretation the cut rule of the sequent calculus corresponds to composition in the category. Boolean and Heyting algebras enter this picture as special categories having at most one morphism per homset, i.e., one proof per entailment, corresponding to the idea that existence of proofs is all that matters: any proof will do and {{there is no point in}} distinguishing them.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we develop {{a new version of}} the intuitionist existential graphs {{presented}} by Arnol Oostra [4]. The deductive rules presented in this article have the same meaning as those described in the work of Yuri Poveda [5], because the deductions according to the parity of the cuts are eliminated and are replaced by a finite set of recursive rules. This way, $ Alfa_I $ the existential graphs system for intuitional propositional logic follows the course of the deductive rules of the system $ Alfa_ 0 $ described by Poveda [5], and is equivalent to the intuitionistic propositional calculus. In this representation the $ Alfa_ 0 $ system is improved, there are a series of deductive rules of second degree incorporated that previously had not been considered and that allow a better management of deductions and finally from the ideas proposed by Van Dalen [6], a mixture is incorporated in the <b>deduction</b> techniques, the <b>natural</b> <b>deductions</b> of the Gentzen system are combined with new system rules $ Alfa_ 0 $ and $ Alfa_I $.

60|$|So you {{and others}} upbraid me with having put myself out of my 'natural place.' What is one's natural place, I wonder? For the Chinese it is the inner side of the wall.

That is as men {{conceive}} of 'natural places.' But, in the highest sense, I ask you, how can {{a man or a}} woman leave his or her natural place. Wherever God's universe is round, and God's law above, there is a natural place. Circumstances, the force of natural things, have brought me here and kept me; it is my natural place. And, intellectually speaking, having grown to a certain point by help of certain opportunities, my way of regarding the world is also natural to me, my opinions are the <b>natural</b> <b>deductions</b> of my mind. Isn't it so? Still I do beg to say both to you and to others accusing that Italy is not my 'adopted country.' I love Italy, but I love France, too, and certainly I love England. Because I have broken through what seems to me the English 'Little Pedlingtonism,' am I to be supposed to take up an Italian 'Little Pedlingtonism'? No, indeed. I love truth and justice, or I try to love truth and justice, more than any Plato's or Shakespeare's country.[73] I certainly do not love the egotism of England, nor wish to love it. I class England among the most immoral nations in respect to her foreign politics. And her 'National Defence' cry fills me with disgust. But this by no means proves that I have adopted another country--no, indeed! In fact, patriotism in the narrow sense is a virtue which will wear out, sooner or later, everywhere.

40|$|The {{philosophy}} of Leibniz is often considered as an intellectualism. Speculation {{is said to}} take precedence over experience in it. Against this persistent misunderstanding, Leibniz holds that experience plays a constitutive role {{in all areas of}} knowledge, even in mathematics and even in metaphysics.

40|$|Since {{the time}} of Aristotle's students, interpreters have {{considered}} Prior Analytics to be a treatise about deductive reasoning, more generally, about methods of determining the validity and invalidity of premise-conclusion arguments. People studied Prior Analytics {{in order to learn}} more about deductive reasoning and to improve their own reasoning skills. These interpreters understood Aristotle to be focusing on two epistemic processes: first, the process of establishing knowledge that a conclusion follows necessarily from a set of premises (that is, on the epistemic process of extracting information implicit in explicitly given information) and, second, the process of establishing knowledge that a conclusion does not follow. Despite the overwhelming tendency to interpret the syllogistic as formal epistemology, {{it was not until the}} early 1970 s that it occurred to anyone to think that Aristotle may have developed a theory of deductive reasoning with a well worked-out system of deductions comparable in rigor and precision with systems such as propositional logic or equational logic familiar from mathematical logic. 	When modern logicians in the 1920 s and 1930 s first turned their attention to the problem of understanding Aristotle's contribution to logic in modern terms, they were guided both by the Frege-Russell conception of logic as formal ontology and at the same time by a desire to protect Aristotle from possible charges of psychologism. They thought they saw Aristotle applying the informal axiomatic method to formal ontology, not as making the first steps into formal epistemology. They did not notice Aristotle's description of deductive reasoning. Ironically, the formal axiomatic method (in which one explicitly presents not merely the substantive axioms but also the deductive processes used to derive theorems from the axioms) is incipient in Aristotle's presentation. 	Partly in opposition to the axiomatic, ontically-oriented approach to Aristotle's logic and partly as a result of attempting to increase the degree of fit between interpretation and text, logicians in the 1970 s working independently came to remarkably similar conclusions to the effect that Aristotle indeed had produced the first system of formal deductions. They concluded that Aristotle had analyzed the process of deduction and that his achievement included a semantically complete system of <b>natural</b> <b>deductions</b> including both direct and indirect deductions. 	Where the interpretations of the 1920 s and 1930 s attribute to Aristotle a system of propositions organized deductively, the interpretations of the 1970 s attribute to Aristotle a system of deductions, or extended deductive discourses, organized epistemically. The logicians of the 1920 s and 1930 s take Aristotle to be deducing laws of logic from axiomatic origins; the logicians of the 1970 s take Aristotle to be describing the process of deduction and in particular to be describing deductions themselves, both those deductions that are proofs based on axiomatic premises and those deductions that, though deductively cogent, do not establish the truth of the conclusion but only that the conclusion is implied by the premise-set. 	Thus, two very different and opposed interpretations had emerged, interestingly both products of modern logicians equipped with the theoretical apparatus of mathematical logic. The issue at stake between these two interpretations is the historical question of Aristotle's place in the history of logic and of his orientation in philosophy of logic. This paper affirms Aristotle's place as the founder of logic taken as formal epistemology, including the study of deductive reasoning. A by-product of this study of Aristotle's accomplishments in logic is a clarification of a distinction implicit in discourses among logicians [...] that between logic as formal ontology and logic as formal epistemology...|$|R
