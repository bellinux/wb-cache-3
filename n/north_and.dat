5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of <b>North</b> <b>and</b> South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of <b>North</b> <b>and</b> South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and <b>North</b> <b>and</b> South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
