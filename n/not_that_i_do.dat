2500|$|This book, {{written by}} the empress, is capable of being an example to generations. [...] It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know the will of heaven and mourn uselessly, but now, when I enter the palace, I can no longer hear her {{corrective}} words. [...] I have lost a wonderful help, and I cannot forget her.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Verber, {{vice-president}} of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, stated in 2015 {{that the board}} trusted the academic and educational value of republishing. “We would, of course, be very wary of any attempt to glorify Hitler or to belittle the Holocaust in any way,” Verber declared to The Observer. “But this is <b>not</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand how some Jewish groups could be upset and nervous, but it seems it is being done from a historical {{point of view and}} to put it in context.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph, {{prior to the}} Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, Lima revealed her diet regimen – nine days before the show, she drinks only protein shakes: [...] "No liquids at all so you dry out, sometimes you can lose up to eight pounds just from that," [...] she says. She also stated that {{the last three weeks}} before the show, she works out twice a day. The interview got negative reviews on the media and was mentioned in CNN's Anderson Cooper's [...] "Ridiculist". Shortly afterwards, Lima defended herself in an {{interview with}} E!, [...] "I know it's very intense but... I just have an athlete's mind and I appreciate doing this thing," [...] she said. [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> crazy diets throughout the year. I just do it for this particular thing. After this show, I become normal again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> sir," [...] {{replied the}} page; [...] "but {{it is what}} the men-at-arms swear to, having drawn it from the serving-maid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{take any}} interest," [...] said Croft, [...] "but at first your name never came forward, and I {{soon began to}} know you by the title which your {{remarkable}} condition of wedlock gave you." ...|$|R
6000|$|BOBBY. Well, it's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{care for}} you: in fact, no girl {{can ever be}} to me exactly what you are; but weve been brought up so much {{together}} that it feels more like brother and sister than--well, than the other thing, doesnt it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} to be harsh," [...] he said, [...] "and it is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} how you feel. You have made my duty peculiarly difficult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I always desire it,' {{said the}} old man. 'You know I always desire it. I wish to pay as I go, even when I buy of you. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not leave a balance to be settled one day, Pecksniff.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe. I {{am not a}} puppy or a fool to flatter {{myself that}} you must {{be in love with}} me. I believe you well enough. But still it is {{possible}} that your mind may alter." ...|$|E
5000|$|He was {{recalled}} to the first-team {{bench for}} a Football League Trophy match against Gillingham, {{but according to}} the club he failed to show up for the match, causing the club to discipline him. Theoklitos denied the claim, saying [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> turn up but I was half an hour late" [...] because [...] "I got my wires mixed up".|$|R
6000|$|... "You will be sorely tempted, no doubt. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{appreciate}} your feelings. This is an Englishman's Home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not possible," [...] he answered. [...] "Please <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{appreciate}} your hospitality--and your kindness, Lady Elisabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{naturally}} you acted unconsciousness! It {{was better}} than insulting her by seeming to condole. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> though, for she deserves more steadiness than he has shown! If a man could appreciate her at all, I should have {{thought that it would}} have been once and for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it were <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to {{sacrifice}} any of the lives on board, unnecessarily," [...] the captain said, [...] "I would let them come alongside and try boarding. We have a strong crew, and with the sixty soldiers we should give them such a reception as they do not dream of. However, I will keep them off, if I can.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If it were, what is past {{should not}} go unrequited, and the change will teach her what she has rejected. Hush, dearest, it is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{think that you have}} done all for her that {{tenderness}} or good sense could devise, but your time is too much occupied, and I cannot see you overtasked by this poor child's headstrong temper. It is decided, Albinia; say no more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Prince, <b>not</b> exactly <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{think it}} needful to search {{them on a}} matter which seems established, more or less." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want you," [...] I said, [...] "you {{must believe}} <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> have wanted you {{ever since that}} night long ago when I slipped out of your bed and ran away. I am going first to St. Louis and then to New Orleans on a mission of much delicacy, a mission that {{requires}} discretion and secrecy. You may come, with all my heart, with one condition only--that you do not ask my business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” said Tony, {{and there}} was a trace of anxiety in his glance, “I am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> though <b>I</b> have some {{passable}} friends.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's {{only one}} economy which I don't think is justifiable,' said he, 'and that is, {{to cut down}} your {{subscriptions}} to charities. It is such a very cheap way of doing things. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> much in that line--too little, perhaps. But to say that because WE want to economise, therefore some poor people are to suffer, is a very poor argument. We must save at our own expense.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My fingers," [...] said Elizabeth, [...] "do {{not move}} over this {{instrument}} in the masterly manner which I {{see so many}} women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I {{have always}} replied, [...] "No." [...] It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think the}} subject an {{interesting}} one. I cannot myself conceive of any topic more likely to prove fascinating {{to the world as}} a whole, or at all events to the cultured portion of it. But I will not do it, on principle. It is inartistic, and it sets a bad example to the younger men. Other writers (a few of them) do it, I know; but I will not--not as a rule.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no danger}} for me. I am safe. I am the safest person, {{perhaps the only}} safe person, in all this land." [...] The full {{significance}} of her words {{did not seem to}} come to me all at once. Some base for understanding such an assertion seemed to be wanting. It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> trust or believe her, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought she might be mistaken. I wanted to reassure myself, so in my distress I asked unthinkingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A young gentleman? There {{is no one}} in London who is <b>not</b> aware <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> show before midday. Do {{you know}} the person? Have you seen him before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Ethelberta, it is <b>not</b> worth <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{originally}} mean {{to follow}} this course at all; but events seemed to point {{to it in the}} absence of a better.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. Suppose {{that there}} be an Hell in very deed, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{question}} it, any more than I do whether there be a Sun to shine; but I suppose it for argument sake, with Mr. Badmans friends; I say, suppose there be an Hell, and that too, such an one as the Scripture speaks of, one at the remotest distance from God and Life eternall, one where the Worm of a guilty Conscience never dyes, and where the fire of the Wrath of God is not quenched.|$|E
60|$|You {{know the}} story of Joachim and Anna, I hope? <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> myself, quite in the ins and outs; and if you don't I'm not going to keep you waiting while I tell it. All you need know, and you scarcely, before this fresco, need know so much, is, that here are an old husband and old wife, meeting again by surprise, after losing each other, and being each in great fear;--meeting {{at the place where}} they were told by God each to go, without knowing what was to happen there.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear girl," [...] said I, [...] "I {{can make}} neither head nor tails of this; but God forbid that I should do {{anything}} to set you on the jee. As for talking of Miss Grant I have no such a mind to it, and I believe it was yourself began it. My only design (if I took you up at all) was for your own improvement, for I hate the very look of injustice. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish {{you to have a}} good pride and a nice female delicacy; they become you well; but here you show them to excess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hem!" [...] said Tanner: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> very much," [...] and {{he whispered}} to his wife. Sybil removed from them {{as far as she}} was able.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do so," [...] Roger said, seriously. [...] "Some of the canticles {{have plenty}} of ring and go, and the words matter <b>not,</b> seeing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{understand}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chetwode," [...] he said slowly, {{after a long}} pause, [...] "I am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> you a {{kindness}} when I {{asked you}} to come to my house the other night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course. It must {{last the}} Duke's time, and last no longer. It {{would not be}} a healthy kind of life were it <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> my very best to make the evening of his days {{pleasant}} for him, and in that way to be of some service in the world. It has done me good to think that I have in some small degree sacrificed myself. Let me see;--we are to turn here to the left. That goes to Copperhouse Cross, no doubt. Is it not odd that I should have told you all this history?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I, very sorry. I may {{say with}} perfect truth {{that there is}} no man in the world, except my own husband, for whom I feel so perfect an esteem as I do for your father. If it were <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like to be carried away by strong {{language}} I would speak of more than esteem. Through your dear mother I have watched his conduct closely, and have come to think that there is perhaps no other man at the same time so just and so patriotic. Now he is very angry with me,--and most unjustly angry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, Mike. It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not feel}} as loyal as ever {{to the cause}} of the Stuarts, but if they cannot come to their own without Ireland being again deluged with blood, I would rather they would stay away. Twice Ireland has {{suffered}} for the Stuarts: first, when Cromwell came over, carrying fire and sword through the land, and divided half the country among his followers; next, when Dutch William did the same. I am loyal to the Stuarts, as I said, but I am still more loyal to Ireland, and would rather that King James remained all his life at Saint Germain, than that those scenes should ever come again." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I’m a color photographer. <b>That’s</b> what <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Whether {{you like}} it or <b>not,</b> <b>that’s</b> what <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There is nothing wrong with black and white, but I am into color. And I like it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Deringham, with {{a curious}} little laugh. [...] "I meant to knock his arm up, and am <b>not</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. It was, {{considering}} all things, a somewhat disinterested action." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} tell him {{anything}} without your consent and papa's. He {{said he should}} go to papa to-morrow, and <b>I</b> could <b>not</b> prevent <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew it was quite impossible." ...|$|R
