We compute all the relations satisfied by those elements of H # (U n) of degree two which come from the Z cohomology. Then we define elements that generate a subring of the same dimension as the entire cohomology ring H # (U <b>n,</b> <b>F</b> p). After that we concentrate on U 4 and compute all the maximal elementary abelian subgroups and, using them, all relations among the above elements, modulo nilpotents. We then look at tools useful in finding what part of H # (U <b>n,</b> <b>F</b> p) survives in H # (GL <b>n</b> (<b>F</b> p), F p). We compute the Hecke algebra H(GL n //U n) and part of its action on H # (U <b>n,</b> <b>F</b> p). We also prove a particular case of a conjecture of Ash concerning Hecke eigenclasses and Galois representations. In the last chapter, we define a new class in H # (GL <b>n</b> (<b>F</b> p), F p) of small degree 2 p- 2. This class has not been discovered until now, and we prove that it is non-zero if p n.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new concept “conformal theories with an IR cutoff’, after {{pointing out that the}} following two categories in SU(3) gauge theories with fundamental <b>N</b> <b>f</b> fermions possess an IR fixed point: Large <b>N</b> <b>f</b> (Ncf ≤ <b>N</b> <b>f</b> ≤ 16) QCD within the conformal window (referred as Conformal QCD) and small <b>N</b> <b>f</b> (1 ≤ <b>N</b> <b>f</b> ≤ Ncf − 1) QCD at temperature T/Tc> 1 (referred as High Temper-ature QCD). In the case of Conformal QCD in the continuum limit, the compact space and/or time gives an IR cutoff. In the case of High Temperature QCD, the temperature T plays a role of an IR cutoff together with a cutoff due to possible compact space, depending on how to take the continuum limit. We note any lattice calculation is performed on a finite lattice. Thus any calculation on a lattice possesses an IR cutoff. In the conformal theories with an IR cutoff there exists the “conformal region ” together with the confining region and the deconfining region. We verify numerically on a lattice of the size 163 × 64 the existence of the conformal region and the non-trivial Z(3) structure of the vacuum and the Yukawa-type decay form of meson propagators in the conformal region. We stress that High Temperature QCD is intrinsically accompanied with an IR cutoff. Therefore the understanding the vacuum structure and the property of correlation functions is the key to resolve long standing issues in High Temperature QCD. We further argue that there is a precise correspondence between Conformal QCD and High Tem-perature QCD in the temporal propagators under the change of the parameters <b>N</b> <b>f</b> and T/Tc re-spectively: the one boundary is close to meson states and the other is close to free quark states. In particular, we find the correspondence between Conformal QCD with <b>N</b> <b>f</b> = 7 and High Tem-perature QCD with <b>N</b> <b>f</b> = 2 at T ∼ 2 Tc being in close relation to a meson unparticle model.

For each month of the year, for a given station, a set of 48 or 72 coefficients are calculated, depending on the monthly sunspot activity. Then, the normal values of the f 0 F 2 parameter are computed {{as a function of}} the daily sunspot number. The analysis of the model results revealed the following characteristics for the <b>f</b> <b>n</b> <b>F</b> 2 index: first, the temporal variations that characterize the normal ionosphere, imposing some artificial effects on the monthly median values, are eliminated from the newly derived <b>f</b> <b>n</b> <b>F</b> 2 index. Second, the <b>f</b> <b>n</b> <b>F</b> 2 index does not follow the false steplike variations observed in the monthly median f 0 F 2 time series, in transition periods from one month to another.
