The visitors had the power to impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at any time of the day to inspect the premises.|$|E
5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E

25|$|Morse {{was known}} for her strong, deep singing voice and vocal range, which often belied her petite frame.

In 1993, Feinstein, along with then-Representative Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (who lost two of his brothers to assassination, <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> semi-automatic firearms), led the fight to ban many semi-automatic firearms deemed assault weapons and restrict the sale of high capacity magazines.

25|$|Segregation in {{education}} has major social repercussions. The prejudice that many young African-Americans experience causes them undue stress {{which has been}} proven to undermine cognitive development. Eric Hanushek and his co-authors have considered racial concentrations in schools, and they find large and important effects. Black students appear to be systematically and physically hurt by larger concentrations of black students in their school. These effects extend <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> white nor to Hispanic students in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality. Moreover, {{it appears that the}} effect of black concentrations in schools is largest for high achieving black students.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of Benelli were {{confident}} {{that he would be}} elected, and in early ballots, Benelli came within nine votes of success. However, both men faced sufficient opposition for <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> be likely to prevail. Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan was considered as a compromise candidate among the Italian cardinal-electors, but when he started to receive votes, he announced that, if elected, he would decline to accept the papacy. Franz Cardinal König, Archbishop of Vienna, suggested to his fellow electors another compromise candidate: the Polish Cardinal Karol Józef Wojtyła. Wojtyła won on the eighth ballot on the third day (16 October) with, according to the Italian press, 99 votes from the 111 participating electors.|$|E

25|$|The Reserve Components of the United States Armed {{forces are}} named within Title 10 of the United States Code and include: (1) the Army National Guard of the United States, (2) the Army Reserve, (3) the Navy Reserve, (4) the Marine Corps Reserve, (5) the Air National Guard of the United States, (6) the Air Force Reserve, and (7) the Coast Guard Reserve.

In another context, it applies to only the five reserve components directly associated with the five active duty military services but <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> the Army National Guard nor the Air National Guard.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is <b>neither</b> <b>to</b> be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E
