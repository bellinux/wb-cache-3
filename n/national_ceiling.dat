30|$|Furthermore, the {{relative}} importance (Sk) of the three considered income components is not homogeneous because market-based income represents between 88 and 93.5 % of the total income of the farm in the observed period, whereas the DPs amount to 12 % of the farm income in 2014 and 6.5 % in 2015.7 Such an outcome cannot be attributed only to {{the reduction of the}} <b>national</b> <b>ceiling</b> for DPs but is strongly influenced by the changes in market conditions. Specifically, market-based income strongly affects unequal income distribution since it is strongly concentrated in the uppermost deciles of the farm population (CMI 14 [*]=[*] 0.864 and CMI 15 [*]=[*] 0.796). It follows that {{the relative}} contribution of market-based income to inequality is very high, as shown {{by the fact that it}} generated more than 90 % of the overall income inequality in 2014 – 2015 (PMI 14 [*]=[*] 0.928 and PMI 15 [*]=[*] 0.957).|$|E

Actually, the {{beef and veal}} supporting aid-system based on various types of direct farmers’ premia will be turned to a single farm payment. Options for partial decoupling can also be applied even regionally depending on member states decision. For Italian beef and veal sector decoupling is a critical issue. The different Italian livestock production systems and the lower financial support because of a partial application of Agenda 2000 make decisions about decoupling a hardly task. Effects of different decoupling options have been analyzed joint to <b>national</b> <b>ceiling</b> reduction. A positive mathematical programming model has been calibrated on the beef and veal sector of Veneto Region. Results show that a decrease in livestock numbers and farmers’ income is mitigated when partial decoupling is applied. A reduction in young cattle price may further compensate the negative impact of decoupling...|$|E
30|$|However, {{the main}} focus of this paper was the redistributive effect of the new direct payment scheme {{introduced}} by the CAP 2013 reform that replaced the former SPS in Italy, where approximately 90 % of the <b>national</b> <b>ceiling</b> was devoted to the BPS and the GR. Both static and dynamic analyses highlighted an expected decrease in the concentration of direct payments by 2019 because Italy will progressively shift from the “historical” regional model to a tunnel model for internal convergence during the transitional 2015 – 2020 period. Conversely, the decrease in the DP/FI ratio between 2014 and 2019 due to both policy changes and exogenous factors is expected to negatively affect the ability of these payments to oppose the regressive effect of MIs, particularly for regions and sectors that mainly benefitted from the SPS introduced by CAP 2003 reform. In more detail, the results indirectly highlight that the more farm income is affected by changing market conditions (increasingly influenced by price volatility) related to output composition (consumption, investment, government expenditure, and gross exports and imports), the more unequally it is distributed. This phenomenon is affected by any increase (decrease) in the budget for DPs, which could improve (worsen) the stabilization and redistribution of farm income and reduce (increase) its concentration since such aid tends to equalize farm income.|$|E

40|$|The Dutch Cabinet has {{set down}} a {{national}} programme, drawn {{up in the}} framework of the European Directive on <b>national</b> emission <b>ceilings</b> (the NEC Directive), in an Implementation Memorandum, 'Make it or break it'. On request of the Cabinet, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) - RIVM took on the evaluation of the objectives and cost-effectiveness of this programme for. Conclusions and recommendations are reported here. A major conclusion is the strong probability that the Netherlands will not meet its international emission obligations for 3 out of 4 NEC compounds, SO 2, NOx and NMVOCs. Many of the measures and options for additional measures are not concrete and lack sufficient policy instruments for implementation. The choice made to translate <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> into sector targets has not been accepted by any of the sectors. This increases the risks surrounding implementation because of the uncertainty in the results of the policy package. Furthermore, the passage of time may mean that some of the reductions needed cannot be realised, making a declaration of default a very real possibility. In the case of ammonia, current policies may be sufficient to meet the target, although there is still a chance that the emission ceiling will be exceeded. Additional measures proposed are expected to bring the ammonia emissions under the ceiling. It will be possible to update the policy programme in 2006. In the meantime, it still {{remains to be seen whether}} 'Make it or break it' has set out the right implementation course for realising the Dutch <b>national</b> emission <b>ceilings...</b>|$|R

To protect the environment, the European Union (EU) has adopted several directives that set goals to limit N losses. <b>National</b> Emission <b>Ceilings</b> (NEC) are prescribed in the NEC directive for nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Crop residues may contribute to ammonia volatilization, but sufficient information on their contribution to the national ammonia volatilization is lacking. Experiments were carried out with the aim to assess the ammonia volatilization of crop residues left on the soil surface or incorporated into the soil under the conditions met in practice in the Netherlands during late autumn and winter. Ammonia emission from residues of broccoli, leek, sugar beet, cut grass, fodder radish (fresh and frozen) and yellow mustard (frozen) was studied during two winter seasons using volatilization chambers. Residues were either placed on top of soil or mixed with soil. Mixing residues with soil gave insignificant ammonia volatilization, whereas volatilization was 5 – 16 percent of the N content of residues when placed on top of soil. Ammonia volatilization started after at least 4 days. Total ammonia volatilization was related to C/N-ratio and N concentration of the plant material. After 37 days, cumulative ammonia volatilization was negligible from plant material with N concentration below 2 percent, and was 10 percent of the N content of plant material with 4 percent N. These observations {{can be explained by}} decomposition of plant material by micro-organisms. After an initial built up of the microbial population, NH 4 + that is not needed for their own growth is released and can easily emit as NH 3 at the soil surface. The results of the experiments were used to estimate the contribution of crop residues to ammonia volatilization in the Netherlands. Crop residues of arable crops and residues of pasture topping may contribute more than 3 million kg NH 3 –N to the national ammonia volatilization of the Netherlands, being more than 3 percent of the national emissions in 2005. This contribution should therefore be considered when focusing on the <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> for ammonia emissions...|$|R

40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} direct payment scheme, accounting for 30 per cent of <b>national</b> <b>ceilings.</b> To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be decoupled income support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{an existing}} {{projection of the}} development of electricity production with a technology-specific environmental assessment. The combination of these two approaches, which so far have only been performed separately, allows a discussion about environmental effects of carbon capture and storage (CCS) implementation strategies on a national level. The results identify the future role of lignite and hard coal in German power production. The implementation of CCS technology leads to a considerable loss of efficiency. Due to CCS, about 50 million t of lignite will be additionally required in 2030 in comparison to the reference case without CCS in 2010. Increasing demand, the replacement of old plants and the compensation of efficiency losses lead to highly ambitious expansion rates. In the case of CCS implementation, the global warming potential (GWP) can be reduced by up to 70 %. However, other environmental impacts increase in part considerably. Compliance with <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> for NOx emissions can only be reached by compensation measures in other sectors The results of the environmental assessment demonstrate the significant role of the coal composition, coal origin and the required transport.

Our analysis shows that exchange rates that satisfy the environmental integrity condition can be established, but that their values vary substantially across countries. Extending the environmental integrity condition to downwind countries will require significantly higher exchange rates.
