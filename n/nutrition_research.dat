Several national research institutions are located on the university's campus including the Energy and Environmental Research Center, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and the USDA Human <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Research</b> Center.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} edge of the central campus area sits Memorial Stadium, the old Ralph Engelstad Arena, and the Hyslop Auditorium. These {{structures}} are all old athletic venues which have been replaced with new structures elsewhere on campus. The eastern part of campus is also the home of the Energy and Environmental Research Center complex which includes the National Center for Hydrogen Technology. The Grand Forks Human <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Research</b> Center, which is operated by the United States Department of Agriculture, is also in this part of campus. A five-story parking garage sits at the corner of University Avenue and Columbia Road. At the extreme eastern portion of campus sits University Park which is operated by the Grand Forks Park District.|$|E
25|$|ARS {{also has}} six major human <b>nutrition</b> <b>research</b> centers {{that focus on}} solving a wide {{spectrum}} of human nutrition questions by providing authoritative, peer-reviewed, science-based evidence. The centers are located in Arkansas, Maryland, Texas, North Dakota, Massachusetts, and California. ARS scientists at these centers study the role of food and dietary components in human health from conception to advanced old age.|$|E

The redox functions of CoQ in cellular energy production and antioxidant protection are based on the ability to exchange two electrons in a redox cycle between ubiquinol (reduced CoQ) and ubiquinone (oxidized CoQ). The antioxidant role of the molecule as a free radical scavenger was widely studied by Lars Ernster. Numerous scientists around the globe started studies on this molecule since then in relation to various diseases including cardiovascular diseases and cancer.|$|E

25|$|Huntingdon Life Sciences {{was founded}} in the UK in 1951 as <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Research</b> Co. Ltd., a {{commercial}} organisation that initially focused on nutrition, veterinary, and biochemical research. The original facilities were split over two locations; the main offices were within Cromwell House {{in the town of}} Huntingdon, Cambs, UK; and the main laboratories were at the Hartford Field Station (just over a mile away). It then became involved with pharmaceuticals, food additives, and industrial and consumer chemicals. In 1959 it changed its name to Nutritional Research Unit Ltd. The company benefited in the early 1960s from increased government regulatory testing requirements, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. In 1964 it was acquired by the U.S. medical supply firm of Becton Dickinson.|$|E

25|$|Dietary and {{nutritional}} choices affect sleep duration and quality. Research is being conducted {{in an attempt}} to discover what kinds of nutritional choices result in better sleep quality. A study in the Western Journal of Nursing Research in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets: a high-protein diet, a high-fat diet, a high-carbohydrate diet, and a control diet. Results indicated that the diets high in protein resulted in fewer wakeful episodes during night-time sleep. The high carbohydrate diet was linked to much shorter periods of quiescent or restful sleep. These results suggest that ingested nutrients do play a role in determining sleep quality. Another investigation published in <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Research</b> in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} one perfect diet for sleep enhancement, this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and restful sleep. A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat proteins, and whole grains can be the best nutritional option for individuals seeking to improve the quality of their sleep.|$|E

500|$|This ample {{provision}} {{arose from}} the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended his original gift of seed money to an undertaking {{to cover the costs}} of the entire expedition. The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as [...] "about £100,000". Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt. According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: [...] "His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return, and what he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton." [...] His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition. Rowett was, according to Huntford, [...] "a stodgy, prosaic looking" [...] businessman, who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an animal <b>nutrition</b> <b>research</b> institute in Aberdeen known as the Rowett Research Institute (now part of the University of Aberdeen).
