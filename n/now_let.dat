5|$|On October 21, 2014, {{a digital}} service {{courtesy}} of the FXNOW app, called Simpsons World, launched. Simpsons World has every episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There was early criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes {{and the length of}} commercial breaks on the streaming service, but there are now fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced that Simpsons World would <b>now</b> <b>let</b> users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format.|$|E

25|$|Hall quotes the 4 August bond of the {{community}} of Edinburgh for the dowry repayment, Grafton has Albany direct the city of Edinburgh to make the bond after Berwick castle surrendered, but as in Hall, Grafton has the Garter Herald King at Arms return to Edinburgh on 23 October to request payment on the 4 August bond. The date is nearly correct; Edward IV decided to abandon the marriage plan and redeem the bond and the Garter herald John Writhe came to Edinburgh on 26 October. On the herald's return Duke of Gloucester withdrew from Newcastle to Sheriff Hutton. Hall and Grafton continue that Albany only <b>now</b> <b>let</b> James III out of the Castle, after having previously besieged him there, though records show James III was released earlier.|$|E
25|$|For {{the other}} implication, assume that every set of graphs has a finite subset of minimal graphs and let a minor-closed set F be given. We {{want to find}} a set H of graphs such that a graph is in F if and only if it does not have a minor in H. Let E be the graphs which are not minors of any graph in F, and let H be the finite set of minimal graphs in E. <b>Now,</b> <b>let</b> an {{arbitrary}} graph G be given. Assume first that G is in F. G cannot have a minor in H since G is in F and H is a subset of E. Now assume that G is not in F. Then G is not a minor of any graph in F, since F is minor-closed. Therefore, G is in E, so G has a minor in H.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} of those arrangements is when rooks are symmetric about {{the centre of}} the board. Let us designate with Gn the number of arrangements in which n rooks are placed on a board with n ranks and n files. <b>Now</b> <b>let</b> us make the board to contain 2n ranks and 2n files. A rook on the first file can be placed on any of the 2n squares of that file. According to the symmetry condition, placement of this rook defines the placement of the rook that stands on the last file − it must be arranged symmetrically to the first rook about the board centre. Let us remove the first and the last files and the ranks that are occupied by rooks (since the number of ranks is even, the removed rooks cannot stand on the same rank). This will give a board of 2n−2 files and 2n−2 ranks. It is clear that to each symmetric arrangement of rooks on the new board corresponds a symmetric arrangement of rooks on the original board. Therefore, G2n = 2nG2n−2 (the factor 2n in this expression comes from the possibility for the first rook to occupy any of the 2n squares on the first file). By iterating the above formula one reaches to the case of a 22 board, on which there are 2 symmetric arrangements (on the diagonals). As a result of this iteration, the final expression is G2n = 2n'n! For the usual chessboard (88), G8 = 244! = 1624 = 384 centrally symmetric arrangements of 8 rooks. One such arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.|$|E

500|$|From {{midway through}} the twentieth century until 1969, {{ownership}} of Friar Park resided with the Roman Catholic Church. As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but outside, signs reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as [...] "like songs really, about the devil, about friendship, life". One example was [...] "Shadows we are and shadows we depart", written on a stone sundial; another began: [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults, <b>now</b> <b>let</b> his foibles pass..." [...] This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall, {{and it was an}} aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio, as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles. In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a [...] "bad domestic year", following his split with Boyd – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman, when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.|$|E
