In these experiments {{they found out that}} the ipso fluorination was generally favoured compared to substitution to NO 2 or Cl <b>nucleofuges,</b> with overall reactivity still governed by the nature of para- and ortho- electron-withdrawing groups. A one-pot procedure was also tested, in which a substituted phenol (56) was successfully reacted with sulfuryl fluoride (SO 2 F 2) and a nucleophilic source of fluoride, affording the desired fluorinated arenes (60) in good yield under mild conditions. The proposed mechanism, supported by calculations and product distribution analysis, involves a pentacoordinate intermediate (58, 59), which is formed via the attack of a fluoride anion on the sulfur centre, and its subsequent rearrangement to the fluoroarene product. It is likely that the potential of this route for translation into 18 F chemistry will be investigated, possibly by modifying the precursor composition which will affect and allow optimisation of the steric/electronic characteristics of the proposed transition state.|$|R

Unfortunately, the competing unimolecular radical reactions of the appropriate free-radical clocks were never observed and limited relevant information was obtained by product analysis. A further extension of the aliphatic S(,RN) 1 process included in Part I is the first reported example of a carbon leaving group which will be added to the already impressive array of poor <b>nucleofuges</b> involved in S(,RN) 1 reactions;In Part II, the reactions of a series of nucleophiles with 1, 1 -dinitro- 2, 2 -diphenylethylene is reported.

Anions such as enolates, dialkyl phosphite ions and cyanide ion add to 1, 1 -dinitro- 2, 2 -diphenylethylene to form the dinitromethide ion which can be isolated as Michael adducts. With nucleophiles such as RS-, PhSe-, PhO-, the intermediate dinitromethide ion undergoes rearrangement via an oxiranyl of episulfonium zwitterion to form a substitution product.

40|$|Lewis base borane adducts (LB·BH 3) {{constitute}} a well-known class of molecules {{with a number}} of diverse applications, including use as protected phosphines. The kinetics and thermodynamics of borane transfer reactions {{from a wide range of}} Lewis base borane complexes have been studied. The data generated has been used both as a quantitative tool to describe the nucleofugality (leaving group ability) of Lewis bases and as a means to improve the efficiency of phosphine borane deprotection reactions. The kinetics of borane transfer from a range of tertiary phosphine borane complexes to a wide range of amines have been determined. All kinetic data obtained, in addition to computational evidence, are consistent with a direct (SN 2 -like) mechanism, rather than a dissociative (SN 1 -like) process. The identities of the amine, phosphine and to a lesser extent solvent, impact substantially on the rate and equilibrium of the transfer, which can span several orders of magnitude. In depth structure activity relationships have been explored both for a wide variety of amine nucleophiles and phosphine <b>nucleofuges.</b> Taken as a whole, the data allow informed optimisation of the “deprotection” of a phosphine borane complex from the standpoint of rate or synthetic convenience. Additionally, the kinetics of ethanolysis of tri(o-tolyl) phosphine borane complex have also been studied. Using bridgehead amine quinuclidine as a benchmark, the kinetics of borane transfer from a wide range amine borane adducts have also been determined. Parameterisation of these data, in addition to that obtained for the analogous phosphine borane complexes, has allowed development of a novel nucleofugality scale (NFB) that quantifies the leaving group ability of a wide range of Lewis bases. Additivity in the kinetics across a series R 3 −nR’nX·BH 3 (X = P, N; R/R’ = aryl, alkyl) has led to the formulation of related substituent parameters (nf PB, nfAB) that quantify the nucleofugal influence of a substituent. Using the substituent nucleofugality parameter in concert with additivity provides a mean of calculating ligand nucleofugality (NFB) values for a wide range of Lewis bases that extends far beyond those experimentally derived. Good agreement was found between predicted (using NF B and nFB values) and experimental rates of borane transfer for ligands outside the training set, thus providing a means to predict the relative rate of phosphine borane deprotections. The utility of both parameters was demonstrated through correlations to rates of redox transformations at iridium (bearing phosphine spectator ligands) and MIDA boronate hydrolysis, (MIDA = N-methyliminodiacetic acid).

Mol. Struct. (Theochem) 541 (2001) 1] {{and based on}} the power series for the one-electron density matrix [J. Mol. Struct. (Theochem) 343 (1995) 183]. Contributions of the direct (through-space) interaction between the electron-donating orbital of nucleophile and the electron-accepting orbital of the nucleofuge-containing (Z–Ca) bond and of various indirect (through-bond) interactions between the same orbitals to the population acquired by the <b>nucleofuge</b> Z during the reaction process may be considered separately and explicitly in this approach. Moreover, orbitals of the nearest-neighborhood of the Z–Ca bond play the role of the principal mediators in the indirect interactions. On this basis, the CbyCg and CbyO bonds are compared in respect of mediating abilities of their p-orbitals in the above-mentioned indirect interactions and thereby of their contributions to relative rates of SN 2 processes. It is demonstrated that the indirect participation of the bonding p-orbital of the CbyCg bond contributes to lowering of the total population acquired by the <b>nucleofuge</b> Z owing to the nucleophilic attack and thereby of the relative reaction rate, whereas the increment of the antibonding orbital gives rise to an opposite effect. For highly electron-donating (soft) nucleophiles, the second contribution predominates over the first one, and this fact serves to account for the known higher reactivity of allyl halogenides as compared to respective alkyl halogenides...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 1 : An {{assessment}} of the mechanism of the benzoin condensation. The reaction under non-hydroxylic conditions. The generally accepted mechanism for the well known benzion condensation is unviable for the following reasons: 1) No experimental evidence for formation of carbanion from oxyanion. 2) No experimental reports on pKa of ‘C-H” in intermediate oxyanion. 3) From previous reports, these types of carbanion are stable only at - 78 ° C. 4) Carbanions possessing <b>nucleofuges</b> generally form carbenes. It was observed that the O- protected benzaldehyde cyanohydrin (1) and O-MOM protected ethyl mandelate (2) are possibly less acidic than benzyl cyanide (3). Attempts to affect hydrogen-deuterium exchange in the O-methyl ether of benzaldehyde cyanohydrin (1) did not yield clear-cut results; neither could the analogous carbanion from O-MOM protected ethyl mandelate be formed, under analogous conditions. O-Protected benzaldehyde cyanohydrin and O-MOM protected ethyl mandelate (2) did not condense with electrophiles like benzaldehyde (4); however benzyl cyanide (3) was condensed with benzaldehyde to form the stilbene cyanide (5) under similar conditions to the benzoin condensation. Scheme 1 : Reactions under benzoin conditions. All these evidences indicate that carbanions derived from 1 and 2 are not formed under {{the conditions of the}} benzoin reaction. An alternative mechanism via intramolecular participation in the cyanohydrin oxyanion leads initially to an imino-oxirane intermediate; electrophilic capture of this in the key step finally leads to benzoin (Scheme 2). This is an attractive possibility that avoids many of the problems of the earlier mechanism, and is also not incompatible with most of the available experimental evidence. Further experimental and theoretical work is indicated before an acceptable mechanism for the benzoin condensation finally emerges. Scheme 2 : A possible alternative mechanism of benzoin condensation Scheme 2 : A possible alternative mechanism of benzoin condensation From the studies on mechanism of benzoin condensation, it seems possible to form imino-oxirane from oxyanion of benzaldehyde cyanohydrin instead of carbanion by participation of cyanide ion. To prove the cyanide ion participation in mechanism of benzoin condensation and to avoid ambiguities from O-H peak, the reaction was performed in 1, 4 dioxane solvent with benzaldehyde (4) and cyanide with the phase transfer catalyst 18 -crown- 6, instead of EtOH and H 2 O as solvent. After mixing the IR spectra for the crude product, indicated the formation of benzoin (8), which was confirmed upon work up. This led to the developing of a novel method for the benzion under anhydrous conditions. Scheme 3 : Formation of benzoin under anhydrous conditions Chapter 2 : Stereochemical stability of benzion. Generally α-hydroxy ketones undergo tautomerism to the enediol form, which are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Because of this, they undergo racemisation. Benzoin is also a α-hydroxy ketone, but it can be resolved into its enantiomeric forms. It indicates enediol form of benzion is unstable possibly due to steric interference. It was observed from the crystal structure of the carbonate analog of ene-diol form of benzoin that there is steric interference between the two phenyl rings. These were twisted out of the plane of the carbonate moiety by 19. 92 ° and - 47. 32 °. (The crystal structure of 4, 5 -diphenyl- 1, 3 -dioxol- 2 -one (9) was reported first time.) This structure also indicated the existence of atropisomerism in the crystalline lattice. Chapter 3 : Polymerisation of benzaldehyde. α-Hydroxy esters can be viewed as surrogates of cyanohydrins. To prove the cyanohydrin anion intermediate in classical benzoin condensation mechanism is very difficult. An interesting alternative is to employ α-hydroxy esters instead. It was observed that methyl 2 -phenylglyoxylate and methyl 2 -(methoxymethyl) - 2 -phenylglyoxylate (2) failed to react with benzaldehyde in aqueous methanol with sodium carbonate as base. IR spectra indicated that the carbonyl peak of benzaldehyde has disappeared, but NMR spectra showed a mixture of methyl 2 -(methoxymethyl) - 2 -phenylglyoxylate (2) and benzaldehyde (4). This seems to indicate the polymerization of benzaldehyde (10) (Scheme 4). However, the product was not stable enough to be isolated and purified.

The rate data for 1 OTs reinforced that the linear Grunwald−Winstein (GW) relationship of 1 OMs previously reported by Creary for non-aqueous solvents must also hold for aqueous organic solvents. 4 OMs showed a markedly dispersed GW relationship that is, {{on the other}} hand, well correlated with an extended GW equation involving a nucleophilicity parameter.

The results obtained showed that nucleophilic catalysis was not a significant path for formation of sulfene from sulfonyl chlorides when triethylamine was used to promote sulfene formation cut that less hindered amines may react with methane sulfonyl chloride via nucleophilic catalysis to some extent.;The second project involves the synthesis and reactions of lcub 3 rcubBetylates(3 -(Alkoxysulfonyl) propanaminium salts). lcub 3 rcubBetylates are an example of a new type of substrate for aliphatic nucleophilic substitution which enhance the applicability of nucleophilic substitution reactions to problems in organic synthesis by providing a good <b>nucleofuge</b> and phase transfer reagent in one substrate.

Each catalytic step of every reaction sequence in MACiE is fully annotated so that it includes the function of the catalytic residues involved in the reaction and the mechanism by which substrates are transformed into products. Using MACiE as a knowledge base, we have seen that the top 10 most catalytic residues are histidine, aspartate, glutamate, lysine, cysteine, arginine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Of these only seven (cysteine, histidine, aspartate, lysine, serine, threonine and tyrosine) dominate catalysis and provide essentially five functional roles that are essential. Stabilisation is the most common and essential role for all classes of enzyme, followed by general acid/base (proton acceptor and proton donor) functionality, with nucleophilic addition following closely behind (nucleophile and <b>nucleofuge).</b> We investigated the occurrence of these residues in MACiE and the Catalytic Site Atlas and found that, as expected, certain residue types are associated with each functional role, with some residue types able to perform diverse roles.

Further, we show that whilst the differences between EC classes in catalytic residue composition are not immediately obvious from the general classes of Ingold mechanisms, there is some weak correlation between the mechanisms involved in a given EC class and the functions that the catalytic amino acid residues are performing.

A total of 14 exo and 9 endo derivatives were prepared for study.

The role of the polar and resonance effects of the substituent in influencing these by polarising the π electrons of the double bond was explored. It was found that the polar effect of the substituent distorted the π system; but that although -I substituents led to a build up of electron density on the nearer of the two carbons as expected, this build up was less than expected and suggested that part of the charge was being delocalised into the saturated norbomyl framework in some way. Attempts to correlate substituent effects with Hammett substituent constants of various types were unsuccessful. Next the regiochemistry of the addition of phenylselenenyl chloride to the same alkenes was studied. The ratio of the addition products formed was found to be controlled by the electronic nature of these substituents, although {{in the case of the}} endo substituted compounds steric effects appeared to play an important role in some cases. Lastly, the ability of the double bond in 2 -norbomene to interact with a C 5 -X bond was investigated by measuring the effect on the length of the C-X bond by X-ray diffraction. A series of derivatives where X was a good leaving group (<b>nucleofuge)</b> was prepared and their structures were determined. It was hoped to show that the C-X bonds were longer when X was exo than when it was endo, indicating that the bond in the first had been weakened by the π bond of the alkene interacting with the back orbital of the C-X bond. Unfortunately the crystals showed considerable disorder, and this affected the reliability of the bond lengths obtained to such an extent that the results obtained proved inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of methods for the activation of the hydroxyl group in non-derivatized alcohols in substitution reactions. The thesis is divided into two parts, describing three different catalytic systems. The first part of the thesis (Chapter 2) describes nucleophilic allylation of amines with allylic alcohols, using a palladium catalyst to generate unsymmetrical diallylated amines. The corresponding amines were further transformed by a one-pot ring-closing metathesis and aromatization reaction to afford β-substituted pyrroles with linear and branched alkyl, benzyl, and aryl groups in overall moderate to good yields. The second part (Chapters 3 and 4) describes the direct intramolecular stereospecific nucleophilic substitution of the hydroxyl group in enantioenriched alcohols by Lewis acid and Brønsted acid/base catalysis. In Chapter 3, the direct intramolecular substitution of non-derivatized alcohols has been developed using Fe(OTf) 3 as catalyst. The hydroxyl groups of aryl, allyl, and alkyl alcohols were substituted by the attack of O- and N-centered nucleophiles, to provide five- and six-membered heterocycles in up to excellent yields with high enantiospecificities. Experimental studies showed that the reaction follows first-order dependence with respect to the catalyst, the internal nucleophile, and the internal electrophile of the substrate. Competition and catalyst-substrate interaction experiments demonstrated that this transformation proceeds via an SN 2 -type reaction pathway. In Chapter 4, a Brønsted acid/base catalyzed intramolecular substitution of non-derivatized alcohols was developed. The direct intramolecular and stereospecific substitution of different alcohols was successfully catalyzed by phosphinic acid (H 3 PO 2). The hydroxyl groups of aryl, allyl, propargyl, and alkyl alcohols were substituted by O-, N-, and S-centered nucleophiles to generate five- and six-membered heterocycles in good to excellent yields with high enantiospecificities. Mechanistic studies (both experiments and density functional theory calculations) have been performed on the reaction forming five-membered heterocyclic compounds. Experimental studies showed that phosphinic acid does not promote SN 1 reactivity. Rate-order determination indicated that the reaction follows first-order dependence with respect to the catalyst, the internal nucleophile, and the internal electrophile. DFT calculations corroborated with a reaction pathway in which the phosphinic acid has a dual activation mode and operates as a bifunctional Brønsted acid/Brønsted base to simultaneously activate both the nucleophile and <b>nucleofuge,</b> resulting in a unique bridging transition state in an SN 2 -type reaction mechanism. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript. Paper 4 : Manuscript. </p...|$|E
