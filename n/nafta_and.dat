5|$|From the 2007–08 season onwards, former Slovenian internationals Zlatko Zahovič as {{the sport}} director, and soon afterwards, Darko Milanič {{as the head}} coach, were {{appointed}} to head the club's sports department. On 10 May 2008, the club re-opened the renovated Ljudski vrt, which had undergone a major reconstruction that lasted almost 20months. The first match played in the newly refurbished stadium was a league match against <b>Nafta</b> <b>and</b> was won 3–1 in front of 12,435spectators. At the start of 2008–09 season, Maribor entered history books as the first club who won 1,000points in the Slovenian top division, after a 2–1 away win against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008. Under the guidance of head coach Darko Milanič, Maribor won all three domestic trophies available to them (the Slovenian League, Cup, and Supercup) in only two seasons with the club, thus becoming the first coach with all three domestic trophies won in Slovenian football. On 12 December 2010, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary. With the 2–1 away victory over Primorje, on 21 May 2011, Maribor secured its ninth Slovenian league title. Four days later the team played the Slovenian cup final at Stožice stadium and lost to Domžale 4–3.|$|E

25|$|Some South Americans see Mercosur {{as giving}} the {{capability}} to combine resources to balance the activities of other global economic powers, especially the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>and</b> the European Union.

25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} impact of market {{integration}} on union density or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged {{in a variety of}} strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>and</b> the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.|$|E

25|$|Since {{at least}} the mid-19th century, {{numerous}} concepts for a union among Canada, Mexico and the United States of America, some including the Caribbean, the Central American and the South American countries, have been proposed, such as the North American Technate. Following the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>and</b> the Maastricht Treaty going into effect there was speculation about {{the formation of a}} North American Union, similar to the European Union created by Maastricht, being a possible future step for the region. Several proposals for continental integration of North America advocated the creation of a union styled after the European Union, though many academic and business groups advocated less dramatic changes involving the formation of a customs union or common market.|$|E
25|$|An {{increasing}} number of economists and international commerce theorists have suggested that economic discrimination goes far {{beyond the bounds of}} individuals or businesses. The largest scale forms of economic discrimination, and the widest ranging, affect entire nations or global regions. Many consider that an open world economic system (globalization), which includes world bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), places countries at risk by practicing explicitly discriminatory techniques such as bilateral and regional bargaining, as well as asymmetrical trade balances and the maintaining of cheap force labor. Trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>and</b> General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are often regarded as financial measures serving to economically oppress third world nations.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>and</b> lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E

25|$|The public's {{concern about}} {{the federal budget deficit}} and fears of {{professional}} politicians allowed the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot to explode on the scene in dramatic fashion—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates in the polls. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA),</b> <b>and</b> internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear of the deficit. His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.|$|E
25|$|Shortages {{of natural}} gas for project fuel were {{forecast}} {{to be a problem}} for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US shale gas production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing making US largely self-sufficient in natural gas and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the <b>NAFTA</b> <b>and</b> the Canadian Constitution to reduce shipments {{of natural gas}} to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has huge undeveloped shale gas deposits in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production {{does not seem to be}} a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify <b>NAFTA,</b> <b>and</b> if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E
