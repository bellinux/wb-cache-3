In all, damage in <b>Nicaragua</b> is estimated at around $1billion (1998USD).|$|E
5|$|Nicaragua's president, José Santos Zelaya, {{wanted to}} revoke {{commercial}} concessions granted to American companies, and American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada. <b>Nicaragua</b> was in debt to foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route {{fall into the}} hands of Europeans. Zelaya's elected successor, José Madriz, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, the Estrada forces took Managua, the capital. The U.S. compelled <b>Nicaragua</b> to accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops to begin the United States occupation of <b>Nicaragua,</b> which lasted until 1933.|$|E

For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day <b>Nicaragua.</b> Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in <b>Nicaragua.</b> The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.|$|E
