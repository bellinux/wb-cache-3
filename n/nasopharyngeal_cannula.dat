40|$|Lipoaspiration is {{the most}} {{commonly}} practiced cosmetic procedure in the world. It provides both metabolic and aesthetic benefits, while avoiding the invasiveness of body-contouring surgery. However, it carries the risk of complications, {{the most common of}} which relate to the repetitive movement of the liposuction cannula back and forth causing friction burns of the skin at the access sites, cutaneous hyperpigmentation or necrosis. To avoid this distressing complication, we describe the use of a <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>cannula</b> fashioned into 15 – 20  mm long pieces and inserted into the access sites to protect the skin from the back and forth movement of the liposuction cannula...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{development}} of subcutaneous emphysema involving face, neck, and thorax has been well-documented {{in cases of}} odontologic procedures, head and/or neck surgery, and craniofacial trauma. Its development without known damage to the mucosa is rare. This report describes {{the case of a}} patient who developed emphysema without an obvious lesion. Case report: This is a male patient, healthy, undergoing epidural blockade and local anesthesia associated with sedation for lipoaspiration of the abdomen and submentonian region. Intercurrences were not observed during the procedure until a <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>cannula</b> was placed for oxygen administration. We also describe an alternative approach for its resolution. Conclusions: Although rare, subcutaneous emphysema can have serious repercussions. Manual lymphatic drainage can be an option for the treatment of this aesthetical complication...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{maternal}} hyperoxygenation treatment (2. 5 l/min {{by means}} of a <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>cannula)</b> was given in four patients presenting with intrauterine growth-retarded (IUGR) fetuses and decelerative fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns at 27 - 28 weeks of gestation. The effect of maternal hyperoxia was studied longitudinally. Neither the incidence of generalized fetal movements (FGM%) nor the pulsatility index of the internal carotid artery increased under hyperoxia. In fact, both variables decreased progressively. FHR variation was abnormal {{prior to the start of}} hyperoxygenation and showed a slight but transient increase. On average, maternal hyperoxygenation 'resulted' in a prolongation of the duration of pregnancy of 9 days. The neonatal mortality was similar in the study group as compared to a control group of IUGR infants. However, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation at birth were found more frequently in the study group. Conversely, blood gas abnormalities were less frequent in the fetuses of mothers that were treated with oxygen. We conclude that positive effects of oxygen therapy in IUGR fetuses remain uncertain and that detrimental effects due to prolongation of intrauterine malnutrition have not as yet been sufficiently excluded...|$|E
