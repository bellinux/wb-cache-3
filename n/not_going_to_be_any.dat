500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E

He had formed a [...] "Stop Kennedy" [...] coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy. Tip O'Neill was a representative from Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, [...] "Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot."

[...] "What I was excited about in their offer to bring me on board is that it was wide open for me. There was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> room with a closed door and I would be given an opportunity to see and learn.

2500|$|Veteran animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston were {{assigned}} as directing animators {{over the three}} good fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Walt Disney urged for the fairies to be more homogeneous, which Thomas and Johnston objected to, with Thomas stating they [...] "thought 'that's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> fun'. So we started figuring {{the other way and}} worked on how we could develop them into special personalities." [...] John Lounsbery would animate the [...] "Skumps" [...] sequence between Kings Hubert and Stefan. Chuck Jones, known for his work as an animation director with Warner Bros. Cartoons, was employed on the film for four months during its early conceptual stages when Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed when it was anticipated that 3-D film would replace animation as a box office draw. Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on Sleeping Beauty, which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation.|$|E

60|$|Jack Burns's pack-train was {{starting}} back light for Crater Lake, and Churchill {{was invited to}} a mule. Burns wanted to put the gripsack on another animal, but Churchill held on to it, carrying it on his saddle-pommel. But he dozed, and the grip persisted in dropping off the pommel, {{one side or the}} other, each time wakening him with a sickening start. Then, in the early darkness, Churchill's mule brushed him against a projecting branch that laid his cheek open. To cap it, the mule blundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider and gripsack out upon the rocks. After that, Churchill walked, or stumbled, rather, over the apology for a trail, leading the mule. Stray and awful odors, drifting from each side the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush for gold. But he did not mind. He was too sleepy. By the time Long Lake was reached, however, he had recovered from his sleepiness; and at Deep Lake he resigned the gripsack to Burns. But thereafter, {{by the light of the}} dim stars, he kept his eyes on Burns. There were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> accidents with that bag.|$|E
6000|$|As she lay {{thinking}} and mourning, the suggestion began to creep {{into her mind}} {{that there was an}} undefinable something about this boy that was lacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. She could not describe it, she could not tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it. What if the boy were really not her son, after all? Oh, absurd! She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her griefs and troubles. No matter, she found that it was an idea that would not 'down,' but persisted in haunting her. It pursued her, it harassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored. At last she perceived that there was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without question, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts. Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that test. But it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish. She turned over in her mind one promising test after another, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were absolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her. Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed manifest that she must give the matter up. While this depressing thought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep. And while she listened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled cry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. This chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests combined. She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work to relight her candle, muttering to herself, [...] "Had I but seen him THEN, I should have known! Since that day, when he was little, that the powder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his eyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the palm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a hundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. Yes, I shall soon know, now!" ...|$|E
