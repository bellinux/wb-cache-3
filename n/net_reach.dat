40|$|Finding {{the best}} path between two nodes on an {{arbitrary}} communication network {{is a complex}} task. Instead of using a central processing unit to keep network topology and compute the best path by request, herein all nodes will react when a network node/arc is inserted/deleted, and eventually producing other reactions on their immediate neighbors, causing a temporary chain reaction until the <b>net</b> <b>reaches</b> a new equilibrium. This individual behavior will produce a global organization of the net (seen as a society of interconnected nodes), where each node will keep the best paths to reach the others, without the need of a central organizational node, thus reducing the expected algorithm complexity, diluting it through all independent agents within the system. ...|$|R

A broad class of production policies is admitted: {{they may be}} nonstationary, non-Markovian, or, in fact, almost arbitrary.
