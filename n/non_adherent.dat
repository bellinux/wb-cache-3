40|$|Objective: Adherence {{problems}} {{are a common}} feature among bipolar patients. A recent study showed that lithium knowledge was {{the main difference between}} <b>adherent</b> and <b>non</b> <b>adherents</b> bipolar patients. The Lithium Knowledge Test (LKT), a brief questionnaire, was developed as a means of identifying aspects of patients' practical and pharmacological knowledge which are important if therapy is to be safe and effective. The original English version is validated in psychiatric population, but a validated Portuguese one is not yet available. Methods: One hundred six patients selected were diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I or II) according to DSM-IV criteria and had to be on lithium treatment for at least one month. The LKT was administered on only one occasion. We analysed the internal consis tency, concurrent validity, sensitivity and specificity of the LKT for the detection of the knowledge about lithium treatment of bipolar patients. Results: The internal consistency, evaluated by Cronbach's alpha was 0. 596. The mean of total score LKT by bipolar patients was 9. 0 (SD: 0. 75) for men and 8. 74 (SD: 0. 44) for women. Concurrent validity based on plasma lithium concentration showed a significant correlation between the total LKT score and plasma lithium (r = 0, 232; p = 0. 020). The sensitivity was 84 % and specificity was 81 %. Conclusion: LKT is a rapid, reliable instrument which appears to be as effective as a lengthier standard interview with a lithium clinic doctor, and which has a high level of acceptability to lithium patients.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the effect in HT- 29 cells of mixed infections with {{poliovirus}} type 1 and Shigella flexneri serotype 5 strain M 90 T and derivative strains differing in adhesive {{as well as}} invasive properties. HT- 29 epithelial intestinal cells derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma are a good model for coinfection studies because they are susceptible both to poliovirus replication and to S. flexneri invasion. The results show that 48 h after infection by poliovirus the invasiveness of wild-type S. flexneri M 90 T and of its adherent and invasive derivative M 90 T (pIL 22) is increased.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Hospital-acquired {{pneumonia}} (HAP) often occurring as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is {{the most}} frequent hospital infection in intensive care units (ICU). Early adequate antimicrobial therapy is an essential determinant of clinical outcome. Organisations like the German PEG or ATS/IDSA provide guidelines for the initial calculated treatment {{in the absence of}} pathogen identification. We conducted a retrospective chart review for patients with HAP/VAP and assessed whether the initial intravenous antibiotic therapy (IIAT) was adequate according to the PEG guidelines Materials and methods We collected data from 5 tertiary care hospitals. Electronic data filtering identified 895 patients with potential HAP/VAP. After chart review we finally identified 221 patients meeting the definition of HAP/VAP. Primary study endpoints were clinical improvement, survival and length of stay. Secondary endpoints included duration of mechanical ventilation, total costs, costs incurred on the intensive care unit (ICU), costs incurred on general wards and drug costs. Results We found that 107 patients received adequate initial intravenous antibiotic therapy (IIAT) vs. 114 with inadequate IIAT according to the PEG guidelines. Baseline characteristics of both groups revealed no significant differences and good comparability. Clinical improvement was 64 % over all patients and 82 % (85 / 104) in the subpopulation with adequate IIAT while only 47 % (48 / 103) inadequately treated patients improved (p Drug costs for the hospital stay were also lower (EUR 4, 069 vs. EUR 4, 833) yet not significant. The most frequent types of inadequate therapy were monotherapy instead of combination therapy, wrong type of penicillin and wrong type of cephalosporin. Discussion These findings are consistent with those from other studies analyzing the impact of guideline adherence on survival rates, clinical success, LOS and costs. However, inadequately treated patients had a higher complicated pathogen risk score (CPRS) compared to those who received adequate therapy. This shows that therapy based on local experiences may be sufficient for patients with low CPRS but inadequate for those with high CPRS. Linear regression models showed that single items of the CPRS like extrapulmonary organ failure or late onset had no significant influence on the results. Conclusion Guideline-adherent initial intravenous antibiotic therapy is clinically superior, saves lives and is less expensive than <b>non</b> guideline <b>adherent</b> therapy. Using a CPRS score can be a useful tool to determine the right choice of initial intravenous antibiotic therapy. the net effect on the German healthcare system per year is estimated at up to 2, 042 lives and EUR 125, 819, 000 saved if guideline-adherent initial therapy for HAP/VAP were established in all German ICUs. </p...|$|R

Medication non adherence is a pervasive medical problem that is common among patients with chronic disease. This study was conducted for a period of 1 month. It includes 154 randomly selected patients who were interviewed by using a questionnaire regarding socio-economic characteristics, adherence rates, barriers that affect adherence to medication use (using Morisky self report scale) and counseled by pharmacist for 20 - 30 minutes. Of the total, 97 (62. 9 %) were adherent and 57 (37. 01 %) were <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> to medications. In our study the commonly cited intentional non-adherence was found to be self-decision(35. 08 %) and ommision of drugs because of experiencing Side effects (22. 8 %). Confusion in dosage frequency (17. 5 %), forgetfulness (10. 5 %) and financial difficulty (8. 7 %) were the other contributing factors for non-adherence. Efforts were taken to increase the medication adherence and self care through patient education by pharmacists.

40|$|Background: Since November 2006, Coartem® (Artemether-Lumefantrine-ALu) {{replaced}} Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine {{as first}} line {{drug of choice}} for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania. Taking many pills of ALu, more than once daily for several days {{has proved to be}} problematic than single SP dose. Objectives: We assessed adherence to Artemether-lumefantrine treatment in patients with uncomplicated Malaria in rural Bagamoyo Materials and Methods: Confirmed malaria Patients were prescribed with ALu and then followed to their homes on day 3 where adherence was assessed by interviews and pill counts. In addition, blood slides for malaria parasites count were taken and axillary temperature was measured. The participants returned to the dispensary on day- 7 where venous blood samples (2 ml) for measurement of blood Lumefantrine concentrations and blood slides were collected. Lumefantrine plasma concentrations were described by age group and category of adherence as means with corresponding standard deviations. Results: Among 143 patients with analyzable data, 10 / 143 (7 %) were probably adherent. The rest were probably or definitely <b>non</b> <b>adherent.</b> Non adherence was attributed to taking fewer doses (20. 8 %) and untimely dosing (72. 2 %). Blister packs were available in 122 (85. 3 %) of the visited households and tablets were still remaining in 29 (23. 8 %) of the patients. 13 / 90 (14. 4. 0 %) of the patients had Lumefantrine level < 175 ng/ml. The difference in mean Lumefantrine concentration between the adherent and <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> groups was not statistically significant (p= 0. 643). The median Lumefantrine concentration was higher in the adherent group (586. 20 ng/ml, range 268. 60 - 715. 90) as compared to <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> group (403. 20 ng/ml range 0. 00 - 2239. 80). None of the patients failed to achieve parasite clearance on day- 3 and day- 7. Conclusions: The overall adherence in the remote rural Bagamoyo population appears to be low. Non adherence is mainly due to untimely intake of ALu doses rather than missing doses. Day- 3 and day- 7 parasite clearance can be achieved despite the patients not completing drug intake and even those with sub-therapeutic day- 7 blood Lumefantrine concentrations...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the pattern of non-adherence to diabetic therapy and associated factors among type 2 diabetic patients. A cross sectional study was conducted from February 01 to April 30, 2011, at Jimma University Specialized Hospital diabetic clinic. Data on Socio-demographic characteristics, disease related and medication related factors, complexity of regimen and drug side effects were collected. Medication non-adherence was measured using a self-reported 4 -item Morisky scale. Patient characteristics, number and dosing of all prescribed medications, glycemic control levels, diabetes related complications, co-morbid conditions and diabetes related admissions were reviewed from patient records. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify the factors related to non-adherence. Among the total of 267 type 2 diabetic patients (mean age 52. 4 ± 11. 9), the prevalence of non-adherence was 24. 3 % (n = 267). About half of the patients 140 (52. 4 %) were on Metformin/Glibenclamide based combination therapy. Patients with depressive symptoms (AOR = 2. 404, 95 % CI = 1. 323 - 4. 366, p = 0. 004) and who experienced side effects (AOR = 1. 868, 95 % CI = 1. 012 - 3. 446, p = 0. 046) were twice more likely to be <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> than without depressive symptoms and without manifesting side effects, respectively.

We have proposed this process as a model system for selection of transformed cells from normal cells. Results This report demonstrates that some fibroblasts can survive during late stages of anoikis, at which time they exhibit transformation-associated properties such as in vitro colony formation in soft agar and in vivo subcutaneous tumour formation in nude mice. Cytogenetic characterisation of these cells revealed that they contained a t (2; 2) derivative chromosome and they have a selective survival advantage in <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> conditions. Gene expression profile indicated that these cells over expressed genes related to hypoxia, glycolysis and tumor suppression/metastasis which could be helpful in their retaining a transformed phenotype. Conclusion Our results reveal some new links between anoikis and cell transformation and they provide a reproducible model system which can potentially be useful to study multistage cancer and to identify new targets for drug development. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of anti-hypertensive medications with increasing efficacy up to 50 % of hypertensive patients have blood pressure levels (BP) not at the goals set by international societies. Some of these patients are either not optimally treated or are <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> to the prescribed drugs, however, a relevant proportion, despite adequate treatment, have resistant hypertension (RH), which represents an important problem in that is associated to an excess risk of cardiovascular events. Notwithstanding a complex pathogenesis, an abundance of data suggests a key contribution for the mineralocorticoid receptor in RH, thus fostering a potential role for its antagonists in this field. Based on these premises randomized clinical trials have been completed aimed at testing the efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) s in RH patients and demonstrated their efficacy in reducing BP and markers of target organ damage, such as microalbuminuria, compared to either placebo or other drugs. In summary, owing {{to the role of}} the mineralocorticoid receptors in the pathogenesis of RH and on their efficacy proved by randomized clinical trials we advocate the inclusion of MRAs as a forth line therapy in patients with RH...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} factors of adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment (ART), factors or variables that can discriminate between adherent and non-adherent patients on ART were selected. Simple structured questionnaire was employed. The study {{sample consisted of}} 145 HIV patients who received ART in the Shashemene General Hospital (SGH). Using self report measure of adherence in the two weeks of study period, 81 % of the patients on ART were adherent whereas 19 % of the patients were <b>non</b> <b>adherent.</b> The major reasons of non-adherence were: forget to take (28. 6 %), confused on {{how and when to}} take (17. 9 %) and feel depressed (14. 2 %). Using discriminant analysis, depression, poor NGO support and HIV serostatus disclosure were identified as barriers of adherence while transportation problem, strong NGO support, good reception in the service area and high CD 4 count were identified as facilitators of adherence. To improve adherence of patients on ART, it was recommend that the current ART program should strive to manage depression before and after the initiation of ART and also strong linkage between NGOs which are working in care and support program must be established...|$|E
40|$|Laminin {{has been}} shown to promote the {{malignant}} phenotype and the level of the 32 / 67 Kd laminin receptor has been found to correlate with Dukes' staging of colon cancer. A biopsy of a Dukes' stage B 2 human colon carcinoma formed a tumor in a nude mouse after coinjection with Matrigel. The parental tumor and the murine tumor appeared identical at the histological level. A cell line LCC-C 1 was established from the murine tumor. The cell line appeared moderately differentiated although it did not produce mucin in vitro; however, the xenograft in vivo did produce low levels of mucin. Laminin adherent and non-adherent cell lines were selected. The parental and the laminin-selected cell subclones adhered equally well to plastic and to fibronectin and showed similar growth rates on plastic. When injected subcutaneously into nude mice, the laminin-adherent cells formed relatively undifferentiated tumors that were twice as large as the parental cell tumors whereas the laminin <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> cells formed very small, but highly differentiated tumors. These data demonstrate that subpopulations of tumor cells which differ in their tumorigenic properties can be selected based on their adhesion to laminin and thus provide models for studying the mechanisms of tumor growth...|$|E
40|$|Antihypertensive {{pharmacotherapy}} {{is associated}} with poor adherence. No validated method exists to establish patients’ likely adherence level. A systematic review and a single, Swedish community pharmacy practice-based pilot study were undertaken investigating blood pressure (BP) optimization from pharmacist-led, community pharmacy based antihypertensive adherence interventions titrated to individual patients. The systematic review showed generic interventions are often used for optimizing BP. Different intervention outcomes vary: positive, negative and no effect has been demonstrated. Pilot study participants (n= 153) were categorised into adherence subgroups (A=Adherent, IR=Intentionally <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> rational, II=Intentionally non-adherent irrational, U=Unintentionally non-adherent) based on responses to questionnaire format adherence screens. Interventions were designed intuitively to optimize adherence for each subgroup: changes in blood pressure and adherence attitudes were assessed. A significant reduction in mean systolic BP (SBP) (3 mmHg, P< 0. 05), with no change in mean diastolic BP (DBP) was seen overall. However, outcomes varied with subgroup: adherence was enhanced in the U subgroup (decreased SBP: 3 mmHg; DBP: no change), but indications of a detrimental effect were observed in the II subgroup (SBP: no change; increased DBP: 3 mmHg). It is feasible to assign patients to different adherence subgroups in community pharmacy, which may optimize medicines adherence through personalization of interventions...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of cell mass and growth {{can be difficult}} with traditional techniques, leaving unanswered questions about how exactly cells grow and divide and how cell mass responds to changes in state or therapeutic treatment. A challenge encountered by other developing mass measurement techniques is accommodating the breadth in the modes of growth of various cell types. This dissertation introduces and develops live cell interferometry (LCI) for the optical tracking and rapid mass profiling of live cells with varying growth types. Mass quantification is demonstrated with picogram resolution on both adherent and <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> cells as well as single cells and colony-forming cells. The flexibility and speed of the LCI is applied to assess the sensitivity of four human breast cancer lines (BT- 474, MDA-MB- 231, SK-BR- 3, MCF- 7) to the HER 2 -directed monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) and to the growth dynamics of human pluripotent stem cells (HSF 1) differentiating under retinoic acid treatment. With the LCI, detecting {{the sensitivity of the}} breast cancer lines to trastuzumab is 20 times faster than traditional proliferation assays, an important advancement towards individualized cancer treatment where patient samples are fragile. Dense clusters of stem cells also pose no barrier and intracolony motion is quantified in addition to overall colony growth...|$|E
40|$|To assess {{nutritional}} {{adherence to}} treatment among obese or overweight patients {{and to examine}} the relationship between anthropometrical variables, 94 subjects between 20 - 50 years old randomly selected were recruited at two nutritional health centers in Medellin-Colombia. Nutritional adherence to treatment was evaluated using a questionnaire, with a total score above 24 considered as adherent to the treatment. In addition, socio-demographic information was obtained and anthropometrical variables were measured. We used descriptive statistical, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square for proportions comparison, and Student T test or U Mann Whitney for means comparison. A 68 % of the patients were classified as no adherent to the nutritional treatment, with significant differences found according to physical activity (p= 0, 013). Mean weight (p= 0, 014), BMI (p= 0, 026), waist circumference (p= 0, 005) and waisthip ratio (p= 0, 022) differed according to adherence, being significantly higher in <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> patients. Percent body fat did not change by degree of adherence. However when controls were separated by gender the results were significant for both men and women.

40|$|Background: The adult {{central nervous}} system (CNS) {{contains}} different populations of immature cells that could possibly be used to repair brain and spinal cord lesions. The diversity and the properties of these cells in the human adult CNS remain to be fully explored. We previously isolated Nestin + Sox 2 + neural multipotential cells from the adult human spinal cord using the neurosphere method (i. e. <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> conditions and defined medium). Results: Here we report the isolation and long term propagation of another population of Nestin + cells from this tissue using adherent culture conditions and serum. QPCR and immunofluorescence indicated that these cells had mesenchymal features {{as evidenced by the}} expression of Snai 2 and Twist 1 and lack of expression of neural markers such as Sox 2, Olig 2 or GFAP. Indeed, these cells expressed markers typical of smooth muscle vascular cells such as Calponin, Caldesmone and Acta 2 (Smooth muscle actin). These cells could not differentiate into chondrocytes, adipocytes, neuronal and glial cells, however they readily mineralized when placed in osteogenic conditions. Further characterization allowed us to identify the Nkx 6. 1 transcription factor as a marker for these cells. Nkx 6. 1 was expressed in vivo by CNS vascular muscular cells located in the parenchyma and the meninges.

40|$|When clients {{demonstrate}} noncompliant behavior, {{it creates}} both a unique challenge {{and often a}} source of frustration, bewilderment, and anger for home health nurses. Home health nurses are concerned about clients ’ noncompliant behavior since their clients’ health problems are potentially serious and can pose significant risks to the length and/or quality of their clients ’ lives if the treatment recommendations are not followed. NANDA-International’s Nursing Diagnoses: Definitions & Classifications defines noncompliance as “behavior of a person and/or caregiver that fails to coin-cide with a health-promoting or therapeutic plan agreed on by the person (and/or family and/or community) and health-care professional. In {{the presence of an}} agreed-on, health-promoting or therapeutic plan, person’s or caregiver’s behavior is fully or partially <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> and may lead to clinically ineffective or partially in-effective outcomes. ” (NANDA-I, 2005, p. 124) According to NANDA-I, the characteristics of non-compliance are the client’s failure to progress, exacer-bation of his or her symptoms, or development of complications as evidenced by either objective tests or behavior that is indicative of failure to adhere to his or her treatment plan (NANDA-I, 2005, p. 124). The prevalence of client noncompliance is stagger-ing. Estimates vary widely, but noncompliance with treatment regimes can range from 20 % to a staggering 80 %, depending on the kind of treatment (Thobaben, Fossett, & Nadler-Moodie, 2004).

40|$|Background. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is {{associated}} with activation of mTOR signaling pathways. Recent studies showed that the anti-diabetic agent metformin decreases proliferation of cancer cells through AMPK-dependent inhibition of mTOR. The objective of current study — assessment {{of the effect of}} metformin on MTC cells. Materials and Methods. Performed growth, viability, migration and resistance to anoikis assays using two MTC-derived cell lines (TT and MZ-CRC- 1). Expressions of molecular targets of metformin were examined in MTC cell lines and in 14 human MTCs tissue samples. Results. We found that metformin inhibited growth and decreased expression of Cyclin D 1 in MTC cells. Treatment with metformin was associated with inhibition of mTOR/p 70 S 6 K/pS 6 signaling and with down-regulation of pERK in both TT and MZ-CRC- 1 cells. Metformin had no significant effects on pAKT in the cell lines examined. Metformin inducible AMPK activation was noted only in TT cells. Treatment with AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) or AMPK silencing did not prevent growth-inhibitory effects of metformin in TT cells. Metformin had no effect on MTC cell migration, but reduced the ability of cells to form multi-cellular spheroids in <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> conditions. Immunostaining of human MTC showed over-expression of Cyclin D 1 in all tumors compared to corresponding normal tissue. Activation of mTOR/p 70 S 6 K was detected in 8 / 14 (57. 1 %) of examined tumors. Conclusions. Together these findings indicate that growth inhibitory effects in MTC cells are associated with down-regulation of both mTOR/ 6 SK and pERK signaling pathways. Expression of metformin’s molecular targets in human MTC cells suggests its potential utility for the treatment of MTC in patients...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{identify}} Heart Failure patients' beliefs {{towards their}} medications {{and how these}} beliefs relate to adherence. Method Patients attending a multi-disciplinary, community based heart failure clinic on the Gold Coast, Australia were interviewed using a questionnaire composed of fours parts: repertory grid technique; Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ); Medicines Adherence Reporting Scale (MARS); demographic details. Patients were divided into those categorised as adherent (MARS score C 23) and those categorised as non-adherent (MARS score/ 23). Necessity beliefs scores from BMQ {{and the frequency of}} statements generated from the repertory grid portion of the questionnaire were compared between these two groups. Results Forty-three patients were interviewed with a mean age (ᓄ) of 64 (ᱷ) years and thirty-six (83. 7 %) were male. Thirty-seven (86. 0 %) patients were categorised as adherent; the remaining six (14. 0 %) as nonadherent. The 43 patients generated a total of 262 statements about their medicines. The three most common themes identified were Related to fluid (36. 6 %), Helps the heart (31. 7 %) and Related to weight (13. 7 %). There was a significantly higher median necessity score in the adherent group compared to the <b>non</b> <b>adherent</b> group (22. 0 vs. 19. 5, p = 0. 0272). Patients with a strong necessity score also had significantly higher self reported adherence compared to patients with a strong concerns score (21. 5 vs. 18. 0, p = 0. 006). Conclusion This study suggests that patients with heart failure possessing a strong belief in the necessity of their treatment regimen are more likely to demonstrate better adherence.
