40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} {{the utility of}} restricted <b>neck</b> movement in epidemiologic case definition for <b>neck</b> disorders. METHODS: Data on <b>neck</b> pain, sensory symptoms in the arm, psychosocial and physical risk factors for <b>neck</b> disorders, {{and the range of}} active <b>neck</b> movements were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire, interview, and physical examination for a community-based sample of 2145 adults aged 25 - 64 years. The prevalence of <b>neck</b> pain and sensory symptoms was examined according to the extent of <b>neck</b> movements. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of risk factors to <b>neck</b> disorders, defined by various combinations of pain and restricted movement, and the associations were compared. RESULTS: The ranges of different categories of <b>neck</b> movement were correlated within persons, and their sum ("total <b>neck</b> movement") was unimodally distributed across persons. The prevalence of <b>neck</b> pain and sensory symptoms was elevated when total <b>neck</b> movement was below the 30 th centile, and particularly below the 10 th centile. Associations between <b>neck</b> pain and low vitality and poor support at work were stronger when there was also restricted <b>neck</b> movement, but the extent of <b>neck</b> movement did not materially modify the relation of <b>neck</b> pain to physical risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The restriction of total <b>neck</b> movement may serve as a marker of severity in community-based studies of <b>neck</b> disorders, but no indication was found that it distinguishes a subset of cases with a distinct etiology...|$|R
500|$|Male giraffes {{use their}} necks as weapons in combat, a {{behaviour}} known as [...] "necking". <b>Necking</b> {{is used to}} establish dominance and males that win <b>necking</b> bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity <b>necking,</b> the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity <b>necking,</b> the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then get ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on {{the weight of the}} skull and the arc of the swing. A <b>necking</b> duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.|$|E

In tertiary creep, the strain rate exponentially increases with stress because of <b>necking</b> phenomena or internal cracks or voids decreases the effective area of the specimen. Strength is quickly lost in this stage while the material's shape is permanently changed. The acceleration of creep deformation in the tertiary stage eventually leads to material fracture.|$|E
50|$|In January 1999, Taylor {{began making}} guitars with a patented, bolt-on <b>neck</b> {{they called the}} NT (new technology) <b>neck.</b> It differs from other guitar <b>necks</b> by using one {{continuous}} piece of wood {{all the way to}} the 19th fret to support the fretboard. More common practice in guitar <b>neck</b> construction is to support the fretboard up to the fourteenth fret, and glue the unsupported portion to the soundboard. The NT <b>neck</b> fits into a pocket on the top of the guitar body, achieving the desired angle with small shims. Guitars sometimes require a <b>neck</b> angle realignment (<b>neck</b> reset). Taylor's system achieves this by changing the shims to adjust the <b>neck</b> angle. Prior to 1999, Taylor Guitars had a simpler bolt-on <b>neck</b> design. Those <b>necks</b> can also be adjusted without the more complex process of ungluing the <b>neck</b> joint.|$|R

Twenty-two patients who underwent PMF recon-struction were studied. The control group comprised 35 patients with <b>neck</b> dissection (without PMF). <b>Neck</b> dissections in both groups were classified into 3 grades; grade 1 : no <b>neck</b> dissection/selective <b>neck</b> dissection; grade 2 : modified radical <b>neck</b> dissection; grade 3 : radical <b>neck</b> dissection/extended radical <b>neck</b> dissection.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{study the}} {{relation}} between <b>neck</b> pain and work related <b>neck</b> flexion, <b>neck</b> rotation, and sitting.  METHODS—A prospective cohort study was performed with a follow up of 3  years among 1334  workers from 34  companies. Work related physical load was assessed by analysing objectively measured exposure data (video recordings) of <b>neck</b> flexion, <b>neck</b> rotation, and sitting posture. <b>Neck</b> pain was assessed by a questionnaire. Adjustments were made for various physical factors that were related or not related to work, psychosocial factors, and individual characteristics.  RESULTS—A significant positive relation {{was found between the}} percentage of the working time in a sitting position and <b>neck</b> pain, implying an increased risk of <b>neck</b> pain for workers who were sitting for more than 95 % of the working time (crude relative risk (RR) 2. 01,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 04  to 3. 88; adjusted RR 2. 34,  95 % CI 1. 05  to 5. 21).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Neck</b> {{dissection}} is {{an important}} surgical procedure {{for the management of}} metastatic nodal disease in the <b>neck.</b> The gold standard of <b>neck</b> nodal management has been the radical <b>neck</b> dissection. Any modification in the <b>neck</b> dissection is always compared with this standard. Over the last few decades, in order to alleviate the morbidity of radical <b>neck</b> dissection, several modifications and conservative procedures have been advocated. These procedures retain certain lymphatic or non-lymphatic structures and have been shown not to compromise oncological safety. Methods A literature search of the Medline was carried out for all articles on <b>neck</b> dissections. The articles were systematically reviewed to analyze and trace the evolution of <b>neck</b> dissection. These were then categorized to address the nomenclature, management of node positive and node negative <b>neck</b> including those who had received chemoradiation. Results The present article discusses the <b>neck</b> nodal nomenclature, the radical <b>neck</b> dissection, its modifications and migration to more conservative procedures and possible advances in the near future. Conclusion Radical <b>neck</b> dissection is now replaced with modified radical <b>neck</b> dissections in most situations. Attempts are being made to replace modified radical <b>neck</b> dissections with selective <b>neck</b> dissections for early node positivity. Sentinel node biopsy is being studied {{to address the issue of}} node negative <b>neck.</b> More conservative surgeries are likely to replace the 'radical' surgeries of bygone era.
