40|$|The recent mass fruiting <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> in Borneo is {{an urgent}} wakeup call: {{existing}} policy instruments, financial mechanisms, and forestry infrastructure are inadequate {{to take full}} advantage of these infrequent opportunities for for- est restoration and conservation. Tropical forest restoration can provide sub- stantial benefits for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and poverty alleviation. Yet the unpredictability of the synchronized flowering and consequent mass fruiting <b>of</b> many <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> in Borneo presents a distinctive set <b>of</b> challenges for <b>forest</b> restoration. Significant financing and a considerable coordinated effort are required to prepare for future mass fruiting events if we are to capitalize on opportunities for ecological restoration. The continued high rate <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> clearance in this region and the rarity of mass fruiting events suggest that there may be few remaining opportunities to prevent widespread species extinctions. In this article we propose a facilitatory policy framework for forest restoration in Borneo to stimulate action in advance of the next mass fruiting <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Forest {{cultures}} in continental part of Croatia are mainly based on bracken-covered areas and moors on deserted agriculture soils and pastures. Successful afforestation i. e. establishment <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> cultures depends {{among other things}} on the understanding of habitats and ecology <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees.</b> The choice <b>of</b> best species <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> for afforestation needs {{to be based on}} the research in soil and climate characteristics of target habitats. The aims of this research were to show mesoclimatic characteristics of Ličko sredogorje and microclimatic and pedological characteristics of Ličko polje. Also, based on habitat characteristics and ecology <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees,</b> the aim was to determine species <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> suitable for afforestation of bracken-covered areas. Materials and Methods: Climate, microclimate, pedological and plant nutrition researches were done at the area of Lika highlands. Climate analysis was done according to air temperatures, amount of precipitation, relative air humidity and other climate elements and appearances. Composite soil samples were taken from the depth of 0 - 30 cm in order to determine plant nutrition potential. Samples were prepared for further analysis in the laboratory. Results: The highest average annual air temperature of 9. 6 °C was found at weather station Gračac and the lowest at Korenica station (8. 1 °C). Average amount of precipitation for this region was around 1500 mm. Monthly rain factors were ranging from arid to perhumid. Considering thermal character of the climate, the area has moderately warm climate. Average volumetric soil humidity is 14. 2 %. Soil has strong acid reaction, is very humus, good to richly supplied with total nitrogen, content of physiologically active phosphorus and potassium is low, and C/N ration normal. Conclusions: According to habitat characteristics in the area of Ličko sredogorje and ecological demands <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species, <b>forest</b> cultures <b>of</b> Common birch (Betula pendula Roth.), Common spruce (Picea abies Karst.), Eastern white pine (Pinus strubus L.), Black pine (Pinus nigra subsp. austriaca Asch i Gr.), Common pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European trembling aspen (Populus tremula L.) can be established...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleConsidering the {{continuous}} influx of Mozambican refugees to Malawi as an external {{shock to the}} forest ecosystem, a dynamic model of optimizing the use <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> resources is developed in this paper. Land clearing for refugee camp sites, construction material, fuelwood and agricultural crop production constitute {{a major threat to}} forest resources in the refugee populated areas. The model presented in the paper provides a framework for analysing various afforestation and technology policies to increase the sustainable use <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> resources. The optimal conditions for choosing the levels of land clearing for various uses of refugee population are derived. The model parameters are used to identify the optimal timing and rate of afforestation that will attain a dynamic equilibrium <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> resources. Several policy implications are derived from the model results for reducing the environmental degradation <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources due to the presence of refugees. It is argued that the general environmental regulation policies based on user-pay principles may not be appropriate under the refugee situation and that additional intervention is needed by the host government and international relief agencies for reversing the trends in deforestation.

This was to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) values from the respondents {{as a measure of}} value for the conservation <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> on the campus. The respondents were private individuals purposively selected from among the academic and non-academic staff members. A total of 68 respondents (45 %) were willing to pay amounts of money ranging from # 5 to# 1000 monthly. The modal value was # 100 having recorded the highest percentage of response (41 %). The mean monthly WTP values ranged from # 70 to # 154 with corresponding aggregate values of # 23450 and # 51724 (1 USD=# 129). These amounts represented the estimated monthly monetary values {{of the environmental}} service functions <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> at the study site.

We grew nonmycorrhizal seedlings and seedlings mycorrhizal with Paxillus involutus Batsch in a sand culture system with two compartments separated by a 45 -mu m Nylon mesh. Hyphae, but not roots, can penetrate this net. Labeling the compartment only accessible to hyphae with Mg- 25 showed that hyphae of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus transported Mg to their host plant. No label was found in nonmycorrhizal control plants. Our data support the idea that ectomycorrhizas are important for the Mg nutrition <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
