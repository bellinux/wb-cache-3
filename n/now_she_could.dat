60|$|Up to {{this point}} Rachel endured the lecture in silence, but <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear no more.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed a}} little laugh; her nature {{was so full}} of it that even <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not keep it back.|$|E
60|$|And {{he made a}} {{step forward}} so that <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not move toward the {{carriage}} without brushing against him. But she made no reply.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her as though doubting even <b>now</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} be in earnest.|$|R
60|$|Her next words {{supplied}} a solution. They {{were under}} shelter {{of one of}} the boats <b>now</b> and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make herself heard.|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} read {{his face as he}} stood looking at her <b>now,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find no hope in it. The eyes that met hers were cold and expressionless.|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{had been}} ashamed {{to appear to}} {{comprehend}} so soon as she really did; but <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> safely suggest the name of [...] "Louisa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, good morning!" [...] She was fluent {{enough on}} the witness-stand and in the police station, but <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not find a word to say.|$|E
60|$|Never a tear had she shed {{since the}} news first came, and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> weep, she could weep her grief out. She {{abandoned}} herself unreservedly to this blessed relief....|$|E
60|$|They {{turned to}} the left into a road that had many trees. <b>Now</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> breathe and look about her, Thyme once more held her head erect and began to swing her arms.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was only}} eighteen, and as fair as could be, With her tempting smiles And maidenly wiles, And {{he was a}} trifle past seventy-three: <b>Now</b> what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see Is a puzzle to me, In a prophet of seventy--seventy-three! ...|$|R
60|$|Something {{encompassed}} her <b>now</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not define: {{the warmth}} of Love, the sense of protection and security--almost as if unseen arms, that were strong and devoted and selfless, held her closely, shielding her from evil and from the taint of selfish human passions.|$|R
60|$|Even <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not admit, to Ursula, {{that she}} wanted to keep it, as a memento, or a symbol. But Ursula knew, and was not pleased. So the subject was {{switched}} off.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} {{anything}} that could be altered," [...] Mrs. Harvey said, [...] "I have a dressmaker in the house <b>now.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> easily do what you need. She's looking over my wardrobe." ...|$|E
60|$|She durst look again, and {{saw that}} he had {{scrambled}} up to the boys' perch, and had lifted Adrian up, but there was white spray dashing round <b>now.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not see the boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a way, I suppose I did," [...] {{admitted}} the other. [...] "I don’t know <b>now</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have {{me up for}} breach of promise, because when I asked her I did it this way. I said, ’Will you be Mrs. Robinson?’ What do you think?" ...|$|R
60|$|And moreover, if <b>now</b> {{and then}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{have a good}} talk with someone {{understanding}} and intelligent, someone <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust, someone who cared {{enough for her to}} think with her and for her....|$|R
60|$|Juanna awoke {{from her}} stupor. What {{was to be}} done <b>now?</b> <b>she</b> wondered. What <b>could</b> be done? Everything seemed lost. Then of a sudden an {{inspiration}} took her.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{softness}} {{that appealed}} to Mrs. Keith in his dark-blue eyes. She had been fond of Dick Blake in his younger days and firmly believed in him. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not credit his being guilty of cowardice.|$|E
60|$|The {{thing had}} been {{so close to the}} top of her mind ever since she had come to the {{knowledge}} of it that it had been hard for her to keep it down. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> keep it down no longer.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{softness}} in {{his dark}} blue eyes that appealed to Mrs. Keith. She had been fond of Dick Blake in his younger days and firmly believed in him. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not credit his being guilty of cowardice.|$|E
60|$|The {{note was}} written without pause or hesitation. It had been thought out {{before it was}} begun. It was strange, even to herself, how easily {{it had come to}} her, after having had it so much on her mind for the last month. <b>She</b> {{wondered}} <b>now</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have hesitated so long; how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever have doubted as to what she would say to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Ambient {{came down}} to meet me as I alighted, {{and told me that}} he was {{sleeping}} so soundly, after a restless night, that she did n't wish him disturbed. I assured her I would n't disturb him, but she said he was quite safe <b>now</b> and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look after him herself." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} had <b>now</b> done what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> for {{the aspect of}} the chamber; and, commending the young man to the {{protection}} of the saints, took her departure.|$|R
60|$|Her {{trip was}} a fact now; no chance could rob her of it. She had looked forward twenty-three years toward it, and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look back at it accomplished. She took up her burden again, never more {{thinking}} to lay it down.|$|E
60|$|Annie's {{question}} had been suggested by a belated reluctance {{to appear before}} so much of Hatboro' {{in charge of the}} minister's child. But <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not retreat, and with Idella's hand in hers she advanced blushing up the aisle to her pew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not {{you think}} his {{forehead}} like--" [...] and she looked {{to the end of}} the room where hung the portraits of two young children, the brothers Geoffrey and Frederick. Henrietta had often longed to see it, but <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> attend to nothing but her mamma.|$|E
60|$|Even then Jeanne was reluctant. They {{were on the}} top of the grass-grown dyke <b>now,</b> {{and below}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dimly see the dark, {{swelling}} water lapping against the gravel bottom.|$|R
60|$|And {{of course}} she had got her way. Could he resist her in anything? They had never spoken of it since, {{it was such a}} sad little ring. Sad! It was not in the least little bit sad. Grizel {{wondered}} as she looked at it <b>now</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever have thought it sad.|$|R
6000|$|Esther's {{eyes were}} fixed upon the speaker. <b>She</b> marvelled <b>now</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have been so blind. The cadaverous face {{was nothing but a}} splendid use of grease paint! The rags! the dirt! the whole {{assumption}} of a hideous character was masterly! But there were the eyes, deep-set, and thoughtful and kind. How did she fail to guess? ...|$|R
60|$|Next {{she heard}} a sound as of a great snake {{dragging}} itself along painfully. A while passed, then a trembling hand thrust a little gourd of water through the hole. She drank, and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak, though the water seemed to flow through her veins like fire.|$|E
60|$|Miss Schuyler {{strained}} her ears, but, {{though the}} horses were walking <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hear nothing. The deep silence round them was emphasized by the soft trample of the hoofs and thin jingle of steel that seemed unreal and out of place there in the wilderness of snow and stars.|$|E
6000|$|The words {{jumped from}} Jean to save Margaret from falling. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not take them back. [...] "I winna believe it o' him," [...] said Jean to herself. [...] "Let them {{say what they}} will, I'll be true to him; and {{when he comes back}} he'll find her as he left her." ...|$|E
60|$|Her lodgings being nearly {{opposite}} her stepfather's former residence, <b>now</b> Farfrae's, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see Donald and Lucetta speeding {{in and out}} of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation. She avoided looking that way as much as possible, but it was hardly in human nature to keep the eyes averted when the door slammed.|$|R
60|$|But Una {{was certain}} <b>now</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> manage business, could wheedle Bessies and face pompous vice-presidents and satisfy querulous Mr. Wilkinses. She looked forward; she picked at {{architecture}} as portrayed in Mr. Wilkins's big books; she learned the reason and {{manner of the}} rows of semi-detached, semi-suburban, semi-comfortable, semi-cheap, and somewhat less than semi-attractive houses.|$|R
60|$|Descending {{from the}} table, {{she left the}} parlour, and went upstairs, {{intending}} to enter the room overhead, which was the bedchamber {{at the back of}} the drawing-room. But, nerveless woman as <b>she</b> had <b>now</b> become, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bring herself to attempt the handle. She listened. The dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat.|$|R
