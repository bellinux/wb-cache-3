5000|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>batteries</b> make {{up about}} 90% of the $50 billion battery market, but {{secondary}} batteries have been gaining market share. About 15 billion <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> are thrown away worldwide every year, virtually all ending up in landfills. Due to the toxic heavy metals and strong acids they contain, batteries are hazardous waste. Most municipalities classify them as such and require separate disposal. The energy needed to manufacture a battery is about 50 {{times greater than the}} energy it contains. Due to their high pollutant content compared to their small energy content, the <b>primary</b> <b>battery</b> is considered a wasteful, environmentally unfriendly technology. Due mainly to increasing sales of wireless devices and cordless tools which cannot be economically powered by <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> and come with integral rechargeable batteries, the secondary battery industry has high growth and has slowly been replacing the <b>primary</b> <b>battery</b> in high end products.|$|R

50|$|Primary {{cells are}} most {{economical}} for infrequent use. Some types of lithium primary cell {{can be stored}} for years with less risk of leakage compared with zinc-type batteries.

Lithium <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> are also useful at lower temperatures than zinc batteries, {{all of which have}} water-based electrolytes. Lithium <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> have a lower internal resistance than zinc <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> and so are more efficient in high-drain flashlights.|$|R

50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are useful}} where {{long periods of}} storage are required; a <b>primary</b> <b>battery</b> can be {{constructed}} to have a lower self-discharge rate than a rechargeable battery, so all its capacity is available for useful purposes. Applications that require a small current for a long time, for example a smoke detector, also use <b>primary</b> <b>batteries</b> since the self-discharge current of a rechargeable battery would exceed the load current and limit service time to {{a few days or}} weeks. For example, a flashlight used for emergencies must work when needed, even if it has sat on a shelf for a long time. Primary cells are also more cost-efficient in this case, as rechargeable batteries would use {{only a small fraction of}} available recharge cycles. Reserve batteries achieve very long storage time (on the order of 10 years or more) without loss of capacity, by physically separating the components of the battery and only assembling them at the time of use. Such constructions are expensive but are found in applications like munitions, which may be stored for years before use.|$|R
