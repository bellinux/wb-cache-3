40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A high savings {{culture is}} {{important}} for sustainable economic development of any country. Whilst Botswana {{has one of the}} highest gross national savings in sub-Saharan Africa, the same cannot be said regarding household savings. Household savings in Botswana have grown at a very slow pace between 2003 and 2012, a worrisome trend given the importance of savings. The main objective of the research assignment was to determine the factors that influence households saving behaviour in Botswana. A probit econometric model was used to find out what factors influence households to choose to save and which ones influence them not to save. Saving behaviour was measured by whether an individual has saved money with a financial institution within the past 12 months. The individual characteristics that were modelled for influence on households saving behaviour were age, income level, education level, gender, formal credit, informal credit, insurance and property ownership. The results indicated that, as suggested by theory and empirical evidence, age, income level and education level have a positive and significant influence on households saving behaviour, whereas, also in line with theory, formal and informal credit and insurance have a negative and significant influence on households saving behaviour. Being female also has a negative but insignificant influence on households saving behaviour. Contrary to expectations, property ownership, which was used as proxy for <b>non-financial</b> <b>assets,</b> has <b>a</b> positive influence on household saving behaviour, although the influence is not significant...|$|R

40|$|Summary: This {{statistical}} indicators paper {{identifies the}} recent {{trends in the}} value, sales and acquisitions of NSW public sector <b>assets,</b> at <b>a</b> whole of government, and individual department and public sector corporation level (selected by order of asset value for the 2012 - 13 financial year). As a preliminary to that discussion, the paper also presents recent trends in the State Budget position. The data {{presented in this paper}} illustrates that real value of NSW public sector assets has increased consistently in the last decade or so. This has been driven predominantly by the revaluation of <b>non-financial</b> <b>assets</b> such as land and property, and also <b>non-financial</b> <b>asset</b> purchases. This growth has not been consistent across all NSW public sector organisations. Of those presented in this paper, it is evident that public trading enterprises with a high composition of land and property assets (such as the NSW Land and Housing Corporation) have experienced considerably higher real net asset value growth than other general government organisations (which are comprised of a higher proportion of operational assets subject to depreciation) ...|$|R

The account of nonfinancial assets has his specific in medical establishments. Reforms, which implemented in Ukraine, affecting the account of <b>non-financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Medical institutions relate to the General government. Methodology. The survey is based on a comparison of data from the national and international reforms in medical industry. Results of the survey showed that in the dictionary of V. Raizberg next determination is driven: "public sector – it is a set of business units, that carry out economic activity, are in a public domain, controlled by public authorities or designated and hired persons" (Raizberg, 1999). In the Commercial code of Ukraine it is indicated: "The subjects of public sector of economy are subjects that operate on the basis of only public domain, and also subjects, which state share in authorized capital exceeds fifty percents or be value that provides a right to the state for decisive influence on economic activity of these subjects" (СС, 2003). Practical implications. Public sector structure specifies data of International Public Sector Accounting Standards. Substancial load concept "public sector" in national and international practice are relevant (Poznyakovska, 2009). Accounting in health institutions has specific terms, inherent to the government sector. They are determined by the types of activity and terms of assignation (Pasichnik, 2005). Medical services must be accessible to all stratum of population. They must have free basis. They come forward as a public benefit independent of individual possibility to pay for him. Therefore lion's part of general charges for health protection is used on the grant of medical services to the population. At the same time "upgrading of medical services lies inplane providing of unitization of going near the grant of medicare, standardization of medical documentation, approaching of services to the patients by their decentralization and integration, in accordance with health care level" (Eshchenko, 2016).

Such prices require determining what hypothetical companies might pay for <b>assets,</b> <b>a</b> costly procedure at best.

Fair valuation of <b>non-financial</b> <b>assets,</b> required in certain circumstances (e. g., business combinations), is particularly difficult to apply. Furthermore, exit values of such assets as work-in-process inventories and special-purpose machines, as defined by SFAS 157, often are zero or negative.

Documented empirical evidence {{of the relationship between}} financial structure and financial crisis, sheds light on the relationship between asset price volatility - extreme variations in price - and financial structure. And the volatility of financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices provides <b>an</b> indirect link between an economy's financial structure and the likelihood of financial crisis. Using time-series data on a se of indicators measuring financial structure, the authors examine how Korea's financial structure affects the volatility of the real effective exchange rate, the money market rate, government bond yields, and stock prices. They find: 1) There is a stable long-term relationship between financial structure and volatility in the real effective exchange rate, the money market rate, stock prices, and the yield on government housing bonds. 2) Financial structure affects asset price variables asymmetrically. Some variables'volatility increases, and others'diminish, suggesting that monetary policies should target different asset markets to achieve different goals. If the goal of the monetary authority is to stabilize the money market rate, for example, intervening in the banking sector is more efficient than intervening in other financial sub-sectors. 3) The higher volatility of stock prices reflects the thin stock market in Korea. 4) The stability of the yield on government housing bonds reflects the Korean government's policy of stabilizing the nation's housing supply by isolating the housing market from the impact of Korea's financial structure. 5) Restrictions on foreigners'ownership of domestic stock in Korea during the periodanalyzed, and the fact that most capital flows through commercial banks, affect the exchange rate, which is determined (at least in the short run) by capital flows in the foreign exchange market.
