On the fifteenth night the scouts {{reported that the}}y were crossing the river, about five thousand horsemen and fifteen thousand foot soldiers, and that at the head of them marched the huge god-elephant Jana, on which rode Simba the King and a lame priest (evidently my friend whose foot had been injured by the pistol), who acted as a mahout. This part of the story I confess I did not believe, since it seemed to me impossible that anyone could ride upon that mad rogue, Jana. Yet, as subsequent events showed, it was in fact true. I suppose that in certain hands the beast became tame. Or perhaps it was drugged.|$|E

On 20 August 1942 he was posted to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford for a short time. MacLachlan flew {{as often as he}} could regardless of the activity.

50|$|WTMJ {{spent much}} of its life {{operating}} at 5 kW from Brookfield, which was still powerful enough to cover much of eastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.

The station's signal is directed generally north during both daytime and nighttime operation. During the day, four-towers are used.
