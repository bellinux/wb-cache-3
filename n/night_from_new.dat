This part of the story I confess I did not believe, since it seemed to me impossible that anyone could ride upon that mad rogue, Jana. Yet, as subsequent events showed, it was in fact true. I suppose that in certain hands the beast became tame. Or perhaps it was drugged.|$|E

50|$|While {{based at}} Crosby-on-Eden with 59 OTU MacLachlan spent time flying {{other types of}} {{aircraft}} including the Bristol Beaufighter. On 20 August 1942 he was posted to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford for a short time. MacLachlan flew {{as often as he}} could regardless of the activity.

50|$|WTMJ {{spent much}} of its life {{operating}} at 5 kW from Brookfield, which was still powerful enough to cover much of eastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.

The station's signal is directed generally north during both daytime and nighttime operation. During the day, four-towers are used.
