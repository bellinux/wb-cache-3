40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Creative Writing) The thesis shows how the novel The Apothecary's Tales manipulates narrative frames to create a 'simulachron', an unreliable virtual world, which problematises the reader's conceptions of the past. The novel transgresses the generic rules of 'historical fiction' to create a quality of 'historicity' located in the affect of alterity. This is argued to be a somatic response to peril deferred. The novel seeks to evoke alterity by defamiliarising linguistic norms. It does this principally {{through the use of}} 'diachronic polysemia' (lexical 'false friends') and intertexts to syncopate the reader continually between the disparate sensibilities of the 1 ih and 21 st centuries. These sensibilities are simulated in the novel by the imbedment of sociolects and 'hypomemes', the tacit thoughtways supposed peculiar to a given milieu. To self-authenticate its fictions, the novel employs the 'parafictive' devices of a testamentary found artifact, an unreliable narrator and editor, plausible sociologuemes (social conventions) and ideologuemes (ideologies that inform behaviour), along with a density of period minutiae putatively grounded in the record. Any truth effects achieved are then ludically subverted by a process of critique in which structural units of the novel systematically parody the other. The novel is patterned in the structure of a nested diptych, of expositions contra posed in a mutual commentary, which extends from the defining templates of plot and episode to the micro levels of morphemes in polysemic wordplay. The tropes of <b>nested</b> <b>framing</b> and repetition of form and syntagm are defined in the thesis, respectively, as encubi/atio and 'emblematic resonance'. It is argued that these tropes, encoded in a fictive discourse that defies closure, provide a simulation of hermetic form that -when mapped upon the aleatory life world -can be productive of aesthetic affect. The agonistic elements of plot and incident in the novel are figured within the tapas of theatre, foregrounded by the duplicitous self-fashioning of the characters, and by the continual metaleptic shifts or 'frame syncopation' of narrative viewpoint, both intra and extra-diegetic. Frame syncopation is used advisedly to dilemmatise significations at both the structural and syntagmatic levels. The thesis contends that such contrived collisions of narrative interpretation may be the dynamic of affectivity in all aesthetic discourse...|$|R

We also discuss an architecture that can achieve sufficient thermomechanical stability to match the pointing stability. This concept is motivated by advances in the development and testing of Ultra Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) flights which promise to allow observation campaigns lasting more than three months. The design incorporates a multi-stage pointing architecture comprising: a gondola coarse azimuth control system, a multi-axis <b>nested</b> gimbal <b>frame</b> structure with arcsecond stability, a telescope de-rotator to eliminate field rotation, and a fine guidance stage consisting of both a telescope mounted angular rate sensor and guide CCDs in the focal plane to drive a fast-steering mirror.

40|$|The Pi-calculus is a {{formalism}} {{to model}} and reason about highly concurrent and dynamic systems. Most of the expressive {{power of the}} language comes from the ability to pass communication channels among concurrent processes, as any other value. We present in this paper the CubeVM, an interpreter architecture for an applied variant of the Pi-calculus, focusing on its operational semantics. The main characteristic of the CubeVM comes from its stackless architecture. We show, in a formal way, that the resource management model inside the VM may be greatly simplified {{without the need for}} <b>nested</b> stack <b>frames.</b> This is particularly true for the garbage collection of processes and channels. The proposed GC, based on a reference counting scheme, is highly concurrent and, most interestingly, does automatically detect and reclaim cycles of disabled processes. We also address the main performance issues raised by the fine-grained concurrency model of the Pi-calculus. We introduce the reactive variant of the semantics that allows, when applicable, to increase the performance drastically by bypassing the scheduler. We define the language subset of processes in so called chain-reaction forms for which the sequential semantics can be proved statically. We illustrate the expressive power and performance gains of such chain-reactions with examples of functional, dataflow and object-oriented systems.

40|$|Although {{plants as}} sessile organisms are {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} stressors in the field, the stress factors for the above-ground and underground parts of the plant and their gene expression profiles are not the same. Here, we investigated NbKPILP, a gene encoding a new member of the ubiquitous, pathogenesis-related Kunitz peptidase inhibitor (KPI) -like protein family, that we discovered in the genome of Nicotiana benthamiana and other representatives of the Solanaceae family. The NbKPILP gene encodes a protein that has all the structural elements characteristic of KPI but in contrast to the proven A. thaliana KPI (AtKPI), it does not inhibit serine peptidases. Unlike roots, NbKPILP mRNA and its corresponding protein were not detected in intact leaves, but abiotic and biotic stressors drastically affected NbKPILP mRNA accumulation. In search of the causes of suppressed NbKPILP mRNA accumulation in leaves, we found that the NbKPILP gene is “matryoshka,” containing an alternative <b>nested</b> reading <b>frame</b> (ANRF) encoding a 53 -amino acid (aa) polypeptide (53 aa-ANRF) which has an amphipathic helix (AH). We confirmed ANRF expression experimentally. A vector containing a GFP-encoding sequence was inserted into the NbKPILP gene in frame with 53 aa-ANRF, resulting in a 53 aa-GFP fused protein that localized in the membrane fraction of cells. Using the 5 ′-RACE approach, we have shown that the expression of ANRF was not explained by the existence of a cryptic promoter within the NbKPILP gene but was controlled by the maternal NbKPILP mRNA. We found that insertion of mutations destroying the 53 aa-ANRF AH resulted in more than a two-fold increase of the NbKPILP mRNA level. The NbKPILP gene represents the first example of ANRF functioning as a repressor of a maternal gene in an intact plant. We proposed a model where the stress influencing the translation initiation promotes the accumulation of NbKPILP and its mRNA in leaves...|$|R
40|$|Out of {{the seven}} species of sea turtles in the world, six are {{classified}} as endangered. Mexico is home to five of these species which are protected by the government laws, however these animals are still subject to many threats, the most crucial is the poaching and illegal commerce of their eggs. There are programs related to the prevention of these illegal activities such as the surveillance of the beaches during nesting season but monitoring the long extension of beaches {{in the country is}} exhausting. In order to solve this problem, the current project proposes the use of drones to automatically detect sea turtle nests along the beach making use of machine learning and computer vision algorithms. However, sea turtle nests detection is a complex task due to the similarity between a nest and its surrounding area, therefore this project has explored the subject using the deep learning approach, particularly making use of Convolutional Neural Network architectures which have shown a success in challenges related to image classification and localisation and outperforms classical machine learning methods. In order to find the best architecture for this task, different architectures were trained and tested in similar conditions to classify an image as either nest or not a nest, then the best architecture was used for detecting <b>nests</b> using <b>frames</b> extracted from a video obtained using a drone. Finally, a tracking algorithm is proposed for detecting nests within a video stream in order to obtain a complete system for a real world application in a near future. Results show an encouraging performance in classification and recognition which is also non-dependent of the current task such that by performing the corresponding training, this algorithm could also be used for detecting another kind of objects.

40|$|Herpesviruses employ many {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune response, allowing them to persist life-long in their hosts. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA- 1) and, more recently, the latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA- 1) of the Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus {{have been shown to}} function as in cis-acting inhibitors of antigen presentation. In both proteins, long simple repeat elements are responsible for the inhibition, but the sequences of these repeats are strongly dissimilar. Intriguingly, EBNA- 1 mRNA contains a large <b>nested</b> open reading <b>frame</b> that codes for a 40. 7 kDa strongly acidic protein, in addition to the full-length EBNA- 1. This protein, here called pGZr, has a 230 amino-acids long glycine, glutamine, and glutamic acid-rich repeat ('GZ' repeat), highly similar (65 % amino-acid identity) to the acidic repeat of LANA- 1. To evaluate if pGZr, like EBNA- 1 and LANA- 1, can inhibit antigen presentation in cis, we fused the nested ORF with the E. coli-derived LacZ gene encoding beta-galactosidase. Whereas cells producing the unmodified beta-galactosidase readily present the H- 2 L(d) -restricted CTL epitope TPHPARIGL, which resides in the C-terminal region of beta-galactosidase, cells producing the pGZr-beta-galactosidase fusion protein do not. Also shorter fragments of the repeat can inhibit peptide presentation. Even though the physiological function of pGZr remains to be elucidated, the GZ-repeat protein may be valuable as inhibitor of presentation of antigenic peptides derived from transgenes in gene therapy...|$|R

From a practice-based perspective, the exploration of the study object oscillates between three <b>nested</b> and interconnected <b>frames.</b> The main contribution of this thesis is that it illustrates how activities of information sharing not only contribute to, but actually {{play a central role in}} the shaping of the practice of design research. It is shown how information sharing works as a contributor to the development, maintenance and shaping of practices in 1) design research as it is conducted in the Nordic network; 2) in the field of design research; and 3) within interdisciplinary research. Without losing sight of the empirical material, the theoretical analysis has made it possible to illuminate the connection between activities of sharing and the enactment of a discipline. Through analysis and discussion of the four studies as a whole, the reciprocal relationship between information sharing and the area of design research is elucidated. It is shown how information sharing, as it emerges in this interdisciplinary practice, functions as a unifying force towards the probable goal of establishing a discipline.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether changing the stated time frame for COOP-WONCA charts has {{any effect on}} responses. Specifically, to assess the effect of attempting to avoid the situation where the time frame crosses the onset of an acute episode. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial of two time <b>frames,</b> <b>nested</b> within a main trial comparing early discharge with a hospital at home scheme against routine discharge policy. The time frames compared were the standard two weeks (four for the pain chart) and a shorter period of 48 hours for all seven charts. SETTING: Acute hospital wards in Frenchay Healthcare Trust and the Avon Orthopaedic Centre in Bristol. PARTICIPANTS: Patients entered into the main trial, who were medically stable, in need of continued rehabilitative care but suitable for discharge to hospital at home. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were randomised, 106 to the shorter time frame, 94 to the standard charts. No clear differences were observed {{between the two groups}} for the proportion failing to self complete the charts. For the (seven) chart scores, only pain was statistically significantly different between the time frames (Mann-Whitney p = 0. 0085; proportion reporting moderate or severe pain 19 % higher in the standard group, 95 % confidence intervals 5 % to 33 %). For both this chart and that for change in health, however, there was evidence of greater differences between the versions of the chart among those admitted more recently (p values for relevant interactions 0. 004 and < or = 0. 001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: While the present findings give some support for the wide applicability of the standard version, there is sufficient evidence here to indicate that the time frame may influence the results, particularly for patients with a recent acute episode. In the absence of further data, then, it would seem prudent to consider a shorter time frame for such patients, especially if the aim is to assess current health status or to measure changes over a comparatively short period of time, or both...|$|R
