40|$|Differences among {{geographic}} {{regions in}} terms of the structure and functions of coral-reef communities appear to be influenced greatly by <b>nutrient</b> <b>input.</b> Upwelling is prevalent on the western coasts of continents, major river drainage is prevalent on the eastern coasts of continents, and oceanic regions tend to be oligotrophic. Animal-plant symbionts are predominant in areas of low <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> where recycling of nutrients is strongly favored. At intermediate levels of <b>nutrient</b> <b>input,</b> algae respond more promptly than corals to nutrient pulses and can overgrow juvenile corals unless grazed back by herbivores. At very high levels of <b>nutrient</b> <b>input,</b> phytoplankton appear to preempt light and nutrients and raise the compensation depth of benthic algae; the phytoplankton-based foodweb replaces the benthic alga-based foodweb. Success of recruitment for species with planktotrophic larvae is occasionally facilitated by a nutrient pulse, after which increased recruitment brings about more intense competition and grazing pressure because of greater population densities.

This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30â€“40 million pastoralists.

Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.|$|E
25|$|Reclamation of {{land for}} {{agriculture}} by converting marshland to upland was historically a common practice. Dikes were often built to allow for this shift in land change and to provide flood protection further inland. In recent times intertidal flats have also been reclaimed. For centuries, livestock such as sheep and cattle grazed on the highly fertile salt marsh land. Land reclamation for agriculture has resulted in many changes such as shifts in vegetation structure, sedimentation, salinity, water flow, biodiversity loss and high <b>nutrient</b> <b>inputs.</b> There have been many attempts made to eradicate these problems for example, in New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina anglica was introduced from England into the Manawatu River mouth in 1913 to try and reclaim the estuary land for farming. A shift in structure from bare tidal flat to pastureland resulted from increased sedimentation and the cordgrass extended out into other estuaries around New Zealand. Native plants and animals struggled to survive as non-natives out competed them. Efforts are now being made to remove these cordgrass species, as the damages are slowly being recognised.|$|E

40|$|Grazing lawns are {{characteristic}} for African savanna grasslands, standing out as intensely grazed patches of stoloniferous grazing-tolerant grass species. Grazing lawn {{development has been}} associated with grazing and increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> by large migratory herds. However, we argue that in systems without mass migrations disturbances, other than direct grazing, drive lawn development. Such disturbances, e. g. termite activity or megaherbivore middens, also increase <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> and keep the bunch vegetation down for a prolonged time period. However, field observations show that not all such disturbances lead to grazing lawns. We hypothesize that the initial disturbance has to be of a minimal threshold spatial scale, for grazing intensity to be high enough to induce lawn formation. We experimentally tested this idea in natural tall savanna grassland. We mowed different-sized plots to simulate initial disturbances of different scales (six times during one year) and applied fertilizer to half of the plots during two years to simulate increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> by herbivores or termite activity. Allowing grazing by naturally occurring herbivores, we followed the vegetation development over more than three years. Grazing kept bunch grass short in coarser, fertilized plots, while grasses grew out toward their initial height in fine-scale and unfertilized plots. Moreover, lawn grasses strongly increased in cover in plots with an increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> but only after coarser scale disturbance. These results support our hypothesis that an increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> in combination with grazing indeed induces grazing lawn formation, but only above a threshold scale of the initial disturbance.

5000|$|Urbanization, deforestation, and {{agricultural}} activities largely contribute sediment and <b>nutrient</b> <b>inputs</b> to coastal waters via rivers. Increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>inputs</b> to marine systems have shown both short-term increases in productivity and fishery yields, and long-term detrimental effects of eutrophication. Tripling of NO3âˆ’ loads in the Mississippi River {{in the last}} half of the 20th century have been correlated with increased fishery yields in waters surrounding the Mississippi delta; however, these <b>nutrient</b> <b>inputs</b> have produced seasonal hypoxia (oxygen concentrations less than 2-3 mg Lâˆ’1, [...] "dead zones") in the Gulf of Mexico. In estuarine and coastal systems, high <b>nutrient</b> <b>inputs</b> increase primary production (e.g., phytoplankton, sea grasses, macroalgae), which increase turbidity with resulting decreases in light penetration throughout the water column. Consequently, submerged vegetation growth declines, which reduces habitat complexity and oxygen production. The increased primary (i.e., phytoplankton, macroalgae, etc.) production leads to a flux of carbon to bottom waters when decaying organic matter (i.e., senescent primary production) sinks and is consumed by aerobic bacteria lower in the water column. As a result, oxygen consumption in bottom waters is greater than diffusion of oxygen from surface waters. Additionally, certain algal blooms termed harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce toxins that can act as neuromuscular or organ damaging compounds. These algal blooms can be harmful to other marine life as well as to humans.|$|E

30|$|Much {{research}} has focused on the influence of environmental parameters on hard corals and macroalgae, and {{there are only a few}} studies investigating other benthic groups (e.g., West and van Woesik 2001; Costa et al. 2008). Despite the different physiological responses that increased nutrient levels can have on benthic reef organisms, increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> generally causes coral reef diversity to decrease (Fabricius 2005). Although there were no signs of macroalgal over-growth in this survey, some locations were sub-dominated by soft corals and had low hard coral coverage (FigureÂ  4). Locations to the south of Toguchi had between 5 % and 26 % soft coral coverage. In other studies soft corals have been observed to increase in abundance with increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> (McClanahan et al. 2002). West and van Woesik (2001) surveyed how river discharge and human population affected benthic composition in Okinawa, and their survey at Toguchi found that hard coral cover was approximately 11 %, soft coral 1 %, and Palythoa was only 0.1 %; while in the current research, Palythoa was 0.5 %, hard coral cover was only 1.5 %, but soft coral had risen to 15 %. Therefore, it could be possible that locations such as Makiminato, Sunabe, and Mizugama that do not have high soft coral coverage but suffer from high <b>nutrient</b> <b>input</b> may, in the future, gradually become dominated by soft corals under multiple disturbances. Nevertheless, many soft corals are susceptible to bleaching (Loya et al. 2001; van Woesik et al. 2011), and considering the prediction of continued climate change in the future (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999), soft coral dominance may only be a short-term phenomenon. Such a situation may be the same for P. tuberculosa, and instead of becoming dominant under climate change and anthropogenic disturbances, this species may become more abundant in transition stage(s) during phase shifts, particularly with higher fresh water or <b>nutrient</b> <b>input.</b>|$|R
