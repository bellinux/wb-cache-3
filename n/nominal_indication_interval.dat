40|$|Prevalence of {{coronary}} heart disease (CHD), of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and of the metabolic syndrome are in Mauritius amongst {{the highest in the}} world. As T 2 DM and CHD are closely associated and have both a polygenic basis, we conducted a 10 cM genome scan with 403 microsatellite markers in 99 independent families of North-Eastern Indian origin including 535 individuals. Families were ascertained through a proband with CHD before 52 years of age and additional sibs with myocardial infarction (MI) or T 2 DM. Model-free two-point and multipoint linkage analysis were performed using the Mapmarker-Sibs (MLS) and maximum-likelihood-binomial (MLB) programs for autosomal markers and the Aspex program for chromosome X markers. In a second step, additional markers were studied to increase the genetic map density in three regions on chromosomes 3, 8 and 16 where initial indication for linkage was found. Our data show suggestive linkage with CHD on chromosome 16 p 13 -pter with the MLS statistics at 8. 69 cM (LOD = 3. 06, P = 0. 00017) which partially overlaps with a high pressure (HBP) peak. At the same locus, a <b>nominal</b> <b>indication</b> for linkage with T 2 DM was found in 35 large T 2 DM Pondicherian families also having Indian origin. With respect to region 8 q 23, we found suggestive linkage with T 2 DM (LOD = 2. 55, P = 0. 00058) as well as with HBP. On 3 q 27, we replicated previous indication for linkage found in Caucasians (for the metabolic syndrome and for diabetes) according to the categorized trait for CHD and MI with the MLB statistics (LOD = 2. 13, P = 0. 0009). The genome scan also revealed nominal evidence of linkage with CHD on 10 q 23 (LOD = 2. 06, P = 0. 00188). Interestingly, we detected in the same region overlapping linkages with three QTLs: age of onset of CHD (LOD = 2. 03), HDL cholesterol (LOD = 1. 48) and LDL/HDL ratio (LOD = 1. 34). Ordered-subset analysis based on family body mass index ranking replicated finding on 2 q 37 for T 2 DM (at Calpain 10 locus).

40|$|Digital road {{databases}} {{are widely}} used in many facets of our daily life. Most of these databases come with a <b>nominal</b> quality <b>indication,</b> but often more detailed quality descriptions regarding possible errors, the positional accuracy, and information on the completeness of the vector data are desirable. In this paper an approach for the quality description of road data from the Authoritative Topographic Cartographic Information System (ATKIS) of Germany is introduced. The work is embedded in a project initiated by the German Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG), which is interested in an automation of the road data verification process. How existing road vectors from ATKIS can be assessed by combining the information coming from several object extraction algorithms is investigated. These objects are modeled in the so called relationship model where the topologic and geometric relation between roads and other objects are given. For example a row of trees is often parallel to roads and has a minimum and a maximum distance from the carriageway. Every extracted object- such as rows of trees extracted from aerial imagery- may then support a given ATKIS road. If it does not coincide with the model it gives evidence against the ATKIS road. The Hint-Theory is used which {{is derived from the}} Dempster-Shafer Theory of evidence to combine all information related to an ATKIS road segment. Example results show that the introduced procedure is able to yield reliable information on the quality of ATKIS objects. ...|$|R

The magnet has a short sample gradient of 205 T/m at 1. 9 K and a peak field of 14. 2 T. The test campaign has been performed at CERN in April 2014. In the specific tests, which were dedicated to the measurements of the dynamic inductance of the magnet during the rapid current discharge for a quench, the protection heaters were activated only in some windings, {{in order to obtain}} the measure of the resistive and inductive voltages separately. The analysis of the results confirms a very low value of the dynamic inductance {{at the beginning of the}} discharge, which later approaches the <b>nominal</b> value. <b>Indications</b> of dynamic inductance variation were already found from the analysis of current decay during quenches in the previous magnets HQ 02 a and HQ 02 a 2; however, with this dedicated test of HQ 02 b, a quantitative measurement and assessment has been possible. An analytical model using interfilament coupling current influence for the inductance lowering has been implemented in the quench calculation code QLASA, and the comparison with experimental data is given. The agreement of the model with the experimental results is very good and allows predicting more accurately the critical parameters in quench analysis (MIITs, hot spot temperature) for the MQXF Nb 3 Sn quadrupoles, which will be installed in the High Luminosity LHC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background While {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) {{are based on}} strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, non-interventional studies (NISs) might provide additional information to guide management in patients more representative to the real-world setting. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare baseline characteristics of patients receiving intravitreal treatment in the NIS OCEAN with those from published RCTs. Methods The ongoing OCEAN study enrolled patients treated with ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema (DME) or branch/central retinal vein occlusion (B/CRVO). Baseline patient characteristics were compared by indication within the OCEAN cohort. Furthermore, the characteristics were set in reference to those of published RCTs in the same <b>indications.</b> Confidence <b>intervals</b> (CIs) were calculated and assessed for statistically significant differences as indicated by non-overlapping CIs. Results Patient characteristics in the NIS OCEAN were evaluated for 3, 614 patients with nAMD, 1, 211 with DME, 204 with BRVO and 121 with CRVO. Between these groups, significant differences in mean age, gender distributions, and mean baseline VA were seen, reflecting known differences between the indications. Compared to the patient characteristics of published RCTs (trials selected by literature search: nAMD: 13 RCTs, DME: 9, RVO: 5), the OCEAN patients 2 ̆ 019 mean age was significantly higher in every indication. The gender distributions across the trials were comparable, with only few differences between OCEAN and the RCTs. Regarding the mean baseline VA, notable differences were found in nAMD and in DME, with VA significantly higher in some RCTs and lower in others. Conclusions The described differences underline the complementarity of NISs and RCTs. OCEAN covers a broader spectrum and more variability of patients than do RCTs. As baseline values may have impact on the treatment response (ceiling effect), there is an ongoing need for research in all patient subgroups. Country-specific assessments of patient populations can better reflect the real-world situation. NISs can deliver insights that RCTs may not, as NISs can include non-typical patients, patients with comorbidities, a broader age spectrum and patients of various disease stages.

40|$|Introduction: Hepatitis C is {{the first}} {{aetiologic}} agent for HCC in Morocco. Antiviral treatment {{reduces the risk of}} developing HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis C but few cases of HCC have been still reported. We aimed to define population with high risk of HCC occurrence, confirm the protective role of SVR and to identify predictive factors of developing HCC after SVR. We’ll try to present suggestions about screening strategies (<b>indications</b> and <b>interval)</b> after antiviral therapy according to level of HCC occurrence risk. Patients and Methods: We included all patients with chronic hepatitis C treated in our department from January 2002 to April 2010. We compare HCV-treated patients with no developed HCC to HCC population using khi- 2 and Fisher Exact analysis. Results: 369 patients treated for hepatitis C were considered, and 20 HCC were reported. The risk of HCC occurrence was not significant according to gender and genotypes. Advanced age and severe fibrosis were significant risk factors. HCC was reported in 2. 3 % of sustained virological responders versus 12. 5 % of non responders. SVR is a significant protective factor. Conclusion: In our series, 5 % of previously treated HCV carriers developed HCC and 2. 3 % of sustained virological responders developed. Achieving SVR after antiviral therapy is a protective factor. Advanced age (> 50 y. o), severe fibrosis (F> 2) and lack of SVR at HCV diagnosis are predictive factors of HCC development in treated patients. Regular bi-annual ultrasonography screening should be indicated necessarily in patients with advanced fibrosis stage (F 3 - F 4) even after SVR, particularly when co-morbid conditions are associated (advanced age, NASH, diabetes mellitus,…). Screening interval in sustained virological responders with reduced fibrosis stage may be reduced to annual surveillance. Establishing guidelines about consensual strategy to survey sustained virological responders is now necessary especially with high rates of SVR and the extension of treatment indications in era of DAA drugs...|$|R
30|$|IEEE 802.11 s draft {{proposes a}} new {{medium access control}} function-mesh {{deterministic}} access (MDA), which is mainly used for single-channel wireless mesh local area network (LAN). In single-channel environment, collisions between control packets and data packets may occur very often. To completely avoid the collision between control packets and data packets, the mesh delivery traffic <b>indication</b> message (DTIM) <b>interval</b> is first divided into contention period and data transmission period. To reduce the hardware requirements in design, we require a mesh point (MP) only equips a single transceiver to support multichannel environment. To provide higher performance and network capacity than the original MDA for wireless mesh LAN, we proposed a multichannel MDA (MMDA) algorithm. However, the MMDA algorithm may suffer from the resource waste problem when wireless mesh LAN is at heavy-loading situation, so this paper proposes a dynamic adjustable contention period (DACP) mechanism to solve this problem. In addition, we use an adaptive backoff process (ABP) to improve {{the fairness of the}} MMDA algorithm. The theoretical analysis gives the upper limit of the throughput for the DACP mechanism. The simulation experiments clearly show the results in multichannel wireless mesh LAN environment that the proposed scheme performs better than the MMDA algorithm and the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) in throughput, average waiting time, and packet drop ratio.|$|R

Patients and methods: Data were collected retrospectively from physicians in Germany, France, and the UK regarding patients (n= 638) treated with incobotulinumtoxinA for aesthetic indications. Data on <b>indication,</b> treatment <b>interval,</b> dose injected, physician and patient satisfaction, and adverse drug reactions were recorded according to routine daily practice. Results: Most patients (76. 0 %) received incobotulinumtoxinA for glabellar frown lines (GFL) and were given doses of ≤ 20 U. The majority of treatment intervals were 5 months or longer. Overall, 64. 1 % of patients were treated for off-label indications, sometimes in combination with treatment for GFL. The most frequently treated off-label indications were horizontal forehead lines (38. 6 %) and/or crow&# 39;s feet (CF; 31. 7 %); for CF, > 95 % of injected doses were ≤ 24 U. In Germany, a smaller proportion of patients were given incobotulinumtoxinA treatment for CF (27. 6 %), compared with France (40. 4 %) and the UK (33. 2 %), although country-specific differences were less prominent when treatment cycle data for CF were examined. Treatment satisfaction among physicians and patients (overall, and for GFL specifically) was very high, with excellent tolerability and only one mild adverse drug reaction reported. Conclusion: In daily practice, incobotulinumtoxinA is mainly used for GFL; however, its use for CF and horizontal forehead lines (often in combination with GFL) is relatively common. Treatment satisfaction across aesthetic indications is high, and incobotulinumtoxinA is well tolerated, with time intervals of 5 months or longer between injections {{in the majority of}} cases. When considering factors such as dose and treatment interval, adherence to the Summary of Product Characteristics when treating GFL in daily practice is good. These results support previous reports that incobotulinumtoxinA is an effective treatment for GFL, with an excellent safety profile.

40|$|A multi-proxy {{investigation}} of the Cenomanian–Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE) near Dover in southern England previously demonstrated that, coincident with a major global positive carbon stable-isotope excursion during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2), the diversity of nanoplankton, dinoflagellates, planktonic and benthonic foraminifera and ostracods was severely reduced. This was attributed to decreasing levels of dissolved oxygen, consequent on an intensification and expansion of the oceanic Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) into shelf seas. In {{the case of the}} ostracods, it was noted that as podocopid taxa became locally extinct, platycopids became the dominant component of the fauna. Subsequently the “Platycopid Signal” Hypothesis (PSH) claimed that dominance of platycopids in ostracod assemblages could be regarded as a signal of dysaerobic conditions on the sea floor, {{based on the premise that}} the filter-feeding platycopids, able to pass more water over their respiratory surface, were better-equipped than other benthonic ostracods to survive in water of reduced oxygen concentration. The PSH has been widely accepted and applied in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of stratigraphic intervals ranging from the Palaeozoic to the Quaternary. However, the modern biological and ecological support claimed for the Platycopid Signal has been challenged; platycopids are occasionally dominant in modern OMZs, but often they are not, and in any case the same can be said about some podocopids. Apparently precise calibration scales published by some authors are not justified by available data; furthermore, Platycopid Signal <b>indications</b> of dysaerobic <b>intervals</b> in the English Chalk succession often conflict with the evidence of macrofossils and trace fossils. Here we review old and new data from two CTBE sites in SE England, Dover and Eastbourne, and advance an alternative interpretation of the Platycopid Signal, based on the concept of the spread of oceanic oligotrophic conditions into the European Chalk Sea during OAE 2. We propose that ostracod assemblages overwhelmingly dominated by platycopids signify oligotrophy, because living platycopids appear to be adapted to filter-feed on nano- and picoplankton which are predominant in oligotrophic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vaginal {{delivery}} after previous one cesarean section for a non recurring indication {{has been described}} by several authors as safe and having a success rate of 60 – 80 %. Hence many centers are offering VBAC for candidates leaving the century old dictum of once cesarean always cesarean. But predicting success of VBAC after trial of labor (TOL) is still a difficult task {{due to the lack of}} a validated prediction tool. Studies on predictors of success are few and most of them conducted in developed countries and difficult to generalize. Therefore assessing factors associated with successful VBAC is very important to for counseling mothers while offering VBAC. The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with successful VBAC in three teaching Hospitals in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. Methods A case control study was conducted to compare the factors associated with successful VBAC in teaching hospitals in Addis Ababa in one year period. The cases were those successfully delivered vaginally and the controls were those with failed VBAC and delivered by caesarean section. The sample size of the cases was 101 vaginal deliveries and the controls were 103 failed VBAC patients which made the case to control ratio of 1 : 1. Result In this study independent factors determining successful VBAC were, history of successful VBAC in the past, rupture of membrane at admission, and cervical dilatation of more than 3 cm at admission. Presence of meconium, malposition and history of stillbirth were associated with failed VBAC. Factors like maternal age, past caesarean <b>indications,</b> inter delivery <b>interval,</b> and birth weight were not found to be significant determinants of success. The most common reason for repeat cesarean section for after trial of labor was labour dysfunction because of absence of a policy for augmentation on a scarred uterus in these hospitals. Conclusion It is possible to prepare a decision tool on the success of VBAC by taking important past and present obstetric and reproductive performance history as predictor. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundFractures of the {{proximal}} femur commonly occur {{but the majority}} of orthopaedic surgeons do not consider general hardware removal as a routine necessity. <b>Indications</b> and time <b>interval</b> for hardware removal in this special selected patient group is still controversial. Therefore we performed a retrospective study to address the following questions: 1) Is there a difference between the medically- (infection, mechanical problems, implant failure) and non-medically indicated group (patients demand, meteoro-sensitivity, foreign body sensation) in relation to complications? 2) Is there a correlation regarding time interval between implantation and removal comparing these two groups? 3) Is there a context related refracture rate? 4) Should non-medically indicated implant removal (IR) be performed due to persistent pressure from the patient?HypothesisWe hypothesized that non-medically indicated implant removals should be avoided due to a significantly higher number of associated complications. Patients and methodsA total of 371 consecutive patients with 424 hardware removal procedures following a proximal femur fracture, between 08 / 1992 and 11 / 2008, have been included. Study population was divided into two groups according to their indication for implant removal: medically indicated group (MIR) consisted of 299 patients (80. 59 %) and 72 patients (19. 41 %) were assigned to the non-medically indicated (NMIR) group. ResultsIn the NMIR subgroup a total of (n= 21) 28 % complications occurred compared to 11. 46 % in the MIR subgroup; (P< 0. 005), 86. 51 % of IR in the MIR group were performed within 1. 5 years, compared to 79. 17 % in the NMIR group after 2 to 3. 5 years (NS). In the MIR group 1 refracture occurred, compared to 4 in the NMIR group (NS). ConclusionNon-medically indicated implant removal should be avoided due to the higher complication rate of 28 %.

MDA mainly {{works in the}} single-channel network, and the related works of MDA also focuses on the improvement of single-channel network performance. The authors of [17] propose a semi-random backoff (SRB) method that enables resource reservation. Cheng et al. propose the DPSO-CA algorithm to assign channel with topology preservation in multiradio wireless mesh networks [18]. Xiao et al. investigate the fundamental performance limits of MAC protocols for particular multihop sensor networks [19]. Vishnevsky et al. make the beacons responsible for supporting MDA designed for delay-sensitive multimedia applications [20]. The authors of [21] develop a scheduled mesh access (SMA) mechanism based on MDA, while SMA has better anti-interference ability than EDCA. The authors of [22] define the MDA interframe space (MIFS) to make MP get higher priority to access its own MDA opportunity (MDAOP). However, single-channel network environment has higher collision probability and cannot avoid collisions between control packets and data packets. In particular, network performance is strictly limited in the single-channel wireless mesh LAN when {{it is in the}} heavy-loading situation and hidden node environment. According to [23, 24], using multichannel architecture is more effective than single-channel architecture to enhance performance and reduce collision probability in IEEE 802.11 network.

The authors of [26] give the embedded version FreeBSD for multichannel wireless mesh networks. [27] proposes a traffic-aware switching scheme (TRASS) for wireless mesh network. In order to further enhance wireless mesh LAN performance and capacity, we have proposed multichannel MDA (MMDA) algorithm to make MDA works on multichannel wireless mesh LAN [28, 29]. The MMDA algorithm adopts four-way handshaking mechanism to reduce hidden node problems, and mesh delivery traffic <b>indication</b> message (DTIM) <b>interval</b> is divided into contention period (CP) and data transmission period (DTP) to completely avoid the collision between control packets and data packets. The MMDA algorithm is designed with only single transceiver, so it can reduce the hardware requirements and design complexity.|$|R

Results which were received showed, that people attending athletic club takes interest in optimal purport of training, though they are lacking in information about the lasting of rest intervals and its significance. In majority, trainers of health groups do not designate the time people must rest since the next repeat of exercise. Striving of wellbeing and pretty look are dominant reason of exercising people to attend trainings of healf strenthening. Other reasons, which prompt to attend trainings of health strengthening, depend on sexually and age. Women are more interested in control of weight; also they took exercise with the purpose of better temper and they mention no increase of muscule fitness. Reasons of muscle growing and power preservation also spending of leisure are more significant for men.
