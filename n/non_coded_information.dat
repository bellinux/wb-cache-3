40|$|The RNA-Crypto System (shortly RCS) is a {{symmetric}} key algorithm to cipher data. The idea {{for this new}} algorithm starts from the observation of nature. In particular from the observation of RNA behavior {{and some of its}} properties. The RNA sequences has some sections called Introns. Introns, derived from the term "intragenic regions", are non-coding sections of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) or other RNAs, that are removed (spliced out of the RNA) before the mature RNA is formed. Once the introns have been spliced out of a pre-mRNA, the resulting mRNA sequence is ready to be translated into a protein. The corresponding parts of a gene are known as introns as well. The nature and the role of Introns in the pre-mRNA is not clear and it is under ponderous researches by Biologists but, in our case, we will use the presence of Introns in the RNA-Crypto System output as a strong method to add chaotic <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> <b>information</b> and an unnecessary behaviour in the access to the secret key to code the messages.

40|$|Comparative {{genomics}} {{methods are}} widely used to aid the functional annotation of <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> DNA regions. However, aligning <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> sequences requires new algorithms and strategies, {{in order to take}} into account extensive rearrangements and turnover during evolution. Here we present a novel large scale alignment strategy which aims at drawing a precise map of conserved <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> regions between genomes, even when these regions have undergone small scale rearrangments events and a certain degree of sequence variability. We applied our alignment approach to obtain a genome-wide catalogue of conserved <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> blocks (CNBs) between Drosophila melanogaster and 11 other Drosophila species. Interestingly, we observe numerous small scale rearrangement events, such as local inversions, duplications and translocations, which are not observable in the whole genome alignments currently available.

Many of these transcripts are presently considered crucial regulators of gene expression and functionally implicated in developmental processes in Eukaryotes. Notably, despite {{a huge number}} of lncRNAs are expressed in the Central Nervous System (CNS), only a few of them have been characterized in terms of molecular structure, gene expression regulation and function. In the present study, we identify linc-NeD 125 as a novel cytoplasmic, neuronal-induced long intergenic <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> RNA (lincRNA).

40|$|Background <b>Non</b> <b>coding</b> RNAs are the RNA {{molecules}} {{that do not}} code for proteins but play structural, catalytic or regulatory roles in the organisms {{in which they are}} found. These RNAs generally conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence. It is possible to look for protein coding genes using sequence signals like promoters, terminators, start and stop codons etc. However, {{this is not the case}} with <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> RNAs since these signals are weakly conserved in them. Hence the situation with <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> RNAs is more challenging. Therefore a protocol is devised to identify U 1 RNA in species not previously known to have it. Results It is sufficient to use the covariance models to identify <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> RNAs but they are very slow and hence a filtering step is needed before using the covariance models to reduce the search space for identifying these genes. The protocol for identifying U 1 RNA genes employs for the filtering a pattern matcher RNABOB that can conduct secondary structure pattern searches. The descriptor for RNABOB is made automatically such that it can also represent the bulges and interior loops in helices of RNA. The protocol is compared with the Rfam and Weinberg & Ruzzo approaches and has been able to identify new U 1 RNA homologues in the Apicomplexan group where it has not previously been found. Conclusions The method has been used to identify the gene for U 1 RNA in certain species in which it has not been detected previously. The identified genes may be further analyzed by wet laboratory techniques for the confirmation of their existence. ...|$|R

This finding resulted in a Nobel Prize awarded to Fire and Mello in 2006. miRNA a small <b>non</b> <b>coding</b> RNA  which played  a very important role in regulating protein expression through   3 ”UTR  or other binding places to mRNA target. miRNA have been considered as negative regulators of protein coding gene expression that may impact in cell differentiation, proliferation,  survival and all fundamental cellular processes, also  implicated in carcinogenesis. miRNA can be grouped into tumor suppressor miRNA (miRSuppressor) and oncogenic miRNA (OncomiR). miRSuppressor regulates protein expression through targeting oncogenic mRNA, meanwhile OncomiR target mRNA Tumor Suppressor. Evidence indicates that deregulation in genetic and epigenetic may cause overexpression of oncomiR and loss of expression of Tumor Suppressor miR.   In addition to that, in recent years, evidences showed that cell-to-cell communication conducted via exosome, which is released from every cell in physiological and pathological conditions andconsidered as fingerprints of cell and its status.  This is a paramount biomarker discovery in cancer.
