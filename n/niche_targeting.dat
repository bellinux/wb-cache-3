40|$|International audienceHead {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell cancer (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world. Effective therapeutic modalities such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and combinations of each {{are used in the}} management of the disease. In most cases, treatment fails to obtain total cancer cure. In recent years, it appears that one of the key determinants of treatment failure may be the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that escape currently available therapies. CSCs form {{a small portion of the}} total tumor burden but may play a disproportionately important role in determining outcomes. CSCs have stem features such as self-renewal, high migration capacity, drug resistance, high proliferation abilities. A large body of evidence points to the fact that CSCs are particularly resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In HNSCC, CSCs have been increasingly shown to have an integral role in tumor initiation, disease progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. In the light of such observations, the present review summarizes biological characteristics of CSCs in HNSCC, outlines targeted strategies for the successful eradication of CSCs in HNSCC including targeting the self-renewal controlling pathways, blocking epithelial mesenchymal transition, <b>niche</b> <b>targeting,</b> immunotherapy approaches and highlights the need to better understand CSCs biology for new treatments modalities...|$|E

40|$|There is now {{increasing}} evidence which suggests {{a pivotal role}} for oxidative stress {{in the development and}} progression of osteoporosis. We confirm herein the protective effects of natural antioxidant Tanshinol against oxidative stress in osteoblastic differentiation and the underlying mechanism. Our results show that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease in cell viability, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a caspase- 3 -dependent manner, and inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation. Tanshinol reverses these deleterious consequence triggered by oxidative stress. Moreover, under the condition of oxidative stress, Tanshinol suppresses the activation of FoxO 3 a transcription factor and expressions of its target genes Gadd 45 a and catalase (CAT) and simultaneously counteracts the inhibition of Wnt signalling and expressions of target genes Axin 2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Osteoprotegerin (OPG). The findings are further consolidated using FoxO 3 a siRNA interference and overexpression of Tcf 4. The results illustrate that Tanshinol attenuates oxidative stress via down-regulation of FoxO 3 a signaling, and rescues the decrease of osteoblastic differentiation through upregulation of Wnt signal under oxidative stress. The present findings suggest that the beneficial effects of Tanshinol may be adopted as a novel therapeutic approach in recently recognized conditions of <b>niche</b> <b>targeting</b> osteoporosis...|$|E

We present experimental evidence describing how the difficulty of locating niches changes for an entrant and an incumbent producer as both niche size and the producers' learning strategies are varied.

40|$|In face of gradual {{ecological}} deterioration, the Chinese {{government has}} been in search of more efficient and effective mitigation policies, aiming to promote the sustainability of livestock production. However, researchers and policy makers seem to neglect a key issue: pinpoint policies are the most important, which means <b>niche</b> <b>targeting</b> is the premise before any policy design, such that better knowing of the livestock farmers preference is prerequisite. This paper then analyzes this question using a method of choice experiment to elicit the farmers’ preference and valuation of livestock pollution control policy instruments at household-scale, medium-scale and large-scale farms. Five attributes (technology regulation, pollution charge, biogas subsidy, manure price, and information provisioning) were set as livestock pollution control policy instruments. In total, 754 pigs farmers from five representative provinces in China were surveyed, and the collected {{data were analyzed using}} random parameter logit models. The marginal substitution rates for attributes are estimated both with preference space approach and willingness to pay space approach. The results show significant heterogeneities in farmers’ preferences and valuations for livestock pollution control policy instruments within the three scales. All policy instruments effectively increased the manure eco-friendly treatment ratio for medium-scale farms, and household-scale farms showed little change in the manure eco-friendly treatment ratio under all policy instruments. Household-scale farms and medium-scale farms suggested the highest preference for the biogas subsidy policy, while large-scale farms suggested the highest preference for the manure price policy...|$|E

40|$|Your life is {{your message}} to the world, {{make sure it is}} remembered. The undeniable fact of life is death. The only problem is that very few people are financially {{prepared}} for it. Death generally comes unexpected, and with this comes unexpected expenses. All reasonably responsible people will ensure that in the event of passing away, that adequate provision is made to pay for his or her funeral. Inequality and extreme poverty in South Africa necessitates a product that will eliminate fraud and exploitation of customers. Shepherd Life aims to provide a funeral policy product to a <b>niche</b> <b>target</b> market that will support the ethical norms of the founders. The <b>niche</b> <b>target</b> market includes all South African citizens dependent on a social grant. The product will be superior in quality and innovation with the lowest possible premium in the market. This project has one main objective which is to develop a well-defined business plan for Shepherd Life. This objective was divided into two specific deliverables. The first deliverable is the development of a business model for Shepherd Life that will support the strategy and objectives of the company. The second deliverable is the design of a tablet application that supports the business model. A literature study was done to gain an understanding of all the techniques available to design, evaluate and validate a business model, a financial model and a tablet application. Using these techniques studied in the literature review two business models were developed and compared using a business model canvas and a financial analysis. The target market, industry and competitors of Shepherd Life were studied comprehensively. The models were evaluated using an analytical hierarchy process and the optimal model was chosen. The tablet design was done by developing context data models, detailed entity relationship diagrams, context data flow diagrams and screen mock-ups. All of these techniques assisted the technical design team of Shepherd Life to develop the application. Shepherd Life implemented the proposed business model and tablet solution. After implementation a SWOT assessment as well as an objective compliance check to validate the business model was done. To validate the tablet design a questionnaire was distributed and completed by all agents and team leaders of Shepherd Life and finally analysed. An objective compliance check was also done for the tablet design. Shepherd Life aims to deliver a state of the art product {{while at the same time}} supporting the <b>niche</b> <b>target</b> market the company operates in. Helping the underprivileged and eliminating fraud from the industry will help make South Africa a better country with each funeral policy sold.

5000|$|A topic as {{emotional}} and involving as political preference is especially {{subject to the}} selective exposure phenomenon. In fact, Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1948) found selective exposure early on to be a necessary link in their theory that campaigns primarily reinforce and activate preexisting political notions. The ever-increasing number of media options further facilitates the public's ability to selectively expose themselves to desired media messages. The explosion of the Internet has put the individual in the driver's seat with regard to what kind of information s/he will encounter. McLeod, Kosicki, and McLeod (2002) stated that information selection and [...] "exposure is much more specialized and individualized" [...] (p. 221) {{in the era of}} the World Wide Web.
