The histone code at the DSB site undergoes transient changes following DNA damage, and is stably modified after repair.

During repair discrete DNA loops form that connect the 5 ' and the 3 ' ends of the repaired GFP gene. Some of these loops are sensitive to RNaseH, suggesting that they are stabilized by RNA:DNA hybrids. BER-NER enzymes recruited to the DSB influence the final methylation status of the repaired gene, as does transcription of the gene during the three weeks following repair.

Furthermore, it is known that the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of non-host ant species remain stable between Finland and the UK.

40|$|Expectations for {{the time}} scale and {{structure}} of allelic genealogies in finite populations are formed under three models of sporophytic self- incompatibility. The models differ in the dominance interactions among the alleles that determine the self-incompatibility phenotype: In the SSIcod model, alleles act codominantly in both pollen and style, in the SSIdom model, alleles form a dominance hierarchy, and in SSIdomcod, alleles are codominant in the style and show a dominance hierarchy in the pollen. Coalescence times of alleles rarely differ more than threefold from those under gametophytic self-incompatibility, and transspecific polymorphism is therefore expected to be equally common. The previously reported directional turnover process of alleles in the SSIdomcod model results in coalescence times lower and substitution rates higher {{than those in the}} other models. The SSIdom model assumes strong asymmetries in allelic action, and the most recessive extant allele {{is likely to be the}} most recent common ancestor. Despite these asymmetries, the expected shape of the allele genealogies does not deviate markedly from the shape of a <b>neutral</b> <b>gene</b> genealogy.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{understanding of}} recombination {{is that in}} large asexual populations with multiplicative fitness, linkage disequilibrium is negligible, and thus there is no selective agent driving an allele for recombination.

Yet data on such selection is equivocal, and various works have shown that synergistic epistasis per se, when left unquantified in its magnitude or operation, is not sufficient to drive the evolution of recombination. Here we show that neither it, nor any mechanism generating negative linkage disequilibrium among fitness-related loci, is necessary. We demonstrate that a <b>neutral</b> <b>gene</b> for recombination can increase in frequency in a large population under a low mutation rate and strict multiplicative fitness. We work in a parameter range where individuals have, on average, less than one mutation each, yet recombination can still evolve.

To assist such inference, we study, by means of simulations and analytical methods, the dynamics of <b>neutral</b> <b>gene</b> frequencies in a population undergoing a continual range expansion in one dimension.

We quantify this phenomenon in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of lineages that reach fixation and, closely related, (ii) the continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at the wave front, characterizing the approach to fixation. Our simulations show that an effective population size can be assigned to the wave that controls the (observable) gradient in heterozygosity left behind the colonization process. This effective population size is markedly higher in pushed waves than in pulled waves, and increases only sub-linearly with deme size.

40|$|Mathematical {{properties}} of the overdominance model with mutation and random genetic drift are studied by using the method of stochastic differential equations (Itô and McKean 1974). It is shown that overdominant selection is very powerful in increasing the mean heterozygosity as compared with neutral mutations, and if 2 Ns (N = effective population size; s = selective disadvantage for homozygotes) is larger than 10, a very low mutation rate is sufficient to explain the observed level of allozyme polymorphism. The distribution of heterozygosity for overdominant genes is considerably {{different from that of}} neutral mutations, and if the ratio of selection coefficient (s) to mutation rate (ν) is large and the mean heterozygosity (h) is lower than 0. 2, single-locus heterozygosity is either approximately 0 or 0. 5. If h increases further, however, heterozygosity shows a multiple-peak distribution. Reflecting this type of distribution, the relationship between the mean and variance of heterozygosity is considerably different from that for <b>neutral</b> <b>genes.</b> When s/v is large, the proportion of polymorphic loci increases approximately linearly with mean heterozygosity. The distribution of allele frequencies is also drastically different from that of <b>neutral</b> <b>genes,</b> and generally shows a peak at the intermediate gene frequency. Implications of these results on the maintenance of allozyme polymorphism are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In a {{geographically}} structured population, {{the interplay}} among gene migration, genetic drift and natural selection raises intriguing evolutionary problems, but the rigorous mathematical treatment is often very difficult. Therefore several approximate formulas were developed concerning the coalescence process of <b>neutral</b> <b>genes</b> and the fixation process of selected mutations in an island model, and their accuracy was examined by computer simulation. When migration is limited, the coalescence (or divergence) time for sampled <b>neutral</b> <b>genes</b> {{can be described}} by the convolution of exponential functions, as in a panmictic population, but it is determined mainly by migration rate {{and the number of}} demes from which the sample is taken. This time can be much longer than that in a panmictic population with the same number of breeding individuals. For a selected mutation, the spreading over the entire population was formulated as a birth and death process, in which the fixation probability within a deme plays a key role. With limited amounts of migration, even advantageous mutations take a large number of generations to spread. Furthermore, it is likely that these mutations which are temporarily fixed in some demes may be swamped out again by non-mutant immigrants from other demes unless selection is strong enough. These results are potentially useful for testing quantitatively various hypotheses that have been proposed for the origin of modern human populations...|$|R
40|$|Different alleles {{undergoing}} strong symmetric balancing selection show {{a simple}} genealogical structure (allelic genealogy), {{similar to the}} gene genealogy described by the coalescence process for a sample of neutral genes randomly drawn from a panmictic population at equilibrium. The only {{difference between the two}} genealogies lies in the different time scales. An approximate scaling factor for allelic genealogy relative to that of <b>neutral</b> <b>gene</b> genealogy is [square root of S/(2 M) ]. [In[S/(16 pi M 2) ]]- 3 / 2, where M = Nu and S = 2 Ns (N, effective population size; u, mutation rate to selected alleles per locus per generation; s, selection coefficient). The larger the value of square root of S/M (greater than or equal to 100), the larger the scaling factor. These findings, supported by simulation results, allow one to apply the theoretical results of the coalescence process directly to the allelic genealogy. Combined with the trans-species evolution of the major histocompatibility complex polymorphism for which balancing selection is believed to be responsible, allelic genealogy predicts that the number of breeding individuals in the human population could not be as small as 50 - 100 at any time of its evolutionary history. The analysis appears to contradict the founder principle as being important in recent mammalian evolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of gene and allelic genealogies at a gametophytic self- incompatibility locus in {{plants have been}} investigated analytically and checked against extensive numerical simulations. It is found that, as with overdominant loci, there are two genealogical processes with markedly different time scales. First, functionally distinct allelic lines diverge on an extremely long time scale which is inversely related to the mutation rate to new alleles. These alleles show a genealogical structure which is similar, after an appropriate rescaling of time, to that described by the coalescent process for genes at a neutral locus. Second, gene copies sampled within the same functional allelic line show genealogical relationships similar to <b>neutral</b> <b>gene</b> genealogies but on a much shorter time scale, {{which is on the}} same order of magnitude as the harmonic mean of the number of gene copies within an allelic line. These results are discussed in relation to data showing trans-specific polymorphisms for alleles at the gametophytic self- incompatibility locus in the Solanaceae. It is shown that population sizes on the order of 4 x 105 and a mutation rate per locus per generation as high as 10 - 6 could account for estimated allelic divergence times in this family.

No study has been able to obtain results for arbitrary selection on multiple loci undergoing multiple genetic transformation events. Here techniques from Karlin (1982) are applied to a multilocus model of mutation with multivariate control over mutation rates, and the reduction principle is found to operate. Constraining assumptions are that mutation distributions follow the transition probabilities of reversible Markov chains, and that all loci are tightly linked. The extension of the reduction principle is shown topologically to require a manifold of mutation rate alterations that are neutral for a new modifier allele, below which will cause a new modifier allele to increase when rare, and above which cause it to go extinct. This manifold is the same structure as found in a multivariate multilocus model of recombination modification by Zhivotovsky et al. (1994).
