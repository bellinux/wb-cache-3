5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E

25|$|The 1985 {{season was}} very much a replay of 1984, with the Outlaws {{struggling}} after a quick start. The team jumped out to a 4-2 start, including a 31-13 pounding of the Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie-led New Jersey Generals. However, they proceeded to drop six in a row, and seven out of eight. They rebounded to win three straight, but did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> help to make the playoffs, and finished 8-10.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with opening}} the door for many R performers, Laine played a {{significant}} role in the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s. When Nat King Cole's television show was unable to get a sponsor, Laine crossed the color line, becoming the first white artist to appear as a guest (forgoing his usual salary of $10,000.00 as Cole's show only paid scale). Many other top white singers followed suit, including Tony Bennett and Rosemary Clooney, but Cole's show still could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> sponsors to continue.|$|E
25|$|Like people, fancy mice {{can become}} obese if they overeat and do <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> {{physical}} activity. This {{can lead to}} them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice get enough exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a wire cage with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and {{can be difficult to}} retrieve.|$|E

Vizslas that do <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> attention and exercise can easily become destructive or hyperactive. Under-stimulated Vizslas may also become depressed or engage in obsessive-compulsive behaviours such as persistent licking (Coffman 1992). Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla {{wants to be}} close to its owner as much of the time as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners if allowed, burrowing under the covers.|$|E
25|$|General George C. Kenney, {{commander}} of the USAAF Fifth Air Force operating in New Guinea, could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> P-38s; they had become his favorite fighter in November 1942 when one squadron, the 39th Fighter Squadron of the 35th Fighter Group, joined his assorted P-39s and P-40s. The Lightnings established local air superiority with their first combat action on 27 December 1942. Kenney sent repeated requests to Arnold for more P-38s, and was rewarded with occasional shipments, but Europe was a higher priority in Washington. Despite their small force, Lightning pilots began to compete in racking up scores against Japanese aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Accidents {{and lasting}} damage can {{generally}} {{be avoided by}} very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often {{if he or she}} is all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Musa III came {{to power}} after Maghan III. His reign began with the conquest of Dioma under his given name of Sérébandjougou {{alongside}} his brother and heir Gbèré. After conquering Dioma, he {{was put on the}} throne as Foamed Musa or Musa III. Despite starting out on a markedly positive note, Musa III’s reign would be one of many losses for the Mali Empire. In 1433, the Tuareg launched a major invasion from the north capturing Timbuktu, Arawan and Walata. The important city-state of Jenne was independent of Mali by 1439. The Mali Empire loss almost all access to the Saharan trade routes without which it could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> horses to take the centers back or preserve its own precarious position. The mansas were thus forced to look south for their economic security.|$|E

Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They {{had gone to a}} shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door. They were charged with violent assault, damage to property (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth £113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves up. In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth £10.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the federal victory at Corinth, the railroads that linked Memphis with {{the eastern part of the}} Confederacy had been cut, {{severely}} reducing the strategic importance of the city. Therefore, in early June 1862, Memphis and its nearby forts were abandoned by the rebel army. Most of the garrison were sent to join units elsewhere, including Vicksburg and only a small rear guard was left to make a token resistance. The River Defense Fleet was also to have retreated to Vicksburg, but it could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> coal in Memphis. Unable to flee when the federal fleet appeared on June 6, Montgomery and his captains had to decide whether to fight, or scuttle their boats. They chose to fight, steaming out in the early morning to meet the advancing flotilla and the rams trailing behind it, with Memphis citizens cheering them on.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution of Denmark, Denmark {{is governed}} {{according}} {{to the principle of}} negative parliamentarism, meaning that while a government doesn't need the majority of seats in parliament, it must never have a majority of seats against it in a vote of no confidence. Before the ongoing elections, this was relevant since the government, consisting of the Conservative People's Party and the Liberals did not have a majority of seats, but depended on the support of the Danish People's Party. Early opinion polls showed that neither a right-wing or a left-wing government could gather enough seats to be in government without the support of the newly established New Alliance. This caused a lot of interest, since New Alliance had stated that they would first give the government the opportunity to propose a programme for government, but that they would not definitely support a right-wing government prior to seeing how many of their political agendas they could work together on. Many people were unsure how this would be possible, since New Alliance was originally formed to limit the influence of the Danish People's Party, without whom a right-wing government did not seem possible in opinion polls. After the elections, however, it was clear that New Alliance did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> seats in parliament to break the previous right-wing majority.|$|E
25|$|Toadie and Sonya {{decide to}} enlist Nell in {{childcare}} when she begins playing up, believing she does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> attention. During an open {{day for the}} new childcare centre, Toadie falls from an out-of-control bouncy castle and is left paralysed. Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund to pay their bills, but discover the money has been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her {{to move in with}} her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile. Worried that Steph is a threat to her marriage, Sonya offers Belinda a job as Toadie's nurse. Belinda quits after one day and Sonya's insecurities are exposed. She and Toadie begin attending counselling.|$|E

25|$|The second {{qualifying}} {{session was}} delayed due to multiple crashes during qualifying for the FIA GT World Cup support race. When the session did begin and before any competitor could record a timed lap, {{the first of}} two red flags was waved for Ilott who swiped the barriers exiting the San Francisco Bend. Later Melco hairpin was blocked when Menezes was attempting to return to pit lane after running off the circuit at Moorish turn and could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> steering lock and understeered into the barriers. Lorandi could not react quickly enough and ploughed into Menezes's rear end. Lorandi's rear-end in turn was hit by a Signature car. Rosenqvist continued his strong form from Thursday's qualifying and set the pace again before Leclerc usurped his time halfway through the session. Rosenqvist had new tyres installed on his vehicle and returned {{to the top of the}} standings. He later improved with a lap of two minutes and 10.474 in response to Juncadella getting close to Rosenqvist's pace. The session was abandoned with four minutes remaining when Giovinazzi crashed at the left-hand corner before Maternity Bend. Thus, Rosenqvist took pole position at Macau by 0.213 seconds ahead of Juncadella. Leclerc moved up eight from his provisional grid position to start from third and was the best placed of all the rookie drivers. Giovinazzi dropped one position from third to fourth. Pommer was in the top three for the majority of the session before settling for fifth. However he was handed a two-place grid penalty for impeding another car during qualifying. MacLeod and Sette Câmara consequently moved into fifth and sixth as a result of Pommer's penalty. Pommer was ahead of a close trio of cars driven by Macau rookies. Maini, Lorandi and Stroll were the three drivers who rounded out the top ten. The sixth row was adorned by the Mücke Motorsport cars of Ferrucci and Jensen. The rest of the grid lined up as the British duo of Sims and Dennis, Albon, Sekiguchi, Tveter, Ilott, the Japanese pair of Kanamaru and Takaboshi, Chang, Cao, Yamashita, Cassidy, Menezes, Boccolacci, Solomon and Zhi.|$|E
