We then focus our analyses on the specific ways in which <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging by airlines can affect firm value. Specifically, we investigate the effect of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging on firm value based on different hedging levels, different levels of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> exposures, different hedger types, different operating costs spent on <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> and different levels of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> price volatility.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are mainly}} four {{pathways}} to get liquid fuels from the coal including the direct liquefaction process, the Fischer-Tropsch process, coal-tar refining, and pyrolysis process. The characteristics {{of these four}} processed have been described. As the first two pathways {{are considered to be}} promising, the characteristics of these two types of coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are discussed and the component characteristics of coal-based synthesis fuels are investigated, respectively. The component characteristics of coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are compared with the traditional petroleum-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> There are large differences between the properties of the coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> via direct and indirect liquefaction pathways. Comparing with the conventional petroleum-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> the coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> via direct liquefaction pathway has the higher aromatics content, while the fuel via indirect pathway (F-T process) has more paraffin and nearly no naphthenes or aromatics.

Therefore different production processes for sustainable <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are developed and optimized by the German Aerospace Center. Additionally cost analysis for the operation and construction of appropriate refineries were performed. Howev-er, {{the environmental impact of}} the green fuel production was not analysed.

40|$|The key {{motivation}} {{for this work}} was {{the potential impact of}} alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> use on emissions that contribute to global climate change. This work focused on one specific aspect in examining the feasibility of using alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> - their life-cycle Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions relative to conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> This involved the quantification of the overall GHG emissions of potential alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuels,</b> from feedstock recovery and transportation, to the production, transportation and utilization of the fuels. The fuels examined in this work included <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> and ultra-low sulfur <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from conventional crude, <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from oil sands and oil shale, Fischer-Tropsch <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from natural gas, coal and biomass, and biojet from soy oil and palm oil. By identifying and varying important input parameters, a range of life-cycle GHG emissions for each fuel pathway was derived. From the analyses in this work, only alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> from biomass offer substantial life-cycle GHG emissions reductions compared to conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> and that is true only if land use change emissions were negligible. Direct or indirect land use changes from the use of biomass feedstocks (particularly food crops) could potentially increase life-cycle GHG emissions to levels several times above that of conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> A scenario analysis was conducted to examine the amount of biofuel needed to displace conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> in 2025 to maintain U. S. aviation GHG emissions at baseline 2006 levels. It was found that the large-scale deployment of biofuels to achieve carbon-neutral U. S. aviation growth through 2025 was limited by feedstock and land availability if current generation biofuels (particularly those made from food crops) were used. Hence, it is important to explore the use of next generation non-food, high yield feedstocks (e. g. algae) that use little land and result in little or no land use change emissions for large-scale biofuel production. by Hsin Min Wong.

Contaminated soil was incubated at 27 °C either as well-aerated surface soil or as poorly aerated subsurface soil. In the former case, {{the effects of}} bioremediation treatment on residues, microbial numbers, and microbial activity were also assessed. Hydrocarbon residues were measured by quantitative gas chromatography. Enumerations included direct counts of metabolically active bacteria, measurement of mycelial length, plate counts of aerobic heterotrophs, and most probable numbers of hydrocarbon degraders. Activity was assessed by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis. <b>Jet</b> <b>fuel</b> disappeared much more rapidly from surface soil than it did from subsurface soil. In surface soil, microbial numbers and mycelial length were increased by 2 to 2. 5 orders of magnitude {{as a result of}} <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> contamination alone and by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude {{as a result of the}} combination of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> contamination and bioremediation. FDA hydrolysis was stimulated by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> and bioremediation, but was inhibited by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> alone. The latter was traced to an inhibition of the FDA assay by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> biodegradation products. In subsurface soil, oxygen limitation strongly attenuated microbial responses to <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> An increase in the most probable numbers of hydrocarbon degraders was accompanied by a decline in other aerobic heterotrophs, so that total plate counts changed little.

Adding back a cocktail of 7 of the most prevalent aromatic hydrocarbons found in <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> to S- 8 up-regulated cyclooxygenase- 2 expression and induced immune suppression. Cyclooxygenase- 2 induction can be initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). JP- 8 treated keratinocytes increased ROS production, S- 8 did not.
