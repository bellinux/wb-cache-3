50|$|<b>Nosiheptide</b> {{consists}} of 5 thiazole rings, a central tetrasubstituted pyridine moiety, and a bicyclic macrocycle, {{which includes a}} modified amino acid (from tryptophan) external to the initial peptide translated from the gene encoding it. It {{is used as a}} feed additive in the growth of poultry and hogs to promote growth and general health, although it has not been applied in human medicines due to low water solubility and poor resorption from the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Nosiheptide</b> and other thiopeptide's mechanism of action stems from the tight binding on the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting the activities of elongation factors, preventing protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nosiheptide</b> {{biosynthesis}} {{begins with}} the translation of a 50 amino acid precursor peptide consisting of a 37 amino acid leader peptide fused to a 13 amino acid structural peptide (SCTTCECCCSCSS), matching the <b>nosiheptide</b> backbone aside from the C-terminal serine residue that is partially cleaved in maturation of the final product. Next, cyclizations occur between 5 of the cysteine residues in the structural sequence and the previous carbonyl on the adjacent amino acid to form thiazole rings after oxidation. Several amino acid residues then undergo elimination of water to produce dehydroamino acids, and the first macrocycle is constructed by cyclization of two of these dehydroamino acid residues. This cyclization includes a Diels-Alder type reaction, dehydration, and elimination of the leader peptide. An indolic acid moiety modified from L-tryptophan is then ligated to the unmodified cysteine residue through a thioester linkage. After methylation and oxidation of the indole, the second macrocycle is formed by reaction of the indole hydroxyl group with the free carboxyl group of the nearby glutamate residue. The now fused bicyclic peptide undergoes several oxidations and partial cleavage of the C-terminal dehydroalanine residue to give the mature <b>nosiheptide.</b>|$|E

Although the crystal structures of NHR and the closely related thiostrepton-resistance methyltransferase (TSR) in complex with the cofactor S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) are available, the principles behind NHR substrate recognition and catalysis remain unclear. We have analyzed the binding interactions between NHR and model 58 and 29 nucleotide substrate RNAs by gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) and fluorescence anisotropy. We show that the enzyme binds to RNA as a dimer. By constructing a hetero-dimer complex composed of one wild-type subunit and one inactive mutant NHR-R 135 A subunit, we show that only one functional subunit of the NHR homodimer is required for its enzymatic activity. Mutational analysis suggests that the interactions between neighbouring bases (G 1068 and U 1066) and A 1067 have an important role in methyltransfer activity, such that the substitution of a deoxy sugar spacer (5 ') to the target nucleotide achieved near wild-type levels of methylation. A series of atomic substitutions at specific positions on the substrate adenine show that local base-base interactions between neighbouring bases are important for methylation. Taken together these data suggest that local base-base interactions {{play an important role in}} aligning the substrate 2 ' hydroxyl group of A 1067 for methyl group transfer.

40|$|Abstract. The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of figure–eight macrocycles are very scarce owing to the intricacies and lack of predictability from first principles. This review emphasizes on discrete macrocyclic systems both synthetic and natural with a defined figure eight knotted topology. In almost all the helical macrocycles, the helical arrangement is held by intramolecular hydrogen bonding or as a backbone requirement, but in all cases, a planar graph can be drawn and so these compounds are trivial from the topological stand point. Nature presents great deal of complexity in terms of structures in macromolecules like DNA and proteins and also displays intriguing topology in simple natural products.

40|$|The thiopeptide {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} targets the GTPase-associated center (GAC) of the ribosome to inhibit translation factor function. Using X-ray crystallography, we have determined the binding sites of thiostrepton (Thio), <b>nosiheptide</b> (Nosi), and micrococcin (Micro), on the Deinococcus radiodurans large ribosomal subunit. The thiopeptides, by binding within a cleft located between the ribosomal protein L 11 and helices 43 and 44 of the 23 S rRNA, overlap {{with the position}} of domain V of EF-G, thus explaining how this class of drugs perturbs translation factor binding to the ribosome. The presence of Micro leads to additional density for the C-terminal domain (CTD) of L 7, adjacent to and interacting with L 11.

40|$|The radical S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) {{superfamily}} contains {{thousands of}} proteins that catalyze highly diverse conversions, {{most of which}} are poorly understood {{due to a lack of}} information regarding chemical products and radical-dependent transformations.

Drug binding induces a large transition from a partially unfolded to a globin-like structure.

Remarkably, the identified four-ring motif is also the major interacting part of the antibiotic with the ribosome. Hence the TipA multidrug resistance mechanism is directed against the same chemical motif that inhibits protein synthesis.

40|$|Two {{bacterial}} response regulator {{systems were}} studied in this thesis. NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography {{were used to}} determine the structures of both domains of the antibiotic sensor TipAL, {{as well as of the}} c-di-GMP receptor PA 4608, in complex with cognate ligands. By comparison with structures of the free proteins, we found that ligand binding induced biologically relevant structural rearrangements in all proteins studied. The putative multidrug resistance gene tipA of the soil bacterium Streptomyces lividans codes for the transcription factor TipAL, which comprises two domains: a DNA-binding domain named TipAN, and a ligand-binding domain named TipAS, which is capable of recognizing and binding a diverse group of macrocyclic thiopeptide antibiotics. After antibiotic binding, TipAL binds to promoter DNA and activates transcription. In order to elucidate the specificity and flexibility of antibiotic recognition as well as the mechanism of transcriptional activation, the two domains of TipAL were studied separately. We have determined the structures of TipAS with bound promothiocin A or <b>nosiheptide</b> antibiotics by NMR spectroscopy. The N-terminal part of the TipAS sequence, which is flexible and unstructured in free TipAS, forms three new helices in both complexes, burying the bound antibiotics. Considering that the newly formed helices form the connection between the TipAS and TipAN domains, we propose that the formation of additional secondary structure forms the basis of transcriptional activation by TipAL after ligand binding. The TipAS complexes with promothiocin A and <b>nosiheptide</b> are similar, but differ in the dynamics of the newly formed helices; the smaller ligand, promothiocin A, appears to leave more room for movement of TipAS. The structure of TipAN in complex with a fragment of tipA promoter DNA was solved by X-ray crystallography. TipAN binds to the symmetric promoter as a dimer, which is held together by a long, antiparallel coiled coil. In contrast to homologous proteins, TipAN does not bend and twist bound DNA, which is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation by other proteins of the same family. This indicates that the activated TipAS domain is required for transcriptional activation by TipAL. C-di-GMP is a second messenger molecule that appears to be ubiquitous in, and unique to, the bacterial kingdom. It generally controls the switch from motile, singlecell lifestyles to surface-attached, multicellular communities such as biofilms. The natural receptors of c-di-GMP are the PilZ domain proteins, which include PA 4608 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have solved the NMR solution structure of PA 4608 in complex with c-di-GMP. C-di-GMP binds to the protein as an intercalated dimer, displacing the C-terminal 310 helix found in the apo form. The N-terminal part of PA 4608, which contains the highly conserved RxxxR motif and which is flexible and unstructured before ligand binding, contacts the distal side of c-di-GMP. ...|$|E
40|$|The radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) enzyme {{superfamily}} {{is remarkable}} at catalyzing chemically diverse and complex reactions.

We now report {{the expansion of the}} MIA synthase family by characterization of NocL, which is involved in nocathiacin I biosynthesis. EPR and UV-visible absorbance spectroscopic analyses demonstrated the interaction between l-Trp and the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster of NocL, leading to the assumption of nonspecific interaction of [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster with other nucleophiles via the unique Fe site. This notion is supported by the finding of the heterogeneity in the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster of NocL in the absence of AdoMet, which was revealed by the EPR study at very low temperature. Furthermore, a free radical was observed by EPR during the catalysis, which is in good agreement with the hypothesis of a glycyl radical intermediate. Combined with the mutational analysis, these studies provide new insights into the function of the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster of radical AdoMet enzymes as well as the mechanism of the radical-mediated complex carbon chain rearrangement catalyzed by MIA synthase...|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{metabolites}} {{isolated in}} screening programs {{for their ability}} to activate transcription of the tipA promoter (ptipA) in Streptomyces lividans define a class of cyclic thiopeptide antibiotics having dehydroalanine side chains ('tails'). Here we show that such compounds of heterogeneous primary structure (representatives tested: thiostrepton, <b>nosiheptide,</b> berninamycin, promothiocin) are all recognized by TipAS and TipAL, two in-frame translation products of the tipA gene. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif of TipAL is homologous to the MerR family of transcriptional activators, while the C terminus forms a novel ligand- binding domain, ptipA inducers formed irreversible complexes in vitro and in vivo (presumably covalent) with TipAS by reacting with the second of the two C-terminal cysteine residues. Promothiocin and thiostrepton derivatives in which the dehydroalanine side chains were removed lost the ability to modify TipAS. They were able to induce expression of ptipA as well as the tipA gene, although with reduced activity. Thus, TipA required the thiopeptide ring structure for recognition, while the tail served either as a dispensable part of the recognition domain and/or locked thiopeptides onto TipA proteins, thus leading to an irreversible transcriptional activation. Construction and analysis of a disruption mutant showed that tipA was autogenously regulated and conferred thiopeptide resistance.

40|$|Background: The {{sporulation}} of aerial hyphae of Streptomyces coelicolor is {{a complex}} developmental process. Only {{a limited number of}} the genes involved in this intriguing morphological differentiation programme are known, including some key regulatory genes. The aim {{of this study was to}} expand our knowledge of the gene repertoire involved in S. coelicolor sporulation. Results: We report a DNA microarray-based investigation of developmentally controlled gene expression in S. coelicolor. By comparing global transcription patterns of the wild-type parent and two mutants lacking key regulators of aerial hyphal sporulation, we found a total of 114 genes that had significantly different expression in at least one of the two mutants compared to the wild-type during sporulation. A whiA mutant showed the largest effects on gene expression, while only a few genes were specifically affected by whiH mutation. Seven new sporulation loci were investigated in more detail with respect to expression patterns and mutant phenotypes. These included SCO 7449 - 7451 that affect spore pigment biogenesis; SCO 1773 - 1774 that encode an L-alanine dehydrogenase and a regulator-like protein and are required for maturation of spores; SCO 3857 that encodes a protein highly similar to a <b>nosiheptide</b> resistance regulator and affects spore maturation; and four additional loci (SCO 4421, SCO 4157, SCO 0934, SCO 1195) that show developmental regulation but no overt mutant phenotype. Furthermore, we describe a new promoter-probe vector that takes advantage of the red fluorescent protein mCherry as a reporter of cell type-specific promoter activity. Conclusion: Aerial hyphal sporulation in S. coelicolor is a technically challenging process for global transcriptomic investigations since it occurs only as a small fraction of the colony biomass and is not highly synchronized. Here we show that by comparing a wild-type to mutants lacking regulators that are specifically affecting processes in aerial hypha, it is possible to identify previously unknown genes with important roles in sporulation.

With global emergence of multiply-drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and parasites like Plasmodium falciparum, there is a distinct need {{for the development of}} novel anti-infectives to target these infections. Our data encompasses interdisciplinary links between pharmacology, natural product chemistry, infectious disease pathogenesis and innate immunity. We have (I) characterized novel antibiotics as new classical-type antibiotics, (II) identified a significant virulence factor, alpha-toxin, in MRSA and characterized its potential as a therapeutic target and (III) investigated a pathogen-specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulatory subunit as a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of P. falciparum. From this multi-dimensional approach, we have identified potent antibacterial therapies. Our data highlights the ocean as an extremely rich resource of chemically diverse scaffolds. Here, we comprehensively characterize four marine-derived chemical scaffolds, marinopyrrole, napyradiomycin, etamycin and <b>nosiheptide</b> for their potent antibacterial activities against contemporary strains of multi-drug resistant MRSA. Further, in this work, we identify a potential MRSA virulence factor inhibitor. Diflunisal, a known and commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, was predicted via virtual screening to inhibit the production of a pore-forming S. aureus toxin. Our data emphasizes the potent anti-virulence properties of diflunisal and identifies a wide range of supplementary anti-bacterial and anti-virulence properties that could prove extremely useful in treating virulent and pathogenic MRSA infections. Finally, we investigate the PKA regulatory subunit of P. falciparum to identify pathogen-specific features that may be implicated in its roles in malarial parasite development, host invasion and pathogenesis. We conclude it to be a valid therapeutic target by identifying species-specific differences parasitic and mammalian isoforms that may prove useful in the development and engineering of therapeutic inhibitors.

40|$|The vernamycin A (VA) -producing organism, Streptomyces loidensis, is {{refractory}} {{to indigenous}} drug in vivo. Through {{the use of}} an in vitro assay system, {{it has been shown that}} the 50 S ribosomal subunit (normally the target site of VA) is resistant to drug. To determine whether ribosomal RNA (rRKA) or ribosomal proteins (r proteins) conferred resistance to VA, it became necessary to develop a procedure for reconstituting 50 S particles (with the aim of perforning "crossover" experiments with rRNA and r proteins from a VA-sensitive organism). Curiously, 50 S particles reconstituted from S, loidensis rRNA and r proteins, were found to exhibit a changed response to VA in vitro (i. e. they were sensitive to drug by comparison with native 50 S particles). However, while a rigorous examination of reconstituted 50 S particles by a variety of analytical techniques did not reveal an unequivocal reason for the change in response to VA, one novel approach did yield a plausible explanation. Thus, reconstituted 50 S particles exposed to VA appeared to lose a ribosomal protein (tentatively identified as homologous with E. coli L 7 /L 12) while no such protein was lost from native 50 S particles. Hence, the mechanism of resistance to VA in S. loidensis may involve an increased affinity of the protein for the corresponding ribosome. In support of this notion, the "displacement effect" has been observed (on occasions) with native 50 S particles from VA-sensitive organisms. However, it has not been possible to establish unequivocally whether this effect could be the mode of action of the drug. The reconstitution methodology has been adapted and modified to embrace 5 OS ribosomal subunits from a variety of Streptomyces spp. and 30 S ribosomal subunits from Streptomyces coelicolor. In addition, the methodology has been employed to demonstrate that the resistance determinant for <b>nosiheptide,</b> in the producing organism Streptomyces actuosus, is rRNA...|$|E
