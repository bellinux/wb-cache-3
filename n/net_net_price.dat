40|$|There are {{watercourses}} on {{the globe}} which as yet do not deliver up their energy {{to the needs of}} the people. How much energy their waters bear, is it worth to take away this energy? Those and alike questions must be (and they are) answered before start to build hydro power station. Similar problems must be solved to control hydro power plants in most gainful way which is known as hydrothermal coordination. The notion of price of water can be met lately in technical literature as one of numerical indices of these issues. The gross <b>price</b> of water and <b>net</b> <b>price</b> of water are considered in this paper. Gross price of 1 t water is the price of electric energy obtained by conversion of potential energy of 1 t of water, lifted to a height of power station water head. <b>Net</b> <b>price</b> of water is the difference between gross price and total expenses determined by hydro power station building and its exploitation costs in a year related to 1 m 3 of water. If <b>net</b> <b>price</b> of water is positive, it is worth building power station. The greater <b>net</b> <b>price</b> is, the more urgent is the building. <b>Net</b> <b>price</b> of water grows with water head but it continues only to some height of the dam because further increase of head sharply increases capital outlay and other exploitation expenses. To maximize <b>net</b> <b>price</b> of water, optimization of <b>net</b> <b>price</b> function can be done. <b>Net</b> <b>price</b> of water diminishes when some amount of water is diverted for other needs. When amount of diverted water is out of discussion, no controversy can emerge. However when by diverted water some goods with some monetary worth can be obtained, the task must be solved how much water can be diverted so that the water of watercourse be used to the maximum benefit.

40|$|The {{main idea}} behind Reconfigurable Object <b>Nets</b> (RONs) is the {{integration}} of transition firing and rule-based <b>net</b> structure transformation of place/transition <b>nets</b> during system simulation. RONs are high-level <b>nets</b> with two types of tokens: object <b>nets</b> (place/transition <b>nets)</b> and <b>net</b> transformation rules (a dedicated type of graph transformation rules). Firing of high-level transitions may involve firing of object <b>net</b> transitions, transporting object <b>net</b> tokens through the high-level <b>net,</b> and applying <b>net</b> transformation rules to object <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> transformations include <b>net</b> modifications such as merging or splitting of object <b>nets,</b> and <b>net</b> refinement.

Our approach allows the speci cation of di erent symmetry groups. Additionally it provides facilities either to calculate symmetries on demand while running the actual analysis algorithm, or to calculate them in advance. For the latter case we de ne and calculate a ground set of symmetries. Such a set has polynomial size and is su cient for an e cient implementation of the for all symmetries loop and the partition of <b>net</b> elements into equivalence classes. These two constructions are the usual way tointegrate symmetries into an analysis algorithm. ...|$|R
