5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: <b>none</b> <b>are</b> universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E

Adoption is the ultimate goal, but unadoptable cats may live out their lives on the property as well.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the bird}} species {{recorded}} in Nicaragua. The avifauna of Nicaragua included a total of 779 species as of May 2008, according to Bird Checklists of the World. Since that date, two additional species have been added through eBird. Of the 781 species, 54 are rare or accidental and four have been introduced by humans. <b>None</b> <b>are</b> endemic.|$|E
5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all {{together in the}} same building, and <b>none</b> <b>are</b> unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.|$|E

5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though <b>none</b> <b>are</b> now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Strasbourg, Calvin was not {{attached}} to one particular church, but held his office successively in the Saint-Nicolas Church, the Sainte-Madeleine Church and the former Dominican Church, renamed the Temple Neuf. (All of these churches still exist, but <b>none</b> <b>are</b> in the architectural state of Calvin's days.) Calvin ministered to 400–500 members in his church. He preached or lectured every day, with two sermons on Sunday. Communion was celebrated monthly and congregational singing of the psalms was encouraged. He also worked on the second edition of the Institutes. Calvin was dissatisfied with its original structure as a catechism, a primer for young Christians.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, {{but this was}} most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and <b>none</b> <b>are</b> in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E

5|$|Navenby {{is served}} by its own village school, Navenby Church of England Primary School. It is a {{voluntary}} controlled school for children aged 4–11. There is a choice of nearby senior schools for older Navenby pupils, although <b>none</b> <b>are</b> within the village. Lincolnshire County Council operates a preference system for parents, which allows them to choose a preferred school, rather than one {{for which they are}} in the catchment area. The closest senior school to Navenby, and the one that is within the Designated Transport Area, is Sir William Robertson High School at Welbourn. This is a mixed comprehensive school named after Field Marshal William Robertson, who was born in Welbourn and served in the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Technetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; <b>none</b> <b>are</b> stable. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts {{are found in}} the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis is {{the largest}} {{architectural}} complex at Quiriguá, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned. The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes. The acropolis complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of corbel arches, but <b>none</b> <b>are</b> still standing.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; <b>none</b> <b>are</b> specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though <b>none</b> <b>are</b> specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E
5|$|The main {{cargo carried}} was coal. In 1788, {{a group of}} {{shareholders}} set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the Forest of Dean. This profitable business continued until 1833. Boats that worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of sailing boat which was fitted with ketch, cutter or sloop rigging. Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts, but <b>none</b> <b>are</b> known to have survived to the present day.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions would be necessary, and side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though <b>none</b> <b>are</b> known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E
5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; <b>none</b> <b>are</b> likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but <b>none</b> <b>are</b> effective.|$|E
