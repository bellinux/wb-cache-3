50|$|Almost all {{transgenic}} plants {{contain a}} few common building blocks that make unknown GMOs easier to find. Even though detecting a novel gene in a GMO {{can be like}} finding {{a needle in a}} haystack, the fact that the needles are usually similar makes it much easier. To trigger gene expression, scientists couple the gene they want to add with what is known as a transcription promoter. The high-performing 35S promoter is a common feature to many GMOs. In addition, the stop signal for gene transcription in most GMOs is often the same: the <b>NOS</b> <b>terminator.</b> Researchers now compile a set of genetic sequences characteristic of GMOs. After genetic elements characteristic of GMOs are selected, methods and tools are developed for detecting them in test samples. Approaches being considered include microarrays and anchor PCR profiling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The acreage for genetically {{modified}} crops (GMOs) —particularly soybean—has steadily increased since 1996, when the first crop of Roundup Ready soy-bean (intended for food production) was grown. The Roundup Ready soybean varieties derive from a soybean line into which a glyphosate-resistant enolpyruvylshiki-mate- 3 -phosphate-synthase (EPSPS) gene was intro-duced. The inserted and the flanking regions in Roundup Ready soybean have recently been characterized. It was shown that a further 250 -bp fragment of the epsps gene is localized downstream of the introduced <b>nos</b> <b>terminator</b> of transcription, derived from the nopaline synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We examined whether this 250 -bp fragment could be of functional importance. Our data demonstrate that at least 150 bp of this DNA region are transcribed in Roundup Ready soybean. Transcription of the fragment depends on whether read-through events ignore the <b>nos</b> <b>terminator</b> signal located upstream. Our data also indicate that the read-through product is further processed, resulting in four different RNA variants from which the transcribed region of the <b>nos</b> <b>terminator</b> is completely deleted. Deletion results in the generation of open reading frames which might code for (as yet unknown) EPSPS fusion proteins. The <b>nos</b> <b>terminator</b> {{is used as a}} regulatory element in several other GMOs used for food production. This implies that read through products and transcription of RNA variants might be a common feature in these GMOs...|$|E

30|$|Template DNA {{molecules}} can {{be generated}} either by fragmentation or standard PCR. If fragmentation is used, universal adaptors are ligated to the fragment end, similar to the method used by Illumina. In the case of PCR, the adaptors can be built into the primers. The prepared fragments are hybridised to special beads upon which both amplification and sequencing takes place; the beads are used in excess to ensure that each bead binds a maximum of one template molecule. A mix of these beads, PCR reagents and oil is then agitated to form an emulsion of tiny oil reaction chambers, each containing a single bead with a single molecule attached and all the components of a PCR. This is subjected to thermal cycling to clonally amplify the DNA template {{on the surface of}} each bead (known as emulsion PCR or emPCR). The sequencing reaction is performed on a specially fabricated ‘PicoTitre Plate (PTP)’—this comprises millions of microscopic wells, each just big enough to contain a single template bead. After breaking the emulsion the beads are loaded onto the PTP along with other, much smaller beads that contain all the reagents necessary for the sequencing reaction except the nucleotides. Sequencing proceeds with the sequential addition of each individual nucleotide in turn (i.e. A, then C, then G, then T). If a nucleotide is incorporated by DNA polymerase into the growing DNA strand, an inorganic phosphate ion is released. This initiates an enzyme cascade resulting in the release of a flash of light. Since <b>no</b> <b>terminators</b> are used in this chemistry, incorporation of nucleotides into homopolymer stretches continues until a different base is encountered and the associated light flash is proportionally brighter. The location and intensity of light emitted is detected by a camera across the whole plate. Excess nucleotides are then washed off in preparation for the next cycle. This process is repeated several hundred times to build the temporal image sequence. Unlike other chemistries the number of incorporation cycles required to reach a particular read length is dependent on the sequence composition of the template. On average read length is expected to be ~ 2.5 × cycle number but this could be less with more homopolymers. As before the temporal series of images can be computationally converted into sequence reads.|$|R

Since design of a selective environment for maintaining function of a circuit will be unique to every circuit, general design principles are needed for engineering evolutionary robust circuits that permit the long-term study or applied use of synthetic circuits. Results: We first measured the stability of two BioBrick-assembled genetic circuits propagated in Escherichia coli over multiple generations and the mutations that caused their loss-of-function. The first circuit, T 9002, loses function in less than 20 generations and the mutation that repeatedly causes its loss-of-function is a deletion between two homologous transcriptional terminators.

5000|$|Under 2007-era {{analysis}} terminator {{blood is}} shown {{to be similar to}} human blood, using a synthetic oxygen carrier rather than human red blood cells, as <b>terminator</b> endoskeletons contain <b>no</b> bone marrow. <b>Terminator</b> flesh heals by itself, and at a much faster rate than normal human tissue and has never been shown to bruise or discolor from trauma, even after several days. However, a terminator's flesh covering can die if it sustains adequately massive damage, at which point it takes on a waxy, corpse-like pallor and begins to decompose. This process is seen in the later scenes of the original film where The Terminator, holed up in his hotel room, is attracting flies and draws an inquiry from the janitor as to whether the smell is coming from a dead animal. More advanced flesh used on T-888s appears to not suffer the effects of age or deprivation, as shown in the Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episode, [...] "Self Made Man," [...] where a T-888 known as Myron Stark is able to maintain his organic covering while sealed within a wall for eighty years; no explanation for this ability was provided. Terminator flesh lacerations can be repaired; the T-800 and Sarah Connor closed each other's wounds with sutures in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and Cameron sealed her wounds with heavy duty staples in The Sarah Connor Chronicles episode [...] "Samson and Delilah".|$|R
