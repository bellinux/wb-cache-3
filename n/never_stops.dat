5|$|Beginning in 1999, Monster Ballads, {{a series}} of {{compilation}} albums that feature popular power ballads, usually from the glam metal genre, capitalized on the nostalgia, with the first volume going platinum. The VH1 sponsored Rock <b>Never</b> <b>Stops</b> Tour, beginning in 1998, has seen many glam metal bands take to the stage again, including on the inaugural tour: Warrant, Slaughter, Quiet Riot, FireHouse, and L.A. Guns. Slaughter also {{took part in the}} 1999 version with Ted Nugent, Night Ranger, and Quiet Riot. Poison and Cinderella toured together in 2000 and 2002, and in 2005 Cinderella headlined the Rock <b>Never</b> <b>Stops</b> Tour, with support from Ratt, Quiet Riot, and FireHouse. In 2007 the four-day-long Rocklahoma festival held in Oklahoma included glam metal bands Poison, Ratt and Twisted Sister. Warrant and Cinderella co-headlined the festival in 2008. Nostalgia for the genre was evidenced in the production of the glam metal themed musical Rock of Ages, which ran in Los Angeles in 2006 and in New York in 2008. It was made into a film released in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|Robin Wright as Jenny Curran: Forrest's {{childhood}} friend {{with whom he}} immediately falls in love, and <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> loving throughout his life. A victim {{of child sexual abuse}} at the hands of her bitterly widowed father, Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in the 1960s and the 1970s/1980s drug culture. She re-enters Forrest's life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterwards she dies of an unnamed illness, but given the time period, the movie's propensity for showing the major aspects of U.S. culture, and the character's depicted actions during the 60s and 70s, it can be speculated that she died of AIDS or Hepatitis C.|$|E

FireHouse is estimated to have sold over 7 million albums worldwide since their debut.|$|E
25|$|Dentures {{that fit}} well {{during the first}} few years after {{creation}} will not necessarily fit well {{for the rest of the}} wearer's lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to resorb progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the dentures. Poorly fitting dentures hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting dentures. Poor fitting dentures may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum.|$|E

On April 5, 2004 Time magazine said that Ding Zilin is “the symbolic leader for many people in China who want the government to account for its actions that night. She is a small woman with a strong voice. Her bereavement makes her powerful”. Author of Beijing Coma, Ma Jian also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 New York Times article. He describes how she will once again defy authorities and lay a memorial off Chang'an Avenue. He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a deer in the headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} never {{completely}} at rest. It <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> functioning and firing neuronal signals, {{as well as}} using oxygen {{as long as the}} person in question is alive. In fact, in Stark and Squire’s, 2001 study When zero is not zero: The problem of ambiguous baseline conditions in fMRI, activity in the medial temporal lobe (as well as in other brain regions) was substantially higher during rest than during several alternative baseline conditions. The effect of this elevated activity during rest was to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the sign of the activity during task conditions relevant to memory functions. These results demonstrate that periods of rest are associated with significant cognitive activity and are therefore not an optimal baseline for cognition tasks. In order to discern baseline and activation conditions it is necessary to interpret a lot of information. This includes situations as simple as breathing. Periodic blocks may result in identical data of other variance in the data if the person breathes at a regular rate of 1 breath/5sec, and the blocks occur every 10s, thus impairing the data.|$|E

500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbishs {{sound is}} highly {{influenced}} by the traditional guitar pop of British bands such as the Kinks, the Jam, the Small Faces and the Who. The album's songs explore a number of styles—punk rock ("Advert"), neo-psychedelia ("Chemical World"), and vaudeville music-hall ("Sunday Sunday"). Opening track [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] is, according to NME, [...] "quintessential Blur. Damon, perennially bored, <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> singing, and Graham [...] supplie his usual immaculate guitar accompaniment". While [...] "Oily Water" [...] harked back to the baggy sound of Leisure, NME described [...] "Intermission" [...] as [...] "a pub piano knees-up that rinky-dinks along then gets frazzled in guitars and speeded-up drums". Most of the songs on the album are melodic and lushly produced, often supplemented by a brass section, string arrangements and backing vocals. To offer contrast to the classicist songwriting, Allmusic noted that [...] "Coxon's guitar tears each song open, either with unpredictable melodic lines or layers of translucent, hypnotic effects, and his work creates great tension with Alex James' kinetic bass".|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from CD Universe {{commented that}} the song [...] "warns a potential love of [...] need for time and patience, rolling along nicely with a slow groove and a big beat." [...] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic considered [...] "Sometimes" [...] a competent single, but claimed the song as unremarkable. Kyle Anderson of MTV said that the song [...] "introduces the first sorta-ballad to ," [...] and considered it [...] "reasonable enough, though through three songs Spears' lyric approach appears to be entirely about guys. Like, she <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> thinking about them." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called [...] "Sometimes" [...] a [...] "further hit" [...] from ...Baby One More Time, along with [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spence D. of IGN considered [...] "Sometimes" [...] a [...] " [...] glossy grown-up pop" [...] song, while Annabel Leathes of BBC Online said the song [...] "represent the innocent years when Britney annoyed and titillated in equal measure." [...] During the 2000 BMI Pop Awards, [...] "Sometimes" [...] was honored with the award of Most Performed BMI Song.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} a decade later that the album started to receive almost {{unanimous}} praise from rock critics, many of whom made particular note of its influence in modern rock music. Christgau wrote in his 1977 retrospective review for The Village Voice that the record was difficult to understand in 1967, [...] "which is probably why people are still learning from it. It sounds intermittently crude, thin, and pretentious at first, but it <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> getting better". In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), Colin Larkin called it a [...] "powerful collection" [...] that [...] "introduced Reed's decidedly urban infatuations, a fascination for street culture and amorality bordering on voyeurism." [...] In April 2003, Spin led their [...] "Top Fifteen Most Influential Albums of All Time" [...] list with the album. On November 12, 2000, NPR included it in their [...] "NPR 100" [...] series of [...] "the most important American musical works of the 20th century". Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time in November 2003, calling it the most prophetic rock album ever made.|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{speculation}} of rifts between Dempsey and Pompeo, {{and even}} show runner Rhimes, the former maintained his stance of leaving in a [...] "very good" [...] place with his co-star of ten years.

Chemistry right away.” He thanked his fans on Twitter and wrote, [...] "I {{want to thank all}} the fans, what an incredible 11 yrs, I love you all." [...] Rhimes asserted on the importance of Dempsey's character in the statement she released at his departure: “Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character—for Meredith, for me and for the fans. I absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ‘McDreamy.’ As Ellis Grey would say: the carousel <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> turning.” Pompeo too took to Twitter to react to the death of Shepherd and wrote, [...] "I am honored and excited {{to tell the story of}} how Meredith goes on in the face of what feels like the impossible. I hope you will all join me on her journey.” It was the first time she spoke out publicly about Dempsey's publicised exit.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented {{positively}} on {{the arrangement}} of Monteith's song, grading the performance [...] "A". His lowest grade went to [...] "Papa, Can You Hear Me?", which he gave a [...] "C". Benigno felt that both Michele and Colfer's solos were damaged {{by the fact that}} the songs' only link to the episode's plot were their titles, finding it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing [...] "I wanna be your man" [...] about his father. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their [...] relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt's performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, [...] "it genuinely grows out of the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad <b>never</b> <b>stops</b> being kind of weird." [...] Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode.

Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley's songs, which left her [...] "strangely unmoved". She suggested that, [...] "Mercedes sang admirably, beautifully even, but she didn’t seem truly transported by the music; so we weren't." ...|$|E
