5|$|It is also widely {{believed}} that birth rates fell {{during the period}} too, meaning that {{the growth rate of}} the population fell relative to the <b>natural</b> <b>death</b> rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time. Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the <b>natural</b> <b>death</b> of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the epidemiology {{and the underlying}} pathological conditions of <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> among motor vehicle drivers. Sudden death while driving may cause damage to properties, other vehicles or road users. Although the Medical Commission on Accident Prevention recommended restrictions to drivers at risk of {{sudden death due to}} their medical conditions, these restrictions are useless if they do not result in greater safety to the public. DESIGN: A retrospective study of <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> of motor vehicle drivers. SETTING: <b>Natural</b> <b>deaths</b> of motor vehicle drivers reported to the coroner for Birmingham and Solihull. SUBJECTS: 86 consecutive <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> of motor vehicle drivers in a five-year period between 1984 and 1988. RESULTS: Of the 86 fatalities reviewed, 80 (93 %) sudden deaths were caused by ischaemic heart disease. Fifty vehicles were involved in collision with 32 properties, 20 other vehicles and six pedestrians. Fifty-one out of 80 cardiac deaths had past cardiac history and three had reported chest pain prior to the sudden death. CONCLUSION: An applied normative ethical assessment based on the basic moral principles of autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence are discussed. We conclude that medical screening of drivers has little benefit for the drivers or other persons...|$|R
5|$|Ambrose Dudley {{was imprisoned}} in the Tower of London {{with his father}} and his four brothers. All were attainted and {{condemned}} to death, but only the Duke and Guildford Dudley, the second youngest brother, were executed. After the <b>natural</b> <b>death</b> of John, the eldest brother, in October 1554, Ambrose Dudley was the family's heir; he remained longest in the Tower, being released late in 1554 after a plea by his wife, Lady Tailboys. On the whole, the brothers' release was brought about by their mother and their brother-in-law Henry Sidney, who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around England's new co-ruler and king consort, Philip of Spain. Out of prison, in December 1554 or January 1555, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship.|$|E
5|$|Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving fair trial. The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the priests and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by strangulation in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a <b>natural</b> <b>death</b> within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E
5|$|When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD, {{his estate}} and {{the titles of}} the principate were left to Caligula and Tiberius's own grandson, Gemellus, who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still {{conjecture}} that he was murdered. Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect, Macro, smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to {{the joy of the}} Roman people, while Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian. Seneca the Elder and Philo, who both wrote during Tiberius's reign, as well as Josephus record Tiberius as dying a <b>natural</b> <b>death.</b> Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius's will nullified with regard to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius's wishes.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of Melvin Van Peebles' film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, he premiered two musicals on Broadway, Don't Play Us Cheap and Ain't Supposed To Die A <b>Natural</b> <b>Death,</b> {{deriving}} from earlier plays he had written in French. To express the ghetto's turmoil and pathos, Van Peebles used sprechgesang as a form he could tell stories in; he recorded three albums using this style, Brer Soul, Ain't Supposed To Die a <b>Natural</b> <b>Death</b> and As Serious as a Heart-Attack. The albums were categorized as spoken word at the time, but was later called a precursor to rapping and hip hop music.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Valid {{mortality}} statistics {{are important for}} healthcare planning and research. Suicides and accidents often present a challenge in the classification of the manner of death. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the reliability of the national suicide statistics by comparing the classification of suicide in the Scandinavian cause of death registers with a reclassification by 8 persons with different medical expertise (psychiatry, forensic pathology and public health) from each of the 3 Scandinavian countries. METHODS: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark retrieved available information on a sample of 600 deaths in 2008 from each country. 200 were classified in the registers as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined and 200 as <b>natural</b> <b>deaths.</b> The reclassification comprised an assessment of the manner and cause of death as well as the level of certainty. RESULTS: In total, 81 %, 88 % and 90 % of deaths registered as suicide in the official {{mortality statistics}} were confirmed by experts using the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish data sets, respectively. About 3 % of deaths classified as accidents or <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> in the cause of death registers were reclassified as suicides. However, after a second reclassification based on additional information, 9 % of the <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> and accidents were reclassified as suicides in the Norwegian data set, and 21 % of the undetermined deaths were reclassified as suicides in the Swedish data set. In total, the levels of certainty of the experts were 87 % of suicides in the Norwegian data set, 77 % in the Swedish data set and 92 % in Danish data set; the uncertainty was highest in poisoning suicides. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of reported suicides were confirmed as being suicides. Few accidents and <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> were reclassified as suicides. Hence, reclassification did not increase the overall official suicide statistics of the 3 Scandinavian countries...|$|R

As the result {{it has been found}} that in the blood serum of sudden death and in some of <b>natural</b> <b>deaths</b> from tumors, leukemias, etc., the decrease in fibrinolytic activity is equivalent to the amount of proactivator that combined with the SK-like substance liberated into blood. On the other hand, in the blood of most of <b>natural</b> <b>deaths,</b> and in that bled from vessels and stored in body cavities, no natural fibrinolysis is observable and the same fibrinolytic activity with SK as normal one is demonstrated. Thus it is concluded that the cause of blood fluidity in sudden death is due to the fibrinolysis. </p...|$|R
