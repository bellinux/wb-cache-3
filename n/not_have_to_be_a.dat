Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays {{at the point of}} intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the spherical angle formed by two great circles on a sphere is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that about 3% of all promotions are underpromotions. The frequency of truly significant underpromotions is, however, less than this. Note that the promoted piece does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> piece that {{has previously been}} captured. A player may promote to any piece they wish, {{regardless of whether or}} not such a piece has been captured. In theory, a player could have nine queens, ten knights, ten bishops or ten rooks, though these are highly improbable scenarios. Some chess sets come with an extra queen of each color to use for promoted pawns. If an extra queen is unavailable, it is often represented by an upside-down rook instead.|$|E

25|$|The Sun, in {{this respect}} as in many others, is {{relatively}} benign: the variation between its maximum and minimum energy output is roughly 0.1% over its 11-year solar cycle. There is strong (though not undisputed) evidence that even minor changes in the Sun's luminosity have had significant effects on the Earth's climate well within the historical era: the Little Ice Age of the mid-second millennium, for instance, may {{have been caused by}} a relatively long-term decline in the Sun's luminosity. Thus, a star does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true variable for differences in luminosity to affect habitability. Of known solar analogs, one that closely resembles the Sun is considered to be 18 Scorpii; unfortunately for the prospects of life existing in its proximity, the only significant difference between the two bodies is the amplitude of the solar cycle, which appears to be much greater for 18 Scorpii.|$|E
25|$|FOA's Torsten Magnusson {{met with}} the American envoy Howard A. Robinson in November 1954, and Malte Jacobsson from the Atom Committee talked to Counter Admiral Lewis Strauss from Atomic Energy Commission in April 1955. Sweden {{indicated}} {{that it would be}} interested in purchasing approximately 25 nuclear devices. In 1957, Ambassador Erik Boheman raised the question at the US State Department, while the Swedish Ministry of Defense inquired about sending Swedish officers to train on the use of nuclear weapons. Boheman also mentioned that Denmark and Norway had already purchased weapons systems that could carry nuclear warheads, although neither country had devices to deploy on such systems. The American response was dismissive because Sweden, as a non-NATO state, did not have any mutual defense agreement with the US, which was a requirement in American law to even consider nuclear weapons cooperation. The message was clear - if Sweden reconsidered its nonalignment policy, the US would consider a new request from Sweden, otherwise discussions would be fruitless. Analysis from the US State Department in 1959, showed that Sweden did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> NATO-member for the proposed nuclear weapons sales, but it had to, at the very minimum, have an agreement with the US regarding use of nuclear weapons, which would imply Sweden renouncing nonalignment. On April 6, 1960, the United States National Security Council decided that the Americans should not support the Swedish ownership of nuclear weapons, nor did it approve of the idea of a Swedish nuclear weapons program. The US Government believed that Western interests would be best served against the Soviet Union if Sweden invested its limited resources in conventional weapons, rather than an expensive nuclear weapons program.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} require the players to employ more tactical approaches to maps, in their introduction of such units as the Flare Gun, a vehicle that could reveal parts of the map hidden by fog of war, and the commanding officers, who have had their [...] "CO Powers" [...] reduced in importance from the previous titles. However, the developers added that one does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "master strategist" [...] to play the game, commenting that the Flare Gun {{could be used by}} a casual gamer to quickly move across a map covered in fog of war, while a more advanced player may use it for more strategic means. This unit was added as a means to speed up stages with fog of war. Other new units include the Bike, which was a means of achieving a faster tempo to the game. When asked why the Duster, a modification of a crop duster, was added in favor of the stealth jet from Advance Wars: Dual Strike, the developers commented that the Duster was an inexpensive aerial unit that was not only easy-to-use, but could attack ground units as well. The unit was also added to be a throwback to an older era, as well as demonstrating how people in this world use anything they can as a means of survival.|$|E
500|$|According to {{intersex}} {{activist and}} academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person's sexual attraction determines {{his or her}} gender. Cal's wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link between gender identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie [...] "denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality." [...] Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees {{with the belief that}} being attracted to females is [...] "masculine" [...] and thus it is [...] "more natural" [...] for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Review of Books argued that Callie does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, [...] "Breasts have the same effect on me as on anyone with my testosterone level." [...] Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish [...] "Eugenides's (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership". Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie's erotic interest in girls is [...] "retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his 'true biological nature'." [...] Cal's gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal's inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth.|$|E

2500|$|At the extreme, {{the theory}} of false {{necessity}} criticizes and thus unifies strands of the radical tradition. It frees leftist and liberal ideals from institutional fetishism, and emancipates modernist ideals from structural fetishism. The theory further detaches the radical commitment from utopian claims and provides a theoretical basis for transformative action. That transformative action, Unger believes, does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete overhaul or total revolution, but rather is [...] "a piecemeal but cumulative change {{in the organization of}} society". The key to the project, {{in the words of one}} critic, [...] "is to complete the rebellion against the naturalistic fallacy (that is, the confusion of accident with essence and contingency with necessity) and to effect an irrevocable emancipation from false necessity".|$|E
2500|$|The Old Bold Pilots Association (OBPA) traces its {{beginnings}} to the mid-1980s when four former United States Army Air Force P-47 Thunderbolt pilots met regularly {{for a meal}} and to share flying stories.

The name of the group is a refutation of an observation made in 1949 by early airmail pilot, E. Hamilton Lee: [...] "There are old pilots and bold pilots, but no old, bold pilots." [...] The association is informal without a charter, dues, or speakers. Informality was desired by members who rejected the strict rules common in other aviation groups. One does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pilot to attend, and anyone with an interest in aviation is invited.|$|E
