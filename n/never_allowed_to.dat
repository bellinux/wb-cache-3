5|$|The Phantom Stranger {{asks the}} Justice League Dark, {{specifically}} Zatanna, {{to help him}} enter Hell to save his family. In Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger #10, Zauriel warns Phantom Stranger that he is <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> enter Heaven again, having gone {{to try to save}} his family. Zauriel states to Phantom Stranger that if he tries, he will be erased from time and history.|$|E
5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> spend time with her son.|$|E

5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> remarry, {{while it}} was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years, and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal approval is sought.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the turn}} of the last century, an Iyer widow was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> remarry. Once her husband dies, an Iyer woman had to tonsure her head. She had to remove the kunkumam or the {{vermilion}} mark on her forehead, and was required to smear her forehead with the sacred ashes. All these practices have, however, greatly dimimished with the enactment of reforms.|$|E
25|$|Arthur {{is forced}} {{to move in with}} his son, Mark, and he spends {{the rest of the year}} desperately trying to {{convince}} Pauline that it is her he wants. Pauline and Arthur eventually reconcile when he helps her deal with the death of her brother, Pete (Peter Dean). The affair is <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> be forgotten, however, particularly when Pauline's relative Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly) comes to lodge and discovers his escapades.|$|E

25|$|Kozlovsky was {{well-known}} to be a favourite {{singer of}} Joseph Stalin. Stalin used to invite Kozlovsky {{to come over}} whenever he wanted {{to listen to the}} sound of his voice, even {{in the middle of the}} night. So pleased was Stalin with Kozlovsky's singing, that he once kissed him and then himself sang to the piano accompaniment of Kozlovsky. Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave its borders.|$|E
25|$|Abagnale was {{eventually}} arrested in Montpellier, France, in 1969 when an Air France attendant he previously dated recognized him and informed police. When the French police arrested him, 12 {{countries in which}} he had committed fraud sought his extradition. After a two-day trial, he first served time in Perpignan's prison—a one-year sentence that the presiding judge at his trial reduced to six months. At Perpignan he was held nude in a tiny, filthy, lightless cell that he was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave. The cell lacked toilet facilities, a mattress, or a blanket, and food and water were strictly limited.|$|E
25|$|The SR.N1 {{made its}} first hover on 11 June 1959, and made its famed {{successful}} crossing of the English Channel on 25 July 1959. In December 1959, the Duke of Edinburgh visited Saunders-Roe at East Cowes and persuaded the chief test-pilot, Commander Peter Lamb, {{to allow him to}} take over the SR.N1's controls. He flew the SR.N1 so fast that he was asked to slow down a little. On examination of the craft afterwards, it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed, damage that was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> be repaired, and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'Royal Dent'.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. National Rifle Association {{collected}} and shipped {{large numbers of}} privately donated rifles {{for use by the}} Home Guard. These were {{collected and}} destroyed after the war. Within a few months they were issued proper uniforms and equipment, as the immediate needs of the regular forces were satisfied. After September 1940 the army began to take charge of the Home Guard training in Osterley, and Wintringham and his associates were gradually sidelined. Wintringham resigned in April 1941. Ironically, despite his support of the Home Guard, Wintringham was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> join the organisation himself because of a policy barring membership by communists and fascists.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Jamal al-Atassi {{supported}} Hafez al-Assad {{after the}} a coup that ousted his cousin Nour al-Deen as president. He hoped Assad {{would take a}} harder line on reunification with Egypt. In March 1972, Assad formed the National Progressive Front, a Baath-led coalition of socialist parties. He invited Atassi, who by this time {{was one of the}} most venerated nationalists in the country, to join a 13-member committee delegated with administering the NPF's political affairs. Realizing that Assad opposed restoring the UAR or the NPF, he left within a year and formed a new organization, the Democratic Arab Socialist Union. Assad promptly outlawed it and sought to isolate Atassi, who was therefore <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> enter parliament.|$|E
25|$|This {{movement}} {{received a}} lot of press in the United States, both favourable and unfavourable. The leader of the movement, Samuel Ripley of Leone, Tutuila, was in effect exiled from American Samoa, when he was barred by the US Navy authorities from disembarking from a ship returning to Pagopago from California, and he was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> return to his homeland. He eventually became the mayor of Richmond, California. The United States sent a committee to American Samoa in 1930, including US citizens from Hawaii who had a prominent role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom and Queen Lili'uokalani. Their report, favourable to the US position, had a considerable influence on US policy, and the American Samoa Mau was totally suppressed by the US. Its influence however continued to be felt.|$|E

25|$|Rikki Clarke top-scored with 46 and top-bowled {{with three}} for 11 for the Surrey Lions {{as they moved}} closer to a quarter-final spot in the Twenty20 Cup with a Duckworth–Lewis method win over Middlesex Crusaders. Batting first, Surrey made 180 for 7, Tim Murtagh hitting 24 off the last eight balls as Melvyn Betts of Middlesex was smashed around. In reply, only Ed Smith could do {{anything}} serious against the Surrey bowlers, with 33 off 22 balls. When Clarke dug out him, Scott Styris and Ed Joyce in quick succession, however, things looked bright for Surrey, and then rain intervened after 11 overs of the Middlesex innings. They were <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> come back, and as they were 22 runs behind the par score with their 78 for 4, Surrey took the victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{while in}} {{hospital}} {{for the removal of}} her tonsils, Svetlana met Kunwar Brajesh Singh, an Indian Communist from the Kalakankar Rajput Zamindar family visiting Moscow. The two fell in love. Singh was mild-mannered and highly educated but gravely ill with bronchiectasis and emphysema. The relationship grew deeper and stronger still while the couple were recuperating in Sochi beside the Black Sea. Singh returned to Moscow in 1965 to work as a translator, but he and Svetlana were not allowed to marry. The following year, 1966, he died. She was allowed to travel to India to take his ashes to his family to pour into the Ganges. She stayed in the family home in Kalakankar {{on the banks of the}} Ganges for three months and became immersed in local customs, leading to her abandonment of atheism. In an interview on 26 April 1967, she referred to Singh as her husband but also stated that they were <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> marry officially.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, {{wars and}} {{genocide}} end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered {{the population of}} the French village Oradour-sur-Glane. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President Charles de Gaulle, as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the former eastern territories were completely destroyed {{in the last two years}} of the war. These territories later became part of Poland and the Soviet Union, and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example Kłomino (Westfalenhof), Pstrąże (Pstransse), and Janowa Góra (Johannesberg). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. Imber and Tyneham, along with several villages in the Stanford Battle Area, were commandeered by the War Office for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since.|$|E

500|$|Stroud {{became the}} subject of a 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis, Birdman of Alcatraz. Gaddis, who {{strongly}} advocated rehabilitation in the prisons, portrayed Stroud in favorable light. [...] This was adapted by Guy Trosper for the 1962 film of the same name, directed by John Frankenheimer. It starred Burt Lancaster as Stroud, Karl Malden as a fictionalized and renamed warden, and Thelma Ritter as Stroud's mother. Both the book and the film were highly fictionalized, with former inmates stating that Stroud was far more sinister and unpleasant than the character depicted in them. Stroud was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> see the film.|$|E
500|$|Although the Peregrine {{appeared}} to be a satisfactory design, it was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> mature since Rolls-Royce's priority was refining the Merlin. As a result, the Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft: the Westland Whirlwind fighter and one of the Gloster F.9/37 prototypes. The Vulture was fitted to the Avro Manchester bomber, but proved unreliable in service and the planned fighter using it – the Hawker Tornado – was cancelled as a result. With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the [...] range, the Peregrine and Vulture were both cancelled in 1943, and by mid-1943 the Merlin was supplemented in service by the larger Griffon. The Griffon incorporated several design improvements and ultimately superseded the Merlin.|$|E
