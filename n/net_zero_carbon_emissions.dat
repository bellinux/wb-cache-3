Hydrogen production via biomass steam gasification is receiving attention due to its sustainability and <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>emission.</b> Coupled with in situ CO 2 adsorption, this process has been proven to be environment friendly. The study reports {{on the impact of}} temperature, steam/biomass ratio and sorbent/biomass ratio on hydrogen production performance in a steam gasification process using a simulation model developed in MATLAB. In this study, biomass is assumed as char and gasification and CO 2 adsorption occur in one gasifier. The model is used to predict the product gas composition, hydrogen yield and thermodynamic efficiency of the process. The results show that with the increase in temperature and steam/biomass ratio, the hydrogen concentration and yield increase, however, the thermodynamic efficiency decreases. Hydrogen yield increases from 78 to 97 g kg - 1 of biomass with the increase in temperature and steam/biomass ratio within the range of 800 to 1300 K and 2. 0 to 5. 0, respectively. Maximum hydrogen efficiency of 87 % is observed at 800 K and steam/biomass ratio of 2. 0. At the sorbent/biomass of 1. 52, hydrogen purity is predicted to reach 0. 98 mole fraction with CO 2 present in system absorbed. At 950 K with steam/biomass ratio of 3. 0 and sorbent/biomass ratio of 1. 0, a maximum hydrogen concentration of 0. 81 mole fraction is obtained in the product gas.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to present a life-cycle assessment of pollution from alternative transport fuels in Indian conditions. The present study is limited to gross <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> (as CO 2) because of its serious implications for global warming. Indicative values of gross <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> from bioethanol, CNG and electrical energy sources have been evaluated from industrial data and compared with those from oil. The energy and environmental analyses of bioethanol production in India show that bioethanol can significantly reduce global CO 2 emissions and, if used as a petrol blend, can help reduce oil imports as well as aromatics pollution from unleaded petrol (now introduced into India). The method used in this research has two main components. The first is an examination of each energy industry in detail, using primary sources of data from power stations, oil refineries and anhydrous ethanol production from molasses. The processes involved in each case are examined, taking into account energy use in any necessary auxiliary activities to evaluate the total <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> The second component is a detailed examination of one specific form of public transport. This is a three-wheeled 8 -seater used {{in the city of}} Lucknow in North India. It is chosen because it is available with a petrol or compressed natural gas (CNG) spark-ignition engine (and hence could alternatively be ethanol-fuelled) and in a battery-electric version. Both parts of this data-gathering have been specific to the situation in India. In energy conversion the refinery crude composition and processes, basic resources of biomass and the mix of primary energy for electricity generation are different in each country. The types of vehicle used also vary considerably from region to region. It is observed that while CNG and electric-powered vehicles may have low and zero tailpipe emissions respectively, gross pollution from such vehicles and their associated resource systems may be significant. In the case of electrically-propelled vehicles the gross <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> is comparable with that for similar petrol-engine vehicles since about 80 % of electricity production in India is fossil-fuel-based. In comparison, CNG shows a reduction of about a third.

40|$|With {{the right}} {{government}} support and with efforts to fast-track stronger environmental building standards, Australian homes and neighbourhoods could be emissions free and water efficient by 2020, {{according to this}} report. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Climate change presents {{a clear and present}} danger to ecosystems, communities and economies. As Professor Garnaut so powerfully stated “the failure of our generation (to address climate change) would lead to consequences that would haunt humanity until the end of time". With further climate change already locked in based on historical emissions it is clear that climate change will impact directly on our homes and we need to prepare them for higher temperatures, more erratic weather and extreme weather events and higher energy and water costs. It makes sense to prepare our homes to withstand future environmental and economic shocks with better design, glazing, insulation and water-efficiency measures. At the same time, the residential housing sector is a major contributor to our total greenhouse emissions. The residential sector contributes 17. 5 percent of Victoria’s greenhouse gas emissions. By 2010, emissions from buildings are estimated to increase by more than 48 percent above 1990 levels. Yet greenhouse gas emissions from the average home can be reduced by more than 75 percent with energy efficient design and appliances. If the remaining energy demand is supplied with renewable energy further greenhouse savings are possible. It is even possible to achieve a house with <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> Implementing cost-effective, simple water-saving measures at the same time can help us adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as drought. The majority of homes that we build today will still be in place in 2050. Building these new homes to yesterday’s water and energy efficiency standards will lock us into high emissions and water use far into the future. This report recommends that Australian governments adopt a goal of requiring new homes and neighborhoods to be ‘climate safe 2 ̆ 7 by 2020 to guide both regulation and incentives. This would mean that new homes would need to have <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> and be extremely water efficient. The report suggests that Australian governments follow the example of the UK Government which has committed to building all new homes to zero emissions standards from 2016 onwards, and established a task force to set interim standards and programs to make progress towards this target. Australian Governments recently committed through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) to increase the energy efficiency standards for new residential buildings to six stars or equivalent nationally as part of the 2010 update of the Building Code of Australia. While the COAG commitment is a good move forward for all Australian states, a 6 star energy efficiency requirement is only a half step towards preparing our new building stock for the future. Ultimately, if we are to avert catastrophic climate change and prepare our houses to cope with predicted temperature and price shocks, we should be aiming for building standards that require a ‘climate safe’ home – that is a <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> emissions home which is also highly water efficient. Given the length of time today’s houses will be in use, it is essential that any decisions taken now to raise building standards represent a decisive first step along the road towards this long-term goal. Focusing particularly on Victoria, this report makes a convincing case for raising the required standard for new homes and renovations to at least 7 to 8 Stars and for including complementary water efficiency measures. The report highlights that moving to at least 7 stars would increase the affordability of purchasing and living in a home as the energy and water cost savings would far outweigh the slightly increased up front construction cost. It also outlines further benefits of higher building standards including further job creation in building industries. However as new homes will account for just 15 percent of Australia’s housing stock by 2020, a focus solely on standards for new homes will not achieve the ‘mass greening’ of our housing stock we need. An estimated 1. 9 million Victorian homes built before 2004 still have energy ratings of 2 Stars or less, while at least 50 percent of Melbourne households do not have a water-efficient showerhead and 20 percent still have at least one single flush toilet. Improved standards for new homes must therefore be complemented by a concerted program to upgrade the energy and water efficiency of our existing housing stock as well. At present, our poor quality housing stock is part of the climate change problem. But as this report shows, with the right mix of policies the housing sector can become {{an important part of the}} solution. A full summary of policy recommendations to achieve climate safe programs is at the end of this report.

40|$|Many impacts {{projected}} for {{a global}} warming level of 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels may exceed the coping capacities of particularly vulnerable countries. Therefore, many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1. 5 °C. Here we analyse integrated energy-economy-environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1. 5 °C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios, energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 °C-consistent scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 °C- to a 1. 5 °C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO 2. This implies an earlier transition to <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> worldwide, to be achieved between 2045 and 2060.

With increased releases of carbon into the atmosphere and the effect of carbon dioxide and related pollutants on air quality and climate, it is critical that universities reduce their carbon footprints. Alternative landscape architectural designs and management techniques, such as rain gardens, constructed wetlands, restored prairies, and woodlands can be implemented to mitigate carbon outputs. Infrastructural landscapes‐called “green infrastructure” for their ability to meet essential human needs using natural processes ‐ sequester carbon at high rates, improve storm water runoff quality, and reduce runoff volumes. Establishment of native and other appropriate green space networks on university campuses can provide rich settings for education, research, and infrastructural services while also promoting carbon neutrality—achieving <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> by balancing carbon released to the atmosphere with an equivalent amount sequestered in vegetation or offset by investing in renewable energy sources. The large experiential landscapes associated with university campuses can operate simultaneously as alternative storm water and carbon mitigating landscapes. They likewise have the potential to restore critical ecological processes while reflecting many of the ecosystems associated with the eco‐region where each university resides. The educational aspect of universities will be enhanced through an interwoven landscape of green infrastructure networks and pedestrian corridors that engage and inform faculty, students, staff and visitors. Development of green infrastructure on university campuses can significantly reduce human impacts on the local environment. They can also increase environmental awareness and showcase responsible stewardship of the land and recourses. These landscapes have great potential to restore native ecosystems and/or historic landscapes habitats. In the right locations they can provide stable environments for various regionally important plant and animal species. Green infrastructure can also reduce short‐ and long‐term costs associated with creating, maintaining, and replacing traditional pipeto‐ pond storm water infrastructure. Increased carbon sequestered in infrastructural landscapes could likewise be a source of additional revenue for universities through the carbon trading market (assuming this market becomes active and remains productive in the U. S.), thus creating a return on investment in the overall green infrastructure system for a campus...|$|E

40|$|The energy {{performance}} and greenhouse gas impact of homes {{has been at}} the forefront of Australian climate change mitigation policy discussion for several decades. Various levels of government have acted to improve the energy and carbon efficiency of new homes through planning and building regulatory instruments. Most recently the Building Code of Australia has been used to introduce minimum energy efficiency standards for new homes at 4 stars in 2003, 5 stars in 2006 and 6 stars in 2010. But while improving the performance of long-lived assets such as new homes is a commonly used policy of developed nations, the relatively poor energy and greenhouse performing existing housing stock will continue to have a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions for many decades. The concept of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> homes has been in the Australian policy debate since that target was set by the United Kingdom Government for new homes in 2007, with the policy commencing in 2016. And while the focus of the policy debate to date has been centred on the construction of new homes, can the same concept of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> homes realistically be applied to the existing housing stock? Very little information is available about the practical implementation of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> retrofits on existing Australian homes, and therefore little is known about the value of the concept in reducing the greenhouse gas emission impact of the existing building stock. The research question was consequently framed as - can the utilisation of commonly available renewable energy and energy efficient technologies allow an existing home to be retrofitted to be operationally carbon neutral?
