According to the {{features}} of paper currency CIS image, the fuzzy set theory is initial used to improve the contrast of banknote target and background, paper money’s edge pixels are obtained by scanning, and then the sub-pixel edges are fitted by least square method; in the fitting process, the error threshold method is applied for eliminating noisy edge points, then slope correction of paper money is carried out according to the angle of sub-pixel edge line and the <b>note</b> <b>area</b> is extracted, finally, fuzzy enhancement {{is used for the}} extracted image again. Experiments show that, this method has good versatility, high accuracy and strong anti-interference ability, it can even extract the paper currency area effectively in the edge deterioration and unfilled corner condition, and the enhanced image is in favor of subsequent paper currency recognition...|$|E
