40|$|ObjectiveTo assess {{technical}} feasibility and short-term {{outcome of a}} novel hypogastric preservation technique in patients with aortoiliac aneurysms using commercially available endografts without device modification. MethodsMulti-institution review of prospectively acquired database of patients undergoing double-barrel endograft repair of aortoiliac aneurysms. ResultsTwenty-two patients underwent endovascular aneurysm repair for aortoiliac aneurysms from 2010 to 2011, with 23 double-barrel hypogastric preservation procedures successfully completed in 21 patients. The technique involved bifurcated main body placement followed by simultaneous deployment of parallel endograft limbs into the external iliac (ipsilateral approach) and hypogastric (contralateral femoral or brachial approach) arteries. Bilateral hypogastric branches were performed in two patients, and unilateral branches with and without contralateral coil embolization were performed in nine and ten patients, respectively. Procedural success rate was 96 %, technical success rate (successful implantation with immediate aneurysm exclusion and no observed endoleak) was 88 %, and access was fully-percutaneous in 86 %. Two type III endoleaks between branch components were <b>noted</b> <b>on</b> <b>completion</b> angiograms, but both resolved spontaneously on follow-up imaging. One type Ib endoleak was <b>noted</b> <b>on</b> postoperative imaging (contralateral to hypogastric branch, repaired with limb extension), as were three type II endoleaks (14 %) without sac expansion. Early (< 2 weeks) limb occlusion (one external iliac, two hypogastric) occurred in two patients, though no subsequent occlusions have occurred (mean follow-up, 7. 2 months; range, 1 - 20 months). Primary patency for external iliac and hypogastric limbs at 6 months was 95 % and 88 %, respectively. There were no deaths; complications included groin hematoma in 10 % and acute renal insufficiency in 5 %. Buttock claudication (n = 4) only occurred in patients who had ipsilateral coil embolization of hypogastric arteries (n = 9) for bilateral iliac aneurysms in which only unilateral hypogastric preservation was performed, resulting in rate of 44 % in these patients. ConclusionsThe double-barrel technique for hypogastric preservation is technically feasible across multiple interventionalists using commercially available endografts without device modification. These procedures are associated with minimal morbidity, acceptable short-term limb-patency rates, and reduced buttock claudication compared with those involving contralateral hypogastric embolization...|$|R
40|$|Minimal {{research}} {{to date has}} evaluated the impact of SQ 3 R implementation on content retention and student performance. Existing research is anecdotal or lacks ecological validity. The current research shows the impact of SQ 3 R implementation, as demonstrated by <b>note</b> packet <b>completion,</b> <b>on</b> student comprehension and retention. Results from the current study indicate that when students use SQ 3 R strategies (e. g., surveying prior to reading, generating questions, reading to answer said questions, reciting and reviewing information), they retain more information as demonstrated by higher achievement on course exams. Given that students are not apt to utilize their textbooks in an effective manner independently, I provide suggestions regarding the incorporation of these findings into course design...|$|R
40|$|CELT {{projects}} on changing practice through innovation and researchA formalised skills-based tutorial system {{in support of}} student learning has been devised, stitched into core Level 1 modules, and requiring student self study and individual student inputs in small group (maximum 5) compulsory tutorials. The aim has been to co-ordinate {{the development of the}} six (Foundation Degree) key transferable skills and to underpin career management activities by fostering, in first year students, a feeling of ‘belonging’ through the strengthening of personal progress planning. The outcome has been a series of skills-related tutorial topics providing training in relevant study techniques (involving all staff irrespective of discipline) with student guidance <b>notes</b> <b>on</b> task <b>completion,</b> a mechanism for encouraging students to use assessment feedback from all sources in a constructive and reflective manner and a means for monitoring student attendance and performance which, it is envisaged, should lead to improvements in Year 1 retention rates. Our system has recently been evaluated at a full Biosciences divisional meeting. Unanimous acceptance by all 20 + staff with some discussion on, and modification to, the proposed mode of assessment for the subject-specific extended essay {{and the nature of the}} numerical exercise on statistics and use of calculators. Potential rooming problems were voiced. The project is now virtually completed and is ready for an October start, apart from final agreements on the format of the skills diaries/recording systems which will form the basis of a Science student’s Progress File...|$|R
