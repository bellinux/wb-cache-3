40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{is highly}} related to insulin resistance, therefore, the {{increased}} number of obesity {{is followed by the}} increased prevalence of type 2 Diabetes Melitus. Obesity is associated with increased of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in muscle, liver and endothelial cells. The increase of ROS would lead to insulin resistance (IR) and increased pro-inflammatory protein. FFA {{plays an important role in}} IR by inhibiting muscle glucose transport and oxidation via effects on serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS- 1. The aim of this study was discover the existence of SOD, hs-CRP and and adiponectin levels towards the occurrence of insulin resistance which was caused by elevated level of FFA and to discover the interaction between SOD, hs-CRP and adiponectin in <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> <b>obese</b> adult male. METHODS: This was observational study with cross sectional design. There were 65 <b>obese</b> male <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects and 45 <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> male <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects who met the criteria. In this study, measurements were done on body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, insulin, adiponectin, hs-CRP and SOD. Obese was defined as BMI > 25 kg/m 2, normal weight was defined as BMI 18. 5 - 23 kh/m 2 and Insulin Resistance was defined as HOMA-IR > 1. RESULTS: This study showed that Hypoadiponectinemia condition, decreased SOD level and high level of hs-CRP is associated with insulin resistance in <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> subject. Adiponectin and SOD were correlated negatively with insulin resistance in <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> (Adiponectin, r=- 0. 455, p< 0. 001; SOD, r=- 0. 262, p= 0. 003), hs-CRP was positively correlated with insulin resistance in <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> (r= 0. 592, p< 0. 001). FFA levels was increased in obese insulin resistance compared with <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> insulin resistance. The Odds Ratio of Adiponectin, hs-CRP and SOD in this study was analyzed by logistic binary. The OR for SOD 3. 6 (p= 0. 001), hs-CRP 9. 1 (p< 0. 001) and Adiponectin 7. 2 (p< 0. 001).

Methods This is a cross sectional study with 133 <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> males volunteers (characterized by waist circumference > 90 cm; fasting blood glucose < 126 mg/dL; and no diabetic specific symptoms) age between 30 - 60 years which was done in Jakarta, Indonesia. We measured biochemical markers such as Angptl 3, FABP 4, FFA, fasting insulin and fasting glucose. We also measured weight, height, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Correlation between each marker was measured using Pearson and Spearman’s analysis. Results Pearson and Spearman’s correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation between Angptl 3 and FABP 4 (r = 0. 319; P = 0. 000), Angptl 3 and FFA (r = 0. 171; r = 0. 049), FABP 4 and HOMA-IR (r = 0. 202; P = 0. 019), FFA and FABP 4 (r = 0. 506; P = 0. 000), WC and HOMA-IR (r = 0. 323; P = 0. 000), WC and FABP 4 (r = 0. 387; P = 0. 000), Body Mass Index (BMI) and HOMA-IR (r = 0. 270; P = 0. 002), BMI and FABP 4 (r = 0. 362; P = 0. 000).

Further, correlation between serum trace elements levels and glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), body mass index (BMI), waist circumferences, waist -to -hip ratio and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein(hsCRP) were also determined in these women. Methods: This study was performed with morbidly obese (BMI > 40 kg/m 2 women with diabetes (n= 41), without diabetes (n= 45) and 50 healthly <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> women. Anthropometric measurements were taken and levels of serum Zn, Cr, Fe Cu and Mn were determined. Biochemical parameters included serum glucose, insulin, lipids, haemoglobin, hsCRP and HbA 1 C.

40|$|AbstractFarnesoid X Receptor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in maintaining bile acid, cholesterol homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Here we investigated whether FXR is expressed by pancreatic β-cells and regulates insulin signaling in pancreatic β-cell line and human islets. We found that FXR activation induces positive regulatory effects on glucose-induced insulin transcription and secretion by genomic and non-genomic activities. Genomic effects of FXR activation relay on the induction of the glucose regulated transcription factor KLF 11. Indeed, results from silencing experiments of KLF 11 demonstrate that this transcription factor is essential for FXR activity on glucose-induced insulin gene transcription. In addition FXR regulates insulin secretion by non-genomic effects. Thus, activation of FXR in βTC 6 cells increases Akt phosphorylation and translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT 2 at plasma membrane, increasing the glucose uptake by these cells. In vivo experiments on <b>Non</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>Diabetic</b> (NOD) mice demonstrated that FXR activation delays development of signs of diabetes, hyperglycemia and glycosuria, by enhancing insulin secretion and by stimulating glucose uptake by the liver.

Although the accumulating evidence supports a role of Abi 1 in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and growth factor/receptor signaling, {{it is not clear how}} it contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis. We show here that Abi 1 gene silencing by short hairpin RNA attenuated the Bcr-Abl-induced abnormal actin remodeling, membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase clustering and inhibited cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Although the knock down of Abi 1 expression did not affect growth factor-independent growth of Bcr-Abl-transformed Ba/F 3 cells in vitro, it impeded competitive expansion of these cells in <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> (NOD) / severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice. Remarkably, the knock down of Abi 1 expression in Bcr-Abl-transformed Ba/F 3 cells impaired the leukemogenic potential of these cells in NOD/SCID mice. Abi 1 contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis in part through Src family kinases, as the knock down of Abi 1 expression attenuates Bcr-Abl-stimulated activation of Lyn.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Central {{obesity is}} the {{accumulation}} of visceral (intra-abdominal) fat and is strongly known {{to be associated with}} insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Obesity can cause adipocyte hypertrophy that results in dysregulation of adipokine expression. The abnormal function of adipocytes may {{play an important role in}} the development of a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state associated with obesity. Adiponectin, retinol binding protein (RBP) - 4 and fetuin-A play a role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Expression of fetuin-A is increased due to fat accumulation in the liver. Elevated concentration of fetuin-A in the circulation can impair insulin signaling in muscle and liver as well as suppress adiponectin secretion, although its molecular mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship of fetuin-A, adiponectin, RBP- 4 and hsCRP with insulin resistance in <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> men. METHODS: This was an observational study with a cross-sectional design. The study subjects were 64 men with non diabetic abdominal obesity, characterized by waist circumference of 98. 47 ± 5. 88 cm and fasting blood glucose of 85. 75 ± 8. 36 mg/dL. RESULTS: This study showed that fetuin-A was positively correlated with HOMA-IR in <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> men with insulin resistance (r= 0. 128; p= 0. 570), although not significant. Fetuin-A was found to be correlated with adiponectin, RBP- 4 and hsCRP (r= 0. 150; p= 0. 233; r= 0. 050; p= 0. 711; r=- 0. 04; p= 0. 445), although not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of fetuin-A showed a tendency to be positively correlated with HOMA-IR and with RBP- 4 in <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> men, although statistically not significant. The concentration of fetuin-A showed a tendency to be negatively correlated with adiponectin and hsCRP although statistically not significant. There was no interrelationship between fetuin-A, adiponectin, RBP- 4, hsCRP and HOMA-IR. Elevated concentrations of fetuin-A were noted in obese subjects, which in turn might impair insulin signaling. This finding might suggest that fetuin-A may represent a new target for the prevention of insulin resistance. Further studies might be needed on obese population with fatty liver.

Paradoxically, epidemiological and experimental data have shown that some microorganisms can also prevent these pathologies. This observation is at the origin of the hygiene hypothesis according to which the decline of infections in western countries is at the origin of the increased incidence of both Th 1 -mediated autoimmune diseases and Th 2 -mediated allergic diseases over the last decades. We have tested whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation can recapitulate the protective effect of infectious agents on allergy and autoimmunity. Methods and Findings: Here, we performed a systematic study of the disease-modifying effects of a set of natural or synthetic TLR agonists using two experimental models, ovalbumin (OVA) -induced asthma and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, presenting the same genetic background of the <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> mouse (NOD) that is highly susceptible to both pathologies. In the same models, we also investigated the effect of probiotics. Additionally, we examined the effect of the genetic invalidation of MyD 88 on the development of allergic asthma and spontaneous diabetes. We demonstrate that multiple TLR agonists prevent from both allergy and autoimmunity when administered parenterally. Probiotics which stimulate TLRs also protect from these two diseases. The physiological relevance of these findings is further suggested by the major acceleration of OVA-induced asthma in MyD 88 invalidated mice. Our results strongly indicate that the TLRmediate...|$|E

However, in adulthood only BALB/c and NOD mice continued this pattern. By contrast, in IFN- transgenic mice, CCK expression was suppressed from birth to 3 months of age in the pancreata but not intestines.

Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance would improve setting up preventive and treatment strategies of type 2 diabetes. Down-regulation of GALNT 2, an UDPN-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase- 2 (ppGalNAc-T 2), causes impaired insulin signaling and action in cultured human liver cells. In addition, GALNT 2 mRNA levels are down-regulated in liver of spontaneously insulin resistant, diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. To investigate the role of GALNT 2 in human hyperglycemia, we measured GALNT 2 mRNA expression levels in peripheral whole blood cells of 84 non-obese and 46 obese non-diabetic individuals as well as of 98 obese patients with type 2 diabetes. We also measured GALNT 2 mRNA expression in human U 937 cells cultured under different glucose concentrations. In vivo studies indicated that GALNT 2 mRNA levels were significantly reduced from <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> control to <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> and to <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> individuals (p, 0. 001).

Although it is still being debated, increased lipolysis is {{known as one of}} the risk factors for inflammation and insulin resistance. Two factors already known to affect lipolysis are Angptl 3, known as prolipolytic factor, and FGF 21, known as antilipolytic factor. The aim of this study was to observe the role of Angptl 3 and FGF 21 to lipolysis, inflammation and insulin resistance in <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> <b>obese</b> male. METHODS: This was an observational study with cross sectional design. One hundred and thirty male subjects aged 30 - 60 years with non diabetic abdominal obesity characterized by waist circumference 97. 32 ± 5. 63 cm and fasting blood glucose 90. 19 ± 8. 78 mg/dL. RESULTS: The results of this study showed a correlation between Angptl 3 -FFA (r= 0. 203; p= 0. 021; R square= 0. 041; p= 0. 021), Angptl 3 -FABP 4 (r= 0. 330; p= 0. 000; R square= 0. 109; p= 0. 000) and Angptl 3 -TNFα (r= 0. 288; p= 0. 001; R square= 0. 049; p= 0. 011). There was a correlation between FGF 21 -FABP 4 (r= 0. 218, p= 0. 013; R square= 0. 047, p= 0. 013) and FGF 21 HOMA-IR (r= 0. 308, p= 0. 000; R square= 0. 046, p= 0. 014). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Angptl 3 may affect lipolysis and inflammation while FGF 21 may affect lipolysis and insulin resistance. The increased FGF 21 concentration might occur as a compensation (negative feedback mechanism) to reduce lipolysis and increase insulin sensitivity in <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> <b>obese</b> males. Further studies might be needed to observe Angptl 3 and FGF 21 profile in more severe obese population in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that maternal environment, in particular maternal autoantibodies, modify the risk of developing autoimmune diabetes in offspring. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether modification of maternal environment and maternal diabetes risk through immunization affects autoimmune diabetes risk in the progeny. The risk of developing insulin antibodies and of developing diabetes was determined in 113 female progeny of <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> (NOD) dams that were immunized with insulin, control antigen or vehicle before or during pregnancy. Although NOD dams immunized with insulin were rendered diabetes resistant (40 % diabetes by age 36 weeks versus 100 % in control dams), diabetes development in their female offspring (72 %, 26 / 36) was similar to that in female offspring of dams immunized with glucagon (82 %, 22 / 27) or vehicle (76 %, 19 / 25). Furthermore, no significant differences in diabetes development or insulin autoantibody titres were observed between female progeny of insulin autoantibody positive NOD dams (82 % diabetes by age 36 weeks, 18 / 22), insulin autoantibody negative NOD dams (75 %, 41 / 55), and NOD dams that had antibodies against exogneous insulin (71 %, 22 / 31). The findings suggest that modification of the maternal risk for autoimmune diabetes via antigen-specific immunization is not transferred to progeny and that fetal exposure to insulin autoantibodies does not increase the risk for diabetes development...|$|E
40|$|The class II major {{histocompatibility}} complex molecule I-A g 7 is strongly linked {{to the development of}} spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> mice and to the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Biozzi AB/H mice. Structurally, it resembles the HLA-DQ molecules associated with human IDDM, in having a non-Asp residue at position 57 in its � chain. To identify the requirements for peptide binding to I-A g 7 and thereby potentially pathogenic T cell epitopes, we analyzed a known I-A g 7 -restricted T cell epitope, hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) amino acids 9 – 27. NH 2 - and COOH-terminal truncations demonstrated that the minimal epitope for activation of the T cell hybridoma 2 D 12. 1 was M 12 -R 21 and the minimum sequence for direct binding to purified I-A g 7 M 12 -Y 20 / K 13 -R 21. Alanine (A) scanning revealed two primary anchors for binding at relative positions (p) 6 (L) and 9 (Y) in the HEL epitope. The critical role of both anchors was demonstrated by incorporating L and Y in poly(A) backbones at the same relative positions as in the HEL epitope. Well-tolerated, weakly tolerated, and nontolerated residues were identified by analyzing the binding of peptides containing multiple substitutions at individual positions. Optimally, p 6 was a large, hydrophobic residue (L, I, V, M), whereas p 9 was aromatic and hydrophobic (...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We have {{previously}} reported a highly diabetogenic CD 8 T cell clone, G 9 C 8, in the <b>Non</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>Diabetic</b> (NOD) mouse, specific to low avidity insulin peptide B 15 - 23 and cells responsive to this antigen {{are among the}} earliest islet infiltrates. We aimed to study the selection, activation and development of diabetogenic capacity of these insulin-reactive T cells. Research Design and Methods: We generated a TCR transgenic mouse expressing the cloned TCR Vα 18 /Vβ 6 receptor of the G 9 C 8 insulin-reactive CD 8 T cell clone. The mice were crossed to TCRCα−/− mice so {{that the majority of}} the T cells expressed the clonotypic TCR and the phenotype and function of the cells was investigated. Results: There was good selection of CD 8 T cells with a predominance of CD 8 single positive thymocytes, in spite of thymic insulin expression. Peripheral lymph node T cells had a naïve phenotype (CD 44 lo, CD 62 Lhi) and proliferated to insulin B 15 - 23 peptide and to insulin. These cells produced interferon-γ and TNF-α in response to insulin peptide and were cytotoxic to insulin-peptide coated targets. In vivo, the TCR transgenic mice developed insulitis but not spontaneous diabetes. However, the mice developed diabetes on immunization, and the activated transgenic T cells were able to transfer diabetes to immunodeficient NOD. scid mice. Conclusion: Autoimmune CD 8 T cells responding to a low affinity insulin B chain peptide escape from thymic negative selection, and require activation in vivo to cause diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Aims Obesity is an {{important}} risk factor {{for the development of}} chronic kidney disease. One of the major factors involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated kidney disease is glomeru-lar hyperfiltration. Increasing salt-delivery to the macula densa is expected to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by activating tubuloglomerular feedback. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which inhibits salt reabsorption in the proximal tubule, increases distal salt delivery. Its effects on obesity-related glomerular hyperfiltration have not previously been studied. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate whether adminis-tration of acetazolamide to <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects reduces glomerular hyperfiltration. Materials and Methods The study was performed using a randomized double-blind crossover design. Obese non-diabetic men with glomerular hyperfiltration were randomized to receive intravenously either acetazolamide or furosemide at equipotent doses. Twelve subjects received the allocated medications. Two weeks later, the same subjects received the drug which they had no...|$|R
40|$|Hyperglycaemia stimulates {{a variety}} of {{biochemical}} abnormalities. The area of particular interest {{in this study is}} the influence of non-enzymatic glycation of proteins on iron homeostasis, and particularly on non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) and its possible relation to atherogenesis in both Type 2 <b>diabetic</b> and <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects. The link between non-enzymatic glycation of proteins and iron homeostasis, and development of macrovascular disease may be mechanistically different in Type 2 <b>diabetic</b> and <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects due to a difference in the protein glycation pattern. Because the following in vivo study required storage of samples for up to two years to complete the processing of all the samples, a storage study was carried out using different anticoagulants and addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) to samples to study the effects of storage, thawing and freezing of the samples on the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of lipid peroxidation. This storage study showed that EDTA attenuated the action of lipid oxidation compared with lithium heparin (LiH). A combination of GSH with either EDTA or LiH added more protection from lipid peroxidation {{in the first week of}} storage, but due to the thawing and freezing of the sample the action of GSH diminished through its autooxidation, meaning that addition of GSH to samples in the following in vivo study would be useless. An in vivo study was carried out on iron-related parameters in three subject groups: control (non-diabetic, non-obese), Type 2 <b>diabetic</b> and <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic.</b> Glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 C) was strongly correlated with NTBI in the diabetic group. Also the level of NTBI was significantly increased in Type 2 diabetic subjects compared with other groups while the level of total iron was significantly decreased. The study showed a strong positive correlation between NTBI and a biomarker of endothelium dysfunction (E-selectin) in all groups studied. Although it is not possible from the current data to know if there is a causal relationship between these two parameters, it remains a possibility that iron released from its binding sites could initiate oxidative damage to the endothelial cells and begin the process of atherogenesis. Positive correlation at the 90 % confidence level between NTBI and a biomarker of inflammation, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, is another indicator in this study of a link between increases in NTBI, inflammation, endothelium dysfunction and atherosclerosis. This study also showed for first time that NTBI is present in higher levels in the plasma of obese subjects compared to controls despite the obese subjects having significantly lower total iron. An in vitro study found that glycation of transferrin half saturated with iron increased with increasing glucose concentration, leading to decreased capacity of transferrin to hold iron and increased release of free iron. Also co-incubation of transferrin half saturated with iron with low density lipoprotein (LDL) and glucose showed oxidation of LDL (measured as MDA). This may be explained by the effect of glycation, leading to release of free iron, which catalyses oxidation of LDL. In addition, glycation of LDL may enhance the oxidation of LDL catalysed by iron. Both studies indicate that the glycation of proteins has a major impact on iron homeostasis leading to release of non-enzymatic glycation and contributing to one of the most common complications of Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosisthe Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research Baghdad, Ira...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} tissues including those of the cardiovascular system. Recent clinical studies have suggested a significant correlation between elevated OPG serum level and cardiovascular mortality. Since coronary artery calcification (CAC) is positively associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, we carried out a study to investigate whether OPG serum level is associated with the severity of CAC in <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> centrally <b>obese</b> men. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done on seventy <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> centrally <b>obese</b> men. CAC score was determined by using dual source computed tomography (DSCT). OPG serum level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS for windows ver 16. ANOVA was performed to analyze mean, maximum, minimum value, and standard deviation. Spearman correlation test was performed to determine the correlation between OPG serum level and CAC score. Significance value was defined as alpha level= 0. 05 based on two-tailed tests. RESULTS: OPG serum level was significantly correlated with CAC score. The severity of CAC increased with the increase of OPG level. Age was significantly correlated with OPG serum level and CAC score. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that serum OPG level was associated with the severity of CAC, which highlights that OPG could be involved in the progression of CAC in <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> <b>obese</b> men.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} {{factor is}} a pleiotropic cytokine with potent immune regulatory functions. Although tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have demonstrated great utility in treating other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, there are conflicting results in Sjögren's syndrome. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the effect of a locally expressed tumor necrosis factor inhibitor on the salivary gland function and histopathology in an animal model of Sjögren's syndrome. Using in vivo adeno associated viral gene transfer, we have stably expressed soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 -Fc fusion protein locally in the salivary glands in the <b>Non</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>Diabetic</b> model of Sjögren's syndrome. Pilocarpine stimulated saliva flow was measured to address the salivary gland function and salivary glands were analyzed for focus score and cytokine profiles. Additionally, cytokines and autoantibody levels were measured in plasma. Local expression of tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 :immunoglobulin G fusion protein resulted in decreased saliva flow over time. While no change in lymphocytic infiltrates or autoantibody levels was detected, statistically significant increased levels of tumor growth factor-beta 1 and decreased levels of interleukin- 5, interleukin- 12 p 70 and interleukin - 17 were detected in the salivary glands. In contrast, plasma levels showed significantly decreased levels of tumor growth factor-beta 1 and increased levels of interleukin- 4, interferon-gamma, interleukin- 10 and interleukin- 12 p 70. Our findings suggest that expression of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in the salivary gland can have a negative effect on salivary gland function and that other cytokines should be explored as points for therapeutic intervention in Sjögren's syndrom...|$|E
40|$|The {{derivation}} of pluripotent {{embryonic stem}} cells (ESCs) {{from a variety of}} genetic backgrounds remains a desirable objective in the generation of mice functionally deficient in genes of interest and the modeling of human disease. Nevertheless, disparity in the ease with which different strains of mice yield ESC lines has long been acknowledged. Indeed, the generation of bona fide ESCs from the <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> (NOD) mouse, a well-characterized model of human type I diabetes, has historically proved especially difficult to achieve. Here, we report the development of protocols for the derivation of novel ESC lines from C 57 Bl/ 6 mice based on the combined use of high concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor and serum-replacement, which is equally applicable to fresh and cryo-preserved embryos. Further, we demonstrate the success of this approach using Balb/K and CBA/Ca mice, widely considered to be refractory strains. CBA/Ca ESCs contributed to the somatic germ layers of chimeras and displayed a very high competence at germline transmission. Importantly, we were able to use the same protocol for the derivation of ESC lines from nonpermissive NOD mice. These ESCs displayed a normal karyotype that was robustly stable during long-term culture, were capable of forming teratomas in vivo and germline competent chimeras after injection into recipient blastocysts. Further, these novel ESC lines efficiently formed embryoid bodies in vitro and could be directed in their differentiation along the dendritic cell lineage, thus illustrating their potential application to the generation of cell types of relevance to the pathogenesis of type I diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 1 is an {{autoimmune disease}} with a genetic predisposition that is triggered by environmental factors during early life. Epidemiological {{studies show that}} bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, has been detected in about 90 % of all analyzed human urine samples. In this study, BPA was found {{to increase the severity}} of insulitis and the incidence of diabetes in female <b>non</b> <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> (NOD) mice offspring after transmaternal exposure through the dams' drinking water (0, 0. 1, 1, and 10 mg/l). Both the severity of insulitis in the pancreatic islets at 11 weeks of age and the diabetes prevalence at 20 weeks were significantly increased for female offspring in the highest exposure group compared to the control group. Increased numbers of apoptotic cells, a reduction in tissue resident macrophages and an increase in regulatory T cells were observed in islets prior to insulitis development in transmaternally exposed offspring. The detectable apoptotic cells were identified as mostly glucagon producing alpha-cells but also tissue resident macrophages and betacells. In the local (pancreatic) lymph node neither regulatory T cell nor NKT cell populations were affected by maternal BPA exposure. Maternal BPA exposure may have induced systemic immune changes in offspring, as evidenced by alterations in LPSand ConA-induced cytokine secretion in splenocytes. In conclusion, transmaternal BPA exposure, in utero and through lactation, accelerated the spontaneous diabetes development in NOD mice. This acceleration appeared to be related to early life modulatory effects on the immune system, resulting in adverse effects later in life. © The Author 2013.

40|$|Abstract A {{worldwide}} epidemic exists {{with respect}} to diabetes mellitus because of increased rates of obesity. There is a significant correlation between obesity and insulin resistance and obesity causes {{the increase in the}} severity of the disease. The adipose tissues in the visceral region function as an endocrine organ that produces certain proteins with role in glucose homeostasis. The expression level of some of these proteins is increased in diabetes and can serve as specific marker of the disease. The study was performed to check the effect of various physical and biochemical parameters of obesity on the development and progression of diabetes mellitus. In our study the serum samples of diabetics were collected and were further categorized into two groups i. e. <b>diabetic</b> <b>obese</b> and <b>diabetic</b> <b>non</b> <b>obese,</b> on the basis of BMI, waist circumference and waist to hip ratio.

40|$|Background/Aims: Despite strong {{association}} between obesity and {{the pathogenesis of}} type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), only a subset of obese individuals eventually develops T 2 D. We sought to determine the immunological factors behind this heterogeneity. Methods: Peripheral blood of obese non-diabetic subjects and <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects were collected and the B cell responses in these subjects were analyzed. Results: We found that the B cells from <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects had similar B cell subtype composition and secreted similar levels of low-grade pro-inflammatory cytokines to obese non-diabetic subjects, characteristic to the background chronic immune activation frequently observed in obese subjects. When examining adaptive B cell antibody responses, however, <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects presented much higher levels of polyclonal activation and antibody secretion, with impaired ability to response to new antigens such as seasonal influenza vaccination. Conclusions: These data demonstrated that in <b>obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects, B cell adaptive response is impaired and potentially contribute to overall higher inflammation...|$|R

The goal of this work was to study the physiological mechanisms that explained these improvements. Methods: Fifteen morbid obese subjects (7 <b>obese</b> <b>non</b> <b>diabetic</b> and 8 with type 2 diabetes before the surgery) were studied before surgery by gastric bypass (RYGB), 1 month, 1 year and 8 years after surgery. The protocol used the infusion of stable isotope tracers of glucose and glycerol [6, 6 - 2 H]-glucose and [2 H 5]-glycerol {{for the assessment of}} endogenous glucose production (EGP) and rate of lipolysis (RaLip) at fasting and during mixed meal test (MTT). During the meal U-[13 C]-glucose per os was used for the assessment of oral glucose uptake. Results: The patients lost a significant amount of weight that was maintained at 8 years. Moreover glycemic control was improved and all subjects were non diabetics after surgery and this was maintained after 8 years. All glucose fluxes were decreased and this explained the better glycemic control Conclusions: Bariatric surgery by RYGB dramatically reduces body weight and improves metabolic control resulting in remission of diabetes that is maintained at 8 years after surgery...|$|R
