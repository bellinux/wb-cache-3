During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad.

Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E

5|$|The Liao dynasty was {{destroyed}} by the Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts of Central Asia for almost a century before being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, {{and a number of}} various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain over the exact <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of the influence of the Liao Khitan culture upon subsequent developments, such as the musical and theatrical arts.|$|E
5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation to resolve the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages of the British raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India {{proposed}} a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as {{part of the process of}} transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of fundamental rights, protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J.B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub-committee on Fundamental Rights, expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.|$|E

25|$|Sir Ronald Wilson {{was once}} the {{president}} of Australia's Human Rights Commission. He stated that Australia's program in which 20–25,000 Aboriginal children were forcibly separated from their natural families was genocide, because {{it was intended to}} cause the Aboriginal people to die out. The program ran from 1900 to 1969. The <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of the removals have been disputed within Australia, with opponents questioning the findings contained in the Commission report and asserting that the size of the Stolen Generation had been exaggerated.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{recognition in the}} accounting literature that properly directed audit effort is critical to an effective and efficient engagement. Auditors assess the risks of managerial misstatements and use these risks to plan audit procedures. Prior studies examining the linkage between assessed risk and audit effort report weak and conflicting results. The unobservable nature of the audit process necessitates the use of proxies to capture assessed risks and audit effort. This study utilizes proprietary audit workpaper data to obtain better measurement of assessed risks and effort. These improved measurements provide stronger evidence on whether changes in assessed risks will affect the <b>nature,</b> timing, <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of audit testing. This linkage is examined first using OLS and then an instrumental variables approach to address potential simultaneity in determining the <b>nature,</b> timing, <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of substantive effort. In contrast to prior research, results suggest that auditors vary the <b>nature,</b> timing, <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of substantive effort in response to assessed auditee risks...|$|R

25|$|Toothed {{whales are}} capable of making {{a broad range of}} sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three {{categories}} of sounds can be identified: frequency-modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds, and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are used for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Toothed whale biosonar clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its role as intermediate host for several economically important trematode species, Tarebia granifera has colonized water reservoirs, dams and ponds on the premises of three large industrial plants in northern KwaZulu-Natal and been pumped out {{of at least one}} of them, blocking water pipes and damaging equipment. This generally happens when snail densities are high and the damage is due to individuals being crushed so that pieces of shell and soft tissue are carried into machinery. Details of the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of this damage and the costs incurred are not available. There is no doubt that Tarebia granifera is able to pass unharmed through pumps, probably as juveniles.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{consultation}} — The {{plastic surgeon}} explains {{the technical and}} aesthetic considerations of the breast lift operation to the woman. That the B technique mastopexy yields improved aesthetic results with a breast-skin pedicle created with a curvilinear incision (an inverted, upper-case letter-B). That said curvilinear incision technique eliminates the medial vertical incision of the Anchor mastopexy, and so creates a lifted bust with breasts of natural size, appearance, and contour, and few surgical scars. The consultation includes detailed, pre-operative, post-operative, and healing-stage photographs that illustrate the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of the mastopexy incisions and the resultant scars. That the full healing (scar maturation) might require approximately one year to establish the final contour of the lifted breasts, after the suspensory ligaments and the parenchymal tissue have settled into and upon the chest as an aesthetically satisfactory bust of natural size, appearance, and contour.|$|E

25|$|Madden's fear {{of flying}} (aviophobia) is well known. Two {{different}} theories have developed as to the cause. One theory relates to the October 29, 1960, Cal Poly football team plane crash that {{claimed the lives of}} sixteen players, the team’s student manager, and a football booster. Having graduated from Cal Poly only two years prior, Madden lost many friends in the accident. However, it is known that Madden flew up until 1979, when he had a panic attack on a flight originating in Tampa. The details, <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of this panic attack are not known. Madden, however, stated once in an interview that his fears were not about turbulence, flying, or heights, but primarily claustrophobia. He also once noted that when he did fly, traveling all over the United States, it did not allow him to see anything.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{notification}} of a potentially hazardous waste site, the EPA conducts a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection (PA/SI), which involves records reviews, interviews, visual inspections, and limited field sampling. Information from the PA/SI {{is used by}} the EPA to develop a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score to determine the CERCLA status of the site. Sites that score high enough to be listed typically proceed to a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The RI includes an extensive sampling program and risk assessment that defines the <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> of the site contamination and risks. The FS is used to develop and evaluate various remediation alternatives. The preferred alternative is presented in a Proposed Plan for public review and comment, followed by a selected alternative in a ROD. The site then enters into a Remedial Design phase and then the Remedial Action phase. Many sites include Long-Term Monitoring. 5-year reviews once the Remedial Action has been completed are required whenever hazardous substances are left onsite above levels safe for unrestricted use.|$|E

The committee cited the unique Welsh national identity and that many students in Wales could not afford to travel to University in England or Scotland. Furthermore, it advocated for a national degree-awarding university for Wales, composed of the regional colleges. It also recommended that the colleges should be unsectarian in nature and that they should exclude the teaching of theology.|$|E
