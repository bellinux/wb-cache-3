5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a <b>nerve</b> <b>root.</b> Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E

40|$|Background: In total en bloc {{spondylectomy}} (TES) {{of upper}} thoracic spine including the second thoracic (T 2) vertebra, T 2 <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> are usually transected. In this study, {{we examined the}} association between transection of the T 2 <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> and upper-extremity motor function in patients with upper thoracic TES. Copyright:Methods: We assessed 16 patients who underwent upper thoracic TES with bilateral transection of the T 2 <b>nerve</b> <b>roots.</b> Patients were divided into three groups: 3 patients without any processing of T 1 and upper <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> (T 2 group), 7 with extensive dissection of T 1 <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> (T 1 - 2 group), and 6 with extensive dissection of T 1 and upper <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> (C-T 2 group). Postoperative upper-extremity motor function was compared between the groups. Results: Postoperative deterioration of upper-extremity motor function was observed in 9 of the 16 patients (56. 3 %). Three of the 7 patients in the T 1 - 2 group and all 6 patients in the C-T 2 group showed deterioration of upper-extremity motor function, {{but there was no}} deterioration in the T 2 group. In the T 1 - 2 group, 3 patients showed mild deterioration that did not affect their activities of daily living and they achieved complete recovery at the latest follow-up examination. In contrast, severe dysfunction occurred frequently in the C-T 2 group, without recovery at the latest follow-up. Conclusions: The transection of the T 2 <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> alone did not result in upper-extremity motor dysfunction; rather, the dysfunction is caused by the extensive dissection of the T 1 and upper <b>nerve</b> <b>roots.</b> Therefore, transection of the T 2 <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> in upper thoracic TES seems to be an acceptable procedure with satisfactory outcomes...|$|R
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} is {{continuous}} with the caudal {{portion of the}} medulla, running {{from the base of}} the skull to the body of the first lumbar vertebra.

25|$|Lumbar disc herniations {{occur in}} the lower back, most often between {{the fourth and fifth}} lumbar {{vertebral}} bodies or between the fifth and the sacrum. Symptoms can affect the lower back, buttocks, thigh, anal/genital region (via the perineal nerve), and may radiate into the foot and/or toe. The sciatic nerve is the most commonly affected nerve, causing symptoms of sciatica. The femoral nerve can also be affected and cause the patient to experience a numb, tingling feeling throughout one or both legs and even feet or even a burning feeling in the hips and legs. A hernia in the lumbar region often compresses the <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> exiting at the level below the disk. Thus, a herniation of the L4/5 disc will compress the L5 <b>nerve</b> <b>root.</b>|$|E

25|$|MPS IV, Morquio syndrome, is {{estimated}} to occur in 1 in 700,000 births. Its two subtypes result from the missing or deficient enzymes N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) (Type A) or beta-galactosidase (Type B) needed {{to break down the}} keratan sulfate sugar chain. Clinical features are similar in both types but appear milder in Morquio Type B. Onset is between ages 1 and 3. Neurological complications include spinal nerve and <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> compression resulting from extreme, progressive skeletal changes, particularly in the ribs and chest; conductive and/or neurosensitive loss of hearing and clouded corneas.

40|$|Purpose: Compression of {{the spinal}} <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> by lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is a major}} clinical problem associated with intermittent claudication, pain and numbness. The pathological mechanism is reduced blood flow in <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> and degeneration of <b>nerve</b> <b>roots.</b> Prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) is used for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) to increase capillary flow around the main artery and improve symptoms; however, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) does not change after treatment. Lumbar spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> contain somatosensory, somatomotor, and unmyelinated autonomic nerves, and improved blood flow in these spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> may improve the function of nerve fibers innervating muscle, capillary, and main vessels in the lower leg, resulting in an increased ABI. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the hypothesis that limaprost, a PGE 1 analog, improves blood flow in compressed and degenerated spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots,</b> leading to improved function of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> innervating the lower leg and a resultant increase in the ABI. Methods: Limaprost (15 μg 3 times a day for 3 months) was administered orally to 49 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. Low back pain and leg pain scores, walking distance, and ABI were measured before treatment and after 3 months of limaprost treatment. Results: Low back pain, leg pain, and maximum walking distance significantly improved after limaprost treatment (P< 0. 05). ABI was also significantly increased by limaprost treatment (P= 0. 003). Conclusions: This is the first investigation of changes in ABI in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis after treatment with a PGE 1 analog. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider the role of the autonomic nervous system in spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> associated with blood supply to the lower leg in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis...|$|R
50|$|Cauda equina syndrome, a rare {{disorder}} {{affecting the}} bundle of <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> (cauda equina) at the lower (lumbar) end of the spinal cord, is a surgical emergency. Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> in the lumbar spine are compressed, disrupting sensation and movement. <b>Nerve</b> <b>roots</b> that control {{the function of the}} bladder and bowel are especially vulnerable to damage.

25|$|About {{three percent}} of cancer {{patients}} experience spinal cord compression, usually from expansion of the vertebral body or pedicle (fig. 1) due to metastasis, sometimes involving collapse of the vertebral body. Occasionally compression is caused by nonvertebral metastasis adjacent to the spinal cord. Compression of the long tracts of the cord itself produces funicular pain and compression of a spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> (fig. 5) produces radicular pain. Seventy percent of cases involve the thoracic, 20 percent the lumbar, and 10 percent the cervical spine; and about 20 percent of cases involve multiple sites of compression. The nature of the pain depends on {{the location of the}} compression.|$|E
25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> compression.|$|E

25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E

Cranial CSF leaks are as a result of intracranial hypertension in a vast majority of cases.

Degenerative spinal disc diseases cause a disc to pierce the dura mater, leading to a CSF leak.|$|E

40|$|In imaging diagnosis, {{redundant}} <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> of the {{cauda equina}} {{are characterized by}} the presence of elongated, enlarged and tortuous <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> in close relationship with a high-grade lumbar spinal canal stenosis. This is not an independent entity, but it is believed to be a consequence of the chronic compression {{at the level of the}} lumbar canal stenosis and thus may be part of the natural history of lumbar spinal stenosis. The present paper is aimed at reviewing the histopathological, electrophysiological and imaging findings, particularly at magnetic resonance imaging, as well as the clinical meaning of this entity. As the current assessment of canal stenosis and root compression is preferably performed by means of magnetic resonance imaging, this is the imaging method by which the condition is identified. The recognition of redundant <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> at magnetic resonance imaging is important, particularly to avoid misdiagnosing other conditions such as intradural arteriovenous malformations. The literature approaching the clinical relevance of the presence of redundant <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> is controversial.

2500|$|Fractures are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} aspect of osteoporosis. Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from [...] osteoporosis {{and can lead to}} further disability and early mortality. These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip. The symptoms of a vertebral collapse ("compression fracture") are sudden back pain, often with radicular pain (shooting pain due to <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.|$|E
2500|$|Although many minor disc herniations heal {{on their}} own with {{conservative}} treatment, occasionally disc herniations require surgery for correction. [...] A primary focus of surgery is to remove pressure or reduce mechanical compression on a neural element— either the spinal cord, or a <b>nerve</b> <b>root.</b> But it is increasingly recognized that back pain, rather than being solely due to compression, may also be due to chemical inflammation. There is evidence that points to a specific inflammatory mediator of this pain. This inflammatory molecule, called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), is released {{not only by the}} herniated disc, but also in cases of disc tear (annular tear), by facet joints, and in spinal stenosis. In addition to causing pain and inflammation, TNF may also contribute to disc degeneration.|$|E
2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is a controversial condition that, {{depending on the}} analysis, varies from a [...] "very rare" [...] cause to contributing to up to 8% of low back or buttock pain. In 17% of the population, the sciatic nerve runs through the piriformis muscle rather than beneath it. When the muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it is posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve. It has colloquially {{been referred to as}} [...] "wallet sciatica" [...] since a wallet carried in a rear hip pocket compresses the buttock muscles and sciatic nerve when the bearer sits down. [...] Piriformis syndrome causes sciatica when the <b>nerve</b> <b>root</b> itself remains normal and no herniation of a spinal disc is apparent.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT TENSILE PROPERTIES OF SPINAL NERVE ROOTS AT HIGH STRAIN RATES: AN IN VIVO STUDY by Joseph M. Yaldo April 2012 Advisor: Dr. John M. Cavanaugh Major: Biomedical Engineering Degree: Master of Science Spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> {{are subject}} to tension in many {{traumatic}} and non-traumatic situations, such as motor vehicle accidents or disc herniation. These events may cause severe injuries and pain to the victims who are involved. By obtaining {{a better understanding of}} the biomechanical properties of spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots,</b> in particular in tension, better methods can be developed to help predict the amount of tension that may be applied to spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> before causing serious injury to an individual. For this study biomechanical properties of dorsal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> at the L 4 and L 5 lumbar levels were determined at high displacement rates of 20, 200, and 800 mm/sec. The study was done using Sprague Dawley rats in vivo. Load and displacement data was obtained from the <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> as they were stretched to failure. Maximum load, maximum stress, and modulus of elasticity (E) values were calculated. Maximum load values of 8. 3 2. 3 g, 21. 4 5. 1 g, and 26. 3 4. 2 g were found for the 20, 200, and 800 mm/sec rates, respectively. Also, maximum stress and E values of 210. 1 42. 0 kPa and 1. 1 0. 3 MPa, 511. 5 85. 2 kPa and 3. 1 1. 4 MPa, and 687. 9 120. 6 kPa and 3. 5 1. 3 MPa were obtained for the 20, 200, and 800 mm/sec rates, respectively. It was found that as the displacement rate increased, the maximum load, stress, and E values also increased. No significant difference was shown in the failure strain among the three displacement rates. The results from the study demonstrated spinal <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> exhibit a strain rate dependency. These results help give a better understanding of how tensile properties of <b>nerve</b> <b>roots</b> are affected by different strain rates...|$|R
