5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, <b>nutating</b> disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
50|$|A <b>nutating</b> disc engine (also {{sometimes}} called a disc engine) is an {{internal combustion engine}} comprising fundamentally of one moving part and a direct drive onto the crankshaft. Initially patented in 1993, it differs from earlier internal combustion engines {{in a number of}} ways and utilizes a circular rocking or wobbling <b>nutating</b> motion, drawing heavily from similar steam-powered engines developed in the 19th century, and similar to the motion of the non-rotating portion of a swash plate on a swash plate engine.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, a <b>nutating</b> {{motion is}} similar to that seen in a {{swashplate}} mechanism. In general, a <b>nutating</b> plate is carried on a skewed bearing on the main shaft and does not itself rotate, whereas a swashplate is fixed to the shaft and rotates with it. The motion {{is similar to}} the motions of coin or a tire wobbling on the ground after being dropped with the flat side down. Precession is the physical term for this kind of motion.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{difference}} between the two basic schemes is in polarization. As the feed horn in the rotated process spins, the polarization changes with the rotation and will thus be 90 degrees off in polarization when the feed is 90 degrees off its initial axis. As the feed horn is fixed in <b>nutated</b> feeds, no polarization changes occur. Most early systems used a rotated feed, due to its mechanical simplicity, but later systems often used <b>nutated</b> feeds in order to use the polarization information.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to cause the {{redirection}} of the beam from the antenna's midline. The first is referred to as a rotated feed. As its name suggests, a feed horn is set just off the parabolic focal point which causes the energy to focus slightly off the antenna midline. The feed is then rotated around {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid to produce the conical rotation. The other system is a <b>nutated</b> feed. A <b>nutated</b> feed offsets the antenna at an angle to a fixed feed horn, and then rotates the antenna. A variation of a <b>nutated</b> feed makes the feed move in a small circle, rapidly and continuously changing the pointing direction of the beam. In this latter type, neither the feed nor the antenna revolves around the pointing axis of the antenna; only the pointing direction changes, tracing out a narrow cone.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{engine to}} the {{swashplate}} engine is the wobble plate engine, {{also known as}} nutator or Z-crank drive. This uses a bearing that purely <b>nutates,</b> rather than also rotating as for the swashplate. The wobble plate is separated from the output shaft by a rotary bearing. Wobble plate engines are thus not cam engines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nutating</b> {{flowmeters}} {{and pumps}} have similar motions to the wobble of a swashplate, {{but do not}} necessarily transform the motion to a reciprocating motion at any time.|$|E

40|$|Neutron stars, asteroids, comets, cosmic-dust granules, spacecraft, {{as well as}} {{whatever}} other freely spinning body dissipate energy when they rotate about any axis different from principal. We discuss the internal-dissipation-caused relaxation of a freely precessing rotator towards its minimal-energy mode (mode that corresponds to the spin about the maximal-inertia axis). We show that this simple system contains in itself some quite unexpected physics. While the body <b>nutates</b> at some rate, the internal stresses and strains within the body oscillate at frequencies both higher and (what is especially surprising) lower than this rate...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{influences}} {{a number}} of processes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) through the action of five receptors. In this study, we used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging to examine {{the long-term effects of}} ethylene on growing, etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. These measurements revealed that ethylene stimulates nutations of the hypocotyls with an average delay in onset of over 6 h. The nutation response was constitutive in ctr 1 - 2 mutants maintained in air, whereas ein 2 - 1 mutants failed to <b>nutate</b> when treated with ethylene. Ethylene-stimulated nutations were also eliminated in etr 1 - 7 loss-of-function mutants. Transformation of the etr 1 - 7 mutant with a wild-type genomic ETR 1 transgene rescued the nutation phenotype, further supporting a requirement for ETR 1. Loss-of-function mutations in the other receptor isoforms had no effect on ethylene-stimulated nutations. However, the double ers 1 - 2 ers 2 - 3 and triple etr 2 - 3 ers 2 - 3 ein 4 - 4 loss-of-function mutants constitutively <b>nutated</b> in air. These results support a model where all the receptors are involved in ethylene-stimulated nutations, but the ETR 1 receptor is required and has a contrasting role from the other receptor isoforms in this nutation phenotype. Naphthylphthalamic acid eliminated ethylene-stimulated nutations but had no effect on growth inhibition caused by ethylene, pointing to a role for auxin transport in the nutation phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Etiolated {{seedlings}} of Arabidopsis thaliana <b>nutated</b> {{under conditions}} of physiological darkness while about ten percent of monitored individuals exhibited regular elliptical nutation, circumnutation. Pre-irradiation with red light prevented occurrence of circumnutation without having {{an effect on the}} average rate of the nutational movement. Phototropic response of seedlings to unilateral blue light appeared to be superimposed over nutation. Throughout gravitropism, some seedlings continued to exhibit nutation suggesting that these two processes are independently controlled. Based on these results, we suggest that nutation in Arabidopsis probably is not controlled by the mechanism predicted by the theory of gravitropic overshoots...|$|R
5000|$|U.S. patent number 5,251,594 {{was granted}} to Leonard Meyer of Illinois in 1993 for a [...] "nutating {{internal}} combustion disc engine". The Meyer <b>Nutating</b> Engine {{is a new}} type of internal combustion engine with higher power density than conventional reciprocating piston engines and which can operate on a variety of fuels, including gasoline, heavy fuels and hydrogen. The patent made reference to various 20th-century <b>nutating</b> engines in the United States, but no reference at all to the original Dakeyne engine, described below, in its prior art. The similarity to its 166-year-old hydraulic predecessor is strikingly evident, the main change being that the disc is not entirely flat but slightly convex.|$|E

The proposed module is mounted on a novel seesaw swivel-drive mechanism with unique features, including a rotary actuator for track-following; in addition, a seesaw arm <b>nutates</b> along a pivot for laser focusing. Additionally, the actuating force is increased within the limit of actuator size constraints by using a Halbach-magnet-array in biaxial voice coil motors. Experimental assessment of the holographic module and actuator reveals that the HOE module ensures the optical performance and stability of the system, together with a performance superior to a classic hinge-type swing arm actuator, as attributed to enhanced durability and higher robustness...|$|R

An array of twenty-four electromagnets, sequentially energized in sets of three, are arranged in a ring around {{the periphery of the}} base plate. Selective energization of the eight sets of electromagnets causes the rim of the top plate to be magnetically attracted to the energized electromagnets.

This method uses a fourth order asymptotic approximation to the Biot-Savart integrals for elliptical Gaussian vorticity distributions to determine velocity and velocity derivatives. A robust adaptive refinement procedure reconfigures elements that spread beyond the specified resolution. The high order convergence rate is verified by comparing calculations with the vortex method to exact solutions in a variety of controlled experiments.

5000|$|When {{the mean}} equator and equinox of J2000 {{are used to}} define a {{celestial}} reference frame, that frame may also be denoted J2000 coordinates or simply J2000.

Use of the [...] "mean" [...] locations means that nutation is averaged out or omitted. Novices are sometimes confused by finding that the Earth's rotational North pole does not point quite at the J2000 celestial pole at the epoch J2000.0; {{the reason is that}} the true pole of epoch <b>nutates</b> away from the mean one. The same differences pertain to the equinox.|$|R
25|$|Bradley and Molyneux {{discussed}} several hypotheses in {{the hope}} of finding the solution. Since the apparent motion was evidently caused neither by parallax nor observational errors, Bradley first hypothesized that it could be due to oscillations in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere– a phenomenon known as nutation. 35 Camelopardalis was seen to possess an apparent motion which could be consistent with nutation, but since its declination varied only one half as much as that of γ Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the answer (however, Bradley later went on to discover that the Earth does indeed <b>nutate).</b> He also investigated the possibility that the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the Earth's atmosphere, thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, but again obtained negative results.|$|R

The hyperfine interactions split the Ω_R(H⃗_ 0) curve into eight different curves which are fitted numerically and described analytically.

A portion of the area of the disc is used for intake and compression, a portion is used to seal against a center casing, and the remaining portion is used for expansion and exhaust. The compressed air is admitted to an external accumulator, and then into an external combustion chamber before it is admitted to the power side of the disc. The external combustion chamber enables the engine to use diesel fuel in small engine sizes, giving it unique capabilities for unmanned aerial vehicle propulsion and other applications. One significant benefit of the <b>nutating</b> engine is the overlap of the power strokes.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{satellite}} antennas are gimbal-mounted with an active control system {{to keep the}} antenna pointed at the target satellite. Short time-scale antenna stabilization is achieved with gyroscope feedback. Long time-scale tracking of the satellite is maintained by scanning the antenna: The beam is intentionally <b>nutated</b> and the resulting change in signal strength is used to estimate how well the antenna is aligned to the satellite. We review the basic architectures for tracking with an outer control loop, assuming {{that the system is}} built upon a fast inner stabilization loop. The problem is formulated in a generic mathematical way, not specific to RF satellite communication. Approaches and nomenclature from other fields faced with the same problem of peak-seeking control are discussed. One common and simple technique for tracking is analyzed in detail to reveal the shortcomings that lead to degraded performance. An improvement is suggested and subjected to the same transient analysis to show the improvement. Implications to the overall closed-loop tracking systems are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} an {{elliptic}} vortex evolving in a periodically strained background flow is studied {{in order to}} establish the possible unbounded regimes. Depending on the parameters of the exterior flow, there are three classical regimes of the elliptic vortex motion under constant linear deformation: (i)  rotation, (ii)  nutation, and (iii)  infinite elongation. The phase portrait for the vortex dynamics features critical points which correspond to the stationary vortex not changing its form and orientation. We demonstrate that, given superimposed periodic oscillations to the exterior deformation, the phase space region corresponding to the elliptic critical point experiences parametric instability leading to locally unbounded dynamics of the vortex. This dynamics manifests itself as the vortex <b>nutates</b> along the strain axis while continuously elongating. This motion continues until nonlinear effects intervene near the region associated with the steady-state separatrix. Next, we show that, for specific values of the perturbation parameters, the parametric instability is effectively suppressed by nonlinearity in the primal parametric instability zone. The secondary zone of the parametric instability, on the contrary, produces an effective growth of the vortex's aspect ratio...|$|R

In this engine the normal piston and {{cylinder}} was replaced by an oscillating disc. In 1849 Rennie employed George Daniell Bishopp as a foreman at their works, and he held an 1848 patent regarding this form of engine.

40|$|An {{attitude}} reconstruction algorithm {{has been}} developed for a flexible sounding rocket whose spin vector <b>nutates</b> unstably about its minor inertia axis. This algorithm deduces attitude for use in post-flight analysis of the sounding rocket's science data. An additional motive for pursuing this work has been {{to show that a}} flexible-body dynamic model {{can be used in a}} Kalman filter/smoother-type attitude estimation system. The attitude reconstruction algorithm is a squareroot information filter/smoother. It uses a dynamic model of the rocket that includes a main rigid body and a flexure mode for a pair of elastic booms. Boom bending is the principal cause of the energy loss that leads to unstable growth of the nutations. The flexure of the booms is modeled by a Markov process, but the laws of mechanics are used to model the flexure's influence on the attitude dynamics of the main spacecraft body. The filter/smoother achieves an attitude accuracy that is significantly better than can be achieved using a rigid-body model. The peak attitude error is estimated to be 4 deg, and the majority of the error seems to be caused by the limited accuracy of the rocket's attitude sensors...|$|R

40|$|The {{nucleus of}} a galaxy orbits around the mass centroid. Orbital motions appear overstable in {{numerical}} experiments {{started with a}} galaxy's nucleus at rest atop its mass centroid. The amplitude doubles in 6 - 10 orbital periods. Orbits precess, <b>nutate,</b> and change their amplitudes, but they keep fairly constant periods. Orbital periods are in resonance with local particle motions, and amplitudes reach a core radius. This resonance suggests that center motions are a local, rather than a global, phenomenon. The overstability implies that a galaxy cannot be formed in nature with its nucleus at rest atop its mass centroid, and that nuclei orbit the mass centroid in real galaxies. These center motions should show up observationally as a shift of the nucleus away from the center defined by nearby isophotes. Off-center nuclei {{have been reported in}} many galaxies (e. g., M 33, M 101, NGC 3379, NGC 3384). Other kinds of observations confirmed the picture of nonsteady galactic centers as well.
