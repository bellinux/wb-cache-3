25|$|In the 1950s, the {{endogenous}} {{production of}} psychoactive agents {{was considered to}} be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis. Several speculative and yet untested hypotheses suggest that endogenous DMT is produced in the human brain and is involved in certain psychological and neurological states. DMT is naturally occurring in small amounts in rat brain, human cerebrospinal fluid, and other tissues of humans and other mammals. A biochemical mechanism for this was proposed by the medical researcher J. C. Callaway, who suggested in 1988 that DMT might be connected with visual dream phenomena: brain DMT levels would be periodically elevated to induce visual dreaming and possibly other natural states of mind. A role of endogenous hallucinogens including DMT in higher level sensory processing and awareness was proposed by J. V. Wallach (2009) based on a hypothetical role of DMT as a neurotransmitter. In 2011, Nicholas V. Cozzi, of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, concluded that INMT, an enzyme that may be associated with the biosynthesis of DMT and endogenous hallucinogens, is present in the primate (rhesus macaque) pineal gland, retinal ganglion neurons, and spinal cord. <b>Neurobiologist</b> Andrew Gallimore (2013) suggested that while DMT might not have a modern neural function, it may have been an ancestral neuromodulator once secreted in psychedelic concentrations during REM sleep, a function now lost.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{approach}} two controversial perspectives {{to be found}} in some philosophical approach to consciousness, the first one deals with the different uses of the terms “consciousness” and “to be aware of” so as to identify theirs uses which appears to be unsettling for <b>neurobiologists</b> and philosophers. For <b>neurobiologists</b> the contentious aspect lies on the concept of subjectivity, and for a philosopher in the category of qualia. The second one consists in upholding the thesis that puts into doubt the explicative character of the great majority of the materialist perspectives underlying current explanations of consciousness and qualia...|$|R

Novel interaction techniques and fast algorithms are demanded by <b>neurobiologists</b> to interactively and intuitively extract neural structures from confocal data. In this paper, we present such an algorithm-technique combination, which lets users interactively select desired structures from visualization results instead of 2 D slices. By integrating the segmentation functions with a confocal visualization tool <b>neurobiologists</b> can easily extract complex neural structures within their typical visualization workflow...|$|R

2500|$|With Providence (1977), Resnais {{made his}} first film in English, with a {{screenplay}} written by David Mercer, and a cast that included John Gielgud and Dirk Bogarde.

Resnais was eager that the dark subject should remain humorous, and he described it as [...] "a macabre divertissement". Formal innovation characterised Mon oncle d'Amérique (My American Uncle, 1980) in which the theories of the <b>neurobiologist</b> Henri Laborit about animal behaviour are juxtaposed with three interwoven fictional stories; and a further counterpoint to the fictional characters {{is provided by the}} inclusion of film extracts of the classic French film actors with whom they identify.
