500|$|Intra-conference {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2007, when Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "'s only got onemore year, though. He'll be there onemore year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. [...] At the Pac-10 Conference media day (July 26, 2007), Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football"; the declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.|$|E
500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales {{said that}} the {{nomination}} [...] "is a powerful message, a powerful message of hope and opportunity of hope through this appointment." [...] With respect to Sotomayor, Gonzales said, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind about her qualifications in terms of education, experience. A president {{is not required to}} nominate the most qualified person to the court. I think he's obligated to nominate someone who is well qualified, and I think by any measure she is well qualified. I think there are legitimate questions about her judicial philosophy, and again, that will be something that will be examined in the confirmation process." ...|$|R

500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{influence}} {{on foreign policy}} has been cited as foundational to the George W. Bush administration's foreign policy, and the Iraq War.

[...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that President Truman made the right decision." [...] At the same time, he said, [...] "As the man who commanded the last atomic mission, I pray that I retain that singular distinction." ...|$|E

In a 2011 {{interview}} with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Gingrich addressed his past infidelities by saying, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> at times <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked too hard and things happened <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life that were not appropriate." [...] In December 2011, after the group Iowans for Christian Leaders in Government requested that he sign their so-called [...] "Marriage Vow", Gingrich sent a lengthy written response. It included his pledge to [...] "uphold personal fidelity to my spouse".|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, backgammon programmers found more success with an {{approach}} based on artificial neural networks. TD-Gammon, developed by Gerald Tesauro of IBM, {{was the first}} of these programs to play near the expert level. Its neural network was trained using temporal difference learning applied to data generated from self-play. According to assessments by Bill Robertie and Kit Woolsey, TD-Gammon's play was at or above the level of the top human players in the world. Woolsey said of the program that [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that its positional judgment is far better than mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2010, {{shortly before}} a speech {{for the eighth}} annual [...] "Images and Perceptions of Arab Americans" [...] conference in Dearborn, Michigan, Thomas told reporters that she still stood by the {{comments}} she had made to Nesenoff.

[...] During the speech, Thomas said: [...] "Congress, the White House, Hollywood and Wall Street are owned by Zionists. <b>No</b> <b>question,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion."

2500|$|GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5, finding it fell {{just short of}} being a classic; [...] "the biggest and most obvious problem with the game has to be its story. There was not a single, solitary moment during the game where I was even the {{slightest}} bit interested in or entertained by its copious, well-voiced, cinematic sequences." [...] He concluded [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Dark Cloud 2 {{is one of the}} most solid RPG adventures for the PS2; but what I am sure of is that it doesn't quite live up to its potential. If Level-5 had worked out all of the kinks, it'd be one of my favorite games for the PS2. Sadly, it's not. While it has my grudging respect, there are many games that I prefer, thanks to DC2's idiosyncrasies." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{relationships}} and her sexuality, Fox {{said that she}} has a general distrust and dislike of men, and that the perception of her as a [...] "wild and crazy sexpot" [...] is false because she is asocial and has only been sexually intimate with her [...] "childhood sweetheart" [...] and Brian Austin Green; she stated that she would rather stay at home instead of going out, and emphasized that she cannot have sex with someone she does not love. She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind about being bisexual," [...] Fox stated. [...] "But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Engaging {{in civil}} disobedience {{that would result}} in many people being arrested was a primary objective, as it would focus {{attention}} on the target. On March 24, 1987, 17 people out of 250 participating were arrested for blocking rush-hour traffic in front of the FDA's Wall Street offices. Kramer was arrested dozens of times working with ACT UP, and the organization grew to hundreds of chapters in the US and Europe. Immunologist Anthony Fauci states [...] "ACT UP put medical treatment {{in the hands of the}} patients. And that is the way it ought to be... There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. In American medicine there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry. Playwright Tony Kushner offered his opinion of why Kramer fought so relentlessly: [...] "In a way, like a lot of Jewish men of Larry's generation, the Holocaust is a defining historical moment, and what happened in the early 1980s with AIDS felt, and was in fact, holocaustal to Larry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harbaugh stirred some intra-conference {{controversy}} in March 2007, {{when he was}} quoted as saying rival USC head coach [...] "Pete Carroll's only got one more year, though. He'll be there one more year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. The comment caused a rebuke from Carroll. (In fact, Carroll would be at USC for three more years.) At the Pacific-10 Conference media day on July 26, 2007, Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football." [...] The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention. Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history. Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55–21 on November 14, 2009. Stanford's 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll's first November loss as USC head coach. Harbaugh never lost in USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E

Here is a rude sketch of its use of the crocket in the spandrils of its external tracery, and here are the waves of the Greek sea round the son of Poseidon. Seventeen hundred years are between them, but the same mind is in both. I wonder how many times seventeen hundred years Mr. Darwin will ask, to retrace the Greek designer of this into his primitive ape; or how many times six hundred years of such improvements as we have made on the church of St. Urbain, will be needed in order to enable our descendants to regard the designers of that, as only primitive apes.|$|E
