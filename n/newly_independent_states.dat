5|$|These radars {{have been}} {{installed}} at six different radar stations {{and as of}} 2012 are operational at three – Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty required that early warning radars were located {{on the periphery of}} national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 as many of the radar stations were now in <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states.</b> The first station to close was Skrunda, in newly independent Latvia. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would stop working in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.|$|E
5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to {{how it should be}} implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the {{subsequent}} Russian Civil War, many Baltic Germans fled to Germany. After 1919, many Baltic Germans felt obliged to depart the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> for Germany, but many stayed as ordinary citizens.|$|E

25|$|Its {{ability to}} achieve {{financial}} sustainability allowed FINCA to make considerable expansions in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and the <b>Newly</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>States</b> of the Former Soviet Union. In 1995, FINCA entered the former Soviet Union by establishing a Village Banking program in Kyrgyzstan. In 1997, FINCA co-sponsored the first Microcredit Summit, with over 2,000 policymakers, practitioners, and donors discussing ways to expand microcredit programs. In 2000, FINCA {{became one of the}} first economic development organizations to enter Kosovo after the June 1999 cease-fire. In the 2000s, FINCA continued its penetration into the <b>Newly</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>States</b> by establishing new programs in Central Asia. Its most recent programs were launched in Afghanistan, in 2004 (see FINCA Afghanistan), and Jordan in 2007. In April 2009, FINCA Kyrgyzstan became the second program to pass the 100,000 client mark.|$|E
25|$|The 1972 Anti-ballistic missile treaty {{requires}} that {{early warning radar}} stations are located {{on the periphery of}} national territory and face outwards. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 this resulted in many of the stations ending up in <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states.</b> The radar station at Skrunda, now in Latvia, closed in 1998. Other stations now overseas were Sevastopol and Mukachevo (both in Ukraine), Balkhash (Kazakhstan) and Gabala (Azerbaijan).|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union officially {{dissolved}} on 31 December 1991, {{leaving the}} Soviet military in limbo. For {{the next year}} and a half various attempts to keep its unity and to transform it into the military of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) failed. Over time, some units stationed in the newly independent republics swore loyalty to their new national governments, while a series of treaties between the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> divided up the military's assets.|$|E

25|$|Since its inception, one of {{the primary}} goals of the CIS has been to provide a forum for {{discussing}} issues related to the social and economic development of the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states.</b> To achieve this goal member states have agreed to promote and protect human rights. Initially, efforts to achieve this goal consisted merely of statements of good will, but on 26 May 1995, the CIS adopted a Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|On May 4, 1776, the Colony of Rhode Island {{became the}} first of the Thirteen Colonies to renounce its {{allegiance}} to the British Crown, and it was the fourth among the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 9, 1778. The state boycotted the 1787 convention which drew up the United States Constitution and initially refused to ratify it; it was the last of the original states to do so, on May 29, 1790.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, the Supreme Soviet, {{the highest}} governmental {{body of the}} Soviet Union, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state. The Soviet Army originally remained under overall CIS command, but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states.</b> The few remaining Soviet institutions {{that had not been}} taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.|$|E

25|$|Before 2002, Russian law allowed {{residents}} of former Soviet Union {{to apply for}} citizenship {{if they had not}} become citizens of their <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states.</b> The procedure was extremely complex. The new citizenship law of Russia adopted on 31 May 2002 introduced a simplified procedure of citizenship acquisition for former citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of their place of residence. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the application process was simplified even further, and people could apply even without leaving their homes. Russian nationalist non-governmental organisations with close ties to Russian officialdom simply took their papers to a nearby Russian city for processing.|$|E
25|$|Tension {{between the}} {{political}} forces in Moscow and Beijing would greatly influence Asian politics during the 1960s and 1970s, and {{a microcosm of}} the Sino-Soviet split emerged when the by-then late-Ho Chi Minh's Soviet-aligned Vietnam invaded Pol Pot's pro-Chinese Cambodia in 1978. The Soviets had ensured the loyalty of Vietnam and Laos through an aggressive campaign of political, economic and military aid – the same tactic which allowed the Soviet Union to compete with the United States in a race to establish themselves as neocolonial rulers of <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> in Africa and the Middle East. Extensive arms sales made weapons like the AK-47 and the T-55 tank icons of the contemporary wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the ROC eparchies in some <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> {{of the former}} USSR enjoy the status of self-governing Churches within the Moscow Patriarchate (which status, {{according}} to the ROC legal terminology, is distinct from the ″autonomous″ one): the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate, Latvian Orthodox Church, Moldovan Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the last one being virtually fully independent in administrative matters. Similar status, since 2007, is enjoyed by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (previously fully independent and deemed schismatic by the ROC). The Chinese Orthodox Church and the Japanese Orthodox Churches were granted full autonomy by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this autonomy is not universally recognized.|$|E

5000|$|Just {{before the}} start of the Revolutionary War, Clinton's step-father John Sampson was a Lieutenant General in the Provincial North Carolina Army for Governor William Tryon in support of King George III. [...] A few short years later however in 1777, the Oath of Allegiance and Abjuration was passed by the House of Commons that {{required}} all state and some county Government officials to sign swearing their oath to support the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>State</b> of North Carolina. It is interesting to note that Richard Clinton did indeed sign this oath; however his step-father John Sampson did not, indicating that there may have been a conflict of interest of who the family would support: the British Crown, or the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R
25|$|Soviet {{military}} aid continued after their withdrawal, and massive quantities of food, fuel, ammunition and military equipment {{was given to}} the government. Varennikov visited Afghanistan in May 1989 to discuss ways and means to deliver the aid to the government. In 1990 Soviet aid amounted to an estimated 3 billion United States dollars. As it turned out, the Afghan military was entirely dependent on Soviet aid to function. When the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, Najibullah turned to former Soviet Central Asia for aid. These <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> had no wish to see Afghanistan being taken over by religious fundamentalists, and supplied Afghanistan with 6 million barrels of oil and 500,000 tons of wheat to survive the winter.|$|E
25|$|Jawaharlal Nehru's {{concept of}} nonalignment brought India {{considerable}} international prestige among <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> that shared India's {{concerns about the}} military confrontation between the superpowers {{and the influence of}} the former colonial powers. New Delhi used nonalignment to establish a significant role for itself as a leader of the newly independent world in such multilateral organisations as the United Nations (UN) and the Nonaligned Movement. The signing of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation between India and the Soviet Union in 1971 and India's involvement {{in the internal affairs of}} its smaller neighbours in the 1970s and 1980s tarnished New Delhi's image as a nonaligned nation and led some observers to note that in practice, nonalignment applied only to India's relations with countries outside South Asia.|$|E

Steadily, the units stationed in Ukraine and some other breakaway republics swore loyalty to their new national governments, while a series of treaties between the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> divided up the military's assets. In mid-March 1992, Yeltsin appointed himself as the new Russian minister of defence, marking a crucial step {{in the creation of the}} new Russian armed forces, comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993.|$|E

25|$|On 2 January 1833, Captain James Onslow, of the brig-sloop HMS Clio, {{arrived at}} the Spanish {{settlement}} at Port Louis to request that the Argentine flag be replaced with the British one, and that the Argentine administration leave the islands. While Argentine Lt. Col. José María Pinedo, commander of the Argentine schooner Sarandí, wanted to resist, his numerical disadvantage was obvious, particularly as {{a large number of}} his crew were British mercenaries who were unwilling to fight their own countrymen. Such a situation was not unusual in the <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> in Latin America, where land forces were strong, but navies were frequently quite undermanned. He protested verbally, but departed without a fight on 5 January. The colony was set up and the islands continued under a British presence until the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} years Israel sought to {{maintain}} a non-aligned position between the super-powers. However, in 1952, an antisemitic public trial was staged in Moscow in which a group of Jewish doctors were {{accused of trying to}} poison Stalin (the Doctors' plot), followed by a similar trial in Czechoslovakia (Slánský trial). This, and the failure of Israel {{to be included in the}} Bandung Conference (of non-aligned states), effectively ended Israel's pursuit of non-alignment. On 19 May 1950, Egypt announced that the Suez Canal was closed to Israeli ships and commerce. In 1952 a military coup in Egypt brought Abdel Nasser to power. The United States pursued close relations with the new Arab states, particularly the Nasser-led Egyptian Free Officers Movement and Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. Israel's solution to diplomatic isolation was to establish good relations with <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> in Africa and with France, which was engaged in the Algerian War.|$|E
25|$|The Congress was {{the sole}} organ of the {{national}} government, without a national court to interpret law nor an executive branch to enforce them, in the states or on individuals. Governmental functions, including declarations of war and calls for an army, were supported in some degree for some time, by each state voluntarily, or not. These <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>states</b> separated from Britain no longer received favored treatment at British ports. The British refused to negotiate a commercial treaty in 1785 because the individual American states would not be bound by it. Congress could not act directly upon the States nor upon individuals. It had no authority to regulate foreign or interstate commerce. Every act of government was left to the individual States. Each state levied taxes and tariffs on other states at will, which invited retaliation. Congress could vote itself mediator and judge in state disputes, but states {{did not have to}} accept its decisions.|$|E
