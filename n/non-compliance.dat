5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through <b>non-compliance,</b> leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E

50|$|If an {{organisation}} is correctly {{aligned with}} the Standard, the assessment report {{will be sent to}} The Law Society and the standard awarded. If an organisation's policies, plans, procedures and processes are not correctly {{aligned with the}} Lexcel standard, the assessor will note minor or major 'non-compliances'. Where an organisation is being assessed for the first time, they have up to six months to correct the <b>non-compliances</b> and on completion of any necessary work, will then be awarded the Lexcel Standard. Subsequent assessments will result in minor <b>non-compliances</b> having to be corrected within three weeks and major <b>non-compliances</b> within three months. Award of the standard lasts three years subject to satisfactory annual maintenance visits (AMVs). At the end of the three-year award, if the organisation wishes to continue with Lexcel, a full re-assessment is again undertaken.|$|R
5|$|In March 1942 the Indies were {{occupied}} by the Empire of Japan. The occupation government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both clergy and laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade the use of Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties; several others, including the presbytery at Gedangan, were protected by the clergy. After two European head pastors, G. Schoonhoff and G. de Quay, were confined, ultimately on 27 August 1943 the ethnic Javanese Soegijapranata took on parish duties {{in addition to his}} work as vicar apostolic. Although he promoted <b>non-compliance</b> with Japanese demands considered damaging to the church, Soegijapranata also endorsed some collaboration. For instance, on 28 February 1944 a Latin-language Mass was delivered at Gedangan by , bishop of Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for <b>non-compliance</b> with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct <b>non-compliance</b> with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007. He later claimed that the steroids were for a legitimate medical reason, {{saying that they were}} from when he tore his latissimus dorsi muscle in 2005.|$|E

50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that ISO 14001 certification automatically implies legal compliance. Certification under ISO 14001 {{does not}} directly reflect compliance with any legal requirements, although ISO 14001 demands the organization to evaluate its compliance with legal requirements. If there is no compliance with some legal requirement, ISO 14001 requires that the organization sets specific targets related to the <b>non-compliance(s)</b> and establishes, implements and maintains programmes to achieve compliance. Therefore it is possible that, {{at the time of}} audit, the organization fulfils the requirements of ISO 14001, yet there are one or more <b>non-compliances</b> with specific requirements, which are identified and which the organization actively works to correct. Specific guidance on this subject is provided by the European co-operation for Accreditation.|$|R

5|$|One {{avenue for}} <b>non-compliance</b> {{is the black}} market. FairTax {{supporters}} state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from <b>non-compliance</b> could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} <b>non-compliance</b> with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Duties of {{citizens}} {{were added to}} the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defense. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. However, many of these are non-justifiable, without any legal sanction in case of their violation or <b>non-compliance.</b> There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to <b>non-compliance.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan {{had been}} superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict {{ordering}} all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid {{the rest of}} their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for <b>non-compliance</b> was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:The {{objective}} of the research work is to propose a software service compliance management model towards portability fault tolerance (PFT) using RESTFUL web services exchanges in distributed systems. The compliance management is achieved through correct identification of the various <b>non-compliances</b> while deploying and executing software services on various hardware and system platforms. The portability faults are due to operational platform changes (OPC), service audit constraints (SAC) and multiple service contracts (MSC). These portability faults can be detected and identified through the proposed set of services, namely SARALA {{that are based on}} computational situations, resources and locations of the needed services. The software services in HIPAA framework for mobile health care system are to be portable but also accountable where both are also to be compliant with existing government policies and regulations. The incorrect portability attributes which lead to <b>non-compliances</b> in the network protocol, the third party software and data format are checked to detect the causes of policy violations and activate the necessary enforcement actions to meet the healthcare acts...|$|R

40|$|For safety purposes, {{railroad}} tracks {{need to be}} inspected {{on a regular basis}} for physical defects or design <b>non-compliances.</b> Such track defects and <b>non-compliances,</b> if not detected in a timely manner, may eventually lead to grave consequences such as train derailments. In this paper, we present a real-time automatic vision-based rail inspection system, with main focus on anchors-an important rail component type, and anchor-related rail defects, or exceptions. Our system robustly detects impor-tant rail components including ties, tie plates, anchors with high accuracy and efficiency. Detected objects are then con-solidated across video frames and across camera views to map to physical rail objects, by combining the video data streams from all camera views with GPS information and speed information from the distance measuring instrument (DMI). After these rail components are detected and con-solidated, further data integration and analysis is followed to detect sequence-level track defects, or exceptions. Quan-titative analysis performed on a real online field test con-ducted on different track conditions demonstrates that our system achieves very promising performance in terms of rail component detection, anchor condition assessment, and compliance-level exception detection. We also show that our system outperforms another advanced rail inspection system in anchor detection. 1. Introduction and Relate...|$|R
