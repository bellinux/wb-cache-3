5000|$|Six {{degrees of}} freedom (6DoF) refers to the freedom of {{movement}} of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. Specifically, the body is free to change position as forward/backward (surge), up/down (heave), left/right (sway) translation in three perpendicular axes, combined with changes in orientation through rotation about three perpendicular axes, often termed yaw (<b>normal</b> <b>axis),</b> pitch (lateral axis), and roll (longitudinal axis).|$|E

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of kinematic mounts {{is that the}} center of the mirror moves along its <b>normal</b> <b>axis,</b> when the mirror is rotated. This is because the center of rotation is the middle of the first ball bearing, not {{the center of the}} mirror. For optical cavities and interferometers, it is often desirable to be able to align the mirrors separately from adjustments to the length of the cavity. For these applications and others, a more sophisticated mount is required.|$|E
50|$|The {{light beam}} and the <b>normal</b> <b>axis</b> of the {{reflector}} {{as shown in}} Figure 2 form the entrance angle. The entrance angle {{is a function of}} the orientation of the reflector to the light source. For example, the entrance angle between an automobile approaching a bicycle at an intersection 90 degrees apart is larger than the entrance angle for a bicycle directly in front of an automobile on a straight road. The reflector appears brightest to the observer when it is directly in line with the light source.|$|E
5000|$|As they {{continue}} their journey, the Landmaster develops {{a problem with}} its drivetrain and they head to Detroit. Denton comments that it was [...] "designed to use spare truck parts", semi-trucks in particular. In Detroit they enter a large wrecking yard {{in search of the}} needed parts. A large storm comes upon the group and they take shelter in their vehicle just as a tidal wave washes them away. After the storm passes, they are adrift in a large body of water and it appears that the Earth has returned to its <b>normal</b> <b>axis</b> as the sky is clear. Using the Landmaster's amphibious capability, they reach land. As they are making repairs, they hear a radio broadcast of music and an attempt to reach survivors. After making contact, Tanner and Billy set out on to locate the source of the broadcast. In the final scene, they reach a surprisingly intact Albany and are greeted by its inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|An {{airplane}} spin {{tends to}} flatten as it progresses because then its mass is distributed furthest from its center of rotation, as rotating objects tend to rotate about their axis of maximum rotational inertia. Aircraft have their maximum rotational inertia when spinning on their <b>normal</b> <b>axis,</b> i.e. flatly. In purpose-built aerobatic aircraft, spins may be intentionally flattened {{through the application}} of power and aileron within a normal spin. Rotation rates experienced are dramatic and can exceed 400 degrees per second in an attitude that may even have the nose above the horizon. Such maneuvers must be performed with the center of gravity in the normal range and with appropriate training, and consideration should be given to the extreme gyroscopic forces generated by the propeller and exerted on the crankshaft. The current Guinness world record for the number of consecutive inverted flat spins is 98, set by Spencer Suderman on March 20, 2016 flying an experimental variant of the Pitts S-1 designated the Sunbird S-1x. Suderman started from an altitude of 24,500 ft and recovered at 2000 ft.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{relationship}} between axial length and complications of phacoemulsification with intraocular lens(IOL) implantation in high axial myopia eyes and <b>normal</b> <b>axis</b> eyes. METHODS: A retrospective review of 843 consecutive patients(1 042 eyes) of cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in our hospital from February 2012 to February 2013 was performed. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to the axial length: 853 eyes were in <b>normal</b> <b>axis</b> group(21 - 24 mm) and 189 eyes were in high axial myopia group(≥ 26 mm). The two groups were compared regarding surgical complications, such as vitreous loss, posterior capsular rupture, nucleolus drop, and abnormal location of IOL. RESULTS: Age was a risk factor in both groups. There was positive correlation between age and surgical complications, and between axial length and surgical complications, especially for complications with posterior capsular rupture and vitreous loss. CONCLUSION: As the results illustrate, in this survey, age and high axial lengthare statistically significant risk factors for incidence of complications of phacoemulsification. Anticipation of these complications and also preparation and prophylactic measures may decrease incidence of these complications...|$|E
