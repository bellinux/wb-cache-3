40|$|Confronted with {{substantial}} environmental burden induced by ever-rising consumption {{of energy and}} resources, the manufacturing sector has been urged to shift its production towards a more environmentally conscious paradigm. Hence, sustainable manufacturing has drawn significant attention in recent years. To accomplish this aim, reducing production energy has been acknowledged {{as one of the}} essential tasks. As the key element in manufacturing, machine tools dominate the energy consumption during production. Accordingly, reducing the energy consumption of machine tools can effectively mitigate the adverse environmental impact of manufacturing. This research aims to develop energy-efficient approaches to diminish the energy footprint of machining processes (e. g. turning, milling, and grinding) at machine tool level. Several research subjects have been investigated to address this issue, which mainly involve energy modelling of machine tools, optimization approaches for energy-efficient machining strategies, simulation of energy consumption in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems, and enhancement of the energy conservation of process planning. Firstly, the energy characteristics of machine tools are investigated. The results indicate that the machine energy is significantly influenced by the process parameters. Based on the analysis, the energy model of the machine tool is then developed as a function of process parameters. Two modelling methods, the black-box approach (BBA) and the bottom-up approach (BUA), are developed to establish the energy model of machine tools. The black-box approach considers the machine tool as an opaque object, and the energy characteristic is established empirically by correlating the input machining parameters and their corresponding output energy. In the bottom-up approach, the energy consumption of a machine tool is decomposed into different elements based on either machine state (e. g. startup, standby, cutting) or machine component (e. g. spindle, axis drives). By accumulating the energy of all elements, the total machine energy can be obtained. A modelling accuracy of 95 % can be realized by applying the developed energy models. To develop energy-efficient machining strategies, a surface roughness based approach is proposed to optimize the parameter of the finishing turning process. In this approach, process parameters which can satisfy the surface roughness requirement are firstly selected based on the surface roughness model; then the machining parameters that would lead to minimum energy consumption are determined by applying the established energy model. In addition, the machine energy can also be dramatically affected by different toolpath strategies and <b>non-cutting</b> <b>movement.</b> For selection of toolpath patterns, the investigation for the milling process shows that process time plays a critical role in the energy consumption. A longer toolpath prolongs the machining time and thus requires more energy. The mass of the activated axis also influences the energy, showing that heavier moving axes will result in more energy consumption. For settings in the <b>non-cutting</b> <b>movement,</b> a higher feed rate will increase the energy consumption of axis drives and decrease the energy of auxiliary parts; thus it demonstrates that machine energy presents a U-shape over feed rate, and an optimum feed rate can be selected for <b>non-cutting</b> <b>movement.</b> Moreover, the investigated machining case shows that an overall 50. 6 % of the total machine energy can be reduced through changing process settings (parameters, toolpath pattern, and <b>non-cutting</b> <b>movement).</b> At process chain level, in order to quantitatively allocate the machining stock, a systematic energy-efficient approach, which is based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, is developed to optimize the grinding stock for the turning-grinding process sequence. The validation results present that, compared to the conventional method (Halevi method), the developed approach reduces 16. 6 % of energy consumption for the turning-grinding process sequence. Furthermore, using the developed energy models, an operation-mode based simulation approach, which incorporates material removal simulation to precisely track the energy of removing material, is developed and validated to predict the energy consumption of machining processes. It is shown from the validation result that by applying the developed approach, the energy consumption of machining one product with a sequence of operations can be simulated accurately within a deviation of 10 %. By merging the developed approach into current CAM systems, energy-efficient computer-aided manufacturing can be achieved, and the process settings can be optimized before the workpiece is loaded onto the machine for execution. The investigated case shows that an overall energy-saving potential of 80 % can be identified by adjusting process settings. Therefore, applying the developed simulation approach will help to facilitate process planning, enhance the energy conservation of machine tools as well as cut down the production cost. Finally, to foster the energy conservation of process planning, a comparative analysis is carried out to investigate how the manufacturing energy footprint is affected by the decision-making at each stage of process planning (selection of blank shape and selection of process settings). Process chains, consisting of primary shaping and machining processes for manufacturing conventional shape and near-net-shape products, are analyzed. At the stage of blank shape selection, the process chain for near-net-shape consumes much less energy in contrast with the process chain of conventional shape, showing that for the studied cases more than 50 % of energy can be mitigated for the whole manufacturing chain. As for the selection of process settings, energy saving of up to 20 % can be realized. It shows that using process chain of near-net-shape saves more energy than modifying process settings. In addition to saving energy consumption, manufacturing of near-net-shape products can also reduce the material usage. About 60 % less material is utilized by manufacturing of near-net-shape products. Therefore, applying near-net-shape is able to achieve both energy- and resource- efficient manufacturing. Besides, it also implies that early decision-makings in process planning would help to save more energy consumption in manufacturing. status: publishe...|$|E
