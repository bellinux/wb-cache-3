Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of <b>normal</b> <b>time</b> remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall.

30|$|This finding {{suggests}} that during a consolidation episode, employment {{tends to be more}} reactive to output than in <b>normal</b> <b>times.</b> If output is expanding then employment would expand more than in <b>normal</b> <b>times,</b> while if output is contracting, employment would contract more than in <b>normal</b> <b>times.</b> Hence, consolidating in good times (during output expansion) is here found to positively affect employment. The result is robust under a specification which includes the duration of the consolidation episode, expressed in number of years. Further, distinguishing between expenditure-driven and revenue-driven consolidation episodes, we find that the Okun’s coefficient is sensitive only to expenditure reduction and not increases in revenue. This is an interesting result which may highlight the presence of a crowding-in effect for the private sector when the government size in the economy shrinks. Yet an analysis of the change in the composition of spending during consolidation is necessary to accurately interpret the finding in light of a crowding-in effect for the private sector.|$|R
40|$|A {{widespread}} belief among economists, policy-makers, {{and members}} of the media is that the “confidence ” of households and firms is a critical component of the transmission of fiscal policy shocks into economic activity. In this paper we take this proposition to the data. We use the commonly accepted restrictions from the literature to identify government spending shocks in VARs augmented to include empirical measures of consumer or business confidence. We also estimate non-linear specifications to allow for differential impacts of government spending in recessions versus expansions. In <b>normal</b> <b>times,</b> we find that confidence falls in response to unexpected increases in government spending; during recessions it rises. In addition, the spending multiplier is much larger in recessions than in <b>normal</b> <b>times.</b> We then construct counterfactual impulse responses in which the response of confidence to government spending shocks is “shut down”. Comparing the unconstrained and counterfactual responses of output allows us to determine the importance of confidence as a transmission mechanism of policy. We find that confidence is irrelevant in the transmission of government spending shocks to output in <b>normal</b> <b>times,</b> but is apparently very important during downturns. We provide some evidence that suggests this is because spending shocks during downturns lead to persistent increases in government investment relative to government consumption, whereas {{this is not the case}} in <b>normal</b> <b>times.</b> ∗Contact information...|$|R

Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of <b>normal</b> <b>time,</b> leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time – including one scored almost five minutes after <b>normal</b> <b>time</b> had elapsed – resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history. The game was also notable for former player Joey Barton's sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents on three different players in the space of only a couple of seconds, resulting in a 12-match ban.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of monetary policy {{depends largely on}} how it affects bank behavior. Recent events have cast doubt on how well monetary policy works in this respect, particularly during financial crises. In addition, issues have been raised {{about the role of}} banks in creating asset bubbles that burst and lead to crises. In this paper, we address these issues by focusing on bank liquidity creation, which is a comprehensive measure of bank output that accounts for all on- and off-balance sheet activities. Specifically we formulate and test hypotheses that address the following questions: (1) How does monetary policy affect total bank liquidity creation and its two main components, on- and off-balance sheet liquidity creation, during <b>normal</b> <b>times?</b> (2) Does monetary policy affect bank liquidity creation differently during financial crises versus <b>normal</b> <b>times?</b> (3) Is high aggregate bank liquidity creation an indicator of an impending financial crisis? We identify five financial crises and use data on virtually all U. S. banks between 1984 :Q 1 and 2008 :Q 4. Our main findings are as follows. First, during <b>normal</b> <b>times,</b> monetary policy tightening is associated with a reduction in liquidity creation by small banks, with much of the impact driven by a reduction in on-balance sheet liquidity creation. Monetary policy does not significantly affect liquidity creation by large and medium banks, which create roughly 90 % of aggregate bank liquidity. Second, during financial crises, the effect of monetary policy on liquidity creation is weaker than during <b>normal</b> <b>times</b> fo...|$|R

After eight minutes, Leeds went ahead when Lehmann's goal clearance hit striker Mark Viduka and rebounded into the net. Arsenal equalised through Henry, who converted Ljungberg's cross from the right on a volley. Additional goals from Edu, Pirès and Touré inflicted a third consecutive 4–1 defeat for Leeds against Arsenal at Elland Road. At home to Middlesbrough in the fourth round, Bergkamp opened the scoring for Arsenal, following good play from Parlour. Joseph-Désiré Job equalised for the away team four minutes after, but Ljungberg restored Arsenal's lead with a shot outside the penalty box and scored a second, direct from a corner.
