30|$|One of {{the other}} pitfalls which needs to be avoided is the {{building}} of a ‘politics of recognition’ through media visibility. Even though the use of the media is also a way to raise awareness among a non-Native public, self-making should not be ‘fixed by the look of another’ and should constantly <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> entangled with the paradox of trying to convince the very structures oppressing indigenous people of their authenticity and of the legitimacy of their claims (Coulthard 2008). Indeed, self-representation and self-making are linked to building one’s identity on his or her own terms. But ‘does one actually decide one’s own identity or is it applied from the outside, determined, socially constructed and performed?’ (Smith 2011).|$|E
40|$|Canada and Australia share {{a colonial}} history which {{featured}} {{an attempt to}} eradicate Indigenous spirituality and language and which involved governmental intervention {{in areas such as}} health and education. The movement across traditional borders in order to access health and education created a kind of intra-national diasporic condition, which Indigenous peoples in these countries continue to negotiate on a daily basis. The Inuit writer Alootook Ipellie and Murri writer Sam Watson seek to resist cultural constraints through creating works which are multiply transgressive. Their works cross genre boundaries and use the interstices between Indigenous diaspora, queer theory and maban reality in order to find a way of locating cultural subjectivity in relation to their narratives. They each offer alternatives to normative binaries in literature, especially with regard to cultural and sexual identity. The characters they create are shamanic, and thus able to <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of being Indigenous diasporans in the contemporary world. Ipellie’s narrator in his collection Arctic Dreams and Nightmares is still most at “home” in the Arctic, where his powers are at their strongest; he is hyper-masculine, pragmatic, and engaged with mainstream cultural iconography. Watson’s protagonist is bicultural, promiscuous, and angry at authority figures from both cultures. In the end this paper seeks to analyse how these authors contest established categories about who belongs and where, and how they have determined the means to tell stories of the Arctic and Queensland which might otherwise have been lost through colonial processes...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation Abstract "A Tragedy of Success!" {{is a close}} {{engagement}} with the ongoing artistic turn to Haiti and its revolution within the Caribbean literary imaginary. It argues that twentieth and twenty-first writers of the region {{are drawn to the}} nation and its Upheaval precisely because the striking incongruity of Haiti's revolutionary past and postcolonial present vividly discloses how the modern Caribbean experience is profoundly shaped by the ceaseless play of radical change (conquest, colonialism and anti-colonial revolution) and debilitating communal crisis. This project joins the rich conversation on Haiti, modernity and the Revolution begun by C. LR. James, and continued by Nick Nesbitt and Sibylle Fischer, to address this discussion's slight attention to the abundant literary production inspired by the Revolution. This dissertation therefore focuses on the ideological work of the Revolution's repeated narration in the Caribbean, specifically, {{the manner in which it}} arouses anti-colonial aspirations. It argues that the Caribbean experience of modernity has introduced a tragic mode into literary representations of the Upheaval, causing regional writers to depict the immediate as confounded by the past. Characterized by a subtle wavering between tragic pathos and comic elation, iii this mode is as much an {{engagement with}} time and its affective oscillation as it is a politics of possibility. It speaks strongly to the writers' longing for total decolonial liberation region wide. This project participates in the rethinking of tragedy, as initiated by contemporary scholars like Rita Felski, Timothy Reiss and David Scott, in order to gauge how Caribbean writers use Haiti to <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> and successes of the region in their efforts to portray their desire for an improved Caribbean future. i...|$|E
30|$|These Romantic factors draw {{attention}} of many well known critics. Michael Marais (20001) in “Very Morbid Phenomena: Liberal Punk, the Lucy-Syndrome and J.M. Coetzee’s Disgrace,” talks of Coetzee’s “respect for the otherness of other beings,” a pertinent Wordsworthian concern (38). The Hegelian interest of “the relation of dominance and subservience” (33) is markedly present in Marias critique which further throws {{light on the}} narrative being “determined by a tension between desire and responsibility” (174), the imposing preoccupations of the Romantics. Coetzee brings the two contrasting poets together from the High Romantic period <b>negotiating</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> underlying human relations of the contemporary world.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine how some recent Pakeha writers {{have dealt with}} the {{difficulties}} of a colonial past in their fictional histories. I look at C. K. Stead's The Singing Whakapapa (1994), Ian Wedde's Symmes Hole (1986) and Maurice Shadbolt's New Zealand Wars trilogy: Season of the Jew (1986), Monday's Warriors (1990) and The House of Strife (1993). I focus on the techniques employed by these writers to construct a secure and guiltless sense of belonging for a late-twentieth-century Pakeha readership. This involves a look at how they approach issues of cultural authenticity and tradition and how they <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties,</b> identified by Romi K. Bhabha, at the colonial moment. I argue that ambivalences similar to those identified by Bhabha re-emerge in these contemporary narratives. However, in their attempts to authorise a continued Pakeha presence, the novels respond to a new context. Increased Maori assertiveness and a growing awareness of colonial injustices left many Pakeha, in the 1980 s and 1990 s, with feelings of anxiety about the past; something apparent, for example, in Michael King's "ethnic autobiographies". Bhabha's theories, in order that they remain applicable within this new context, require modification and must be combined with other theoretical approaches. These are provided by Stephen Turner, Jonathan Lamb and Mary-Louise Pratt. With reference to these theorists I argue that, in the novels of Stead, Wedde and Shadbolt, new ambivalences arise out of the contradictory demands of a contemporary Pakeha readership. Other difficulties are inherited from the narrative of "anti-conquest", a term borrowed from Pratt to describe how, in order to circumvent guilt, colonial domination is rewritten in passive forms. Irony, a complicating factor in each of these novels, is used to obscure uncertainty and to protect the narratives and the politics behind them from criticism...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} emphasise skills shortages as {{the demand}} driver of migration policy. In this article experiences of skilled migration in Australia are analysed, {{drawing on the}} capability approach {{and the concept of}} adaptive preferences. Findings from interviews with skilled migrants illustrate how skilled migrants are encouraged to enter Australia but the skills they bring may not be recognized by employers and they are not deemed to be an education priority target group. The migrants have to engage in different adaptations to fulfill their aspirations for a good life in Australia. Some migrants hold on to their initial aspiration for high skilled work and engage in strategies that help to re-position themselves and gradually pursue opportunities in their preferred areas of employment. Others adapt by downgrading their aspirations; they often find themselves on new trajectories that may limit their opportunities. Still the skilled migrants display considerable navigational capacities in <b>negotiating</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of transnational mobility.

40|$|Recent {{scholarly}} work by Jürgen Habermas, Judith Butler, {{and others}} posits a new cultural domain that is simultaneously religious and secular. Drawing on the sermons of John Tillotson and {{the fiction of}} Henry Fielding, this paper examines literary sentimentalism in this “post-secular” light. It aims to show that sentimentalism affirmed Christian virtues such as charity and chastity, but it radically transmuted and displaced those virtues. In particular, it argues that sentimental fiction imaginatively <b>negotiated</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of practicing Christian virtue in a rapidly changing, commercial society heading into what Charles Taylor has recently called the “immanent frame. ” Its heroes and heroines are best understood as virtuous Christians beset by new temptations, misunderstandings, seductions, which they generally, in the end, overcome. In this light, sentimentalism might {{be defined as a}} practice of Christian virtue without teleological ends or rewards. The rewards of virtue would appear to become virtual and immanent, available in the act of reading itself. And this is to merge religion with literature so that together they enter the logic of post-secularity...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{creativity}} and design {{by way of}} metaphor. It maps out the act of designing and considers dynamic forces that engender ways of living differently. Conception: The overall concept is for a book that articulates an extended metaphor through its volume, design and content. The metaphor targets all that is inexpressible about designing. It is an experimental and imaginative exercise that solves an ethics of encounter conducted through a micro-politics of daily activism. Milieu: The metaphor considers everyday situations and specific circumstances that are constituted by the actual occasions of designing. It explores the nexus at which designing is concentrated and traces outwards to determine the horizons of their milieu. Assemblage: The assemblage of the metaphor is the dynamic territory for creating, organizing and fitting together sensational and affective images of life-changing events. Account: The bound account of the metaphor forms visual and conceptual signs of designing into discussion and diagrams that <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of both living and accounting for events. Dynamic: A cartographic approach surveys {{the image of the}} metaphor for indications of the problems that motivate its designing. Design: The design of the metaphor allows it to fold and unfold complexes of components that do not always connect directly but are always in communication with each other. Resolution: The metaphor crystallizes an image of a particulate instance of designing in which its binaries, living by design and designing by event, intersect...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes that}} performative rituals–that is, verbal and {{physical}} acts that reiterate prior uses–enabled medieval {{women and men}} to <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> dangers and <b>difficulties</b> of conception and childbirth. It analyzes the rituals implicated in charms, prayers, amulets, and prayer rolls and traces the circulation of such rituals within medieval English society. Manuscript records from the Anglo-Saxon period to the late Middle Ages offer evidence of the interaction of oral and written means of communicating these rituals. Certain rituals were long-lived, though variants were introduced over time that reflected changing religious attitudes and the involvement of various interested parties, including local healers, doctors, and medical practitioners, as well as monks, friars, and users of vernacular remedy books.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} how Bangladeshi farmers interact with mobile telephony and how they <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>difficulties.</b> In doing so, the paper seeks to identify how farmers integrate mobile telephony into their daily lives, and what factors facilitate and limit their use of mobile telephony. Design/methodology/approach – The research was based on ethnographic observation, interviews and focus group discussions, collected through four months of fieldwork, conducted in two remote areas of Bangladesh. Findings – It was found that Bangladeshi farmers' use of mobile telephony is inhibited due to language barriers, a lack of literacy, unfamiliar English terminologies, inappropriate translation to local language (Bengali) and financial constraints. However, the social, occupational and psychological benefits from mobile telephony motivate them to use and appropriate it through inventive use and adaptation. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that current understanding of usability needs to be interwoven with that about the appropriation of technology in order to develop a better understanding of the use and consequent integration of a technology in daily lives. Practical implications – The paper adds to the argument for a bottom-up approach for ICT-enabled intervention in development activities and for the mobile telephony manufacturers and network providers it contributes to understanding of the rural consumer market of a developing country. Originality/value – The paper presents an original conceptual diagram that combines the concept of usability and appropriation...|$|R
