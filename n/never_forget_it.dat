And the first books, which I read, were in Russian. I {{was raised in the}} atmosphere of the Russian classical theatre school. The art, built on the system of Stanislavsky – that's the most realistic art. And the modern cinema stands on the same principle. A Russian person wants to find the truth. This is the base of the Russian culture. I <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it,</b> especially since I have Russian roots". When asked if she still feels Russian, after having left Russia at a young age, Milla replied, [...] "Definitely. I still speak Russian. I speak it with my daughter. I read her Russian stories and poems. My roots are very important — they make me who I am".|$|E
500|$|In 1921 {{the couple}} went to Europe where Tunis freelanced {{as a sports}} writer for American {{publications}} and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera, including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden, who was 70 at the time. Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned over the railing, and threw up. I'll <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it.</b> I wiped my face with copy paper. But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E

In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained {{on the banks of the}} river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event [...] "The Great Stink"; the leading article in the City Press observed that [...] "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>it</b> and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: ...|$|E

Haldeman in 1972, reveal that Nixon mused [...] "I'm wondering if that was fixed" [...] after seeing the photograph. After the release of this tape, Út commented, [...] "Even though it {{has become one of}} the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in the papers on 12 June 1972.... The picture for me and unquestionably for many others could not have been more real. The photo was as authentic as the Vietnam War itself. The horror of the Vietnam War recorded by me did not have to be fixed. That terrified little girl is still alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of that photo.
