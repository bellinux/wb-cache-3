5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Spin, Williams stated [...] "'Still Into You' is definitely a love song. It's definitely happy. But to me anyway — and obviously I wrote it so maybe I'm biased, but — it's not a sappy love song. ... We've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before, and honestly I don't {{have a whole lot}} of experience writing love songs, or anyways lyrics that are like this." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 David Coulthard {{admitted}} for {{the first}} time the crash at Spa was his fault: [...] "The reality is that I lifted to let him pass me, but I lifted in heavy spray on the racing line. You should <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> now." ...|$|R

500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> on an album, before or since." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{subsequent}} songs {{focus on}} separation, with lyrics written in past tense. [...] "Unfold" [...] comprises individual notes and pauses, and incorporates tension in its off-beat composition, while its percussion increases in tempo before the accompanying instrumentation follows suit. It features deep house beats, resounding guitar harmonics, rhythmic hi-hat, and a dominant breakbeat. Croft describes [...] "Unfold" [...] as a [...] "gentle reverie" [...] and [...] "quite an emotional one." [...] On [...] "Swept Away", she and Sim express fragile declarations of love. They originally wrote the song as a ballad before Smith reworked {{it with a}} Roland TR-909 drum machine. [...] "Our Song" [...] features a rewinding guitar sample, looped feedback, and pulsating percussion buildup. It is about the love shared in a friendship; Croft and Sim wrote it to address {{each other and the}} band itself: [...] "We've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before; we're always addressing the songs outward. It's about the function of love and the love of friends. It's important." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E

500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

This is not true! We’ve <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> and we’ve always advocated love without boundaries." [...] On 26 May, they flew out to Moscow {{to take part in}} the Moscow Gay Pride demonstration.|$|E
2500|$|We {{took the}} prisoners {{to the high}} hills above Evin. They were blind-folded and their hands were tied. We got them off the minibus and had them sit on the ground. Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed our comrades, we have decided to execute you—the brain behind those executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I {{do not know whether}} it was Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri who first pulled out a machine gun and started {{shooting}} them. I do not remember whether I was the 4th or 5th person to whom they gave the machine gun. I had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before. At the end, Sa'di Jalil Esfahani [...] shot them in their heads [...]|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Good Morning America, Simon Cowell was asked of the then six American Idol winners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered that Clarkson did [...] "by a mile", noting that she was [...] "up there" [...] with other great singers such as Celine Dion. Esquire wrote that Clarkson has [...] "the best voice {{in the history of}} pop music". Reviewing Stronger, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone states, Clarkson has, [...] "One of music's most remarkable voices." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard considered Clarkson {{as one of the greatest}} singers in pop music." [...] Regarding the controversial practice of lip-syncing, Clarkson claims that she never has, and never will lip-sync, elaborating in {{an interview}} with Cory Myers; [...] "I've actually <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> because I'm terrified, if I ever did that, something horrible would happen, the track would skip. I have a really unhealthy fear about it. So no, I've never done that". Clarkson has earned the title [...] "Queen of Covers" [...] for her ability to perform songs from artists of various genres.|$|E

60|$|That night Janet rubbed mutton tallow on her hands. She had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before--she {{had thought}} it vain and foolish--though Avery did it every night. But that {{afternoon}} on the pond Randall had said something about the beautiful shape of her pretty slender hands. He had never paid her a compliment before. Her hands were brown and a little hard--not soft and white like Avery's. So Janet resorted to the mutton tallow. If one had a scrap of beauty, if only in one's hands, one might as well take care of it.|$|E
