500|$|A cyst of {{the genus}} Azotobacter is the resting form of a {{vegetative}} cell; however, whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive, the cyst of Azotobacter does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors. Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a certain value of pH, temperature, and source of carbon, the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts, which is detected with phase contrast microscopy. Germination of cysts, a slow process, takes about 4–6 h. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin, which were located in the intima (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape. This process is accompanied by metabolic changes. Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source, the cysts begin to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after four hours. The synthesis of proteins and RNA, [...] occurs in parallel, but it intensifies only after five hours after {{the addition of the}} carbon source. The synthesis of DNA and nitrogen fixation are initiated 5 h after the addition of glucose to a <b>nitrogen-free</b> nutrient medium.|$|E

The burn rate modifiers in the mixture may be an alkaline metal nitrate (NO3-) or nitrite (NO2-), dicyanamide or its salts, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), etc. The coolants and slag formers may be e.g. clay, silica, alumina, glass, etc. Other alternatives are e.g. nitrocellulose based propellants (which have high gas yield but bad storage stability, and their oxygen balance requires secondary oxidation of the reaction products to avoid buildup of carbon monoxide), or high-oxygen <b>nitrogen-free</b> organic compounds with inorganic oxidizers (e.g., di or tricarboxylic acids with chlorates (ClO3-) or perchlorates (ClO4-) and eventually metallic oxides; the <b>nitrogen-free</b> formulation avoids formation of toxic nitrogen oxides).|$|E

50|$|Traube {{developed}} a homogeneous {{concept of the}} critical significance of cellular respiration for the generation of heat, formation and maintenance of structures and organ function. From {{his point of view}} biological oxidation takes place not only in the blood but in all tissues. Traube's theory of muscular metabolism is significant because it showed the close relationship between respiration, muscular activity and heat generation, thus contributed to the refutation of Liebig's theory of nutrients. The substrates for creating muscle power were thus primarily <b>nitrogen-free</b> compounds and not just proteins. To investigate the process of enzymatic oxygen activation in organisms Traube did experimental research into inorganic autoxidation and oxygen activation. He thus demonstrated the role of water as active partner in slow oxidations and showed the intermediate character of hydrogen peroxide generation.|$|E

Through these cultures and characterization tests, A. salinestris was found to share many of the general characteristics specific to the species Azotobacter. Originally, A. salinestris colonies were classified as Azotobacter chroococcum, but were later identified as a separate species based on their salt-dependent growth.|$|E
5000|$|Finally the {{countermeasures}} are {{not limited}} to organismal relationships. West et al. found a similar countermeasure against cheating in legume-rhizobium mutualism. In this relationship, nitrogen fixing bacteria rhizobium fixes atmospheric N2 from inside the roots of leguminous plants, providing this essential source of nitrogen to these plants while also receiving organic acids for themselves. However, some bacteria are more mutualistic, while others are more parasitic because they consume the plant’s resources but fixes little to no N2. Moreover, these plants cannot tell whether the bacteria are more or less parasitic until they are settled in the plant nodules. To prevent cheating, these plants {{seem to be able to}} punish the rhizobium bacteria. In a series of experiments, researchers forced non-cooperation between the bacteria and the plants by placing various nodules in <b>nitrogen-free</b> atmosphere.

5000|$|In <b>nitrogen-free</b> {{culture and}} often in symbiosis, Frankia alni {{bacteria}} surround themselves in [...] "vesicles". These are roughly spherical cellular structures that measure {{two to six}} millimetres in diameter and have a laminated lipid envelope. The vesicles serve to limit the diffusion of oxygen, thus assisting the reduction process that is catalysed by the enzyme nitrogenase. This enzyme bonds each atom of nitrogen to three hydrogen atoms, forming ammonia (NH3). The energy for the reaction {{is provided by the}} hydrolysis of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Two other enzymes are also involved in the process, glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase. The final product of the reactions is glutamate, which is thus normally the most abundant free amino acid in the cell cytoplasm. A by-product of the process is gaseous hydrogen, one molecule of which is produced for every molecule of nitrogen reduced to ammonia, but the bacterium also contains the enzyme hydrogenase, which serves to prevent some of this energy being wasted. In the process, ATP is recovered and oxygen molecules serve as the final electron acceptor in the reaction, leading to the lowering of ambient oxygen levels. This is to the benefit of the nitrogenases, which only function anaerobically.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{chemical}} reaction mechanism of fuel combustion, NOx in the diesel emissions is mainly generated from N 2 inside the burning environment of engine cylinder. Taking the gas mixture, O 2 and CO 2, as the intake air, <b>nitrogen-free</b> intake is accessible, and through simulative calculations and experiments, researchers {{can make a}} study of the ignition and combustion performances of the engines. Taking a type of “ 4135 ACa” diesel engine as the research object, the study suggested the following: in the environment of O 2 and CO 2, only when the volume fraction of O 2 reaches 45 % can the engine be ignited and kept running; engine operation became more steady after its O 2 percentage increased to 50 %. There is no NOx emission of engine’s <b>nitrogen-free</b> combustion, despite some black particles in the exhaust gas. So, the bottleneck of “NOx-Soot” emission is successfully transformed into how to optimize the combustion performance of engines. Additionally, through simulative calculations, influences of the O 2 volume fraction on the <b>nitrogen-free</b> combustion performance have been researched; results suggested that it can help promote the burning efficiency with the increase of O 2.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory is {{developing}} a fuel processor for converting liquid hydrocarbon fuels to a hydrogen-rich product suitable for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell stack. The processor uses an autothermal reformer to convert the feed to a mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water with trace quantities of other components. The carbon monoxide in the product gas is then converted to carbon dioxide in water-gas shift and preferential oxidation reactors. Fuels that have been tested include standard and low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels. Iso-octane and n-hexadecane were also examined as surrogates for gasoline and diesel, respectively.

This study showed that the more stable slopes will also have a lower soil saturation level. There was a positive relationship between sizes of bacterial populations with soil saturation level (r 2 = 0. 60, p< 0. 05). Similar correlations were also observed between soil shear strength with soil saturation levels (r 2 = 0. 58, p< 0. 05) as well.

Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the products released from labeled apple fruit cutin showed that the extracellular enzyme released all classes of cutin monomers. This enzyme also catalyzed hydrolysis of the model ester substrates, p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids, and optimal conditions were determined for a spectrophotometric assay with p-nitrophenyl butyrate as the substrate.
