5|$|Santos boxed for {{the vacant}} WBO light-middleweight title against Yori Boy Campas {{in a fight}} that took place at Bally's Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Santos won the fight when referee Joe Cortez intervened in the {{eleventh}} round. During {{the course of the}} fight numerous combinations hurt Campas and cut his face, in the eleventh round following one of Santos' punches Campas informed Cortez that his vision was <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly.</b> At the moment of the fight's conclusion the scores of the judges were 99–91, 97–93 and 99–90 in favor of Santos. On August 17, 2002, Santos defended this championship for a first time against Mehrdud Takaloo, in a fight that also involved the World Boxing Union Light middleweight championship. The event took place in the Cardiff Castle located in Cardiff, Wales. Takaloo began the fight by using his right hand often and on the fourth round he scored a knockdown. As the fight progressed Takaloo began to show signs of exhaustion and Santos managed to have a strong performance {{in the second half of}} the fight. Takaloo received cuts around both of his eyes which made the referee consider stopping the fight twice in the tenth round. When the fight ended Santos won the contest by unanimous decision and the judges' scores were 116–111, 116–112, 117–110.|$|E

25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly.</b> Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel {{on one side of the}} body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E
25|$|Asda {{had also}} heavily {{increased}} prices across its ranges {{to try to}} offset growing operating costs and increase volume sales and margins which had narrowed within its stores, as a result customers deserted the chain in droves. This was compounded by problems with start-up costs and teething troubles with the new regional distribution depots.

500|$|In epilepsy, the {{resistance}} of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly.</b> This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a [...] "seizure focus". Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain.

[...] However premature menopause is more common in premutation carriers than in women with the full mutation, and for premutations with more than 100 repeats the risk of FXPOI begins to decrease. [...] Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is one of three Fragile X-associated Disorders (FXD) caused by changes in the FMR1 gene.FXPOI affects female premutation carriers of Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by the FMR1 gene, when their ovaries are <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly.</b> [...] Women with FXPOI may develop menopause-like symptoms but they are not actually menopausal.

2500|$|Callas's vocal registers, however, {{were not}} {{seamlessly}} joined; Walter Legge writes, [...] "Unfortunately, {{it was only}} in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill." [...] Rodolfo Celletti states, In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would {{go so far as to}} say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Instead of categorizing every {{individual}} into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim {{to identify the}} key language skills or [...] "modules" [...] that are <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly</b> in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or {{with a number of}} modules. This type of approach requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of Max Coltheart identifies a module that recognizes phonemes as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments, each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to the skills/modules where the most significant impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat these skills.|$|E
2500|$|If an {{individual}} experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological {{results can be}} extremely debilitating. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. [...] "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD. In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects {{have to make a}} simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that OCD patients made signiﬁcantly more commission errors than matched panic disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli". Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. Suicidal behavior may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment. In one meta-analysis involving 164 studies, it was discovered that executive dysfunction and higher cognitive inhibition deficit is positively correlated and more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviors. In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), studies of cognitive control have not emphasized the ability to actively suppress pre-potent mental representations. This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of working memory deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on {{an individual}}'s ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. [...] "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under inhibitory deficit theory as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target". When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty [...] "finding" [...] the words they want to use, which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills <b>not</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>properly.</b> Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with depression, ADHD, or OCD indicate.|$|E
