40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the performance limits of electronic chromatic dispersion compensation (EDC) and digital backpropagation (DBP) for a single-channel non-dispersion-managed fiber-optical link. A known analytical method to derive {{the performance of}} the system with EDC is extended to derive a first-order approximation for {{the performance of the}} system with DBP. In contrast to the cubic growth of the variance of the nonlinear <b>noise-like</b> <b>interference,</b> often called nonlinear noise, with input power for EDC, a quadratic growth is observed with DBP using this approximation. Finally, we provide numerical results to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach and compare it with existing analytical models...|$|E
40|$|The imaging {{capability}} of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) could be seriously limited or denied by an electromagnetic <b>noise-like</b> <b>interference</b> signal impinging on the antenna during the synthetic aperture. A Multi-channel SAR (M-SAR), exploiting an antenna nulling based Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) technique, shall {{be able to}} cancel the effects of interferences over the collected SAR data. Since SAR systems often work with wide bandwidths to provide high resolution images, the ECCM technique must account {{for the presence of}} WB interference signal. In this paper we consider a WB antenna nulling technique based on a space-frequency adaptive nulling and we propose an integration of the WB antenna nulling scheme within the focusing algorithm for MSAR systems, thus allowing a fusion between ECCM and usual SAR processing steps...|$|E
40|$|The {{sparsity}} {{which is}} implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain – for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of Compressed-Sensing (CS), images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as <b>noise-like</b> <b>interference.</b> In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A non-linear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this paper, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ 1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multi-slice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3 D contrast enhanced angiography...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, The Digital Microwave Radio is a Point to Multipoint {{communication}} system operating in 1. 4 - 1. 7 GHz frequency range, used for providing Integrated Voice and Data communication among various Entities. The Data Inter face card {{works on the}} principle of Direct sequence – Code division multiple access The Direct sequence – Code division multiple access (DS–CDMA) {{is expected to be the}} major medium access technology in usage for next generation mobile systems owing to its potential capacity enhancement and the robustness against noise. The CDMA is uniquely featured by its spectrum-spreading randomization process employing a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, thus is often called the spread spectrum multiple access (SSMA). As different CDMA users take different PN sequences, each CDMA receiver can discriminate and detect its own signal, by regarding the signals transmitted by other users as <b>noise-like</b> <b>interferences.</b> In this project Direct sequence principle based CDMA transmitter and receiver is implemented in VHDL for FPGA based SOC solutions. The digital frequency synthesizer principle is used in generating the carrier signals both at transmitter and receiver modules...|$|R
40|$|The continual {{demand for}} {{increased}} mobile radio capacity prompts continued {{development of new}} technology to increase system performance. This thesis presents {{an investigation of the}} performance of a generalised linear diversity receiver, as an implementable approximation to the optimum diversity receiver. The receiver utilises space, or antenna, diversity combining to combat the effects of multipath fading experienced in the mobile channel. The receiver is intended for coherent reception of linearly modulated wideband time division multiple access (TDMA) digital transmissions. The receiver structure is also restricted to the linear case. Two major analyses are undertaken in this thesis: the performance of the diversity receiver with finite-length fractionally-spaced branch equalisers, assuming ideal channel-state-information and synchronisation; and the performance of a carrier frequency offset recovery algorithm, assuming only knowledge of the channel autocorrelation function, and burst synchronisation. This thesis presents a general time-varying frequency-selective multipath Rayleigh fading model. The system model includes non-white, non-Gaussian co-channel interferers as well as non-white, but Gaussian co-channel interferers. However, adjacent channel interference is not modelled. Simulation results are presented for the best possible performance (with ideal channel-state-information) of the diversity receiver, showing the effects of diversity and finite equaliser length, and are compared to results for the optimum linear receiver. The results show that increased diversity is very powerful in improving the performance of the receiver, and that the equaliser lengths can be quite short (e. g., 10 taps) and the receiver will still perform close to the optimum. The receiver is shown to be more capable of combating non-Gaussian co-channel interference than Gaussian (or <b>noise-like)</b> <b>interference.</b> The performance of the carrier frequency offset estimator is also determined by simulation. It is found that in most cases, doubling the diversity reduces the error standard deviation by a factor of two or more. The estimator is found to be relatively insensitive to symbol timing, channel delay spread, frequency offset and signal-to-noise ratio, especially with high diversity...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that, {{magnetic}} resonance images (MRIs) with sparsity representation in a transformed domain, e. g. spatial finite-differences (FD), or discrete cosine transform (DCT), can be restored from undersampled k-space via applying current compressive sampling theory. The paper presents a model-based method {{for the restoration of}} MRIs. The reduced-order model, in which a full-system-response is projected onto a subspace of lower dimensionality, has been used to accelerate image reconstruction by reducing the size of the involved linear system. In this paper, the singular value threshold (SVT) technique is applied as a denoising scheme to reduce and select the model order of the inverse Fourier transform image, and to restore multi-slice breast MRIs that have been compressively sampled in k-space. The restored MRIs with SVT for denoising show reduced sampling errors compared to the direct MRI restoration methods via spatial FD, or DCT. Compressive sampling is a technique for finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear systems. The sparsity that is implicit in MRIs is to explore the solution to MRI reconstruction after transformation from significantly undersampled k-space. The challenge, however, is that, since some incoherent artifacts result from the random undersampling, <b>noise-like</b> <b>interference</b> is added to the image with sparse representation. These recovery algorithms in the literature are not capable of fully removing the artifacts. It is necessary to introduce a denoising procedure {{to improve the quality of}} image recovery. This paper applies a singular value threshold algorithm to reduce the model order of image basis functions, which allows further improvement of the quality of image reconstruction with removal of noise artifacts. The principle of the denoising scheme is to reconstruct the sparse MRI matrices optimally with a lower rank via selecting smaller number of dominant singular values. The singular value threshold algorithm is performed by minimizing the nuclear norm of difference between the sampled image and the recovered image. It has been illustrated that this algorithm improves the ability of previous image reconstruction algorithms to remove noise artifacts while significantly improving the quality of MRI recovery. X. X.
