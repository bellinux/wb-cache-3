5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> regimes, competition from introduced western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for tree hollows, inappropriate fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift and lack of tree regeneration due to overgrazing and weeds.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades. The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river, disrupting its <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> but also providing electricity, irrigation, navigability and other benefits to the region.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Creek {{is one of}} {{only two}} streams in Arizona {{included}} in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The creek and its riparian corridor provide habitat {{for a wide variety of}} flora and fauna, some listed as endangered or otherwise imperiled. Its former power-plant complex is listed as a National Historic District. Since restoration of the stream's <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> in 2008, an increase in recreational visits has raised concerns about overuse and has led to road closings and other restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Determinism Fallacy: {{the fallacy}} that {{uncontrollable}} and little understood law-like forces drive the historical succession of institutional systems. However, {{there is no}} <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> of history. We make ourselves and our world, and can do so in any way we choose.|$|E

25|$|However, {{due to the}} {{increased}} flow of industrial waste, untreated sewage and the reduced <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> of the river {{has led to the}} water pollution of this holy river. Several projects have been initiated in order to clean Ganga.|$|E
25|$|Changes to <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> regime {{over the}} past 30 years has reduced wetland availability, {{has led to a}} decline in extent and {{condition}} of flood dependent vegetation, and has caused a reduction in flora and fauna that require specific flow regimes and water availability.|$|E
25|$|The {{major threat}} facing the {{condition}} of the wetlands in Yanga National Park is the alteration of <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> regimes. There has been an overall reduction to flows to this area due to river regulation (dam and weir), water diversion, and alteration of flows within floodplains with levees and structures.|$|E
30|$|This method can {{be applied}} in pumping wells, but it can hardly ever be used in <b>natural</b> <b>flowing</b> wells, since {{it is hard to}} inject liquid {{solvents}} into the flowing wells.|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that the steady-state <b>natural</b> gas <b>flow</b> model (21)â€“(22) would neglect built-in storage capabilities of pipelines (i.e., line pack) and slow travelling speeds of <b>natural</b> gas <b>flows,</b> {{as compared to}} the transient gas flow model [6]. Indeed, it is pointed out in [6] that the steady-state <b>natural</b> gas <b>flow</b> model might result in suboptimal schedules in the short-term coordinated operation of electricity and natural gas infrastructures.|$|R
25|$|The MRTS {{has been}} criticised for {{environmental}} issues during its construction phase, {{due to the}} fact that much of the alignment was built along the banks of the Buckingham Canal. Although the canal itself has been in decline due to fly tipping and sewage the Chennai River Restoration Trust has planned to revitalise and redevelop it. However, a 7.1-km section will remain impassable due to the presence of the MRTS. Another environmental impact caused by the erection of MRTS pillars in the canal is the blocking of the <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> of storm water during rains. This has led to severe stagnation of rainwater in the neighbourhoods adjoining the canal.|$|E
25|$|Even the {{youngest}} children quickly learn that, {{with varying degrees}} of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability {{to the extent that the}} extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{also have}} {{many ways of}} {{indicating}} class distinctions. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving {{the bridge of the}} song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow. Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often homonyms were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended. Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.|$|E
50|$|Foodscaping {{became more}} widely practiced as a {{response}} to high food prices as well as the economic downturn of 2008. Sometimes it requires planting to take advantage of <b>natural</b> <b>flows</b> of water, which is sometimes called waterscaping.|$|R
25|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>flows</b> {{of oil and}} gas led to the {{successful}} early exploration in Alberta's foothills. Those discoveries were not unique, however. Early settlers frequently found oil and gas seeps in Western Canada, generally near rivers, streams and creeks.|$|R
50|$|The Eagle and Phenix Dam is {{now owned}} by the City of Columbus. The dam was {{breached}} during March 2012 in order to restore <b>natural</b> <b>flowing</b> conditions. This was to create an urban whitewater park along the river.|$|R
25|$|When altered flow regimes have {{impacted}} {{riparian zone}} health, re-establishing natural streamflow {{may be the}} best solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems. The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems. However, simply restoring a more <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> regime also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors. Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this too can be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection.|$|E
500|$|Nineteenth-century {{observers}} of the creek reported seeing many naturally occurring travertine dams with deep pools behind them. A study conducted in 1996 identified the eroded remnants of at least 80 such dams. After the creek's <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> was restored in 2008, hundreds of new travertine dams began to form along a [...] stretch below Fossil Springs. About [...] of travertine per day are deposited along the stream. This rate of deposition makes Fossil Creek the fourth largest travertine system in the United States; the three larger systems are Mammoth Hot Springs, Havasu Creek, and Blue Springs of the Little Colorado River.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{development}} of the Stanislaus River began with the Oakdale and South San Joaquin Irrigation Districts, which were created in 1909 under the Wright Act to serve farmers in the area. Early irrigation along the Stanislaus River was dependent on the <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> of the river, which was never enough to water crops during the late summer and fall. In 1926 the two irrigation districts jointly completed the original Melones Dam, a [...] high concrete arch dam with a storage capacity of [...] This reservoir was still not big enough for all the demands placed on it, especially during the long droughts of the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|A water {{treatment}} plant was built on a site named Minnesota Flats near the Iron Mountain Mine, using lime to balance the pH of the acid mine drainage. Water is also diverted from Slickrock Creek to the treatment site. Altogether, over 95 percent of toxins in the water are removed by the treatment process. Roughly [...] of specialized acid-resistant pipeline, with a cost of over US$1 million per mile, {{are included in the}} treatment process. Most water flowing directly from the mine has a pH level close to 1; the âˆ’3.2 pH mentioned earlier is only found in small amounts. Water is further diluted by <b>natural</b> <b>flow</b> in the tributaries and water diverted from nearby Clear Creek, however, the acidic water still requires treatment.|$|E
