By <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which was being assaulted from all sides.

These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to the west for German troops in the centre much more difficult.|$|E

25|$|The Munich Agreement of 1938 {{delayed the}} {{inevitable}} war between Britain and Germany. Munich {{also led to}} many changes in Imperial General Staff policies, among which was the acceptance of a proposal in November from the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre (ISTDC) at Fort Cumberland for amphibious assault procedures and for {{a new type of}} landing craft. Up to this time the Landing Craft Committee had produced some Motor Landing Craft but had not formed procedures for the assault role of these boats. <b>Now</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> specifications for what the new boat must be able to do. It must weigh less than ten long tons, enabling lifting by passenger liner davits. The new craft also had to be built around the load - apart from crew it should carry the thirty-one men of a British Army platoon and five assault engineers or signallers – and be so shallow drafted as to be able to land them, wet only up to their knees, in eighteen inches of water. The troops had to unload quickly. All of these specifications made the LCA personnel carriers; a separate set of requirements were laid down for a vehicle and supplies carrier, although previously the two roles were combined in the Motor Landing Craft.|$|E
25|$|The Presbyterian Church in Korea was {{established}} in 1902. In 1912 the first General Assembly was held. Australian, American, Canadian minister came in increasing number to Korea. During the Japanese occupation the church faced several hardships. The Pyungyang Seminary was forced to close its dors in 1938. Some leaders went into exile. One year later Chosun Seminary was opened in the south, this become the nucleus of KiJang. In contrast with the Pyungyang Seminary the Chosun Seminary adopted a progressive theological line. In 1946 the Presbyterian Church of Korea adopted the Chosun Seminary. The President of the Seminary Dr. Kim Jae-Joon published an essay that caused a violent debate between conservatives and progressive theological positions. Dr. Park Hyung-Ryong {{decided to leave the}} seminary he was followed by 51 students in 1947. The Assembly also recognised this new Seminary. <b>Now</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two competing seminaries under the authority of the General assembly. The Assembly urged to unite these 2 seminaries. Later it become obvious for the Assembly that the theological position of Chosun Seminary could not be tolerated. In 1953 the church faced theological hardships, because of theology, methods and biblical study taught in the Chosun Theological Seminary. The conservative and fundamentalist fraction of the church rejected this teachings. The Presbyterians divided in 1953 to the Presbyterian Church in Korea and the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea.|$|E
25|$|The Allied “Grand Offensive”, {{planned by}} Foch and Haig, now began, the most {{important}} attack being that on the Hindenburg Line. Haig spent 26 September touring senior British Headquarters, contrasting Rawlinson’s optimism with Byng’s caution, and – at Monash’s request – giving a short pep talk and shaking hands with senior officers of the Australian Corps. On that day the Franco-American attack began in the Meuse-Argonne, then on 27 September British First and Third Armies attacked. First Army, which included the Canadian Corps, had to cross three trench systems and the Canal du Nord (dry but 100 feet wide), pinning many German reserves in five days of hard fighting and in due course penetrating 6 miles over a 12 mile front and taking 10,000 prisoners. On 28 September the Flanders Army Group (GAF) attacked in Flanders, eventually advancing six miles and almost reaching Roulers, which had been the immediate objective of the Third Ypres Offensive the previous autumn. On 29 September Fourth Army attacked, including the famous crossing of the St Quentin Canal (35 feet wide and 6 feet deep) by 46th Division, part of IX Corps, the men using lifebelts taken from Channel Ferries, after a mustard gas bombardment. Fourth Army was attacking forces of roughly equal strength, with the Australians (including the US 27th and 30th Divisions) covered by 1,488 guns and massed Vickers Guns. Rawlinson’s artillery density was equal only to that of 1 July 1916 but infantry had more organic firepower <b>now.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> conflicting reports {{as to whether the}} US II Corps had captured the crossing over Bellincourt Tunnel (where the canal disappeared underground) – when asked for guidance by Monash, Haig ordered that his own attack must proceed as planned, even if American troops were killed by friendly fire. A cavalry brigade commanded by Haig’s cousin, Brigadier-General Neil Haig, was briefly committed to dismount and fight as infantry. By early October Fourth Army was through the Beaurevoir (German Reserve) Line and into open country. In late September Bulgaria sought an armistice, which also contributed to Ludendorff wanting an end to the war.|$|E
