40|$|This paper {{addresses}} one of {{the central}} problems of contract law, a puzzle that has troubled generations of contracts scholars: Why do we only enforce promises backed by consideration? Or, how can we justify insisting on the bargain context, but not requiring that the bargains be adequate? The lack of a theoretical solution to this puzzle has plagued the application of the consideration doctrine in courts of law. We resolve this paradox through two innovations. First, using a game theory model based on asymmetric information, we dispute the common wisdom that the law should honor parties’ intentions as articulated at the time of contract formation. We show how parties’ expressed intentions may not conform to their underlying desires. Crucially, the mere fact that parties take advantage of a legally binding option does not imply that they desire the existence of that option. When courts create an option for the legal enforcement of promises, parties can essentially be forced into exercising that option. How then can the law determine which promises to enforce? Our second innovation shows how social norms against commodification limit the availability of the consideration form. Where previous scholarship has assumed that anyone so wishing can invoke <b>nominal</b> <b>consideration,</b> we argue that anti-commodification norms make even <b>nominal</b> <b>consideration</b> unavailable within certain social contexts. Moreover, the contexts in which norms block the use of consideration are precisely the circumstances where creating a legally binding option would be most likely to harm both promisors and promisees. Ultimately, what matters is not whether the parties actually do offer consideration, but rather whether they can voice consideration. Only when norms allow the use of consideration should we conclude that parties truly desire the option to have their promises legally enforced...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{traditional}} consideration doctrine, a promise is only legally enforceable {{if it is}} made in exchange for something of value. This doctrine {{lies at the heart}} of contract law, yet it lacks a sound theoretical justification – a fact that has confounded generations of scholars and created a mess of case law. This paper argues that the failure of traditional justifications for the doctrine comes from two mistaken assumptions. First, previous scholars have assumed that anyone can back a promise with <b>nominal</b> <b>consideration</b> if they wish to do so. We show how social norms against commodification limit the availability of the consideration form. Some promises are made in social contexts in which invoking consideration—that is, exchanging a promise in return for something of value—violates social taboos. Specifically, we show that anti-commodification taboos operate where the social message sent by a transaction is more important than the desire to transfer goods or services. Whereas previous scholarship has assumed one can always invoke consideration, we argue that anti-commodification norms make even <b>nominal</b> <b>consideration</b> unavailable within these contexts. Second, scholars have assumed that when parties utilize a formalism—such as nominal consideration—to make their promises legally binding, they necessarily desire to be bound. Using a game-theoretic model based on asymmetric information, we dispute the conventional wisdom that the law should honor parties’ intentions as articulated at the time of contract formation. We show how parties’ expressed intentions may not conform to their underlying desires. A promisor may render her promise legally enforceable—even though she does not want to—in order to signal her sincerity to the promisee. As a result, in a cycle of inefficient signaling, other promisors may feel forced to do the same. Thus, the mere fact that parties take advantage of a legally binding form does not imply that they desire the existence of that option. Having the option to legally enforce a promise may harm both promisors and promisees. Having exposed these two flawed assumptions, we provide a new framework for determining which promises the law should enforce. Ultimately, what matters is not whether the parties actually do invoke consideration, but rather whether they can invoke consideration. Norms prevent parties from invoking consideration where the social message sent by a promise is more important than the substance of the transaction—and these are precisely the types of promises in which inefficient signaling is likely to occur. In other words, norms block the use of consideration precisely where the option for legal enforcement of promises is most likely to harm both promisors and promisees. Therefore, only when social norms allow the use of consideration should we conclude that parties truly desire the option to have their promises legally enforced...|$|R
5000|$|A {{tenancy at will}} is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no formal lease, the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a tenancy at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a <b>nominal</b> <b>consideration</b> may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} empirical {{study of}} {{whether there was a}} misalignment of the real exchange rate (RER) in the Bangladesh economy during 1976 - 1991. The time series of multilateral and bilateral RER indexes were computed for the period 1976 - 1991. The computed series of RER were indexed to a base year of when the RER attained its highest level and thereby appeared to be closer to the actual long-run equilibrium RER. In the empirical part of this thesis, five different RER indexes were computed: multilateral real exchange rate index 1 (MRER 1), multilateral real exchange rate index 2 (MRER 2), bilateral real exchange index 1 (BRER 1), bilateral real exchange rate index 2 (BRER 2), and black market bilateral exchange rate index 1 (BMRER 1). Computation of the multilateral and bilateral RER indexes involved data on trade weights and wholesale and consumer price indexes of the domestic economy and its trading partners, besides their nominal official exchange rates. As a result, the study period was not large enough due to the unavailability of data on all variables involved. Misalignment of RER refers to the sustained deviation of the observed RER from its long-run equilibrium level. Three different measures of RER misalignment were constructed: purchasing power parity (RERMISPP), instability (RERMISINSTA), and black market (RERMISBLK). The MRER 1, BRER 2, and BMRER 1 indexes were used respectively, in contrasting RERMISPP, RERMISINSTA, and RERMISBLK measures of RER misalignment. All of these measures demonstrated RER misalignment in Bangladesh during 1976 - 1991. In order to compute the long-run equilibrium RER, a multivariate regression was executed with respect to the RER fundamental real variables. Later, a time series of three different measures of RER misalignment index was regressed on the time series of the growth rate of real GDP (gross domestic product), exports, imports, savings, and investment for 1976 - 1991 to bring about the effects of RER misalignment on the macroeconomic performance of Bangladesh. It was found that RER misalignment adversely affected the macroeconomic performance of Bangladesh. An effectiveness index of nominal devaluation as a preventive policy eroded in later years. Consequently, a cross episode regression was executed to appraise the efficacy of 10 nominal devaluation episodes. It was found that when supplementary macroeconomic policies, such as the growth rate of domestic credit, growth rate of domestic credit to the public sector, and the growth rate in the ratio of public sector to total domestic credit were taken into <b>consideration,</b> <b>nominal</b> devaluation became more effective in bringing about the real devaluation...|$|R

Increasingly we find that "smart" sensors are being planned for future space missions which will search for specific unusual phenomena and, when present, record these phenomena in great detail. This {{gives rise to the}} need for a widely varying bandwidth requirement from each instrument in response to the occurrence of phenomena that cannot be anticipated in advance. An asynchronously multiplexed packet telemetry concept is described which, within broad limits, permits instruments to acquire and transmit information at the rate appropriate for the experimental phenomena being observed. Data from a single instrument, along with the necessary ancillary data (typically time, position, and attitude), will be assembled into self-contained packets and will be subsequently transmitted over various communications links (i. e., space telemetry channel, ground communications circuits, etc.) to the experimenter's facility in near real time. Reliable error control coding will be included in each link transmission to protect the integrity of the data packets. A major objective is to make the entire data acquisition and distribution process completely transparent to the experimenter {{in the sense that the}} output terminal of the distribution system will be physically, logically, and electrically identical to that of the experiment output channel.

This dissertation investigates the development of advanced design techniques for nonlinear controllers and observers for a synchronous generator. The primary objective of the control system in this application is to asymptotically track the nominal terminal voltage and frequency, and to improve the stability and dynamic performance {{in the presence of}} both small and large disturbances. New schemes for designing nonlinear controllers and observers for the synchronous generator are introduced using the concepts and methods from differential geometry and neural network theory. Nonlinear transformation using differential geometry methods is a promising approach to the control of nonlinear systems. The differential geometry-based nonlinear controllers are developed for the synchronous generator and these control schemes are tested on different order models. The initial controller design is conducted based on a <b>nominal</b> load <b>consideration.</b> Later, on-line stabilization which consists of updating the controller parameters is conducted to compensate for the load variations. Differential geometry concepts are use to develop a new nonlinear observer for a synchronous generator that has the ability to handle large transients. The investigation conducted here also includes other kinds of nonlinear observers and compares them with their linear counterparts for different fault clearing times. A software program using symbolic manipulations is developed to help the user, who may not be familiar with differential geometry, to design a nonlinear observer for both single and multi-output models of the synchronous generator. Neural networks provide a solution to interesting identification and control problems. Their parallel nature assures a fast adaptation to the system under control. A new control scheme is developed to adaptively control the frequency and voltage of a synchronous generator using neural networks. Dynamic neural networks whose parameters are identified via a supervised learning procedure are used as approximators to the nonlinear map given by the system input-output data. The trained neural network is then used for the design of the adaptive control scheme. The performance of these newly developed controller and observer schemes are examined in detail for several different cases. It is shown that the presently designed controllers and the observer provide an improved performance when compared with the existing design procedures...|$|R
