This work presents {{a good candidate for}} conductive inks based on a graphene/polymer <b>nanocomposite</b> <b>material</b> that gathers three main benefits that are 1 - neither clogging nor flocculation, 2 - spontaneous film formation around room temperature, 3 - high conductivity. Nanosized Multilayered Graphene (NMG) is produced through a solvent-free procedure, using a grinding process in water.
