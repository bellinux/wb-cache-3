2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The <b>normal</b> <b>strain</b> level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage.|$|E

40|$|The {{mutator gene}} DEL 1 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes {{a high rate}} of {{formation}} of multisite mutations that encompass the following three adjacent genes: CYC 1, which determines the structure of iso- 1 -cytochrome c; RAD 7, which controls UV sensitivity; and OSM 1, which controls osomotic sensitivity. The simplest hypothesis is that these multisite mutations are deletions, although it has not been excluded that they may involve other types of gross chromosomal aberrations. In contrast, <b>normal</b> <b>strains</b> do not produce such multisite mutations even after mutagenic treatments. —The multisite mutations arise at a rate of approximately 10 - 5 to 10 - 6 per cell per division in DEL 1 strains, which is much higher than rates observed for mutation of genes in <b>normal</b> <b>strains.</b> For example, <b>normal</b> <b>strains</b> produce all types of cyc 1 mutants at a low rate of approximately 10 - 8 to 10 - 9. No evidence for multisite mutations was obtained upon analysis of numerous spontaneous ade 1, ade 2, met 2 and met 15 mutants isolated in a DEL 1 strain. DEL 1 segregates as a single Mendelian gene closely linked to the CYC 1 locus. DEL 1 appears to be both cis- and trans-dominant. The location of the DEL 1 gene and the lack of effect on other genes suggest that the mutator acts only on a region adjacent to itself...|$|R

As SXT inhibits the synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid, which acts as a cofactor for thymidylate synthase (thyA), the survival of TD-SCVs depends exclusively {{on the availability of}} external thymidine. Since the underlying mechanism for thymidine dependency is unknown, we investigated if alterations in the thyA nucleotide sequences were responsible for this phenomenon. Sequence analysis of several clinical TD-SCVs and their isogenic <b>normal</b> <b>strains</b> with reference to previously published S. aureus thyA nucleotide sequences was performed. Three clinical TD-SCVs were complemented by transforming TD-SCVs with the vector pCX 19 expressing ThyA from S. aureus 8325 - 4. Transcriptional analysis of metabolic and virulence genes and regulators (agr, hla, spa, citB, thyA, and nupC) was performed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The previously published sequences of thyA and two <b>normal</b> clinical <b>strains</b> were highly conserved, while thyA of four <b>normal</b> <b>strains</b> and four SCVs had nonsynonymous point mutations. In 8 / 10 SCVs, deletions occurred, resulting in stop codons which were located in 4 / 10 SCVs close to or within the active site of the protein (dUMP binding). Complementation of TD-SCVs with thyA almost fully reversed the phenotype, growth characteristics, and transcription patterns. In conclusion, we demonstrated that mutations of the thyA gene were responsible for the phenotype of TD-SCVs. Complementation of TD-SCVs with thyA revealed that a functional ThyA protein is necessary and sufficient to change the SCV phenotype and behavior back to normal...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{one of the}} first {{high-speed}} particle image velocimetry measurements to quantify flame-turbulence interaction in centrally-ignited constant-pressure premixed flames expanding in nearisotropic turbulence. Measurements of mean flow velocity and rms of fluctuating flow velocity are provided over a range of conditions both in the presence and absence of the flame. The distributions of stretch rate contributions from different terms such as tangential <b>straining,</b> <b>normal</b> <b>straining</b> and curvature are also provided. It is found that the <b>normal</b> <b>straining</b> displays non-Gaussian pdf tails whereas the tangential straining shows near Gaussian behavior. We have further tracked the motion of the edge points that reside and co-move with the edge of the flame kernel during its evolution in time, and found that within the measurement conditions, on average the persistence time scales of stretch due to pure curvature exceed that due to tangential straining by at least a factor of two.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} in vitro the magnitude, nature, and regulation of spontaneous and mitogen-induced Ig secretion by splenic lymphocytes from several autoimmune murine strains (NZB, NZB X W, MRL/l BXSB) and appropriate, normal mice. All autoimmune strains had increased numbers of mature splenic B lymphocytes, which secreted and/or contained Ig, compared to age-matched <b>normal</b> <b>strains.</b> In NZB and NZB X W mice, the high frequency of mature B cells was apparent early in life, whereas in MRL/l and BXSB mice {{it was first}} noted shortly before the clinical onset of disease. Spleen cells from young autoimmune mice of all four strains secreted predominantly IgM, but with aging {{and the appearance of}} disease, the cells switched to IgG secretion predominantly. In contrast, spleen cells from normal mice were predominantly IgM, but with aging and the appearance of disease, the cells switched to IgG secretion predominantly. In contrast, spleen cells from normal mice were predominantly IgM secretors throughout the animals' lives. Approximately 15 % of the total Ig-secreting cells in older NZB, NZB X W, and MRL mice were committed to secretion of anti-ssDNA antibodies. In both autoimmune and normal spleen cells, the B-cell population alone contained fewer secreting cells than the total lymphocyte population, indicating that T cells were required to achieve maximal levels of plaque-forming cells. Spleen cells of NZB and NZB X W mice had a greater response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than other autoimmune and <b>normal</b> <b>strains.</b> Responsiveness to LPS, as measured by the frequency of induced Ig-secreting cells, was considerably diminished with age and onset of disease in all autoimmune but not in <b>normal</b> <b>strains.</b> LPS- induced Ig secretion by B cells of autoimmune and normal mice was subject to regulation by splenic T cells. No significant differences were observed between concanavalin-A (Con A) stimulated spleen cells from young and older autoimmune mice and <b>normal</b> control <b>strains</b> in effectively suppressing spontaneous and LPS-induced Ig secretion. Moreover, B cells from autoimmune mice and from <b>normal</b> <b>strains</b> were equally receptive to Con A-induced suppressor signals. T cells from young and older NZB and BXSB mice added to a standard number of B cells from syngeneic young mice provided equal help in enhancing LPS-induced Ig secretion, and this help in turn was equivalent to that provided by T cells from normal mice of the same H- 2 haplotype. The exception was the MRL/l strain; T cells from older animals provided considerably more help than T cells from young MRL/l or T cells from young and older H- 2 - compatible normal mice...|$|R
