Reznor also revealed that Nine Inch <b>Nails</b> would likely distribute any future material independently. Following the announcement, Nine Inch <b>Nails</b> released the 36-track instrumental album Ghosts I–IV in March, 2008 on Reznor's independent label The Null Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the <b>nails</b> and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe <b>nails.</b> Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the <b>nails</b> (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the <b>nails</b> known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E

5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of <b>nails</b> were made, lath <b>nails,</b> slate <b>nails,</b> thatching <b>nails</b> and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

40|$|Background: Proximal <b>nail</b> fold {{inflammation}} can {{be caused}} by many diseases and has not previously been recognized as a result of posterior embedding of the <b>nail.</b> We describe a new pattern of ingrowth that we have termed retronychia (‘‘retro’’—Latin for backwards; ‘‘onychia’’—Greek for <b>nail).</b> The term describes a combination of proximal <b>nail</b> plate ingrowth into the proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is associated with multiple generations of <b>nail</b> plate misaligned beneath the proximal <b>nail.</b> Objective: To describe a new pattern of <b>nail</b> ingrowth which causes a specific form of proximal <b>nail</b> fold paronychia. Methods: Collective cases were reported to a European <b>Nail</b> Society expert group. Results: Persistent proximal <b>nail</b> fold inflammation can result from an episode of trauma that disturbs longitudinal <b>nail</b> growth and results in reverse embedding of the <b>nail</b> plate. This can cause pain, inflammation, and granulation tissue formation, and is typically relieved by avulsion and antiinflammatory treatment. Limitations: We cannot demonstrate causality between the proposed precipitants and the clinical features. Conclusion: Retroncyhia represents proximal ingrowth of the <b>nail</b> that occurs when the <b>nail</b> embeds backwards into the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. <b>Nail</b> plate avulsion with supplementary medical management is curative.

40|$|The <b>nail</b> unit is {{constructed}} by distinctly regulated components. The <b>nail</b> isthmus is a lately proposed {{region as a}} transitional zone between the most distal part of the <b>nail</b> bed and the hyponychium.

40|$|The <b>nail</b> {{plate is}} the {{permanent}} {{product of the}} <b>nail</b> matrix. Its normal appearance and growth depend on the integrity of several components: the surrounding tissues or perionychium and the bony phalanx that are contributing to the <b>nail</b> apparatus or <b>nail</b> unit. The <b>nail</b> is inserted proximally in an invagination practically parallel to the upper surface of the skin and laterally in the lateral <b>nail</b> grooves. This pocket-like invagination has a roof, the proximal <b>nail</b> fold and a floor, the matrix from which the <b>nail</b> is derived. The germinal matrix forms {{the bulk of the}} <b>nail</b> plate. The proximal element forms the superficial third of the <b>nail</b> whereas the distal element provides its inferior two-thirds. The ventral surface of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold adheres closely to the <b>nail</b> for a short distance and forms a gradually desquamating tissue, the cuticle, made of the stratum corneum of both the dorsal and the ventral side of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. The cuticle seals and therefore protects the ungual cul-de-sac. The <b>nail</b> plate is bordered by the proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is continuous with the similarly structured lateral <b>nail</b> fold on each side. The <b>nail</b> bed extends from the lunula to the hyponychium. It presents with parallel longitudinal rete ridges. This area, by contrast to the matrix has a firm attachment to the <b>nail</b> plate and <b>nail</b> avulsion produces a denudation of the <b>nail</b> bed. Colourless, but translucent, the highly vascular connective tissue containing glomus organs transmits a pink colour through the <b>nail.</b> Among its multiple functions, the <b>nail</b> provides counterpressure to the pulp that is essential to the tactile sensation involving the fingers and to the prevention of the hypertrophy of the distal wall tissue, produced after <b>nail</b> loss of the great toe <b>nail.</b> Journal ArticleFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of <b>nails</b> using small trip hammers. The <b>nails</b> were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell <b>nails</b> to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Nine Inch <b>Nails</b> {{began the}} Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, {{in which they}} toured North America as an opening act for {{alternative}} rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

30|$|In {{all other}} cases, the <b>nail</b> bed may be raised and {{evaluated}} under magnification {{in order to}} carefully examine the characteristic of the lesion. If only the sterile matrix is damaged, the <b>nail</b> should be left attached proximally in the <b>nail</b> fold. When the <b>nail</b> germinal matrix is also involved, the entire <b>nail</b> should be detached by making two incisions on the lateral side of the <b>nail</b> fold. The <b>nail</b> should be left attached distally when dislocation of the proximal part of the <b>nail</b> occurs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nail</b> {{diseases}} have {{a negative}} impact on quality of life both by causing esthetic concerns and functional disturbances.

30|$|Optical means {{magnification}} and a 6 - 0 or 7 - 0 nonchromic absorbable monofilament {{are necessary}} for nail-bed sutures. The <b>nail</b> is raised by using scissors or a delicate spatula starting under the free edge of the <b>nail.</b> It is carefully detached from the <b>nail</b> bed and, if necessary, the <b>nail</b> {{is removed from the}} <b>nail</b> fold by rotational movements [5]. The <b>nail</b> will be preserved and replaced like a biological dressing. This has different functions: to shape to the nail-bed fragments, to avoid adhesion between the roof and the <b>nail</b> bed, to support a possible associated fracture, like a splint, to decrease postoperative pain, and to improve tactile sensation during the healing period. Before replacing the <b>nail,</b> a few holes should be made to allow blood drainage. The <b>nail</b> should be firmly fixed {{at the end of the}} operation. Good insertion of the <b>nail</b> base into the sack bottom of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold is very important to prevent a dead space that may cause adherence between the <b>nail</b> matrix and eponychium and subsequent ungual dystrophy. To hold the <b>nail</b> into the <b>nail</b> fold, an X suture is preferable, avoiding passage through the <b>nail</b> bed with a U suture [6, 7]. While the new fingernail is growing, the <b>nail</b> used as a splint will be pushed off and substituted in 1 – 3  months. It is desirable not to remove the <b>nail</b> or the substitute so as to prevent the <b>nail</b> bed drying our. Steri-Strips may help keep the <b>nail</b> in situ during fingernail regrowth.|$|R
