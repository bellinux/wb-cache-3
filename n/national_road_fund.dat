CC has been implementing pavement performance modelling (PPM) for its sealed road network for the past 5 years. The implementation process has included: information improvement plans, Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) site set-up and monitoring plans, sub-network level model calibration, and investigation into varying funding levels and the long-term impact on network condition. The outputs from the pavement model can now be confidently used as part of the overall process in justifying funding from LTNZ.

5|$|The first road in {{the region}} was the Buffalo Trace, an old bison trail that ran from the Falls of the Ohio to Vincennes. After the capitol was {{relocated}} to Corydon, several local roads were created to connect the new capitol to the Ohio River at Mauckport and to New Albany. The first major {{road in the}} state was the <b>National</b> <b>Road,</b> a project <b>funded</b> by the federal government. The road entered Indiana in 1829, connecting Richmond, Indianapolis, and Terre Haute with the eastern states and eventually Illinois and Missouri in the west. The state adopted the advanced methods used to build the <b>national</b> <b>road</b> on a statewide basis and began {{to build a new}} road network that was usable year-round. The North-South Michigan Road was built in the 1830s, connecting Michigan and Kentucky and passing through Indianapolis in the middle. These two new roads were roughly perpendicular within the state and served as the foundation for a road system to encompass all of Indiana.|$|R

By 1834 the {{opposition}} the canal had disappeared and the project was being constructed at little cost to the state and was proving to be profitable, so the General Assembly granted funds to the project to connect it to Lafayette. To fund the project, and in response to the closure of the Second Bank of the United States, the state established the Bank of Indiana. Bonds were issued through the bank who then sold them to creditors in London to fund the early stages of the project, but it soon became apparent that it would take far more funds than could be obtained by the bank bonds alone.|$|R
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Road,</b> {{the first}} <b>road</b> <b>funded</b> by the U.S. federal government, was {{authorized}} by the United States Congress in 1806, and ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Vandalia, Illinois. Construction started in 1811, and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia. Many sites from the <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> remain along Alt US40, in particular the LaVale toll gate house, built in 1836. Following {{the completion of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> in 1837, the federal government ceded the road to the states to operate as a toll road, and toll gate houses such as the one in LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer. Tolls continued to be collected along the <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century. The LaVale toll house is {{the first of its kind}} to be built along the <b>National</b> <b>Road,</b> and it is the last standing toll house along the <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> in Maryland.

40|$|Private-ownership {{of roads}} in Nigeria {{is still at}} the {{deliberation}} stage. In other words roads (tarred and untarred) are owned by Federal, State and Local authorities in Nigeria. Most of these roads, however, share a common characteristic of being “unsafe at any speed”, {{at any time of}} the day. This is {{as a result of the}} low quality of the road components, structures and patterns. For example, road surfaces are undulating and rough. Also, the poor standard of road infrastructure like guard railings/barriers; pavement marking and signs; illumination levels, traffic signals, horizontal/vertical alignment and sight lines contribute largely to the increasing carnage on Nigerian road network. This trend persists because authorities in Nigeria have practically relegated to the background regular road safety audit operations. This is an inevitable aspect of modern methods of road administration and management, which determines a number of traffic potentials concerning highway high collision locations; protection of errant vehicles from light poles, trees, ditches, replacement of damaged and missing signs, street lighting, capacity and level of service analysis. Finally, this paper suggests commissioning of a <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> Research <b>Fund,</b> with a view to developing an efficient road safety audit operational system. Also, the introduction of private initiatives and a Community-based Approach in road administration, as well as decentralization of road administration framework at all levels, will greatly help “engineer out” potentially unsafe features across Nigerian roads, towards a better road traffic environment in the 21 st century...|$|R
