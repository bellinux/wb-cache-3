The same sulfide reacted with isopropylmagnesium and cyclohexylmagnesium bromides {{in the presence of}} anhydrous nickel dichloride and triphenylphosphine to produce t-butyl-benzene. With ethylmagnesium bromide t-butylbenzene and p-t-ethylbutylbenzene were produced. p-t-Butylthiophenol afforded t-butylbenzene as the sole product, when treated with isopropylmagnesium <b>bromide,</b> <b>nickel</b> dichloride and triphenylphosphine, and t-butylbenzene as the major product, when treated with isopropylmagnesium bromide and (1, 3 -diphenylphosphinopropane) nickel dichloride.

40|$|The {{oxidative}} addition of highly reactive zinc (Zn*) to organic bromides shows pronounced structure-reactivity dependence, {{in contrast to}} that shown by magnesium. The kinetic and LFER studies conducted suggest a mechanism in which electron transfer is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Experiments carried out with radical clocks and stereochemical investigations support the presence of radicals. The reactivity profiles suggest that the electron transfer occurs in the normal Marcus region. In the case of aryl bromides, Hammett plots are consistent with participation of aryl halide radical anions as intermediates and again show a qualitative adherence to Marcus theory. The reaction proposed here {{can be described as}} another example of radical mediated selective reaction, and it has straightforward synthetic applications. ^ While there are other examples in the literature of the addition of dialkyl zinc reagents, organozinc cuprates, and allylic organozinc halides to imines, to our knowledge we report here the first addition of a non-allylic organozinc halide across a carbon-nitrogen double bond. Addition of organozinc halides to N-benzyl bensensulfonimine with a copper catalyst under mild conditions gives the corresponding sulfonamide. Alkyl, ester, cyclic, vinylic, and heterocyclic organozincs give moderate to good yields, but best results are obtained with benzylic organozinc species. This type of reaction is currently limited to sulfonimines and is not successful with other carbon-nitrogen double bonds. ^ The {{oxidative addition}} of highly reactive <b>nickel</b> to organic <b>bromides</b> shows only slight structure-reactivity dependence. This is in contrast to the behavior shown by oxidative addition of nickel (0) complexes and is counter to what Marcus theory predicts comparative to zinc. The Hammett relationship is determined for the addition of active nickel and the anomalous behavior is attributed to surface effects involving precursor complex formation, the activated complex, and temperature. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of methyl methacrylate from propylene through methylacetylene was in-vestigated. The {{synthesis of}} methylacetylene was attempted by thermal dehydrogenation (pyrolysis) of propylene. High temperature (1200 - 1300 °C), short contact time (millisec. order; conversions below 30 %), and low pressure (below 100 mm.) {{were found to}} be required for obtaining good yields of methylacetylene-allene. The 32 - 38 % yields of methylacetylene-allene on the basis of propylene pyrolyzed were obtained under best conditions. A free-radical mechanism was proposed for the pyrolysis to account for the experimental results. The synthe-sis of methyl methacrylate was performed by the carboxylation reaction of methylacetylene. The reaction was studied by both stoichiometric and catalytic processes. Stoichiometric process has been studied in the reaction carried out under pressure. The best total yield of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid was 49 % based on the methylacetylene consumed (66 % based on the nickel carbonyl used). As a catalytic process, the reaction proceeded fairly smooth-ly at 170 - 180 °C and about 10 atm. partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the presence of triphenylphosphine <b>nickel</b> <b>bromide</b> complexes (47 % total yield) or nickel carbonyl-water (46 % total yield).

The structure of this compound has been confirmed by comparison of its spectral data {{with that of the}} synthesised isomer, 4,l 0 -dihydro- 7, 8 -dimethyl 10 H-benzof 4, 5 Jcycloheptafl, 2 -bJ furan. Homosesquirosefuran, an analogue of the naturally occurring furanosesquiterpene Sesquirosefuran, has been synthesised via the dianion of methylacetoacetate. An approach to the synthesis of Pinguisone (a component of the essential oil of the liverwort Aneura pinguis) has been attempted employing two Diels-Alder reactions to generate the four cis-methyl groups found in the natural product.

40|$|The {{structures}} of molten nickel chloride, <b>nickel</b> <b>bromide</b> and nickel iodide {{have been investigated}} by applying the technique of neutron diffraction to isotopically enriched samples. The three partial structure factors and corresponding radial distribution functions which characterize the structure have been determined from the experimental data. Both steady state and pulsed neutron sources {{have been used for}} the diffraction experiments; the latter employing time-of-flight techniques. A high temperature furnace was designed for the pulsed neutron experiments and this is described. The steady state experiments used existing furnaces. The data analysis and correction procedures for both types of experiment are discussed. In conjunction with earlier studies of molten divalent chlorides, the results show that whilst the gross structural features of these 2 : 1 molten salts are consistent with a rigid ion model, the electronic structure of the cation appears {{to play an important role}} in determining the detailed structure. The results emphasize the importance of ionicity and charge transfer effects and the need to take these into account in model interaction potentials. A model, based on observations of the solid state, and consistent with the results presented in this thesis is discussed in which the net transfer of charge is proportional to the electronegativity of the anion. The nickel ion in molten nickel iodide appears to be considerably more mobile than in the other nickel halides. Some suggestions are made for further work to determine the mobility of the nickel ion and to test the proposed model for these systems...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{impurities}} and defects modify {{surface chemistry}} {{and structure of}} transition metal oxides is important from a fundamental science perspective and for oxides continued use in industry. Transition metal oxide surfaces Co 3 O 4 (110) and NiO(100) were studied with complementary surface sensitive techniques, including low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), {{to determine the effects}} of impurities and defects on their chemical, physical, and electronic properties. ^ Co 3 O 4 (110) spinel AES and XPS spectra are consistent with previous stoichiometric powder and thin film Co 3 O 4 spinel surfaces and with other cobalt containing spinels. The first published LEED patterns are reported here in, and reveal Type A bulk termination in which octahedral and tetrahedral cation sites are occupied by 3 + and 2 + cobalt cations, respectively. Extended annealing allows the elemental impurities Ca 2 +, K+, Na+, and Cu 1 + to segregate to the surface, and the copper impurity in particular reduces the spinel surface to a rocksalt CoO-like surface. The copper impurity induces a Cu 2 O(110) phase-separation overlayer on the cobalt oxide spinel surface. The Co 3 O 4 (110) substrate cannot be fully re-oxidized to the spinel stoichiometry until all detectable copper is removed from the surface. ^ Low-coordinate transition metal oxide defects were modeled using two different vicinally-cut NiO(100) that resulted in periodic monoatomic stepped substrates with six-atom and seven-atom terrace widths. The AES and XPS spectra are consistent with previous stoichiometric single crystals, powders, and thin film surfaces. LEED shows a characteristic (1 x 1) diffraction pattern for the non-stepped surface and a characteristic spot-splitting diffraction feature for the stepped surfaces correlating to the appropriate step terrace width. ^ TPD probed the surface reactivity of the NiO-bromobenzene (C 6 H 5 Br) adsorbate. A molecularly adsorbed monolayer species desorbs at 169 K for the nonstepped surface and 180 K for the stepped surfaces. The multilayer adsorbate state desorbs from 174 K to 188 K depending upon coverage. A final surface species, observed only on the stepped surfaces, desorbs at 145 K by two pathways. At low coverages dehalogenation occurs resulting in adsorbed bromine, and when these adsorbate sites are saturated, molecular desorption of bromobenzene is then observed. ^ Bromine that remains on the non-stepped and stepped NiO(100) surfaces from dehalogenation appears as <b>nickel</b> <b>bromide</b> determined by the Br 3 p XPS peak with the concentration of bromine higher on the stepped surfaces than on the non-stepped surface. On the non-stepped surface bromobenzene is adsorbed “flat” with the benzene ring parallel to the surface to ensure maximum contact between the molecule and the NiO substrate. The step terraces, however, are too short to easily accommodate this geometry easily and the molecule tilts to fit the step geometry, allowing more bromobenzene to adsorb. Some interaction with the step edge is also most likely important in determining the new adsorbate geometry. ...|$|E
