5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players {{may decide to}} play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the {{previous}} game). Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission. Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and mines—all of which are upgradable. Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades. Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings. Players can choose whether to play stealthily or <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> finish the game without taking a life. Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.|$|E

The knotted gag is able to soak up the saliva that the ball gag does <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> be easily washed for reuse. Knots can be doubled or tripled to fit the size of the gagged person's mouth.|$|E

500|$|Stone {{went with}} her {{daughter}} to Chicago in May, 1893 and gave her last public speeches at the World's Congress of Representative Women where she saw a strong international involvement in women's congresses, with almost 500 women from 27 countries speaking at 81 meetings, and attendance topping 150,000 at the week-long event. Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled [...] "The Progress of Fifty Years" [...] wherein she described the milestones of change, and said [...] "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> never know at what price their {{right to free speech}} and to speak at all in public has been earned." [...] Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and Abigail Scott Duniway to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas. Stone and her daughter returned home to Pope's Hill on May 28.|$|E

6000|$|A {{doctrine}} {{more precisely}} {{the reverse of}} the Volitional theory of [...] causation can not well be imagined. The Volitional theory is, that [...] we know by intuition or by direct experience the action of our own [...] mental volitions on matter; that we may hence infer all other [...] action upon matter {{to be that of}} volition, and might thus know, [...] without any other evidence, that matter is under the government of [...] a Divine Mind. Leibnitz and the Cartesians, on the contrary, [...] maintain that our volitions do <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not act upon matter, [...] and that it is only the existence of an all-governing Being, and [...] that Being omnipotent, which can account for the sequence between [...] our volitions and our bodily actions. When we consider that each [...] of these two theories, which, as theories of causation, stand at [...] the opposite extremes of possible divergence from one another, [...] invokes not only as its evidence, but as its sole evidence, the [...] absolute inconceivability of any theory but itself, we are enabled [...] to measure the worth of this kind of evidence: and when we find [...] the Volitional theory entirely built upon the assertion that by [...] our mental constitution we are compelled to recognize our [...] volitions as efficient causes, and then find other thinkers [...] maintaining that we know that they are <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not be such [...] causes, and can not conceive them to be so, I think we have a [...] right to say that this supposed law of our mental constitution [...] does not exist.|$|E

6000|$|The various {{classes of}} facts now {{referred}} to serve {{to show us}} that, {{in the case of}} the two higher groups--mammalia and birds--almost all the characters by which species are distinguished from each other are, or may be, adaptive. It is these two classes of animals which have been most studied and whose life-histories are supposed to be most fully known, yet even here the assertion of inutility, by an eminent naturalist, in the case of two important organs, has been sufficiently met by minute details either in the anatomy or in the habits of the groups referred to. Such a fact as this, together with the extensive series of characters already enumerated which have been of late years transferred from the [...] "useless" [...] to the [...] "useful" [...] class, should convince us, that the assertion of [...] "inutility" [...] in the case of any organ or peculiarity which is not a rudiment or a correlation, is <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> never be, the statement of a fact, but merely an expression of our ignorance of its purpose or origin.[45] ...|$|E

If men of the world with years enough to have lived out of the old régime into the new would testify in this matter there would ensue a great rattling of dry bones in bodices of reform ladies. Nay, if the young man about town, knowing nothing of how things were in the [...] "dark backward and abysm of time," [...] but something of the moral difference between even so free-running a creature as the society girl and the average working girl of the factory, the shop and the office, would speak out (under assurance of immunity from prosecution) his testimony would be a surprise to the cartilaginous virgins, blowsy matrons, acrid relicts and hairy males of Emancipation.

6000|$|Soils are {{of every}} grade: some, which if cultivated, might replace [...] the capital, but give no profit; some give a slight {{but not an}} [...] {{ordinary}} profit; some, the ordinary profit. That is, “there is a [...] point up {{to which it is}} profitable to cultivate, and beyond which [...] it is not profitable to cultivate. The price of corn will not, for [...] any long time, remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover [...] with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop [...] which is raised at greatest expense.”(188) For similar reasons the [...] price will not remain at a lower rate. If, then, the cost of [...] production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the [...] capital, yields only the ordinary profit, and pays no rent, rent [...] forms no part of this cost, since that land does <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not [...] pay any rent.

60|$|It {{is true that}} a {{thing is}} said by us to exist, {{even when it is}} absent, and {{therefore}} is <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not be perceived. But even then, its existence is to us only another word for our conviction that we should perceive it on a certain supposition; namely, if we were in the needful circumstances of time and place, and endowed with the needful perfection of organs. My belief that the Emperor of China exists, is simply my belief that if I were transported to the imperial palace or some other locality in Pekin, I should see him. My belief that Julius Cæsar existed, is my belief that I should have seen him if I had been present in the field of Pharsalia, or in the senate-house at Rome. When I believe that stars exist beyond the utmost range of my vision, though assisted by the most powerful telescopes yet invented, my belief, philosophically expressed, is, that with still better telescopes, if such existed, I could see them, or that they may be perceived by beings less remote from them in space, or whose capacities of perception are superior to mine.|$|E
60|$|As a first instance, we may cite that {{favorite}} {{argument in}} defense of absolute power, drawn from the analogy of paternal government in a family, which government, however much in need of control, is <b>not</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not be controlled by the children themselves, while they remain children. Paternal government, says the argument, works well; therefore, despotic government in a state will work well. I waive, as not pertinent in this place, all that could be said in qualification of the alleged excellence of paternal government. However this might be, the argument from the family to the state would not the less proceed on a false analogy; implying that the beneficial working of parental government depends, in the family, on the only point which it has in common with political despotism, namely, irresponsibility. Whereas it depends, when real, not on that but on two other circumstances of the case, the affection of the parent for the children, and {{the superiority of the}} parent in wisdom and experience; neither of which properties can be reckoned on, or are at all likely to exist, between a political despot and his subjects; and when either of these circumstances fails even in the family, and the influence of the irresponsibility is allowed to work uncorrected, the result is any thing but good government. This, therefore, is a false analogy.|$|E
