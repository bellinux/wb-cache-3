Particularly in e-learning trainings, e-learners apply this kind of cognitive strategies to integrate knowledges and expertises proposed by e-teachers through on-line resources.

XML technologies, learning models and objects are now mature enough to inspire such structured documents which can instanciate knowledge acquisition and learning processes. In the framework of a collaboration with University of Picardie which proposes 6 fully on-line elearning trainings, we are adaptating HyWebMap structured documents for experimental collaborative e-schoolbag.

The difference between this reality and the image some people have {{is partly due to}} generation gaps. The author supports her argument with a synthesis of empirical studies conducted in Denmark on children's and adolescents' uses of various media. Among other differences, she notes the widening gap between young boys and girls. Drotner Kirsten. <b>Netsurfers</b> and Game Navigators: New media and youthful leisure cultures in Denmark.

We were interested in discovering the opinions of customers concerning the role of internet in the pre- and after-sales stages of the purchasing process in this industry. As we are just {{at the beginning of}} the e-commerce area in the luxury sector, we decided to focus on blogs’ content. After-sales service in the luxury sector is considered with circumspection. Practitioners feel that consumers are still very much attached to the ‘physical’ experience. On the contrary, we assumed that <b>Netsurfers</b> belonging to net communities are also luxury goods and services consumers. According to the netnography methodology (Kozinets, 1998), we analyzed the Netsufers comments about pre- and after-sales services. We identified and selected blogs that are specific to the Web 2. 0 generation; these blogs are discussing about luxury watches, cars, travels and art objects. The results permitted us to identify three categories of services needs: 1) the need for the service in broad terms, especially the service that should be linked to a product 2) the need for a specific information or a very specific service, and 3) specific complaint about service experiences. These insights were discussed to be fully integrated in the e-commerce strategy in general...|$|R
