2500|$|James W. Hudspeth, an {{investigator}} {{of a previous}} <b>near</b> <b>accident</b> (an MD-83, starting from Lanzarote) that was similar in its details, {{pointed out that the}} fuse of the so-called [...] "left ground control relay" [...] at position K-33 of the control panel might have been the actual culprit in the erroneous flight mode: Hudspeth found out during a 2-week investigation at Lanzarote that it is customary in normal maintenance routine to temporarily remove this fuse to engage flight mode, but the fuse is afterwards sometimes not replaced correctly. Because of the frequent handling of this fuse, it is also not easy to visually check that the fuse is functioning properly (as is customary for the pilots to do when they enter the cockpit). Hudspeth speculates that this may have happened with both JK 5022 and Northwest Airlines Flight 255.|$|E
2500|$|MD 42 {{originally}} connected Friendsville with US 219 {{north of}} Accident via Bear Creek Road {{instead of the}} current connection near McHenry. [...] The state highway was paved for about [...] east of Friendsville in 1921. [...] The highway was complete to present day US 219 at the hamlet of Kaese Mill north of Accident in 1923. [...] The first section of MD 42 from Friendsville to the Pennsylvania state line was completed in 1928 from {{the west side of}} the Youghiogheny River to Blooming Rose Road. [...] The modern Maple Street bridge over the Youghiogheny River was built in 1932. [...] Construction of MD 42 from Blooming Rose Road to the state line began in 1932 and was completed in 1935. MD 42 was transferred from its eastern terminus <b>near</b> <b>Accident</b> to a southern terminus near McHenry, following First Street north to Maple Street within Friendsville, in 1960. [...] The state highway originally followed Hoyes Road east from the crossroads in Hoyes to US 219 north of the present terminus. [...] MD 42 was shifted to its present terminus south of Hoyes around 1972. [...] The state highway was relocated in Friendsville to connect with its interchange with I-68 in 1975; First Street and Maple Street through Friendsville were designated MD 742.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the causal factors associated with anger while driving and the possible consequences of that anger on driving behaviour. Drivers kept diaries {{over a period of}} two weeks, detailing the events occurring during each journey in that time, with notes on events such as <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> and on feelings of anger. The {{study examined}} the diaries of 100 drivers, who reported a total of 293 <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> and 383 occasions when they experienced anger. The drivers also completed questionnaires that assessed a number of individual di€erences such as propensity towards mild social deviance and towards committing tra�c violations. On a journey by journey basis drivers {{were more likely to report}} anger when congestion was present, but there was no evidence that the drivers who generally experienced higher levels of congestion also experienced more anger. The study found a strong association between the number of <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> and occasions of anger a person experiences while driving, but this concealed two separate relationships. <b>Near</b> <b>accidents</b> frequently provoked feelings of anger, particularly where the driver felt that they were not at fault in the incident. However, there was also a separate link between the experience of anger in other situations and reports of <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> where the driver was to blame. Such anger also appeared to be linked to mild social deviance and the commission of driving violations. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. Al...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{describe}} the current work situation for BA-operatives (firefighters) within Swedish rescue services, to examine the causes for occupational injuries and <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> among BA-operatives and also examine in which type of environments occupational injuries and <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> have occurred. All occupational injuries and <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> that was reported to the Swedish Work Environment Authority during 1 st January 2002 - to 17 th July 2014 have been analyzed. The analysis showed that a significant larger amount of injuries and <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> occurred during nighttime BA-operations than during daytime operations. The analysis also showed that there are a significant higher number of occupational injuries during BA-operations among retained firefighters than among whole-time firefighters. Most occupational injuries during the investigated time period have occurred in detached houses. The analysis have shown that the reason for this, in most cases, is that the officer in charge has made errors when assessing the risks before the BA-operation was carried out or has failed to communicate his decisions with the other firefighters. Most of the <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> during the time period have occurred in underground car parks and case studies have shown that it’s difficult for BA-operatives to locate and fight fires in this kind of buildings. The case studies also showed that local rescue services often have failed to prepare the firefighters for BA-operations in large buildings and also that many of the  local standard operation procedures are inadequate with respect to replacement of BA-operatives.

5000|$|The album's title, {{according}} to the lead singer Robin Wilson, refers to an in-band joke by a former band member, Doug Hopkins.

40|$|It may {{be known}} that the {{attention}} of the authorities is moving to residential areas where traffic safety research is concerned. The analysis of the lack of traffic mostly concerns accidents. In general, however, there are relatively few accidents in residential areas. Only one third of all accidents in the Netherlands is registered. The necessary time to gather a sufficient number of accident data is in many cases too long. The conditions and circumstances can change in that time. The manoeuvres preceding an accident are normally not registered. In view of these facts {{it is not surprising that}} <b>near</b> <b>accidents</b> and <b>near</b> misses are used as they give much more data. This method is called the conflict method.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{association}} between occupational MRI-related static magnetic fields (SMF) exposure and the occurrence of accidents. METHODS: Recent and career SMF exposure was assessed by linking a retrospective job exposure matrix to payroll based job histories, for a cohort of (former) workers of an imaging device manufacturing facility in the Netherlands. Occurrence of accidents was collected through an online questionnaire. Self-reported injuries due to accidents in the past 12 months, and the first (<b>near)</b> traffic <b>accident</b> while commuting to work and from work were analyzed with logistic regression and discrete-time survival analyses, respectively. RESULTS: High recent SMF exposure was {{associated with an increased}} risk of accidents leading to injuries [odds ratio (OR) 4. 16]. For high recent and career SMF exposure, an increased risk was observed for accidents resulting in physician-treated injuries (OR 5. 78 and 2. 79, respectively) and an increased lifetime risk of (<b>near)</b> <b>accidents</b> during commute to work (hazard ratios 2. 49 and 2. 45, respectively), but not from work. CONCLUSION: We found an association between MRI-related occupational SMF exposure and an increased risk of accidents leading to injury, and for commute-related (<b>near)</b> <b>accidents</b> during the commute from home to work. Further research into health effects of (long-term) SMF exposure is warranted to corroborate our findings. Magn Reson Med, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

50|$|Floor slip {{resistance}} testing is {{the science of}} measuring the coefficient of friction (or resistance to slip accidents) of flooring surfaces, either in a laboratory (before or after installation) or on floors in situ.

Flooring is tested using a tribometer (floor {{slip resistance}} tester) to discover if there is a high propensity for slip and fall accidents on it, either dry and/or (most often) when wet with water or lubricated with other contaminants such as kitchen grease, hydraulic oil, etc. There have been numerous floor slip resistance testing tribometers and lab devices produced around the world to measure both the static (stationary) and dynamic (in motion) coefficient of friction, but presently {{there are only a few}} that have been proven to be reliable for obtaining useful safety results and that have current official test methods.|$|E
