40|$|Procurement auctions may be {{affected}} by abnormally low bids, whose acceptance may have negative consequences on the auctioneer. A method, based on the average submitted bid, is considered to detect such anomalous bids and aid the auctioneer in the possible rejection decision. Analytical expressions or simulation results are provided for the detection probability and for the false alarm probability. The performances heavily depend on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and on the dispersion of bid values. Both performance indices improve as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> grows and generally degrade as the dispersion grows. The presence of multiple anomalous bids leads to a significant worsening of the performance, while courtesy bids raise both the false alarm probability and the detection probability. The use of the average-bid criterion, though officially endorsed in national legislations, is therefore recommended as a strongly precautionary criterion, i. e. when the need to avoid anomalous bids is considered much more relevant than the costs associated to deeper investigation of anomalous bids or to the erroneous rejection of regular bids.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the decision a purchaser must make regarding the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> suppliers that should be invited {{to submit a tender}} for a certain purchase.

On the other hand, with every additional tender, the purchaser might obtain a better bid. We present a theoretical decision model, the Economic Tender Quantity (ETQ) model, that under certain conditions may assist the purchaser in finding the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> that minimises the expected total costs of the tender process, that is the sum of the expected costs of sending, evaluating and communicating, and the expected bid price.

40|$|Detecting {{abnormally}} low bids in procurement auctions is {{a recognized}} problem, since their acceptance {{could result in}} the winner not being able to provide the service or work awarded by the auction, which is a significant risk for the auctioneer. A rank-and-compare algorithm is considered to detect such anomalous bids and help auctioneers in achieving an effective rejection decision. Analytical expressions and simulation results are provided for the detection probability, {{as well as for the}} false alarm probability. The suggested range of application of the detection algorithm leaves out the cases <b>of</b> many <b>tenderers</b> (more than 20) and quite dispersed bids (coefficient of variation larger than 0. 15). An increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> leads to contrasting effects, since both the false alarm probability and the detection probability are reduced. If the bids are spread over a large range, we have instead a double negative effect, with more false alarms and less detections. The presence of multiple anomalous bids worsens the performance of the algorithm as well. On the other hand, the method is quite robust to the presence of courtesy bids. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractSince the 1980 s, {{policies}} {{related to}} outsourcing have steadily emerged {{in both the}} private sector and public sector. Indeed, the topics of procurement and outsourcing attract a lot of attention from practitioners and researchers alike. In the private sector, there are many studies discussing how to develop an efficient supplier-buyer relationship in order to optimize an outsourcing strategy; however, few studies discuss similar topics for the public sector. In this paper, we discuss the supplier-buyer relationship in public procurement and outsourcing based on four different role expectation segments of private suppliers: operator, agent, professional, and partner. While the role expectation for an operator is emphasized in the execution of a public buyer's request, a role expectation for a partner is more collaborative and involves risk sharing. While the role expectation for an agent is based upon business outsourcing, a role expectation for a professional is based upon a specific task. In addition, the paper also investigates market competition in Taiwan's public procurement and outsourcing based on supplier segmentation. The results show that in the four segments of private suppliers, the market competition for the operator segment is the most competitive because it has the most tenderers in the tendering process; on the other hand, in the cases of finding an agent or a professional, the contract price is positively related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenderers.</b> These results can help managers in {{the private sector and}} officers in the public sector to understand the market competition of governmental procurement and outsourcing, and also help them optimize the outcome by developing an appropriate public-private relationship...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 58 - 59). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential for using public funds. To streamline these objectives through public procurement, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance procurement activities in 04 target agencies {{in the light of}} 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Among the four target agencies, LGED and RHD are the largest in terms of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services. Thus, {{it seems to be a}} good consideration to have a look at the compliance issues of PPR 2008 in RHD and LGED’s procurement activities. The present study seeks to provide an assessment of the current procurement performance of LGED & RHD and to find out the gap of compliance with scope of improvement for implementation of PPR 2008. A semi structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data from randomly selected 60 procurement practitioners working in LGED (30) and RHD (30). The Responses were analyzed by using SPSS 17 version package. The related literatures and reports, particularly from LGED and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed to draw conclusion of the study. The highest proportion of the respondent was middle aged and male. Majority of them were from engineering background with post graduate education and were trained in public procurement. The study found that LGED performed better in respect of KPI 4 (Percentage of Tenders following Development Partner Rules), KPI 6 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days between publishing of advertisement and Tender submission deadline), KPI 7 (Percentage of Tenders having sufficient tender submission time), KPI 10 (Ratio <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Tender submission and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Tender document sold), KPI 11 (Percentage of cases TOC included at least ONE member from TEC) and KPI 12 (Percentage of cases TEC formed by Contract Approving Authority) and KPI 13 (Percentage of cases TEC included two external members outside the Ministry or Division), KPI 14 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days between Tender opening and completion of evaluation), KPI 15 (Percentage of cases Tender evaluation has been completed within timeline), KPI 16 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> responsive Tenders), KPI 19 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days taken between submission of Tender Evaluation and approval of contract), KPI 22 (Percentage of cases contract award decision made within timeline by Contract Approving Authority after submitting Tender Evaluation Report), KPI 23 (Percentage of cases TER reviewed by person/ committee other than the Contract Approving Authority), KPI 25 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days between final approval and Notification of Award (NOA), KPI 27 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days between Invitation for Tender (IFT) and Notification of Award), KPI 32 (Percentage of Contracts fully completed and accepted). On the other hand RHD complied better on KPI 8 (Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tenderers</b> purchased Tender Documents), KPI 17 (Percentage of cases TEC recommended for Re- Tendering), KPI 20 (Percentage of Tenders approved by the proper financial delegated authority), KPI 24 (Percentage of Tenders approved by higher tier than the Contract Approving Authority), KPI 28 (Percentage of Contract awards published in CPTU’s website), KPI 34 (Percentage of cases (considering each installment as a case) with delayed payment), KPI 38 (Percentage of cases complaints have been resolved), KPI 41 (Percentage of Contracts with unresolved disputes), and KPI 44 (Percentage of procuring entity which has at least one trained/ certified procurement staff). The perceptions of the respondents regarding procurement performance need to investigate more cautiously as there are ambiguity among the findings of present study, individual consultant’s reports and SRGB’s report. The scenario may be more or less similar in other target agencies. Although LGED is being complied better than RHD against most of the KPIs, there is scope and need for improvement to have a 100 % compliance of PPR 2008 in both of the organizations. Abu Sayed Md.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{study in which}} the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and contractors and related procurement regulations are discussed and compared under Saudi public procurement contract regulations and those of England and Wales. This thesis does not aim to be a comprehensive comparative study, but presents examples to illustrate the issues under discussion. A central aim {{of the study is}} to consider whether Saudi public procurement contract regulations are suitable to protect the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and contractors and to solve their problems in the rapid development of the country. Is the Purchasing Law, in particular, able to cover the rapid development in procurement and the economy in Saudi Arabia and the world? This question is asked in order to examine the weaknesses of current procurement regulations and to explore procurement claims that the Purchasing Law fails to address tenderers' and contractors' rights and concerns. Many criticisms have been raised regarding Saudi public procurement contract regulations, especially the Saudi Purchasing Law. Although the Saudi government has called for the procurement sector to play a greater role in national development, the Purchasing Law does not support this aim. It has remained unchanged since it was enacted in 1979, despite rapid economic changes in the country. Contractors, traders, banks, and Saudi Chambers of Commerce have complained that they are too constrained by the provisions of the Purchasing Law. The ten chapters of this thesis examine the rights <b>of</b> procurement <b>tenderers</b> and contractors throughout the procedures to prepare and award a public procurement contract. In addition to identifying the principles of procurement regulations, this study investigates the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and contractors from the first steps of tendering procedures to the awarding of the contract and afterwards. Once the contracting authority selects a successful contractor this study highlights his rights to obtain his financial payment and to obtain remedy if the contracting authority breaches its contractual obligations. The study examines case law, procurement regulations, circulars and governmental procedures in procurement. The study results indicate that Saudi public procurement contract regulations in general and the Purchasing Law in particular are inadequate to keep pace with development requirements in the country. More specifically, the findings show that current Saudi procurement regulations are in fact obstacles {{to the development of the}} procurement sector, and a main reason for contractors' unwillingness to enter the governmental procurement market.

40|$|In {{construction}} processes, {{the choice}} of a contractor by a public or private Contracting Authority is a crucial moment. Today, to improve the probabilities of success to respect time, cost and quality, Clients resort with greater frequency to contracts award through ???most cost-effective bids??? (MCEB), which allow a more detailed technical and economic evaluation of the offers. Among the qualitative elements included in the calls, listed as example in the art. 83 of Legislative Decree n. 163 / 2006, there are not issues related to the construction site design of an intervention, such as safety, the construction site environmental impact, the use of advanced building technologies and the site organization. However, some Contracting Authorities have tried to include some of these elements between the evaluation criteria in the calls for bids (with scores of about 20 to 40 points out of 100), in order to assess the capabilities of production organization <b>of</b> <b>tenderers,</b> especially for interventions particularly complex as regards to the construction site. Therefore, the research investigated the phenomenology of the MCEB calls - through a detailed analysis of several calls ??? identifying, within the specifications, the qualitative aspects, their related weights and the evaluation criteria associated to the construction site aspects. The study has revealed a certain vagueness in the definition of the these criteria, resulting in the inability to effectively and objectively evaluate the technical and organizational potentialities <b>of</b> <b>tenderers.</b> Since the lack of criteria evaluable in objective terms means both a lower transparency of candidates assessment and a greater likelihood of appeals - with consequent costs for the Contracting Authorities and extension of time for the completion of the intervention ??? the research proposes, as a result, a repertoire of evaluation criteria oriented to a better objectivity, related to the construction site design of the execution phase. The contract award based on a construction project, preset and calibrated on the actual production means and the real organizational capacities of the contracting company, gives greater certainties to the management order and, ultimately, and gives less likely to encounter criticalities during the construction phase, increasing quality levels of works and workers safety...|$|R

40|$|The {{procurement}} of UK {{public services}} has seen considerable changes {{during the final}} 20 years of the millennium. Successive governments have legislated to impose firstly compulsion to compete on price, followed by a duty to achieve best value. Property and construction professional consultants were under an obligation to their professional bodies not to compete on price less than 20 years ago. The {{first part of this}} paper chronicles the main stages in this period of great change. Many commentators in {{the public and private sectors}} have predicted a decline in service quality as firms have been forced to cut costs in order to survive in highly competitive markets. The second part of the paper reports an empirical study that has investigated whether there is any substance to these predictions. One hundred and eighty nine public sector clients have assessed private sector consultants with a view to establishing whether those consultants appointed by competitive fee tendering perform less well than those appointed by other methods. The development of SURVEYQUAL, a 25 item service quality assessment scale is described briefly. Service quality is not significantly lower for those consultants appointed by competition.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{applicability}} of care quality concepts as contract award criteria for public procurement of health and social care, using the case of Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, European and Swedish legal texts, government regulations as well as 26 Swedish court review cases concerning care procurement have been analysed. Findings – Methods used for assessing care quality are seldom useful for predicting the quality to be delivered by a potential contractor. Legal principles of transparency and equal treatment <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> make it necessary to apply strict requirements for verification. Research limitations/implications – Results refer primarily to a Swedish context but could be applicable throughout the EU. Further studies of relations between award criteria and public/private collaborative practices for improving care quality during contractual periods are desirable. Practical implications – Local and regional procurement officials should benefit from a better understanding of how quality criteria should be designed and applied to the award procedures for care contracts. Care providers in the private sector would also be able to develop their quality strategies and present their abilities more efficiently when tendering for public contracts. Social implications – Issues of quality of health and social care are of obvious importance for social sustainability. Public awareness of care quality problems is evident and often a cause of media concern. Originality/value – This investigation pinpoints the difference between traditional care quality thinking and the legal principles underlying contract award in public procurement of care services...|$|R
40|$|It is {{less than}} fifteen years since the {{associations}} representing construction professionals in the UK surrendered to Government pressure, and abolished mandatory fee scales, predicting as they did so that abolition would inevitably lead {{to a decline in}} the standard of service provided to clients. Competitive fee tendering is now the principal route for the appointment of construction professionals in the UK and during the recent recession, fee levels fell to unprecedented low levels. The main aim of this research project is to ascertain whether fee tendering has led to a decline in service quality. The research commences with a literature review of professional services in a construction industry context. The framework for the review is the three stage consumer behaviour model and the variables identified by the literature search are then developed into a process model. The model is underpinned by the important variables to be investigated - the method of appointment and clients' perceptions of service quality. A literature review of these subjects leads to the development of one main hypothesis (that clients' perceptions of service quality are lower for fee tendered appointments) and four subhypotheses. The hypotheses are tested by the analysis of data arising from the assessment of 244 professional consultants by their clients. The main research instrument is a measurement scale developed by comparing four previous studies, with the much used SERVQUAL scale (Parasuraman, Zeithami and Berry, 1991), providing the main foundation of the scale. The data do not support the main hypothesis - either for the entire client sample or for public sector clients only. However the hypotheses that service quality is higher when care is taken with the pre-selection <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and when adequate weighting has been given to ability, are supported. The thesis concludes with implications for the professions and for clients, and with recommendations for further research...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether {{opportunities}} for fraud and corruption might be reduced or increased by rules governing public procurement. The focus is on specific European legislation – Procurement Directive 2004 / 18 on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts for public works, public supply and public services by public bodies within all EU Member States – however similar issues would arise in other jurisdictions. Design/methodology/approach – The procurement process is examined in relation to three stages of procedure: preparation of specifications, selection <b>of</b> <b>tenderers,</b> and execution <b>of</b> contracts, within each of which some specific risks (red flags) are identified. Findings – Particular risks that may not have been sufficiently addressed, in terms of research or legislation, arise at the first of these stages; accordingly this paper focuses there. Generally, risks are summarised in terms of insider-driven specifications, low visibility of procurement processes, and ample opportunities for renegotiation of terms. Risks may be increased by innovative procurement practices that have the effect of extending the manoeuvring between tenderers and public bodies, such as competitive dialogue. Research limitations/implications – Fraud and corruption risk in public procurement is an area deserving detailed and comparative study, with special attention to the pre-contracting stage. Research on this topic within EU Member States should go hand in hand with enquiry into international procurement, and into the EC's own rules as applied by its institutions and bodies. Practical implications – Suggestions for risk-reduction are put forward in relation to quality standards and pre-award publicity. Originality/value – After some time as the Cinderella of crime policies, large-scale frauds attract greater interest.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about social and {{environmental}} considerations with regard to Directive 2014 / 24 /EU in the European Union. The new directives concerning public procurement were adopted in 2014 by the European Union, and the Member States had the obligation to implement the directives by 18 April 2016. The previous major amendments to the rules date back to 2004. The research question is how the novelties in Directive 2014 / 24 /EU linked to {{social and environmental}} considerations reflect the legislator’s general emphasis on social and environmental considerations in public procurement law. The discussion is twofold: firstly, more general changes are discussed, and after that more specific articles are selected for discussion that the author assessed as the central ones {{with regard to the}} research question. In order to analyse the new legal situation and how it is different from the previous directives, the Directives 2014 / 24 /EU and 2004 / 18 /EC are discussed in parallel. The thesis is divided into four parts: the first part constitutes of a general introduction to the topic. Secondly, the general provisions in Directive 2014 / 24 /EU that have significance for more specific provisions of Directive 2014 / 24 /EU are discussed. Thirdly, the more specific provisions of Directive 2014 / 24 /EU are discussed. Fourthly, to conclude the discussion, the different changes in Directive 2014 / 24 /EU are discussed in light of the general status that environmental and social considerations have in public procurement law. To summarise the outcome of the thesis, there are several amendments in Directive 2014 / 24 /EU that are linked to social and environmental considerations which include factors linked to award criteria, definition of the subject-matter of the contract, selection <b>of</b> <b>tenderers,</b> technical specifications and performance conditions. However, as discussed in the thesis, in many areas, these amendments are often vague and the impact on the promotion of social and environmental objectives remains unclear...|$|R

As a result, sets of PQC, and hence prequalification standards, vary between prequalifiers. This paper reports on an investigation {{of the nature of the}} divergencies of the perceived importance of individual PQC by different groups of prequalifiers via a large-scale empirical survey conducted in the United Kingdom. The results support the conclusion that there are significant systematic differences between groups of prequalifiers, with the individual PQC that contribute most to the differences being the method of procurement, size of project, standard of quality, financial stability, project complexity, claim and contractual dispute and length of time in business...|$|R
