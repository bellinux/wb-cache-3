Thus, they are variously referred to as [...] "adjectival verbs" [...] (literal translation), [...] "adjectival nouns" [...] (nouns that function adjectivally), na-adjectives (function as adjectives, <b>take</b> <b>na),</b> and na-nominals (nominals that <b>take</b> <b>na).</b> For example, Eleanor Harz Jorden refers to them as na-nominals in her textbook Japanese: The Spoken Language.|$|R
