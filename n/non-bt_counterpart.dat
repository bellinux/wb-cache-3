2500|$|An expert {{committee}} (EC-I) {{was set up}} in 2006 {{to examine}} the biosafety data presented by Mahyco. They concluded that while the current data demonstrated that Bt brinjal was safe and equivalent to its <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterpart,</b> more studies were required to re-affirm the findings and further trials were needed to ascertain the benefits from Bt brinjal with respect to existing methods for pest management and pesticide reduction. They recommended that large scale trials be allowed to go ahead. In 2009, a second expert committee (EC-II) examined the data from these trials. They concluded that adequate safety tests had been performed, stating that [...] "the benefits of Bt brinjal event EE-I developed by M/s Mahyco far outweigh the perceived and projected risks", and advised the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to recommend commercialization of the Bt brinjal.|$|E
40|$|Stalk rots, {{caused by}} a complex of fungal species, {{are among the most}} {{widespread}} and destructive diseases of maize. Larvae of the European corn borer (ECB) (Ostrinia nubilalis) promote stalk rot development by creating entry points for fungi, serving as vectors of pathogens, and causing physiological stress that may predispose plants to stalk decay. Field experiments were conducted in 1998, 1999, and 2000 to determine whether the use of transgenic Bt hybrids expressing insecticidal proteins would influence stalk rot symptoms (pith disintegration, pith discoloration, and lodging). Five hybrids representing different Bt types (or “Bt events”) (176, BT 11, MON 810, DBT 418, and CBH 351) were paired with their near-isogenic, non-Bt counterparts and subjected to treatments of manual and natural infestation with ECB larvae. Manual infestation resulted in significantly more ECB tunneling than natural infestation in 1998 and 1999 and significantly more lodging in 1998. There were significant linear correlations between ECB injury and stalk rot symptoms in non-Bt hybrids in 1998 and 1999, but not in 2000. A standard foliar insecticide treatment for ECB did not significantly affect stalk rot symptoms. In 1998, Bt hybrids had significantly less ECB tunneling, stalk discoloration, pith disintegration, and lodging compared with non-Bt hybrids, but these effects depended upon the Bt event and the infestation treatment. Similar but less pronounced effects of Bt events were observed in 1999. The 2000 results were more variable; the amount of pith disintegration was significantly lower but discoloration was significantly higher in the BT 11 hybrid compared with its <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterpart,</b> and the amount of lodging was significantly higher in the event 176 hybrid compared with its <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterpart.</b> The ratio of stalk strength to grain weight did not consistently differ between Bt and non-Bt hybrids. These results indicate that, although specific Bt events in some years may cause reductions in stalk rot, the overall effect of Bt transformation on stalk rot occurrence is highly variable...|$|E
40|$|In 1996 {{transgenic}} Bt cotton {{was first}} grown {{on a commercial}} level in Arizona and the U. S. cottonbelt. Insecticidal properties of Bt varieties had been evaluated rather thoroughly in both {{the private and public}} sectors prior to commercial release. However, the agronomic characteristics had not been evaluated to any sufficient extent beyond the level of the developing companies. Lab and field tests were conducted in Arizona in 1996 dealing with the Delta and Pine Land Co. (DPL) companion varieties 5415 /NuCOTN 33 b (similar to 5415 but with the Bt gene) and 5690 /NuCOTN 35 b (with Bt gene). Most field comparisons were between 5415 and 33 b. Lab and field studies revealed very similar agronomic characteristics between the companion varieties. No differences were detected with respect to heat tolerance, as determined by comparative fruit loss and abortion rates {{at the onset of the}} monsoon season. Only slightly higher vigor or growth rates were noted for 33 b over 5415, which was considered to be negligible. Yield results revealed higher lint yields for 33 b over 5415 in most cases. The difference in yields were attributed to pink bollworm infestations and damage, even when chemical control measures were being taken. It was concluded that 33 b, as a transgenic version of 5415, is indeed very close to it's <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterpart...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: There are {{different}} kinds of Bt corn, * depending on which Bt genes have been inserted into the corn using molecular engineering. Some Bt genes protect against stalk borers, others help prevent leaf and ear damage from various caterpillars including corn earworm and fall armyworm. Still other genes protect the roots from western corn rootworm. These genes are bundled together in various combinations, with or without herbicide tolerance genes. Bt corn is really a form of crop insurance that comes in the seed bag. The presence {{of one or more}} Bt genes in a corn hybrid will not increase yield potential. Instead, the gene(s) prevent yield losses from certain insects. Therefore, {{the most important thing to}} remember is that if the population of the target insect in your field or area is high enough, Bt corn will pay off. If the “insect pressure ” is not there, then you won’t get your money back. So it is a matter of deciding if the risk is high enough to warrant purchasing “insurance. ” This information sheet summarizes the results from replicated trials conducted in summer 2011 at eight Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station locations. The trials included Bt corn hybrids paired with their <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterparts</b> (isolines). Six Bt corn traits were tested: YieldGard Corn Borer or Agrisure 3000 GT or Genuity V...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the performance of maize hybrids with Bt event MON 810 (Bt-hybrids) against the maize stem borer Busseola fusca (Fuller) in a biosafety greenhouse (BGH) and against the spotted stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) under confined field trials (CFT) in Kenya for three seasons during 2013 – 2014. The study comprised 14 non-commercialized hybrids (seven pairs of near-isogenic Bt and non-Bt hybrids) and four non-Bt commercial hybrids. Each plant was artificially infested twice with 10 first instar larvae. In CFT, plants were infested with C.  partellus 14 and 24 days after planting; in BGH, plants were infested with B.  fusca 21 and 31 days after planting. In CFT, the seven Bt hybrids significantly differed from their <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterparts</b> for leaf damage, number of exit holes, percent tunnel length, and grain yield. When averaged over three seasons, Bt-hybrids gave the highest grain yield (9. 7  t ha− 1), followed by non-Bt hybrids (6. 9  t ha− 1) and commercial checks (6  t ha− 1). Bt-hybrids had the least number of exit holes and percent tunnel length in all the seasons as compared to the non-Bt hybrids and commercial checks. In BGH trials, Bt-hybrids consistently suffered less leaf damage than their non-Bt near isolines. The study demonstrated that MON 810 was effective in controlling B.  fusca and C.  partellus. Bt-maize, therefore, has great potential {{to reduce the risk of}} maize grain losses in Africa due to stem borers, and will enable the smallholder farmers to produce high-quality grain with increased yield, reduced insecticide inputs, and improved food security...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) {{crops are}} commercially cultivated worldwide {{but there are}} concerns on their possible negative impacts on soil biodiversity. A glasshouse {{study was conducted to}} determine effects of Bt maize residues on soil microbial diversity. Residues of Bt maize (PAN 6 Q- 308 B) and non-Bt maize (PAN 6 Q- 121) were incorporated into the soil and corresponding maize seeds planted. The treatments were replicated three times. Fertilizer and water application were similar for both treatments. Rhizosphere and bulk soil was destructively sampled from each treatment and analyzed for microbial community level physiological profiles using Biolog plates with 31 different carbon substrates. Absorbance in the Biolog plates was recorded after 72 h of incubation at 20 oC. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore counts were also determined. Field studies were conducted at the University of Free State and University of Fort Hare Research Farms {{to determine the effects of}} growing Bt maize on soil microbial diversity. One Bt maize cultivar (PAN 6 Q- 308 B) and non-Bt maize (PAN 6 Q- 121) were grown in a paired experiment at University of Free State farm, while two Bt maize (DKC 61 - 25 B and PAN 6 Q- 321 B) and their near-isogenic non-Bt maize lines (DKC 61 - 24 and PAN 6777) were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Fertilization, weed control and water application, were similar for both Bt maize cultivars and their <b>non-Bt</b> maize <b>counterparts.</b> Rhizosphere soil samples were collected by uprooting whole plants and collecting the soil attached to the roots. The samples were analysed for microbial diversity and for arbuscular mycorrhizae fungal spore counts. Principal component analysis showed that soil microbial diversity was affected more by sampling time whereas genetic modification had minimal effects. Presence of residues also increased the diversity of microorganisms. Mycorrhizal fungal spores were not affected by the presence of Bt maize residues. Growing Bt maize had no effect on the soil microbial diversity in the rhizosphere...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMycotoxins {{produced}} by Fusarium spp. during plant cultivation induce severe diseases in animal and humans. In 2007 a European Union regulation set maximum concentrations of mycotoxins in maize and derivatives of 4000 ppb for fumonisins B 1 and B 2, 1750 ppb for deoxynivalenol, and 350 ppb for zearalenone. To assess {{the safety of}} French maize food, investigations are currently being {{carried out by the}} national Biological Risk Monitoring network. Here, 84 plots were cropped with the Bt maize MON 810 and its isogenic <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterpart</b> in 2005 and 2006 in Southwestern France. Mycotoxin levels were measured in grain at harvest. Fumonisins B 1 and B 2, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone were analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data were analysed statistically using non-parametric tests for mycotoxins and analysis of variance for weather variables. As the climate was homogenous inside the experimental area, the transgenic event introduced into the maize was the only key parameter which differed between Bt and non-Bt maize plots. Our results show that Bt maize decreased concentrations of fumonisins by 90 % and zearalenone by 50 %, whereas the concentration of deoxynivalenol was slightly increased. Those findings suggest a competition among Fusarium species that produce fumonisins or trichothecenes. According to the European regulation, 93 % of the Bt maize crops can be sold, compared with only 45 % for non-Bt maize plots. Our results thus show that Bt maize improved food safety by greatly reducing mycotoxin levels in field crops in Southwestern France...|$|E
40|$|A new EU (European Union) {{regulation}} {{came into}} force in 2007 with Regulation (EC) No. 1126 / 2007 which established maximum levels for fumonisins B₁ and B₂ (4000 ppb), deoxynivalenol (1750 ppb) and zearalenone (350 ppb) in maize and maize products. In order to evaluate French maize food safety, studies {{were carried out}} by the national Biological Risk Monitoring (BRM) Network. In this study, field trials involving 84 plots were conducted with Bt maize (MON 810) and its isogenic <b>non-Bt</b> <b>counterpart</b> in 2005 and 2006 in South-western France. Mycotoxin levels were determined in grain at harvest. Fumonisins B₁ and B₂, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone were analyzed by LC-MS-MS and the results treated statistically using non parametric tests for mycotoxins and analysis of variance test for weather variables. As the climate was homogenous inside the experimental area, the transgenic event introduced into the maize was the only key parameter which differed between Bt and non-Bt maize plots. Our results showed that all mycotoxin families were not impacted in the same way. The efficacy of Bt maize reduced mycotoxins more than 90 % for fumonisins and more than 50 % for zearalenone although deoxynivalenol was lightly increased. Therefore a competition between the different Fusarium spp. which produced fumonisins or trichothecenes is hypothesized. According to Regulation (EC) No. 1126 / 2007, 93 % of the maize of Bt maize plots were able to be commercialized compared to only 45 % for non-Bt maize plots. The results of this work showed that Bt maize improved food safety and constituted an useful tool to reduce significantly mycotoxin levels in harvested and stored grains...|$|E
40|$|Severe feather-pecking (SFP) is a multifactorial {{behaviour}} whereby birds peck at {{and pull}} out the feathers of conspecifics. It can result in extensive feather loss, wounds, and death in affected birds. Many causal factors {{have been identified in}} contributing to the expression of SFP, yet the underlying motivations for the behaviour are not fully understood. Despite over five decades of research, SFP persists as a highly deleterious and prevalent problem in the egg industry worldwide, with no effective method of control. SFP can occur at extremely high rates, with studies reporting between half and three-quarters of flocks surveyed as affected. SFP therefore represents a significant risk to hen welfare. In the last half century, increased intensification of animal production has taken place. Concurrently over recent years, there has been an increase in non-cage housing systems for laying hens. Since SFP is thought to be socially transmitted throughout a flock, it {{has been found to be}} particularly difficult to control in non-cage systems. SFP is thought to be inversely correlated with use of the outdoor range area, although few studies have investigated this relationship and factors which affect range use. Research to investigate why SFP occurs, and how it may be managed, is critical for the future of the egg industry, as well as hen welfare. Some research suggests that SFP is an abnormal behaviour, and may be used as an animal model for obsessive compulsive disorder in humans. Other studies hypothesise that it is triggered by the inhibition of ground-pecking, a foraging behaviour. Still others suggest that SFP has a nutritional basis, and is primarily performed with the intent to ingest feathers. Fearfulness is thought to play a role in the expression of SFP, but the causal relationship has not been determined, as well as whether the recipients or those performing SFP are more fearful. It is also not clear whether the gentle form of feather-pecking (GFP), which does not cause damage to the birds, acts as a precursor to SFP later in life. SFP has been widely controlled by beak-trimming (BT), whereby the tip of the beak is removed. BT does not address the cause of the behaviour, and is the subject of controversy and banned in a number of countries due to welfare reasons. Its effectiveness has also been questioned. There is a need for research to investigate the current need for BT, and potential alternatives. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction to the topics covered in this thesis. Chapter 2 provides a consolidated review of the research on the motivational basis for SFP, how SFP is affected by the environment, and how feeding behaviour and feather-eating are implicated. It was concluded in chapter 2 that more research should be conducted to investigate types of environmental enrichment (EE) that may enhance foraging behaviours as a method to reduce SFP. In addition, research is required on individual bird variation, and the underlying behavioural characteristics related to the expression of SFP. Further, while feather-eating is thought to be important in the expression of SFP, more research is required to understand the specific role it plays, and why some birds may have a greater appetite for feathers. Chapter 3 studies the effects of BT and EE during the rearing period, and plumage damage due to SFP later in life. Chapter 4 investigates some behavioural traits of pullets during the rearing period, how these are affected by the BT and EE treatments, and whether they may be predictive of SFP later in life. Sixteen pens of 50 ISA Brown laying hens were used (n = 800). The BT and EE treatments were applied in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Half of the birds were BT at 1 d of age using an infra-red laser, and a follow-up light-trim was performed at 11 weeks of age with a hot blade. Half of the birds received EE which comprised pecking strings, whole oats in the litter, and greater litter depth. Four focal birds were selected at random per pen, at 11 days of age (n = 64). In chapter 3, focal birds were subject to in situ behaviour observations from 3 to 14 weeks of age. BT birds performed less ground-pecking (P = 0. 003), less SFP (P = 0. 02) and more GFP (P = 0. 02) than their <b>non-BT</b> <b>counterparts</b> during the rearing period. These birds also exhibited less feather damage at 43 weeks of age (P < 0. 001). EE caused birds to perform more ground-scratching (P = 0. 03) and more dustbathing (P = 0. 01) during the rearing period, but had no effect on plumage damage at 43 weeks of age. There was also no interaction effect of BT and EE on plumage damage. It was concluded that BT was an effective method to control SFP and plumage damage, and while pullet behaviour was modified by EE during rearing, it was not effective in reducing SFP. In chapter 4, focal birds were subjected to well-validated behaviour tests; the open-field test (OFT) and the tonic immobility (TI) test, at 5 and 9 weeks of age, respectively. These tests were performed to estimate fearfulness, coping style, and social motivation. Non-BT birds vocalised more (P = 0. 02) and at louder volumes (P = 0. 02) in the OFT at 5 weeks of age, potentially indicating a higher need for social reinstatement. There were no differences between treatments in their levels of fearfulness, as assessed by the TI test (P = 0. 99). There were no predictive relationships between test responses at 5 weeks of age, and plumage damage at 43 weeks of age when analysed using ordinal regression. It was concluded that while the behavioural tests were not related to plumage damage later in life, BT may cause a decreased need for social reinstatement at a young age. Leading on from chapter 4, chapter 5 investigates some underlying behavioural traits of hens classified as feather-peckers, victims, or controls (n = 70). Focal birds were selected due to their involvement in SFP. Victims were selected due to extensive plumage damage, feather-peckers were selected due to the performance of SFP towards other birds, and controls were selected due to a lack of plumage damage and SFP. Control birds thereby appeared unaffected by SFP. The victims and feather-peckers were in pens in which SFP and plumage damage were evident, whereas the control birds were in pens in which little plumage damage was evident. Focal birds were subjected to an OFT and a TI test in the laying period, between 35 and 42 weeks of age, and observed in their home pens at 43 and 44 weeks of age. Birds in SFP pens performed (P = 0. 01) and received (P 0. 1). In the OFT, feather-peckers made more vocalisations (P < 0. 001) at higher volumes (P < 0. 001) than ‘victims’ of SFP, and also made more escape attempts (P = 0. 03). In the TI test, victims had longer latencies to right themselves than peckers (P < 0. 001). It was concluded that the higher levels of vocalisations and escape attempts made by peckers in the OFT may have been due to greater social motivation. The results of this chapter are therefore in agreement with the findings in chapter 4, that birds performing more SFP may be more socially motivated. When the results from chapters 4 and 5 are considered together, it appears that SFP causes increased fearfulness in victims, rather than fearfulness predisposing birds to perform SFP. Chapter 6 compares feather-eating between six SFP pens and six non-SFP pens (n = 12 pens, 600 hens). SFP was determined by feather-scoring and in situ behaviour observations. A second experiment in chapter 6 investigates the temporal relationship between feather-eating and SFP in 16 pens (n = 800 hens) to determine whether feather-eating may predict SFP. This was done by assessing feather-eating prior to the development of SFP, at 15 weeks of age, and again after SFP was apparent, at 40 weeks of age. In the first experiment, there was a clear relationship between SFP and feather-eating, where birds in pens with plumage damage had a higher probability of feather ingestion (P = 0. 02), and showed shorter latencies to peck at, and ingest loose feathers (P < 0. 001). Birds also ingested feathers from some birds faster than others (P < 0. 001). In the second experiment, birds tended to peck feathers taken from the rump more times than feathers sourced from the back at 40 weeks of age (P = 0. 06). These findings demonstrate that birds may preferentially ingest feathers from some birds and particular body areas. This was in line with anecdotal observations of plumage damage occurring mostly on the rump area. Birds pecked at the feathers more (P < 0. 001), had a higher probability of ingesting feathers (P < 0. 001), and pecked and ingested feathers more quickly (P < 0. 001) at 40 than 15 weeks of age. This suggests that birds had a heightened interest in ingesting feathers once SFP was occurring at an older age, although a predictive relationship was not determined due to a lack of variation in plumage damage between pens in this experiment. Chapter 7 investigates the relationships between fearfulness, plumage damage, and range use. Two pens of 50 hens (n = 100) were fitted with Radio Frequency Identification transponders at 26 weeks of age. The hens’ use of the outdoor range was then tracked continuously over a period of 13 days. Two subpopulations were then identified at the end of the trial: high range users (n = 15) and low range users (n = 15), based on their total time spent outside. These birds were subjected to TI tests and feather-scored at 29 weeks of age. There was no relationship between plumage damage and time spent outside on the range (P = 0. 68), but there was a negative association between TI duration and range use (P = 0. 01). This negative association suggests that fearful birds are less likely to use an outdoor range area. Chapter 7 indicates that Radio Frequency Identification technology provides a potential means for quantifying range use in laying hens, on which there is currently very little information. This thesis supports a relationship between fearfulness and SFP (chapter 5). SFP appeared to cause higher levels of fearfulness in the recipients, rather than fearfulness predisposing birds to perform SFP (chapters 4 and 5). Fearfulness was also negatively associated with time spent on the outside range area (chapter 7). While previous studies have found range use and plumage damage to be inversely correlated, this was not found in chapter 7. The relationships between fearfulness, SFP, and range use warrant further research, particularly in larger flock sizes. Social motivation appears to be implicated in the expression of SFP. Birds that performed more SFP (chapters 3 and 5) also demonstrated higher levels of social motivation in the OFTs (chapters 4 and 5). GFP did not predict plumage damage later in life (chapter 3), but was positively associated with SFP (chapter 5). Results from chapters 3 and 5 do not support the hypothesis that SFP is redirected ground-pecking. BT significantly reduced plumage damage. While there were no effects of EE on plumage damage, it appeared to enhance the behavioural repertoire during the period in which it was provided (chapter 3), and tended to reduce SFP received in the laying period (chapter 5). Feather-eating may play an important role in SFP (chapter 6), although investigation of a predictive relationship was precluded, and future research should focus on elucidating the relationship between feather-eating and SFP. This thesis provides information on: 	The short and longer term effects of EE and its interaction with BT. This knowledge could contribute to the development of appropriate husbandry and housing conditions for laying hens to minimise the expression of SFP. 	Feather-eating and its positive association with SFP. It is suggested that birds may have preferences for feathers from particular body areas and birds. 	Behavioural characteristics of pullets prior to the development of high rates of SFP and plumage damage, the usefulness of behavioural tests as predictors of SFP, and the congruency between two behavioural tests, the OFT and the TI test. 	Behavioural traits in birds expressing SFP compared with victimised birds. This information is important in developing standardised phenotypic characteristics of birds that perform SFP. Associated phenotypic characteristics may be utilised in breeding programs to control SFP on a broader scale. 	Range use, fearfulness, and plumage damage. Little is known about range use, why birds access the range area differentially within a flock, and how it may be related to SFP. Information in this area is therefore important to contribute to the understanding of laying hen behaviour and how best to manage and house laying hen flocks. Therefore, this thesis was successful in 1) increasing the understanding of why SFP occurs; 2) providing information on some of the underlying motivations of birds that perform SFP, 3) providing information on some potential methods for control, and 4) identifying avenues for further research...|$|R
