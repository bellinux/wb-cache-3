5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades. The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river, disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity, irrigation, navigability and other benefits to the region.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion on}} the {{proposed}} project was split. Many residents supported the project, stating it would improve {{the safety of the}} highway; however, others believed that the reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on Culver Road, which runs parallel to NY590 through Irondequoit, and that the roundabouts would make <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> highway difficult.|$|E
5|$|The story follows protagonist Cole MacGrath on {{his quest}} in New Marais to grow {{powerful}} {{enough to be able}} to face his nemesis, the Beast. Cole possesses electricity-based superpowers which are used in combat and <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> city. The player is given several opportunities to use these powers for good or selfish purposes in the game's Karma system. The Karma system affects what powers become available, the reaction of the city's populace towards Cole, and the story.|$|E

5|$|With Finney's help, Mau {{was awarded}} a special {{fellowship}} at the East-West Center. Mau returned to Honolulu in April 1975 to begin work with the Hawaii-based Polynesian Voyaging Society, eventually <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> double-hulled canoe, Hōkūle‘a, from Hawaii to Tahiti on its maiden voyage in 1976. Mau trained and mentored Native Hawaiian navigator Nainoa Thompson, who would later become a master navigator. David Henry Lewis, a scholar of Polynesian navigation, documented Mau's work.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten days}} she was {{returned}} to sea and reached Port Dalrymple {{on the morning of}} 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, {{but there was no sign}} of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E
5|$|Belfast sailed for Portsmouth on 3 August 1939, and was {{commissioned}} on 5 August 1939, {{less than a}} month before the outbreak of the Second World War. Her first captain was Captain G A Scott with a crew of 761, and her first assignment was to the Home Fleet's 2nd Cruiser Squadron. On 14 August, Belfast took part in her first exercise, Operation Hipper, in which she played the role of a German commerce raider attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> hazardous Pentland Firth, Belfast successfully evaded the Home Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Green River is the largest, {{and only}} {{incorporated}} city directly served by I-70 in eastern Utah. Unlike {{the communities of}} the Sevier Valley, Green River was founded as a stopover for travelers along transcontinental arteries. The area was first used as a stopover for travelers <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> Green River. Later the town was formed to serve travelers along the Old Spanish Trail and stagecoach mail routes. Green River was an established stopover {{by the time the}} railroad and later highways were built through the area.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> main character, Tidus, {{around the world to}} interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.|$|E

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Atlus and Lancarse for the Nintendo DS. It {{was released in}} Japan in 2009, and in North America in 2010. The game is the fourth entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which forms {{the core of the}} Megami Tensei franchise. The story follows a special task force sent by the United Nations to investigate the Schwarzwelt, a spatial distortion that appears in Antarctica and threatens to engulf the world. Players take control of an unnamed protagonist, <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> environments of the Schwarzwelt in first-person. Combat involves the player and recruited demons fighting against various enemies, with the protagonist having the option of talking with and recruiting enemies.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{includes}} a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively {{play the game}} by taking turns at <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player {{has the opportunity to}} steal the cards of another but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} input and display methods for users of varying {{abilities}} {{to make use}} of SGDs.

5|$|Time Gal is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> course.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E

5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, operations management (or production management), strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for management information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in <b>navigating</b> <b>the</b> discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.|$|E
