40|$|The {{case for}} taxing <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> merely {{to raise more}} {{revenues}} from the financial sector is not particularly strong. Better alternatives to tax the financial sector {{are likely to be}} available. However, a tax on <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> could be justified in order to limit socially undesirable transactions when more direct means of doing so are unavailable for political or practical reasons. Some <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> are indeed likely to do more harm than good, especially when they contribute to the systemic risk of the financial system. However, such a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax should be very small, much smaller than the negative externalities in question, because it is a blunt instrument that also drives out socially useful transactions. There is a case for taxing over-the-counter derivative transactions at a somewhat higher rate than exchange-based derivative transactions.

Background and Problem Discussion: There are challenges associated with overly cash based societies. The use of mobile financial systems could {{address some of}} these challenges. Understanding {{the factors that influence}} people’s willingness to use mobile systems for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> could be significant in developing strategies to transition from traditional payment systems to mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> systems. Purpose – The purpose of this is to assess contribution of customer trust and perception of customer focus to the willingness of GSM subscribers to use the mobile system for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> and how the understanding derived from these factors can be used to develop strategies to promote a transition from cashed based society to mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Method- Quantitative and deductive approach was used. 300 GSM respondents who were selected with a multistage sampling method in three locations were surveyed. Interviewers were used to get data on perceived customer focus level, customer trust and willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Theory – Theory section looks at the concepts relating to customer trust and customer perception of customer focus and pertinent subconstructs applicable to the engagement in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Analysis – I have used correlational analysis to verify the level of association between customer trust, customer focus perception, socio demographic factors and the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> In order to verify the influence of income, a non parametric test was done. Conclusions – The analysis of the data results showed that there is a strong positive association between the willingness to use mobile for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Also, the analysis revealed a positive correlation between the perception of customer focus by subscribers and the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> There was <b>no</b> significant influence by demographic factors such as age and gender on the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> A 3 phased implementation strategy was proposed for the deployment of a mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> system...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, the movement advocating for a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax gained considerable support, culminating in the presentation of a proposal for such a tax by the European Commission on September 28, 2011. This thesis researches and analyzes the use of a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax in light of the stated purpose of the Commission’s proposal. The primary goals of the tax are to (1) raise revenue, (2) curb excessive volatility, and (3) harmonize the internal market. Taxes are most commonly implemented for their revenue-raising qualities rather than as tools for remedying market distortions. In contrast, many view the primary function of the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax as a regulatory tool to minimize excessive risk taking in financial markets. Although this thesis will analyze the potential effects on revenue and the tax’s ability to contribute to harmonization of the internal market, the primary focus is on the volatility-reducing effect regulatory authorities can expect from implementing such a tax. Although the thesis will use the European Commission proposal for a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax as its starting point, it will also review other variations on the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. The thesis will also present alternative measures that should be considered for achieving the goals set forth by the European Commission in lieu of, or in addition to, a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax, and evaluate these measures in light of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. The thesis concludes that while a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction,</b> in theory, may seem like a dynamic solution that could accomplish several different goals, a multifaceted approach tailored to each individual issue is likely to create a more strategic solution in the long run. A more narrowly tailored strategy is also less likely to negatively affect GDP and trading patterns than a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax...|$|R
