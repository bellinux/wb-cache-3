However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, {{it does not}} have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in analogy to the earlier actinides. While its behaviour is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very distinct from its lighter congeners in group 3, it is likely to pose a limit to the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be purely a formal matter. Like its lighter congeners, unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the battle {{is a matter of}} dispute. English Heritage considers the location to be what is now arable land within parkland at Boconnoc that was common grazing land in 1643.

25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} are eventually deposited from the stratosphere onto land and ocean.

25|$|The airport {{purchased}} {{land from}} the Tasmanian Government {{in the southern part}} of the airport for future development of operational facilities. This additional area would allow for a short runway for general aviation aircraft, either parallel to the main runway along the southern end of the eastern boundary of the airport, or a cross runway towards the southern end of the main runway. The alternative second runway would provide an opportunity to improve the operational management of the lighter categories of aircraft. However, the second runway is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed any time soon, because the existing runway is under-utilised.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{frontier of}} this age was also explained in Kojiki as the legend of Shido Shogun's (四道将軍: Shoguns to four ways) expedition. Out of four shoguns, Ōbiko set northward to Koshi and his son Take Nunakawawake set to eastern states. The father moved east from northern Koshi while the son moved north on his way, and they finally met at Aizu (current western Fukushima). Although the legend itself is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a historical fact, Aizu is rather close to southern Tōhoku, where {{the north end of}} keyhole kofun culture as of the late 4th century is located.|$|E

Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.|$|E
25|$|Red {{pondweed}} is {{a reasonably}} distinctive plant and is <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confused {{with any other}} pondweed. Early in the growing season it could be confused with P. polygonifolius, but the submerged leaves of the latter have petioles and are relatively longer. P. praelongus is generally greener with noticeably white, zig-zagged stems that generally branch, never produces floating leaves, and its submerged leaves clasp the stem. Fresh specimens often, but not always, show a reddish tint, but this becomes much more obvious in dried material. Despite its name it is neither restricted to alpine regions or unique among pondweeds in having a reddish colouration.|$|E
