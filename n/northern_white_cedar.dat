This is despite the Labor Day Storm of 1998, a derecho which destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The sugar maple accounts for 14.2 percent of Syracuse's trees, followed by the <b>Northern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> (9.8 percent) and the European buckthorn (6.8 percent).|$|E

2500|$|A mixed {{hardwood}} forest covers {{most of the}} park, chiefly paper birch and quaking aspen with occasional white spruce, eastern white pine, balsam fir, <b>northern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> poplar, and black ash. A more boreal forest appears on ridges and slopes, with black spruce joining the previously listed conifers intermixed with additional birch and aspen. [...] Bottomlands near the river support black and green ash as well as white cedar, white spruce, and yellow birch.|$|E

2500|$|With an {{elevation}} change of , Judge C. R. Magney State Park supports {{a wide variety}} of flora and fauna. [...] Overall the park contains Laurentian Mixed Forest comprising both conifers and broadleafs. [...] Before European settlement the Brule River Valley would have been forested mostly with white pine. [...] Extensive logging and forest fires have altered the park's vegetation significantly, except around the rocky and inaccessible ridgetops. [...] Today's secondary forest is dominated by aspen and birch, with stands of white spruce, sugar maple, and basswood. [...] There are a few remnant stands of white pine on hilltops and ravines, especially along Gauthier Creek. [...] Large <b>northern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedars</b> are abundant along the river. [...] Inland are many dense stands of white spruce, the result of planting and vigorous natural reseeding after the timber harvests. [...] Around the waterfalls, the constant mist creates a microclimate conducive to several plant species not found elsewhere in the park.|$|R
2500|$|Cowles Bog Trail {{is reached}} off of North Mineral Springs Road. Parking {{is to the}} east of the guard shack for Dune Acres. This [...] loop {{is one of the most}} rugged trails in the park. Visitors begin with a long level walk {{skirting}} the wetlands of the Cowles Bog complex and the dune ridges to the north. Following the first fork to the north, they must climb through the dunes until they reach Lake Michigan. This is one of the least crowded areas of the park. Upon return, visitors can take the west part of the loop. Again through the dunes, covered with <b>northern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedars,</b> black oaks and a variety of trees, visitors will again see inter-dunal wetlands, the open beach, and the long, flat Cowles Bog wetland complex. To complete the full , visitors need to continue west around the wetlands to the parking area at Mineral Sprroad crossing, with parking available at Mineral Springs Road, Dune Park station, Calumet Dunes Trail Park, and at U.S. 12, where it crosses the South Shore Tracks, just west of Michigan City.|$|R
2500|$|The Misquah Hills are thickly forested, {{though there}} are granite {{outcrops}} and exposed bedrock in many places. [...] The forest cover consists largely of balsam fir and varieties of spruce; eastern white pine, red pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and <b>northern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> are also common in the area. [...] The Misquahs are part in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province, a transition zone between boreal forest {{to the north and}} broadleaf forests to the south.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{coniferous}} swamp communities intermix {{in areas}} of peaty soil in the park. [...] Black spruce bogs have a dense canopy of black spruce, a shrub layer of black spruce and speckled alder, an understory of bog Labrador tea or leatherleaf depending on shadiness, and a ground cover of sphagnum. [...] Tamarack bogs have an open canopy of tamarack with plenty of black spruce, a shrub layer of speckled alder and dwarf birch, and a very dense understory of leatherleaf with bog-laurel and bog-rosemary over sphagnum. [...] White cedar swamps are characterized by <b>northern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> with black spruce and balsam fir, dense speckled alder shrubs, and less understory and sphagnum than the other communities.|$|E

5000|$|With an {{elevation}} change of 1000 ft, Judge C. R. Magney State Park supports {{a wide variety}} of flora and fauna.

Extensive logging and forest fires have altered the park's vegetation significantly, except around the rocky and inaccessible ridgetops.

[...] Inland are many dense stands of white spruce, the result of planting and vigorous natural reseeding after the timber harvests. [...] Around the waterfalls, the constant mist creates a microclimate conducive to several plant species not found elsewhere in the park. The large mammals found in the park, particularly in the remote northern section, are white-tailed deer, moose, black bears, red foxes, and timber wolves. Smaller mammals include groundhogs, red squirrels, eastern chipmunks, martens, and snowshoe hares. [...] Broad-winged hawks, barred owls, and great horned owls are prevalent, while many other raptor species pass through the park during their migration. Several species of warblers nest in the park. [...] The Brule River and its tributary Gauthier Creek have spawning runs of rainbow trout in spring and salmon in the fall. White-tailed deer are not endemic to northern Minnesota, having expanded into the region {{to take advantage of the}} plant regrowth during the logging period. In the 1940s and 1950s there were as many as 300 deer per square mile. The population has dropped as the forest has matured, but the deer still pose a management challenge as they overgraze young trees of certain species, over time altering the composition of the forest. [...] The park has fenced deer exclosures around reseeded white pines.|$|R

The <b>white</b> <b>cedars</b> often grow from pools of standing water and, {{in contrast to the}} surrounding pine forests, considerably darken the understory. Amid the <b>white</b> <b>cedars</b> are red maple (Acer rubrum), sour gum (Nyssa sylvatica), pitch pine, and sweet bay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana). In openings and edges grow highbush blueberry, dangleberry, swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum), fetterbush (Eubotrys racemosa), and leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata). Sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), inkberry (Ilex glabra), and winterberry (Ilex verticillata) are also present.|$|R

The purpose of the proposed action is to regenerate Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> stands in degraded condition to ensure the stands are not replaced with hardwood stands. This project is needed because the results of forest inventories have indicated competition-induced mortality and declining conditions of the Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> stands on the Dare County Range.
