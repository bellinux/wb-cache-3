There's a whole underworld to the New York building scene that exists in the basements that most people are unaware of. They make it all possible, and you just <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> It's fascinating." ...|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out {{in the middle of}} the desert you would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E
500|$|By 1909, {{the bell}} had made six trips, {{and not only}} had the {{cracking}} become worse, but souvenir hunters had deprived it of over one percent of its weight. When, in 1912, {{the organizers of the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, the city was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally decided to let it go as the bell had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to bring it to millions who might <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> otherwise. However, in 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride, the city installed a metal support structure inside the bell, generally called the [...] "spider." [...] In February 1915, the bell was tapped gently with wooden mallets to produce sounds which were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission which also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service. Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west. It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home; again, five million saw it on the return journey. Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after World War I, and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003. Chicago and San Francisco had obtained its presence after presenting petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of children. Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4million schoolchildren, for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Both efforts failed.|$|E

2500|$|Another foreign {{threat that}} Abas steadfastly confronted was an {{invasion}} by king Ber of Abkhazia in 943: a new church {{had been completed}} in Kars under Abas' orders and prior to its consecration, Ber had appeared with an army along the river of the Araxes, demanding that the new church be consecrated under Chalcedonian rite. Abas refused to make any concessions and ambushed Ber's forces in a dawn assault. Several more skirmishes took place, wherein Ber was finally captured by Abas' men. Abas took the king to his new church {{and told him that}} he would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> again, [...] him and sending him back to Abkhazia. Abas died in 953, leaving his kingdom to his two sons, Ashot III and Mushegh.|$|E
2500|$|Luise, {{the wife}} of Alfred Jodl, {{attached}} herself to her husband's defense team. Subsequently, interviewed by Gitta Sereny, researching her biography of Albert Speer, Luise alleged that in many instances the Allied prosecution made charges against Jodl based on documents that they refused {{to share with the}} defense. Jodl nevertheless proved some of the charges made against him were untrue, such as the charge that he helped Hitler gain control of Germany in 1933. He was in one instance aided by a GI clerk who chose to give Luise a document showing that the execution of a group of British commandos in Norway had been legitimate. The GI warned Luise that if she didn't copy it immediately she would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E
