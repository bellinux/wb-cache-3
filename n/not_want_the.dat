5|$|Burton Pynsent House is a {{historic}} country-house in Britain, situated in the parish of Curry Rivel, Somerset, England. It is a Grade II* listed building. The house was built in stages between 1565 and 1765, when it was bequeathed to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Pynsent, who did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> house to go to Lord North. Pitt had an additional wing built to a design by Lancelot Brown, and the subsequent owner demolished everything but this wing in 1805.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> writers, mostly young children, to be disappointed at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E

5|$|The band did not {{consider}} the album to be important and only Glover and Paice showed up to mix it. According to Birch, Gillan and Blackmore have never heard the finished album. The band did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> album to be released outside Japan and wanted full rights to the tapes, but it was released worldwide anyway.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E

5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> {{babies to}} die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E

It is <b>not</b> <b>wanted,</b> <b>the</b> more's the pity." ...|$|R
5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} {{health was}} {{a constant source of}} worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E
5|$|However, the King did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> house himself, and {{he offered}} it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to {{the high cost of}} maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
50|$|Aebh died and, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>the</b> {{children}} to remain motherless, Bodb sent {{another of his}} daughters, Aoife, to marry Ler. Aoife grew jealous {{of the children and}} cursed them to live as swans for 900 years.|$|R

The King of Chu did not know about his talents and sent him to care for the animals instead.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising the Jack Russell terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, {{the size of the}} breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.|$|E
5|$|McEntee {{has sought}} to raise {{awareness}} of suicide-related issues since her father's death, and in 2013 joined the launch of a suicide prevention campaign by the Pieta House charity, aimed at educating rural communities about the early warning signs of suicide. She also took part in a sponsored walk from Dublin to Navan for the See the Light campaign, which seeks {{to raise awareness of}} mental health issues. However, she told the Irish Independent that she does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> focus to be on her father's death every time she attends a suicide prevention event.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} events to take place in Hyde Park was the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was constructed {{on the south side of}} the park. The public did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> building to remain after the closure of the exhibition, and its architect, Joseph Paxton, raised funds and purchased it. He had it moved to Sydenham Hill in South London. Another significant event was the first Victoria Cross investiture, on 26 June 1857, when 62 men were decorated by Queen Victoria in the presence of Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family, including their future son-in-law Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, later Emperor Frederick III.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> {{responsibility}} of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E
