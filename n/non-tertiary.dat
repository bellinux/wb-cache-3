50|$|Similar to {{the early}} years of EM in the United States, {{emergency}} department physicians in Brazil come from different specialty backgrounds, many of them having taken the job as a form of supplementary income or as a result of unsuccessful private clinical practice. Since 50% of medical school graduates in Brazil do not get residency positions, these new physicians with minimal clinical training look for work in emergency departments. In larger tertiary hospitals, the ED is divided into the main specialty areas, internal medicine, surgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, and staffed by the corresponding physicians. Still, significant delays in care can occur when patients are inappropriately triaged or when communication between the areas is inadequate. In the <b>non-tertiary</b> care centers, which make up the majority of hospitals in the country, emergency department physicians are largely under-trained, underpaid and overstressed by their working conditions.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to assess the accuracy of pediatric echocardiograms done at <b>non-tertiary</b> centers and to evaluate the relationship of inaccurate interpretations with age, echocardiogram performer and complexity of congenital heart disease (CHD). Materials and Methods: The echocardiogram reports of 182 consecutive children with CHD (5 days- 16 years) who were evaluated at a <b>non-tertiary</b> center and subsequently referred to our center were reviewed. Age of the child at echocardiogram, echocardiogram performer and complexity of CHD were noted. These reports were compared with echocardiogram done at our center. Discrepancies were noted and categorized. To assess our own error rate, we compared our echocardiogram reports with the findings obtained during surgery (n = 172), CT scan (n = 9) or cardiac catheterization reports (n = 1). Results: Most of the children at the <b>non-tertiary</b> center (92 %) underwent echocardiogram by personnel other than a pediatric cardiologist. Overall, diagnostic errors were found in 69 / 182 (38 %) children. Moderate and major discrepancies affecting the final management were found in 42 / 182 (23 %) children. Discrepancies were higher when the echocardiogram was done by personnel other than pediatric cardiologist (P 1 year of age.

40|$|Aim. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the prevalence and characteristics of workplace violence directed at a volunteer sample of nurses at one <b>non-tertiary</b> hospital. Respondents' reasons for not reporting these incidents were also investigated. Background. Incidents of workplace violence are increasing worldwide. However, no studies have investigated this phenomenon {{from the perspective of}} nurses in Western Australian <b>non-tertiary</b> hospitals. Design. Survey. Method. A survey was distributed to all 332 nurses working in several areas of one <b>non-tertiary</b> hospital in Western Australia to determine their experiences of workplace violence over a 12 month period. Findings. Of the 113 nurses who agreed to participate in this study, 75 % reported experiencing workplace violence in the previous twelve months. When asked about their most recent incident, 50 % of the nurses said they had reported it verbally, mostly to more senior staff. Only 16 % of the nurses completed an official incident report. Reasons for not reporting included the view that WPV is just part of the job and the perception that management would not be responsive. Conclusion. This study showed that for this sample of nurses violent events are occurring at a rate that is similar to those reported in other studies. This finding should be of great concern to the organisation and the community in general. Relevance to clinical practice. Organisations are obliged to improve the safety of the workplace environment for both staff and patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Continuous {{positive}} airway pressure (CPAP) is used widely {{to provide}} respiratory support for neonates, {{and is often}} the first treatment choice in tertiary centres. Recent trials have demonstrated that CPAP reduces need for intubation and ventilation for infants born at 25 - 28 weeks gestation, and at > 32 weeks, in <b>non-tertiary</b> hospitals, CPAP reduces need for transfer to NICU. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine recent population trends in the use of neonatal continuous positive airway pressure. Methods We undertook a population-based cohort study of all 696, 816 liveborn neonates ≥ 24 weeks gestation in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, 2001 - 2008. Data were obtained from linked birth and hospitalizations records, including neonatal transfers. The primary outcome was CPAP without mechanical ventilation (via endotracheal intubation) between birth and discharge from the hospital system. Analyses were stratified by age ≤ 32 and > 32 weeks gestation. Results Neonates receiving any ventilatory support increased from 1, 480 (17. 9 / 1000) in 2001 to 2, 486 (26. 9 / 1000) in 2008, including 461 (5. 6 / 1000) to 1, 465 (15. 8 / 1000) neonates who received CPAP alone. There was a concurrent decrease in mechanical ventilation use from 12. 3 to 11. 0 / 1000. The increase in CPAP use was greater among neonates > 32 weeks (from 3. 2 to 11. 8 / 1000) compared with neonates ≤ 32 weeks (from 18. 1 to 32. 7 / 1000). The proportion of CPAP > 32 weeks initiated in <b>non-tertiary</b> hospitals increased from 6 % to 30 %. Conclusions The use of neonatal CPAP is increasing, especially > 32 weeks gestation and among <b>non-tertiary</b> hospitals. Recommendations are required regarding which infants should be considered for CPAP, resources necessary for a unit to offer CPAP and monitoring of longer term outcomes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Nasal high-flow (nHF) {{therapy is}} a popular mode of {{respiratory}} support for newborn infants. Evidence for nHF use is predominantly from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). There are no randomised trials of nHF use in <b>non-tertiary</b> special care nurseries (SCNs). We hypothesise that nHF is non-inferior to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as primary support for newborn infants with respiratory distress, in the population cared for in <b>non-tertiary</b> SCNs. Methods and analysis The HUNTER trial is an unblinded Australian multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial. Infants are eligible if born at a gestational age ¿ 31 weeks with birth weight ¿ 1200 g and admitted to a participating <b>non-tertiary</b> SCN, are 1 hour. Infants are randomised to treatment with either nHF or CPAP. The primary outcome is treatment failure within 72 hours of randomisation, as determined by objective oxygenation, apnoea or blood gas criteria or by a clinical decision that urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation, or transfer to a tertiary NICU, is required. Secondary outcomes include incidence of pneumothorax requiring drainage, duration of respiratory support, supplemental oxygen and hospitalisation, costs associated with hospital care, cost-effectiveness, parental stress and satisfaction and nursing workload. Ethics and dissemination Multisite ethical approval for the study has been granted by The Royal Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (Trial Reference No. 34222), and by each participating site.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} labour market integration of ex-Yugoslav immigrants in two European countries - Austria and Sweden - {{in terms of the}} relevant structural characteristics of the two societies, i. e. immigration and citizenship policies, labour market structure and welfare regimes, focusing {{on the role of the}} period of migration and the effect of citizenship acquisition on labour market outcomes. Austrian 1996 micro census and Swedish 1997 labour force survey data are utilized to explore the labour market attainment of former Yugoslav citizens in Austria and Sweden in terms of the four outcomes: labour force participation, unemployment, industrial concentration and occupational status. The results of the multivariate analysis show that in Sweden activity rates of all Yugoslav immigrants are substantially lower than those of the socio-demographically comparable native-born national population, while in Austria, Yugoslavs exhibit trends of labour force participation similar to native Austrians. If successful in finding a job, Yugoslav immigrants of the most recent immigrant wave in Sweden managed to enter on average more prestigious occupations as compared to their compatriots in Austria, but are disadvantaged when compared to the native-born in both countries. Furthermore, in addition to the obvious segregation of the guest workers¿ wave in the <b>non-tertiary</b> sectors in both Sweden and Austria, over-representation of the most recent Yugoslav immigrants in the <b>non-tertiary</b> sector in Austria is evident. Focusing on the effect of the citizenship acquisition, the study proves that in Sweden, a country of permanent migration, citizenship per se does not influence labour market outcomes, when controlling for period of migration. In Austria, non-citizens have higher probability of labour force participation, higher risks of employment in <b>non-tertiary</b> sector and lower occupational status when controlling for the period of migration and socio-demographic charact...|$|E
