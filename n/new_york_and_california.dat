5|$|Life Is Good is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American rapper Nas. It was recorded at various studios in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>California,</b> and produced primarily by No I.D. and Salaam Remi. Nas wrote the album after his divorce from recording artist Kelis and {{compared it to}} Marvin Gaye's 1978 record Here, My Dear. He wanted to vent personal feelings and address moments in his life in his songs, while drawing on 1980s hip hop influences for the album's production in order to complement its nostalgic tone.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>California</b> alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life.|$|E

25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in {{the waning days of}} the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>California.</b> These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of the}} campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to go where the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E

Matthew Fazzi of Facing New York joined Taking Back Sunday in early 2008. He was praised by vocalist Adam Lazzara and the group's manager for incorporating new instruments into the group's sound. Guitarist Eddie Reyes called the album [...] "one of the most aggressive records we've ever written". Towards the end of 2008, the group revealed the album's title, went on a US tour, and made [...] "Carpathia" [...] available for streaming.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the large}} parcels of land {{available}} and the grid road pattern, Gulfton was well-suited {{for the construction of}} large apartment complexes. In the 1960s, a number of large apartment buildings were built. More complexes were added during the 1970s as Houston prospered from the oil boom. These apartments catered to young, predominantly Caucasian workers from the Rust Belt regions of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States employed in the burgeoning oil industry. Americans came from the South, the Midwest, <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>and</b> <b>California</b> to live in the area of complexes. The complexes also housed some individuals from western and eastern Europe, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South America, and Vietnam. Few native Houstonians lived in the housing complexes. The apartments were given names meant to be fancy, such as [...] "Napoleon Square" [...] and [...] "Chateau Carmel." [...] Some complexes gave free videocassette recorders to renters who signed leases for one year.|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} to ponder his senate race decision; {{when he had}} dinner with Nathan on May 12, they were trailed by a flock of photographers. [...] Giuliani canceled campaigning and fundraising trips to upstate <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>California</b> on May 13, suggesting he would not run, but then resumed fundraising and suggested he was inclined towards running on May 15. [...] Two Republican county chairmen became upset at the indecision, saying, [...] "Like Waiting for Godot, we have Waiting for Rudy", and, [...] "We need a decision. Like tomorrow would be nice. Because this is getting ridiculous." [...] A top state Republican said, [...] "He seem to like the attention. He {{seems to be going}} through some sort of catharsis in public. And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it out. I don't think anybody can." [...] Clinton, meanwhile, said as little as possible about the situation, preferring to let Giuliani's drama play out on its own; on May 17, as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides, she won the unanimous approval of delegates to the Democratic Party state convention at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent.|$|E

500|$|On September 30, {{hoping to}} {{separate}} {{himself from the}} policies of the Johnson administration at the advice of O'Brien who noted that he needed the anti-war vote to win in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>California,</b> Humphrey delivered a televised speech in Salt Lake City to a nationwide audience, and announced that if he was elected, he would {{put an end to the}} bombing of North Vietnam, and called for a ceasefire. He labeled the new policy [...] "as an acceptable risk for peace." [...] The plan was compared to Nixon's, which the candidate stated would not be revealed until Inauguration Day. After the speech, anti-war protesters stopped shadowing Humphrey's appearances, and a few McCarthy supporters joined the campaign. Donations totaling $300,000 were immediately made to Humphrey, and he also improved in the polls, cutting Nixon's lead to single digits by mid-October. Meanwhile, Nixon tried to shift the emphasis of the campaign to the issue of law and order, and declared that a vote for Humphrey, would amount to [...] "a vote to continue a lackadaisical, do nothing attitude toward the crime crisis in America." [...] While campaigning in San Antonio, Humphrey went on the attack against Nixon. He accused the Republican nominee of playing politics with human rights, and claimed that he was [...] "on the road to defeat." [...] Hoping to gain favor among the Hispanic community, Humphrey alleged that Nixon had never discussed the concerns of Hispanic-Americans during the course of the campaign. Nixon continued to tie Humphrey to Johnson. He argued that the administration was playing politics with the Vietnam War by trying to complete a treaty before the election to favor the Vice President. Humphrey fired back at Nixon's allegations, stating that the former Vice President was using [...] "the old Nixon tactic of unsubstantiated insinuation" [...] and requested that he show evidence for his claims. Humphrey challenged Nixon to a series of presidential debates, but the Republican nominee declined, largely due to his uncomfortable experience at the 1960 presidential debates, and to deny recognition to the populist American Independent Party candidate, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, who would have been included at the event. Both the Humphrey and Nixon campaigns were concerned that Wallace would take a sizable amount of states in the electoral college and force the House of Representatives to decide the election. Although Wallace had focused most of his campaign on the south, he was drawing large crowds during appearances in the north. Both campaigns delegated a large amount of resources to denounce Wallace as a [...] "frustrated segregationist". As election day neared, Wallace fell in the polls, greatly diminishing the chance that he would influence the result.|$|E
