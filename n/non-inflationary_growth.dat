However, in 1986, he returned to government service and was appointed as the Secretary to the Government. By then, he believed Nigeria needed economic re-structuring. In 1985, prior to his appointment, the military sought public opinion of an IMF economic structuring proposal as a condition for external credit from the fund, the popular opinion was to reject the proposal. The administration then came up with Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). SAP was a proposal to diversify export from a crude oil dependent regime, ensure fiscal and balance of payments equilibrium and <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth.</b> The mechanisms to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives were the devaluation of the naira, reduction of petroleum products subsidies and trade liberalization.

40|$|The {{advanced}} welfare state, {{which became}} one of the hallmarks of the "Golden Age" of post-war prosperity, implied more than a mere upgrading of existing social policies in the developed industrial world. In the broadest of terms, it represented an effort to bring about economic, moral and political reconstruction. Economically, it departed from the orthodoxies of the pure market nexus and required the extension of income and employment security as a right of citizenship. Morally, it sought to defend the ideas of social justice, solidarity and universalism. Politically, the welfare state formed part of a project of nation building, affirming liberal democracy against the twin perils of fascism and bolshevism. Many countries became self-proclaimed welfare states, not so much to give a label to their social policies as to foster national social integration. In today's globally integrated open economies, however, many of the assumptions that guided post-war welfare state construction in the advanced industrial world seem no longer to obtain. <b>Non-inflationary</b> demand-led <b>growth</b> within one country now appears impossible; services rather than manufacturing must assure full employment; the population is rapidly aging; the conventional family, relying on the male breadwinner, is in decline; and the life course is both changing and diversifying.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{account of}} rising household indebtedness in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada claims that current economic stimuli, namely low nominal {{interest rates and}} rising property markets, are the key reasons debt has grown so rapidly since the mid- 1990 s. By drawing on key theoretical assumptions from neoclassical economics, policy makers have argued that rising debt levels since the mid- 1990 s shows that households are rational agents taking advantage of cheaper credit to purchase assets; thus, the equilibrating effect of market society translates into a balance between rising debt and rising assets. This article puts forward an alternative framework for evaluating potential contributing factors of rising household indebtedness in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada by evaluating the long-term impacts of policies implemented to achieve <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth.</b> Using a neo-Gramscian method of analysing historical structures, {{it is argued that}} growing household indebtedness was not an inevitable outcome of the policy of <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth.</b> Instead, it was most likely a product of a confluence of forces as rising demand for credit by households (due to downward pressure on wages) combined with increased supply of credit (as banks sought profitable returns in a liberalised market) to generate indebtedness.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} features of the American economy is its strongly enforced separation of fiscal and monetary policymaking powers. While a number of countries have adopted this division of labor in economic policymaking, the Federal Reserve was the first central bank to explicitly enumerate its independence from the sway of the elected legislature in its founding documents, and this separation has doubtless helped the American economy achieve <b>non-inflationary</b> economic <b>growth</b> over the expanse of the 20 th century. By not giving fiscal policymakers control over the money supply, the US avoids the temptation of paying off deficits by printing money – a deadly trap that, if left unchecked, can result in severe hyperinflation. However, the separation of economic policymaking powers is not without a tradeoff: the independent actions of Congress and the Federal Reserve could result in a mix of uncoordinated policies, as both fiscal and monetary forces attempt to pull the economy in opposite directions. The implications of such divergent policy mixes are not trivial, as they could potentially slow the economy’s long term growth rate or cause unwanted surges in inflation.

Specifically, it looks at the stability of a financeled regime of accumulation {{on the basis of the}} digital production paradigm. Some basic causal relationships of such a regime, especially the investment-profits, wealth-profits, and wealth-consumption connections, seem too fragile to be able to support the assertion that a stable new regime of accumulation has emerged. Furthermore, the New Economy thesis suffers from serious problems in measuring productivity in the service industries. Therefore, it seems just as plausible that the long “Clinton” expansion was a singular event made possible by the special position the U. S. enjoys in the world economy.

Through the case study of the country most dependent on foreign energy supply both during the Bretton Woods years and after the demise of currency convertibility, we follow the U.

We aim to shed light on the linkage between the development of capital intensive sectors and the American aim to make the reintegration of each advanced industrial economy in the postwar system of international economic relations revolve around the combining <b>non-inflationary</b> domestic economic <b>growth</b> and stable external equilibrium, including both foreign exchange stability and sound terms of trade. We make the argument that the U. S. pursued this combination both during and after the collapse of Bretton Woods international monetary arrangements by drawing upon a flow of high capital intensive technology transfer. Furthermore, while focusing only on the period prior to floating currencies in the 1970 s, this article maintains that Washington carried out this foreign economic policy both under the Bretton Woods regime and after its demise, through foreign exchange adjustments and financial assistance programs respectively. After reviewing how the leading literature on the history of U. S. foreign economic policy has portrayed it so far, we focus attention on the Italian case to explore the hypothesis that both under Bretton Woods and after its collapse a very close interlocking was established between exchange rate regimes and the U. S. policy of technology transfer. Through the case study of Italy, we make the argument that prior to the deterioration of fixed exchange rate arrangements Washington provided Rome with technological assistance to target the twin objective of advancing expansionary internal economic policies and pushing forward an ever-rising level of international economic integration of her partner industrial economies. We frame this reconstruction on the decades prior to currency floating before a broader interpretation about the meanings of U.

40|$|The world-wide {{economic}} upswing and {{the improvement in}} the competitive position of Austria's economy in 1997 resulted in an export boom, which also stimulated investment activity. Domestic demand remained sluggish, however, {{in the wake of}} the government's stern consolidation drive. Inflation was dampened by the weakness in consumer demand and the effects of Austria's entry into the EU; unemployment continued its upward trend despite the increase in employment. In 1997, Austria enjoyed a strong, <b>non-inflationary</b> expansion. Economic <b>growth</b> accelerated to 2. 5 percent (after 1. 6 percent in 1996), attaining the medium-term growth trend. The pick-up in economic activity was mainly driven by the favorable performance of the export sector. Strong growth in Austria's export markets, as well as the improvement in the economy's price-determined competitive position, triggered an export boom. Lively export demand boosted manufacturing output (4. 6 percent) and stimulated spending on capital goods. Owing to various special factors such as clement weather in the winter season and the dissolution of rental reserves, the construction industry also recorded output gains; private and public consumption barely exceeded the level of 1996, however. Domestic demand was depressed by the public sector's austerity policies, but the effect of the near-stagnation in disposable income was muted by a hefty decline in the saving ratio and a rise in profits {{in the wake of the}} export boom. The financial deficit of the general government declined to 2. 5 percent of GDP in 1997. Thus, Austria easily met the fiscal criteria for membership in the Economic and Monetary Union. The deficit in the current account stabilized at a level of about ATS 47. 7 billion (or 1. 9 percent of GDP). The deficit poses no serious threat because it is related to net payments to the EU and deficits in the transfer balance rather than being the result of a deterioration in the international competitive position. The pick-up in economic activity had positive effects on the performance of the labor market. Dependent employment (excluding persons in military service and on parental leave) rose by 12, 800 in 1997, with most of the gains, however, stemming from part-time work. For the manufacturing sector, a more sanguine development can be reported: the long-term decline in the number of jobs finally came to a halt at the end of 1997. Price stability was maintained despite the {{economic upswing}}. With a rate of 1. 3 percent, inflation reached a record low in 1997. The price-dampening effects of Austria's membership in the EU were increasingly recorded in service prices; moreover, the ample supply in housing lowered rental prices for newly rented apartments. In an international comparison, the performance of the Austrian economy is quite impressive: in 1997, economic growth was as high as in the EU on average, but by ¼ percentage point higher than in Germany. Even during the period 1990 - 1997, economic growth in Austria kept up with that in the EU; this suggests that Austria's economy coped well with the financial turbulence of the 1990 s, the opening of the East and accession to the EU. The rates of inflation and of unemployment are relatively low. On the downside, however, the sluggish structural adjustment as well as the stubborn budget and current account deficits must be noted.

Though a decrease in inflation explains part of the fall in nominal interest rates, there is also a clear downtrend in real interest rates. Against this backdrop, a debate has emerged over the factors that might have contributed to this decline. Potential persistent factors discussed under the heading of "secular stagnation" include a decline in profitable investment opportunities and high global savings rates. It is often argued that, due to these factors, the so-called natural interest rate, which is the level of interest rate consistent with stable, <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth,</b> has decreased. However, there are also arguments that the low interest rates are transitory and are due to factors such as post-crisis private debt deleveraging, a temporary "savings glut", or higher regulatory burdens for firms and households.

40|$|Commodity prices play an {{important}} role in economic developments in most of the 24 Western and Central African (WCA) countries covered in this paper. It is confirmed that in the light of rising commodity prices between 1999 and 2005, net oil exporters recorded strong growth rates while net oil-importing countries – albeit benefiting from increases in their major non-oil commodity export prices – displayed somewhat lower growth. For most WCA economies, inflation rates appear less affected by commodity price changes and more determined by exchange rate regimes as well as monetary and fiscal policies. While passthrough effects from international to domestic energy prices were significant, notably in oilimporting countries, second-round effects on overall prices seem limited. Governments of oil-rich countries reacted prudently to windfall revenues, partly running sizable fiscal surpluses. A favourable supply response to rising spending as well as sterilisation efforts and increasing money demand also helped to dampen inflationary pressures. However, substantial excess reserves of commercial banks reflect challenges in financial sector developments and the effectiveness of monetary policy in many WCA countries. Given currently widelyused fixed exchange rate regimes, fiscal policy will continue to carry the main burden of macroeconomic adjustment and of sustaining <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth,</b> which remains the key policy challenge facing WCA authorities. ...|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{productive}} potential and the deviation between potential and actual output (i. e. the output gap) provides {{a number of}} key insights into macroeconomic performance. Output in general is determined by {{the quantity and quality of}} the various factors of production and their productivity. Potential output is an indication of the aggregate supply capabilities of the economy and embodies information about developments in the stock of capital, the labour force and technical change. The actual level of output on the other hand, is also influenced by the demand for goods and services. Deviations between the potential and actual levels of output, designated as the output gap, thus provide a measure of the capacity utilisation of the economy and to the extent that demand factors are incorporated, a measure of relative supply and demand in the economy at a particular time. As such, it contains useful short-term information for the formulation of economic policy, particularly policies aimed at controlling inflation. Over the medium term, the growth rate of potential output provides a useful guide for the assessment of sustainable <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth</b> in output and employment. Therefore, in a macro-econometric context, capacity utilisation (or the output gap) serves as a determinant of the behaviour of prices and wages and influences all key macroeconomic variables through a well-developed supply system. However, modelling the output gap or capacity utilisation is a complicated matter for a number of reasons. First, different concepts of potential output have been proposed in the literature and are used in different models. Second, a wide variety of empirical methods are used to measure potential output, ranging from time-series and trend-type analyses to production function-based methodologies, with the precise results sensitive to the method chosen. Finally, actual output could be determined directly from Keynesian demand analysis or by using a production function (supply) approach...|$|E
40|$|Slower {{growth and}} higher {{inflation}} can worsen poverty. By implication, maintaining macroeconomic stability {{is necessary to}} reduce poverty. When a typical aggregate demand (AD) policy for stabilization is not effective, however, its impact on poverty could be devastating as incomes of the poor typically decline with falling output. In this study, I argue that when poverty reduction is included in welfare objectives, {{it is imperative that}} policymakers weigh the impact of macroeconomic policy on the poverty line and household incomes. I address this issue by exploring the theoretical and empirical link between output, price, poverty line, and household incomes, and juxtapose them with their combined effect on poverty. Central to my argument is the premise that neither growth itself nor stability per se is the answer to poverty reduction. Applying a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) with the Blanchard-Quah (B-Q) restriction to the data of two Asian countries, Thailand and Indonesia, it was revealed that the aggregate supply (AS) curves in both countries are flat, implying that a stabilization policy based on AD shock is not effective. On the other hand, an AD expansion can produce <b>non-inflationary</b> <b>growth</b> and raise the incomes of the poor. To the extent that the transmission mechanism through which output affects household incomes is complex, involving direct, indirect, and feedback effects within an economy-wide system, a general equilibrium model with a detailed financial block was used. From the model simulations, poverty and income inequality results were found {{to be sensitive to the}} type of shock, price elasticity of wages, and structure of the economy, particularly the mechanisms by which the financial sector affects household income. While a positive fiscal shock tends to reduce poverty in Thailand, but not in Indonesia, the effect of an expansionary monetary policy on poverty can be either favorable or unfavorable. As shown in the Indonesia case, when the price elasticity of wages is low, the effect can be favorable but it can be unfavorable if the elasticity is high. An expansionary policy can raise the earnings of financial asset holders (i. e., higher income households) more than the incomes of the poor, as is the case in Indonesia, but not in Thailand. A fundamental gain from using the approach is to allow policymakers to measure the intensity of the trade-offs between growth, stability, and poverty, based upon which macroeconomic stability with lower poverty can be achieved...|$|E
