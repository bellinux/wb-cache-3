5000|$|Since {{the quality}} of borrowers' {{financial}} positions affect the terms of their credit, changes in financial positions should result in changes to their investment and spending decisions. This idea {{is closely related to}} the financial accelerator. A basic model of the financial accelerator suggests that a firm's spending on a variable input cannot exceed the sum of gross cash flows and <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of assets. This relationship is expressed as a [...] "collateral-in-advance" [...] constraint. An increase in interest rates will tighten this constraint when it is binding; the firm's ability to purchase inputs will be reduced. This can occur in two ways: directly, via increasing interest payments on outstanding debt or floating-rate debt, and decreasing the value of the firm's collateral through decreased asset-prices typically associated with increased interest rates (reducing the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of the firm's assets); and indirectly, by reducing the demand for a firm's products, which reduces the firm's revenue while its short-run fixed cost do not adjust (lowering the firm's gross cash flow). The reduction in revenue relative to costs erodes the firm's net worth and credit-worthiness over time.|$|E
30|$|A badly {{understood}} {{feature of}} policy reforms reducing the tax deductibility of mortgage interest {{is that these}} reforms imply a transfer of wealth from current to future generations. Even a balanced budget reform, which ploughs back all extra tax revenues from lower interest deductibility by lower tax rates, still leads to a wealth transfer. Current house prices reflect the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of the entitlement to future deductibility. For future generations, the system is a wash. They pay higher house prices {{in exchange for the}} entitlement to tax deductibility. Likewise, the abolishment of the system is a wash: the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of lower deductibility cancels against higher house prices. Hence, the current generation bears the full loss of the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of deductibility. Offsetting this intergenerational transfer of wealth would require the government to increase its debt, by pre-emptively reducing tax rates. If not, the fall in house prices induced by the reform of the system contributes to the fall in current consumption.|$|E

Using a lifecycle simulation approach, I account for ability/selection bias and the substantial probability that entering college freshmen will not eventually graduate, two critically important factors when evaluating the value of pursuing a college degree. I find that financial proposition of attending college is an unambiguously good investment for the vast majority of individuals with low to average college costs, although majors with a lower expected return do not pay off until middle age. However, when the financial costs of attending college are high (defined here as roughly $ 30, 000 per year), the gains from attending college are far more tenuous, particularly among those with below median ability and those pursuing an Arts/Humanities degree.

40|$|ABSTRACT- An ocean observing {{system to}} provide the data for climate research, modelling, and {{forecasting}} must be designed to high standards of accuracy and continuity. The observations are maintained {{for many years to}} develop the criteria for climate forecasting, and hence, in the meantime many of the data can and should be used for short and medium term purposes. When combined with other observations, usually of a local or regional nature, the combined data set provides the full suite of marine and coastal observations needed to serve a wide range of socio-economic and environmental objectives. The diagnostic and forecasting models on different scales are interfaced or nested to produce different analyses and products. The short and medium term systems provide an economic and social return which helps {{to cover the cost of}} the long term system. Although there are insufficient economic data to conduct a strictly controlled cost-benefit analysis at present, the effect of this strategy is, in economic terms, to ensure that the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of benefits minus costs never goes too heavily into deficit, and it may even be possible to maximise shor...|$|E
40|$|How can {{computer-aided}} {{planning systems}} {{deal with the}} complexities, uncertainties, and rapidly shifting information needed to support air warfare operational planning? This paper uses a hierarchical decomposition of decision-making, coupled to a predictive simulation model that estimates the probability distribution of the outcomes of candidate operational plans. The approach will generate, evaluate, and improve Blue plans while assuming that Red intelligently reallocates its forces, using stochastic optimization, to counter Blue’s moves. Evaluation of each Blue plan is accomplished via a Stochastic Evaluator that draws multiple samples of potential outcomes and Red force levels for a given Blue force structure and combined target composition. The evaluation metric is the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> from enemy targets hit. Linear programming heuristics and simulation generate Red’s adaptively optimized responses, outcomes, and inferred relative marginal force values. The results of this two-player, multi-level simulation-optimization approach for operational planning and decision-making demonstrate that automated plan optimization and embedding of optimization algorithms into an operational planning cycle operating over a multi-period conflict can be made practical for current computers by hierarchical decomposition of planning and on-line decision and optimization problems into computationally practical tasks...|$|E

Among policy alternatives that yield the same amount of cigarette consumption, cessation programs yield lower costs to households and the society at large than taxation, while taxation is preferred by the public sector.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of Swedish and Scandinavian investor sentiment on the <b>net</b> asset <b>value</b> <b>discounts</b> of closed-end investment companies. While previous studies have linked sentiment to discounts, both Scandinavian and Swedish evidence is lacking. The study contributes to existing literature by further developing the methodology by Baker & Wurgler (2006) to examine the investor sentiment effect brought forward by Lee et al. (1991) in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, this study offers additional evidence to Hjelström (2007) regarding the aggregate discounts of closed-end investment companies in Swedish capital markets. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on individual investment companies and consider both regional and local sentiment as an explanatory factor. DATA The investor sentiment data set covers quarterly data for stock mutual fund inflows, trading volume for aggregate equity markets, and the number and first-day returns of all main-list IPOs within the time period of 1. 1. 1999 to 31. 3. 2011 separately for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The net asset value data set covers 854 quarter-end <b>net</b> asset <b>value</b> <b>discounts</b> (or premiums) of 20 closed-end investment companies during the same time period. Both of the novel datasets were manually collected from multiple sources. RESULTS My main findings indicate that the aggregate <b>net</b> asset <b>value</b> <b>discount</b> of closed-end investment companies is not a sentiment indicator. I show that investor sentiment does not affect aggregate discounts but rather affects the discounts of individual closed-end investment companies. Furthermore, sentiment affects the discounts of individual investment companies in conflicting ways (i. e. positive sentiment can either increase or decrease discounts). Finally, I find evidence indicating that discounts of individual investment companies do not exhibit correlation, and that the strength of the sentiment effect varies substantially between different types of individual investment companies. My results are mostly in contrast to Lee et al. (1991) but in line with Hjelström (2007) ...|$|R

30|$|The third {{impact was}} the hit to the {{credibility}} of the system of mortgage deductibility. The generosity of the system has been discussed in Section 2. Polls in the period preceding the financial crisis revealed that the system was losing credibility anyway. The public expected changes in the system. The crisis gave it a final blow. In the 2012 coalition agreement, parties negotiated a trimming of the system such that the user cost of housing services went up by about 10 %, see CPB (2012). The macro-economic implications of this policy have been gravely underestimated by the government. When housing supply is completely inelastic, house prices capture the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> <b>value</b> of all future entitlement to mortgage subsidies. A balanced budget reduction of the tax deductibility -the decline in government expenditure on the tax deductibility is ploughed back to tax payers by a reduction in tax rates one-for-one- is still going to hurt current generations of home owners. The value of their property goes down, reflecting the net present value of the reduction of future tax deductibility. Future generations benefit, since their loss of mortgage subsidies is exactly offset by the fall in house-prices, while they still benefit from lower taxes.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the optimal extraction of energy from a hot water geothermal field. In view of the relative "commercial" availability of the many energy sources alternative to geothermal, it is possible that a socially "best" extraction policy may not include producing geothermal energy as fast as the current technology will permit. Rather, a truly "optimal" policy will depend on, among other things, the costs and value of geothermal energy in the future and the analogous values of other energy sources. Hence, a general approach to this problem would make the policy contingent on pertinent information on alternative sources. A good example of this approach is given in Manne's (1976) Energy Technology Assessment Model, where he points out that "Each energy source has its own cost parameters and introduction date, but is interdependent with other components of the energy sector.

It is often asserted that these trends are largely explained by the rising education levels of women.

The Resource-constrained Project Scheduling Problem (Rcpsp), {{in which}} a {{schedule}} must obey the resource constraints and the precedence constraints between pairs of activities, {{is one of the}} most studied scheduling problems. An important variation of the problem (RcpspDc) is to find a schedule which maximises the <b>net</b> present <b>value</b> (<b>discounted</b> cash flow), when every activity has a given cash flow associated with it. Given the success of lazy clause generation (Lcg) approaches to solve Rcpsp with and without generalised precedence relations it seems worthwhile investigating Lcg’s use on RcpspDc. To do so, we must construct propagators for the net-present-value constraint that explain their propagation to the Lcg solver. In this paper we construct three different propagators for net-present-value constraints, and show how they can be used to rapidly solve RcpspDc. ...|$|R

Optimal sizing of CHP plants based on using biomass will be given by optimum coefficient of cogeneration determined following the application of the proposed mathematical model...|$|R
40|$|Gamber and Sorensen provide {{evidence}} suggesting that the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio experienced a level shift in the mean between 1977 and 1981. If such a shift occurred, the nonlinearity in the data shows up as a failure to reject the null hypothesis that a unit root is present; that is, the series is I(1). In this reply, evidence is presented-the Phillips-Perron test and a univariate version of the Stock-Watson q-test-suggesting that the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio is stationary. Hence, the mean is constant. In addition, if one extends the analysis to include the 1989 through 1993 period, the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio appears to be reverting...|$|R

Standard GP techniques require human {{judgment as to}} which data window to use, which may be problematic due to structural breaks and persistence (or long memory) in the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate. We use a recently developed extension of GP to overcome this problem. While our results show no significant out-of-sample forecast improvement relative to the linear alternative or random walk model over the full sample, they do provide evidence as to the stochastic nature of the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate considering the AR(3) model yielded lower forecasting errors in the post- 1982 sample. ...|$|R
