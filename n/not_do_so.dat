5|$|Daniels' {{decision}} {{to run for}} Governor of Indiana led {{to most of the}} rest of Republican field of candidates to drop out of the race. The only challenger who did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> was conservative activist and lobbyist Eric Miller. Miller worked for the Phoenix Group, a Christian rights defense group. Daniels' campaign platform centered on cutting the state budget and privatizing public agencies. He won the primary with 67% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake. Those either {{studying}} at university or wishing to take public office could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> without first swearing the Oath of Supremacy, an act which would have compromised Catesby's Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left without taking his degree, and may then have attended the seminary college of Douai.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> but Edward was called {{as a witness}} in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.|$|E
5|$|Mass demonstrations {{took place}} in Syria condemning US President Harry Truman for {{recognizing}} Israel. Synagogues were attacked in Damascus as were the offices of General Motors. US officials were frustrated at Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations. When Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon signed armistice agreements with Israel between February and April 1949, Syria under Quwatli did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> and refused to send a delegation to attend truce negotiations in Rhodes in March.|$|E

This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated much controversy {{and led to}} the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}. The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{supporter of}} national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills {{to subsidize the}} Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, and for a canal at Sault Ste. Marie. The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until a decade later.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carpenter {{supported}} {{the movement for}} the higher education of women, and had always {{supported the}} feminist cause {{but for most of}} her life would <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> publicly, believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. But she did in 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage. She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Company {{officials}} in Bakersfield who {{were responsible for}} notifying the National Response Center did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until 2:56pm. The Center, staffed by United States Coast Guard officers and marine science technicians, is the sole federal point of contact for reporting all hazardous substances releases and oil spills. An oil spill triggers mandatory federal notification requirements {{in a timely manner}} but company officials said they were unable to contact employees on site as the employees were busy dealing with the immediate demands and distractions of the situation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} how {{directly}} Offenbach influenced Johann Strauss. He had encouraged Strauss to turn to operetta when they met in Vienna in 1864, {{but it was not until}} seven years later that Strauss did so. However, Offenbach's operettas were well established in Vienna, and Strauss worked on the lines established by his French colleague; in 1870s Vienna, an operetta composer who did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> was quickly called to order by the press. In Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model.|$|E

She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E

5|$|Two {{wild animal}} taxa {{are unique to}} St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis), which is a {{subspecies}} of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of house mouse known as the St Kilda house mouse (Mus musculus muralis), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It {{had a number of}} traits in common with a sub-species (Mus musculus mykinessiensis) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) now breeds on Hirta but did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> before the 1930 evacuation.|$|E
5|$|United States Navy {{historian}} Frank Chadwick {{believed that}} de Grasse could have thwarted the British fleet simply by staying put; his fleet's size {{would have been}} sufficient to impede any attempt by Graves to force a passage through his position. Historian Harold Larrabee points out that this would have exposed Clinton in New York to blockade by the French if Graves had successfully entered the bay; if Graves did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Barras (carrying the siege equipment) would have been outnumbered by Graves if de Grasse did not sail out in support.|$|E
5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, {{the court did}} not have its own {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began a fight to get the court a building, and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, {{on the south side of}} the Capitol. Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building, but it did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E
