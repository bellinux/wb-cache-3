25|$|While it {{was thought}} his arrival would make the Spurs respectable again, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>expected</b> what {{happened}} in his rookie season. Led by Robinson, 1989 draftee Sean Elliott from Arizona, and trade acquisition Terry Cummings from the Milwaukee Bucks, the Spurs achieved the biggest one-season turnaround in NBA history, finishing {{with a record of}} 56–26. They also jumped all the way to first place in the Midwest Division, their first division title in seven years.

Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single season turnaround in NBA history at the time (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season). The Spurs leaped to a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA rookie of the year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled David Robinson's Supreme Court.|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

2500|$|Weltlich's {{next three}} teams posted yearly {{improvements}} in overall records, although the 1983–84 Longhorns {{did so by}} the margin of a single game over the prior year, finishing the season 7–21. Texas managed four wins against Division I competition, with a 62–61 road win over Utah in non-conference play, to end a 21-game road losing streak, and three wins against conference competition—two against Baylor and one over Rice. The Longhorns were also generally more competitive in their many defeats, with their 13 SWC losses coming {{by an average of}} 15.0 points, for a one-third reduction in the average margin of defeat from the previous season. Texas played respectably in two losses to eventual second-consecutive national runner-up Houston, losing by 11 to the No. 7 Cougars in Houston and by the same margin to No. 5 Houston in Austin. After trailing 19th-ranked Arkansas 45–27 at halftime in Austin, Texas narrowed the Razorbacks' lead to 68–66 in the final minute before Arkansas added two final points to secure the win. Nonetheless, the 1983–84 season saw a number of particularly lopsided defeats, with a 103–72 loss to SMU and a 74–47 loss to Texas Tech representing what remain the third- and ninth-worst home losses in program history.
