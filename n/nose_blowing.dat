25|$|Acute {{sinusitis}} {{is usually}} precipitated by an earlier {{upper respiratory tract}} infection, generally of viral origin, mostly caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, and metapneumovirus. If the infection is of bacterial origin, the most common three causative agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Until recently, Haemophilus influenzae {{was the most common}} bacterial agent to cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the H. influenza type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased H. influenza type B infections and now non-typable H. influenza (NTHI) are predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis-causing bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and other streptococci species, anaerobic bacteria and, less commonly, gram negative bacteria. Viral sinusitis typically lasts for 7 to 10 days, whereas bacterial sinusitis is more persistent. Approximately 0.5% to 2% of viral sinusitis results in subsequent bacterial sinusitis. It is thought that nasal irritation from <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> leads to the secondary bacterial infection.|$|E
50|$|Valsalva test (<b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> test): Ask {{the patient}} to pinch the {{nostrils}} together and open the mouth, then blow gently through the nose. Observe if there is passage of air or bubbling {{of blood in the}} post extraction alveolus as the trapped air from closed nostrils is forced into the mouth through any oroantral communication. Gentle suction applied to the socket often produces a characteristic hollow sound.|$|E
50|$|Following all {{methods of}} OAC/OAF closure, the {{patients}} are instructed to avoid activities that could produce pressure changes between the nasal passages and oral cavity for at least 2 weeks due to risk of disruption to the healing process. <b>Nose</b> <b>blowing</b> and sneezing with a closed mouth are prohibited. A soft diet is also often advocated during this period. Following surgery, nasal decongestants and prophylactic antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent postoperative infection.|$|E

50|$|The {{condition}} is rare. It {{is more likely}} to occur in persons who regularly have raised pressure in the mouth, for example wind instrument players, and balloon and glass-blowers. Cases have also been reported with bicycle tyre inflation, whistling, <b>nose</b> <b>blowing,</b> cough and valsalva manoeuvre to clear the ears. It can be an iatrogenic effect of dental treatment, spirometry, and positive pressure ventilation. Apart from these factors, the condition mainly occurs in adolescents, often self-inflicted due to psychological issues.|$|E
50|$|Larry Whitehurst, another {{contestant}} who {{has appeared}} on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions.

On the fourteenth question on the night, Whitehurst was drawn towards Whittock after he had made too much coughing and <b>nose</b> <b>blowing,</b> due to the fact that Ingram was about to answer the question wrongly. On the million pound question, he knew the answer to the question so he was able to study the process between the men, and as soon as Whittock coughed in the right answer, Whitehurst had them red handed.|$|E

5000|$|A nose whistle (also {{called a}} 'Noseflute') is a wind instrument, usually made in wood, but also {{available}} in plastic, clay and metal sheet, probably of South-American indigenous origin. In spite of its ethnic background, several models have been conceived and patented in the 19th and 20th Centuries. The <b>nose</b> <b>blows</b> air into the instrument's open nosepiece, from where it is channeled through an airduct, towards a rather sharp edge of a slit, positioned over the player's mouth opening. This edge helps creating a vortex that excites the acoustic field into the player's mouth cavity. Since the volume {{and shape of the}} mouth cavity can be widely and quickly controlled by the player, a wide range of playing frequencies are possible. This high playability of such sound instrument probably explains {{the fact that it is}} usually called [...] "Noseflute", rather than Nose Whistle.|$|R

5000|$|The {{results of}} two randomized, double blind, placebo studies found Pleconaril {{treatment}} could benefit patients suffering from colds due to picornaviruses. [...] Participants {{in the studies}} were healthy adults from Canada and the United States, with self-diagnosed colds that had occurred within 24 hours of trial enrollment. Participants were randomly given a placebo or two 200 mg tablets to take three times daily for five days. To increase absorption it was recommended to be taken after a meal. To monitor the effectiveness of Pleconaril, participants recorded the severity of their symptoms and nasal mucosal samples were obtained at enrollment, day 3, day 6 and day 18. The two studies had a total of 2096 participates and more than 90% (1945) completed the trial. The most common reason for a participant not finishing the trial was an adverse event. Pleconaril treatment showed a reduction in <b>nose</b> <b>blowing,</b> sleep disturbance, and less cold medication used.|$|E
50|$|The {{optic nerve}} can be damaged {{when exposed to}} direct or {{indirect}} injury. Direct optic nerve injuries are caused by trauma to the head or orbit that crosses normal tissue planes and disrupts the anatomy and function of the optic nerve; e.g., a bullet or forceps that physically injures the optic nerve. Indirect injuries, like blunt trauma to the forehead during a motor vehicle accident, transmit force to the optic nerve without transgressing tissue planes. This type of force causes the optic nerve to absorb excess energy {{at the time of}} impact. The most common site of injury of the optic nerve is the intracanalicular portion of the nerve. Deceleration injuries from motor vehicle or bicycle accidents account for 17 to 63 percent of cases. Falls are also a common cause, and optic neuropathy most commonly occurs when there is a loss of consciousness associated with multi-system trauma and serious brain injury. In less than three percent of patients, an orbital hemorrhage after an injection behind the eye (retrobulbar block) can cause injury to the optic nerve, but this is readily manageable if it does not involve direct optic nerve injury and is caught early. The role of high-dose steroids and orbital decompression in treating these patients is controversial and, if administered, must be done very soon after injury with minimal effects. In patients with an orbital fracture, vomiting or <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> can force air into the orbit and possibly compromise the integrity of the optic nerve.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of a full-span 17 -percent-chord internal-flow jet-augmented flap on an aspect-ratio- 7. 0 wing with 35 deg of sweepback {{has been made in}} the Langley 300 -MPH 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel. Blowing over the conventional elevator and blowing down from a nose jet were investigated as a means of trimming the large diving moments at the high momentum and high lift coefficients. The results of the investigation showed that the model with the horizontal tail 0. 928 mean aerodynamic chord above the wing-chord plane was stable to the maximum lift coefficient. The large diving-moment coefficients could be trimmed either with a downward <b>blowing</b> <b>nose</b> jet or by blowing over the elevator. Neither the downward <b>blowing</b> <b>nose</b> jet nor <b>blowing</b> over the elevator greatly affected the static longitudinal stability of the model.

40|$|Otitis {{media with}} serous {{effusion}} (glue ear) {{is one of}} the most common problems seen by family doctors. In order to evaluate the effect of regular <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> on the resolution of serous otitis a randomized trial was carried out in a community health audiology department in Oxfordshire over the period 1983 - 87. A total of 84 children aged three and a half to four and a half years, found to have a conductive hearing loss owing to serous otitis were included in the study. The hearing test combined a discrimination test of seven named toys and full audiometry with earphones. The children's ears were examined by otoscope and Rinne's tuning fork test was performed. Randomly selected children were advised to blow their noses or were given no advice. The children were retested two months later and the outcome determined for children who were or were not given advice and who were or were not naturally good nose blowers. A record was made of any surgical intervention by insertion of ventilating tubes carried out before the children started school and of the results of the children's routine hearing tests on school entry. No significant differences in the proportion of children passing the second hearing test were found between children advised to blow their noses and those given no advice or between those children who were naturally good at <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> and those who were not.

40|$|Intranasal {{pressures}} {{were measured}} in adults during <b>nose</b> <b>blowing,</b> sneezing, and coughing and {{were used for}} ¯uid dynamic modeling. Sinus CT scans were performed after instillation of radiopaque contrast medium into the nasopharynx followed by <b>nose</b> <b>blowing,</b> sneezing, and coughing. The mean (5 SD) maximal intranasal pressure was 66 (514) mm Hg during 35 nose blows, 4. 6 (53. 8) mm Hg during 13 sneezes, and 6. 6 (53. 8) mm Hg during 18 coughing bouts. A single nose blow can propel up to 1 mL of viscous ¯uid in the middle meatus into the maxillary sinus. Sneezing and coughing do not generate suf®cient pressure to propel viscous ¯uid into the sinus. Contrast medium from the nasopharynx appeared in> 1 sinuses in 4 of 4 subjects after a nose blow but not after sneezing or coughing. Adults with early common colds have erratically distributed viscous ¯uid in the paranasal sinuses, which impairs sinus drain-age and ventilation and may contribute to infectious sinusitis [1 ± 5]. The source of this ¯uid is unknown. This study was conceived after observing bubbles in the maxillary sinuses of adults with common colds [1, 3] and seeing a recent patient with a pronounced example of this ®nding (®gure 1). This pa-tient characterized her illness as a ªsneezy, <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> coldº and stated that when blowing her nose she ªblows hard. º The bubbles in the sinus cavity were believed to have resulted from the simultaneous introduction of air and ¯uid from the nasal cavity.

40|$|Vortex {{asymmetry}} on axisymmetric pointed forebodies at high {{angles of}} incidence results in side forces and adverse yawing moments even in symmetric flight. An experimental investigation {{has been carried}} out at low speeds to study the effectiveness of axial <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> against the oncoming flow for side force control on two slender cones. Tests were made on the 8 and 12 deg cone models with (circular) jet flow over a Reynolds number range of 0. 4 × 10 ^ 6 to 5. 4 × 10 ^ 6. Jet-to-freestream velocity ratio was varied up to 2. 0, and the blowing diameter was varied as well. Force measurements were carried over the incidence range of 0 to 45 deg, and limited surface pressure distributions were obtained on the 12 deg cone model. The results explicitly show the effectiveness of <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> for side force control over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, and minimum side force was reached around a jet velocity ratio of 1. 0. An important result is that the side force reduction correlates with jet velocity ratio in the range of parameters studied. Broad similarities in the trend of side force reduction with the <b>nose</b> <b>blowing</b> and the nose bluntness suggest that the interaction of axial jet with freestream flow results, possibly, in what we may call "fluid dynamic blunting"...|$|E
