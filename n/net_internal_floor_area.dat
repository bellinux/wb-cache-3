40|$|The {{research}} investigates {{thermal performance}} of prefabricated timber {{housing in the}} UK due to a growing concern regarding the increase in summertime temperatures, which are expected to occur regularly as global temperatures increase. Furthermore, modern houses are built to meet improved regulations with additional insulation and are more sensitive to potential summertime overheating than older houses. This study examines three UK prefabricated timber housing developments (Bridport, Oxley Woods and Stadthaus) built {{in the last decade}} by evaluating the environmental conditions of the internal spaces and the occupants’ comfort. The research employs a combination of different methods such as post-occupancy surveys, environmental monitoring, and thermal comfort surveys to assess the occupants’ comfort in different seasons. Moreover, dynamic thermal modelling and simulations of the buildings to get more data over a long period are used. The outcomes of this study align with the research aim and sustain the research propositions. The research contributes to the on-going discussions on overheating in dwellings and provides first set of data on occupants’ thermal comfort in prefabricated timber housing. Overall, Oxley Woods appears to be warmer than Bridport and Stadthaus. Using the adaptive thermal comfort model to evaluate the risk of overheating at the buildings suggests overheating occurs in 70 % of the spaces monitored at Oxley Woods; while the analysis suggests warm discomfort in 50 % of the spaces monitored at Bridport and Oxley Woods in the summer. The preferred temperature is 1. 8 ºC higher at Bridport than Oxley Woods indicating comfort is within a wide range for the occupants at Oxley Woods. The neutral temperature is higher at Oxley Woods by 0. 8 ºC suggesting higher adaptation of the occupants to the internal temperatures. The results from the research suggest the occupants of the houses with smaller <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> adapt better than the houses with bigger <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area.</b> The occupants that indicate low level of control are less satisfied with the thermal conditions of the buildings. The results from the surveys and dynamic thermal simulations suggest that summertime overheating occurs in the buildings and high internal temperatures {{are likely to be more}} frequent in UK modern houses with reduced <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> spaces than houses with increased <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> spaces...|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} {{space in}} the estate is housed in the Lok Wah Commercial Centre, a multi-storey open-air shopping centre between Lok Wah North Estate and Lok Nga Court. It was opened in 1985 and comprises an <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of 108510 sq ft. It is built atop a multi-storey car park with 650 spaces, but as the complex is built within a valley the car park is barely noticeable - the shopping centre appears to be at ground level. The commercial centre and car park were originally owned and managed by the Housing Authority, but were transferred to The Link REIT on 25 November 2005. The Link was criticised for abandoning the fountain at the shopping centre, and for raising rents.The estate also has a covered open-air market, the Lok Wah Market, {{with a wide range}} of goods including fresh produce and meats, flowers, groceries, and dry goods.|$|R

Some larger format stores were opened under the Big W brand, similar to Wal-Mart in the US. Although it was successful at the beginning, the format failed to catch on; the original plan had relied upon leveraging the involvement of other Kingfisher group retailers, but following the de-merger this was no longer possible. Following a period of losses, Woolworths confirmed in 2004 it would abandon the Big W concept. The group sold 7 of the 21 Big W stores in 2005 to Tesco and Asda. The gross <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of the remaining sites was reduced to an optimum trading size of around 40,000 to 50000 sq ft.

40|$|Building {{morphology}} {{has significant}} influence on operational energy demand of buildings. Energy consumption for space cooling {{accounts for more than}} 75 % of electricity use in typical condominium buildings. With {{increase in the number of}} condominiums in Sri Lanka, the requirement for space cooling has increased resulting in significant energy demands. Accordingly, this study developed a morphology-based model for forecasting cooling energy demand of condominiums. The study employed a quantitative approach involving questionnaire survey and document review to collect data from thirty (30) condominiums in Sri Lanka. The correlation analysis performed on the data collected indicates that the number of floors (0. 940), building height (0. 930), building shape (- 0. 686), grouping of buildings (- 0. 647) window-to-wall-ration (0. 597), gross <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> (0. 489), and wall-to-floor-ratio (- 0. 457) have significant correlations with the cooling energy demand of condominiums in Sri Lanka. A multiple linear regression model developed shows that the number of floors and window-to-wall-ration account for 91. 2 % accuracy of the cooling energy estimation for condominiums in Sri Lanka. Thus, using the developed model, the annual cooling energy demand of a condominium can be forecast, considering significant design factors that could inform decisions at the building design and construction stage to ensure energy efficient designs...|$|R
40|$|The student {{accommodation}} {{sector in}} now the best-performing {{asset in the}} UK and US property markets and this is projected to further accelerate, with building refurbishment of existing student accommodations being the preferred method to satisfy growing demand. However, there are no published research studies on refurbishment projects within the student accommodation sector. Refurbishment is an emergent trend to upgrade existing stock to ensure that buildings meet rising energy efficiency demands. Moreover, it is widely affirmed that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and notably the built environment is a significant contributor, both through its construction and during its operation and use. This paper demonstrates through a comparative case study approach, how greenhouse gases levels can be effectively measured during refurbishment works. There are multiple metrics used for quantification/assessment of greenhouse gases performance and this paper aims to make well-argued recommendations for their best use. Four student accommodation refurbishment projects are presented to compare and contrast differing emission datasets. The results dictate that project cost and duration cannot alone be used to gauge greenhouse gases emissions; more too, in the instance of student accommodation refurbishment, gross <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> {{and the number of}} rooms offers a more predictable indicator. It is recommended that refurbishment developers reflect on these recommendations when reporting the primary energy and GHG performance of their refurbishment works. Best practice from this research may be adopted into domestic buildings refurbishment projects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} space {{standards}} for social housing in Portugal and in São Paulo, and seeks explanations {{for differences in}} the socio-economic context of both territories. The Controlled Cost Housing (CCH) in Portugal and the housing built within the program My Home My Life (MHML) in São Paulo Municipality are studied. The number and type of rooms, the <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of dwellings, the size of rooms, and the list and size of furniture and equipment are compared. Three research questions are addressed: Which program has more demanding space standards? Which social-economic conditions explain the differences in space standards? How different space standards influence the users' satisfaction? To answer these questions, the study compares socio-economic indicators, space standards and users' satisfaction of both territories. The study has shown that space standards set {{for the construction of}} social housing in CCH are more demanding than in MHML program. For instance, a CCH dwelling has almost two times the gross area of a MHML dwelling with the same number of rooms. The differences in space standards contribute to make the price of housing affordable to low income households in São Paulo Municipality. Although social houses are substantially smaller in São Paulo Municipality than in Portugal, the satisfaction level of dwellers with the size of dwellings is higher in São Paulo. We conclude that different political options regarding how to provide housing to low income households directly influence the space standards set for dwellings and therefore their quality.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} generalize the {{applicability}} of nonlinear numerical investigation of the structural behavior of slab panels at high deflections, which utilizes tensile membrane action in the slabs, the meshing of such floor systems cannot be restricted to orthogonal grids. A separate but related issue is that nonlinear numerical modelling of internal slab panels with continuity across their edges {{has shown that the}} way in which their boundary conditions are defined can have a considerable influence on their predicted membrane forces in various situations. This research investigates the behaviour of the membrane forces in orthogonal and non-orthogonal composite slabs at elevated temperatures by means of numerical modelling. With different continuity conditions at slab panel edges, the effects of various boundary conditions on the tensile membrane action of non-orthogonal slabs at high deflections are identified. In order to achieve this end, a penalty function method is first developed which allows boundary conditions to be defined in terms of relationships between different degrees of freedom in the system’s global coordinates, as opposed to the conventional binary “free or restrained” choice for individual degrees of freedom. This allows boundary conditions either to be defined with respect to axes inclined to the global system, or to link displacements at different nodes. This easily defines suitable boundary conditions for non-orthogonal slabs, and also allows the continuity of internal panels to be realistically modelled. In terms of simplified design methods, it is often possible to divide <b>internal</b> <b>floor</b> <b>areas</b> of a building into rectangular or square panels, but the problem of slabs at or near the edges of non-orthogonal buildings still exists. This thesis attempts to begin to extend these methods to non-orthogonal slabs by determining the optimal small-deflection yield-line failure patterns for quadrilateral slabs of different geometries. Simplified design methods assume that the enhancement of capacity due to tensile membrane action increases continuously with vertical deflection. However, as slab deflection increases, through-depth cracks {{which may or may not}} coincide with the yield lines can occur, and these cause progressive reduction of the enhancement of load capacity. Optimizing assumed yield-line patterns by using a plastic work balance method, the research establishes and validates two existing yield-line patterns for trapezoidal slabs. Further studies to determine the precise yield-line patterns of trapezoidal slabs are made by gradually changing of the geometrical parameters. A new plastic energy method which includes the internal work dissipation during rebar extension has been extended to triangular slabs. The post-yield-line behaviour of such slabs has been demonstrated. This research validates and compares the enhancement factor performance from the new plastic energy method to the existing simplified design method. An investigation of the influence of different reinforcement meshes and geometry on the enhancement of load-carrying capacity of isosceles triangular slabs has been carried out. ...|$|R
