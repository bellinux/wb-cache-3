25|$|MacConkey agar is a {{selective}} and differential medium used {{to differentiate between}} Gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar inhibits the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. Lactose and <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies. An alternative medium, eosin methylene blue serves a similar purpose.|$|E
60|$|First. The brick should neither {{be of the}} white, nor {{the very}} dark red, kind. The white is worse than useless as a color: its cold, raw, sandy neutral has neither warmth enough to relieve, nor gray enough to {{harmonize}} with, any natural tones; it does not please the eye by warmth, in shade; it hurts it, by dry heat in sun; it has none {{of the advantages of}} effect which brick may have, to compensate for the vulgarity which it must have, and is altogether to be abhorred. The very bright red, again, is one of the ugliest warm colors that art ever stumbled upon: it is never mellowed by damps or anything else, and spoils everything near it by its intolerable and inevitable glare. The moderately dark brick, of a <b>neutral</b> <b>red,</b> is to be chosen, and this, after a year or two, will be farther softened in its color by atmospheric influence, and will possess all the advantages we have enumerated. It is almost unnecessary to point out its fitness for a damp situation, not only as the best material for securing the comfort of the inhabitant, but because it will the sooner contract a certain degree of softness of tone, occasioned by microscopic vegetation, which will leave no more brick-red than is agreeable to the feelings where the atmosphere is chill.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>red</b> {{can be used}} as a vital stain. Live cells {{incorporate}} <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> {{into their}} lysosomes.

50|$|A {{number of}} studies {{included}} Kridsadaporn within a sample of asteroids in cometary orbits {{in order to understand}} the relationships in spectral characteristics between ACOs, the Jupiter-family comets, and the outer main belt asteroids.

Earlier studiessuggested that comets in all stages of evolution - active; dormant; and, dead - were very dark, often reddish, objects with spectra similar to D-type, P-type and C-type asteroids of the outer Solar System with probably carbonaceous dust containing reddish organic compounds controlling their colour and albedo characteristics.|$|R

Laboratory spectra of organic residues from meteorites and mixtures with hydrous silicates suggest that complex mixtures of complex organic molecules (kerogens) together with aqueous alteration products of igneous minerals may be the source of the dark matter that is distributed so widely throughout the solar system...|$|R

50|$|During {{fermentation}} of the sugar, acid {{is formed}} and the pH {{of the medium}} drops, changing {{the color of the}} pH indicator. Different formulations use different indicators; <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> is often used. For example, lactose fermenters turn a deep red when this pH indicator is used. Those bacteria unable to ferment lactose, often referred to as nonlactose fermenters, or NLFs for short, use the peptone in the medium. This releases ammonia, which raises the pH of the medium. Although some authors refer to NLFs as being colourless, in reality they turn <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> a buffish color.|$|E

50|$|Bromopyrogallol red is protonized in 1 M H2SO4 {{solution}} and changes gradually to its ionized forms in alkaline solution. In its <b>neutral</b> form, bromopyrogallol <b>red</b> is bipolar ion, containing a protonized carbonyl group {{as well as}} a dissociated sulfonate group. Through testing at isobestic points, it has been determined that bromopyrogallol red is a stronger acid than Pyrogallol Red. In the presence of ammonia salts, the bathochromic shifts increase. The hydrophilic group on the ammonia salts also change the dissociation of the reagent to be used with bromopyrogallol red to a more acidic region.|$|R

40|$|The binding {{sites in}} hen egg-white {{lysozyme}} for <b>neutral</b> bromophenol <b>red</b> (BPR) and ionized bromophenol blue (BPB) have been characterized at 2 Å resolution. In either case, the dye-bound enzyme is active against the polysaccharide, but {{not against the}} cell wall. Both binding sites are outside, but close to, the hexasaccharide binding cleft in the enzyme. The binding site of BPR made up of Arg 5, Lys 33, Phe 34, Asn 37, Phe 38, Ala 122, Trp 123 and possibly Arg 125, is dose to subsite F while that of BPB made up of Tyr 20, Arg 21, Asn 93, Lys 96, Lys 97 and Ser 100, is close to subsites A and B. The binding sites of the neutral dye and the ionized dye are thus spatially far apart. The peptide component of the bacterial cell wall probably interacts with these cells during enzyme action. Such interactions are perhaps necessary for appropriately positioning the enzyme molecule on the bacterial cell wall...|$|R
40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{occurrence}} of Ocotea pulchella in areas subjected to periodic flooding, this work aimed to evaluate the survival and initial development of Ocotea pulchella seedlings (2 months old) and juveniles (9 months old) in response to waterlogging under different light regimes by varying both light quantity and light quality, {{in order to test}} for possible flood tolerance of the species as affected by light conditions. Three levels of soil moisture (field capacity, mean flooding - only for seedlings - and full flooding) and four light treatments (full sun, <b>neutral</b> shade, far <b>red</b> enriched shading and <b>neutral</b> plus far <b>red)</b> were tested. The survival of seedlings and juveniles during one year was relatively high, whereas growth was negatively affected by full sun and flooding. Seedling growth was inhibited by soil waterlogging whatever the light condition, whereas plant growth at field capacity and mean fl ooding was similar. Flooding also inhibited the growth of juveniles, and that response was practically not affected by the light regimes. The results suggest that Ocotea pulchella seedlings can survive in the understory, even in areas subject to fl ooding, forming a slow-growth seedling bank. The species seems to tolerate relatively long-term soil waterlogging when kept out of direct sunlight. Otherwise, responses of waterlogged plants to shading seem to be aff ected by irradiance and light quality...|$|R
