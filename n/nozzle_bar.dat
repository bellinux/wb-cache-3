40|$|Acold-gas test campaignwas {{conducted}} on a subscale dual-bell nozzle operatingunder sea-level conditions {{to study the}} unsteady flow conditions encountered during sneak transition, which is a phenomenon prevalent just before final transition occurs. The study reveals that the flowduring sneak transition is highly unsteady and is themajor source of side-load generation in the dual-bell nozzle preceding the final transition. Statistical analysis suggests that, as the separation frontmoves into the region of wall inflection, the separated shear layer gradually comes {{in close proximity to}} the nozzle extension wall that alters the flow development process in the recirculation/backflow region considerably. This sets the entire backflow region into pressure fluctuations, making the flow conditions highly unsteady. It is further observed that the flow during sneak transition is associated with low frequencies {{in the vicinity of the}} separation location (0. 8 kHz), which decreases as the sneak transition nozzle pressure ratio is approached (0. 2 kHz).

50|$|The {{advantage}} of drive-through systems {{is that the}} vehicle {{does not have to}} stop for cleaning. As the vehicle passes the magnetic-sensor or photo-sensor at the entrance, the washing process is triggered. During the slow passage (5 mph speed) through the wash platform, the vehicle's tires, wheel wells and mud flaps are cleaned by water sprayed from many strategically placed <b>nozzles</b> (spray <b>bar).</b> The <b>nozzles</b> are mounted angle-iron grids which open the tire treads and flushing the mud for a high cleaning performance. The washing platform is usually of galvanized steel. The first modern systems were introduced as the MobyDick “Quick” series at a German construction industry trade exhibition. The Quick system was a significant design improvement from the modified high pressure truck wash systems that were used as wheel and tire wash systems before. Today all modern drive through systems are based on the engineering and design development of the Quick series.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to study the effect of nozzle opening pressure on the combustion process and exhaust emissions of a direct injection diesel engine fueled with orange skin powder diesel solution (OSPDS). Earlier investigation by the authors revealed that 30 % OSPDS was optimum for better performance and reduced emissions. In the present investigation the nozzle opening pressure was varied with 30 % OSPDS and the combustion, performance, and emissions characteristics were studied and {{compared with those of}} diesel fuel. The different nozzle opening pressures studied were 215 bar, 235 bar, and 255 bar. The results showed that the cylinder pressure with 30 % OSPDS at 235 <b>bar</b> fuel <b>nozzle</b> opening pressure, was higher than that of diesel fuel as well as at other nozzle opening pressures. Similarly, the ignition delay was longer with shorter combustion duration in case of 30 % OSPDS at 235 <b>bar</b> <b>nozzle</b> opening pressure. The brake thermal efficiency was higher at 235 bar than that of other fuel nozzle opening pressures with OSPDS and lower than that of diesel fuel. The NOx emission was higher and HC and CO emissions were lower with 30 % OSPDS at 235 bar. The smoke emission was marginally lower at 235 bar and marginally higher at 215 bar than diesel fuel. The performance of the engine at 235 <b>bar</b> <b>nozzle</b> opening pressure was better with reduction in emissions except NOx than other nozzle opening pressures...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{hydrogen}} no-vent fill tests were performed {{in this test}} series using various size spray nozzles and a spray bar with different hole sizes in a 5 cubic foot receiver tank. Fill levels of 90 percent by volume or greater were achieved in 26 of the tests while maintaining a receiver tank pressure below 30 psia. Spray nozzles were mounted {{at the top of}} the tank, whereas, the spray bar was centered in the tank axially. The spray nozzle no-vent fills demonstrated tank pressure and temperature responses comparable to previous test series. Receiver tank pressure responses for the spray bar configuration were similar to the spray nozzle tests with the pressure initially rising rapidly, then leveling off as vapor condenses onto the discharging liquid streams, and finally ramping up near the end of the test due to ullage compression. Both liquid injection techniques tested were capable of filling the receiver tank to 90 percent under variable test conditions. Comparisons between the spray <b>nozzle</b> and spray <b>bar</b> configurations for well matched test conditions indicate the spray nozzle injection technique is more effective in minimizing the receiving tank pressure throughout a no-vent fill compared to the spray bar under normal gravity conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview on the applicability of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) in combustion test facilities and summarizes experiences gained {{in a number of}} applications that were performed in the past 6 years. Emphasis is placed on the experimental aspects of each application rather than the interpretation of the acquired flow field data because many of the encountered problems and chosen solution strategies are unique to this area of planar velocimetry application. In particular imaging configurations, seeding techniques, data acquisition strategies as well as pre- and post-processing methodologies are outlined. The paper describes four similar applications of PIV in atmospheric and pressurized combustors containing single burners that are operated either with kerosene or natural gas. Aside from providing adequate optical access to the respective facilities the most challenging issue has been the reliable supply of non-volatile and non-reacting solid particle seeding. Given the rather large mass flows of up to 1 kg/s inside the combustors, sufficient seeding quantities could best be delivered by fluidized bed particle generators, sometimes even operated in parallel. The devices have been continually improved to allow constant delivery rates only during data acquisition periods, thus preventing unnecessary collection of seeding in the facility. The choice and handling of the seeding particle powder was found to be crucial for the overall success of the measurements. The first application describes initial trials on a swirled kerosene spray fuel <b>nozzle</b> at 3 <b>bars</b> and illustrates problems encountered due to flame luminosity as well as strong light scattering from the fuel droplets. The second application summarizes the challenges faced in obtaining phase-resolved, three-component velocity data from a generic atmospheric gas combustor using stereoscopic PIV. A much larger, swirl stabilized gas burner as utilized in stationary power generation was the subject of the third described application. Here a novel methodology of data acquisition and post-processing provides phase resolved velocity maps even of flows that have non-constant oscillation frequencies. Finally, the fourth application describes how the combination of PIV with DGV can yield three-component velocity data in areas of limited optical access using only one viewing window and one separate window (or probe) for light sheet delivery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo-stroke engines {{have dropped}} out of the {{automobile}} market for a long time due to severe drawbacks. Unfortunately, the comparison with the performances of four-stroke engines was not in favour of two-stroke ones. Nevertheless, the needs of a more compact engine with a better ratio of the mass and size versus power motivated research efforts {{at the beginning of the}} 90 's. Regrettably, these efforts did not result in commercial success and automobile manufacturers kept four-stroke engine architecture as base architecture. However, the two-stroke engine is a highly favourable concept for downsizing and cost reduction by reducing the number of cylinders without NVH penalties. All that added to the maturity of CFD calculations and the availability of high power electronic for control and fuel injection encouraged the Renault research division to have a closer look into its architecture. The study deals with a two-cylinder Diesel engine based on two-stroke valves engine. Air admission and exhausts gas are done through four valves per cylinder; fuel injection is done through ten holes <b>nozzle</b> at 1800 <b>bar</b> of pressure. The company Delphi, partner of the project, provided the injection system. The displacement of engine is 730 cm 3 and the engine is designed for a range of power of about 35 - 50 kW and a range of torque of 110 – 145 N. m. The design of the scavenging was achieved with the help of 3 D simulation based on the best 3 D simulation tools available. More than 250 calculations were completed to determine the best design of the cylinder-head reaching the objective of scavenging performances. At the end of this step, the best compromise was determined between the mass of fresh gas and the mass of burnt gas in the cylinder respecting combustion and engine efficiency criterias. Air supercharging system was designed in cooperation between the partners Renault, Le Moteur Moderne and University of Technology of Prague. The injection and combustion testing and optimisation were done on a one cylinder engine at CMT, University of Valencia, partner of the project. The set of parameters was explored and optimised to reach the best compromise between the combustion efficiency and the target of pollutant emissions to reach the EURO 6 standards. Finally, the optimisation of the engine, including the air loop system, calibration and control is planed in 2012 and will be done at IFPEN, partner of project. The objectives, the design process, the major technical breakthrough as well as its detailed results will be presented in this paper.
