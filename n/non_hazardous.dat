40|$|Personal Care Product (PCP) ingredients, {{widely used}} {{all over the}} world, {{over the last few}} years have become {{chemicals}} of increasing environmental concern, mainly because they are detected in water and may harm wildlife. Due to their high structural heterogeneity, the big number of end-points and the huge lack of experimental data, it is very important to have tools able to quickly highlight the most hazardous and toxic compounds, focusing the experiments on the prioritized chemicals. In silico tools, like QSAR models based on structural molecular descriptors, can predict the missing data for activities and properties necessary to prioritize the existing or even not yet synthesized chemicals for their potential hazard. In the present study, new externally validated QSAR models, specific to predict acute PCPs' toxicity in three key organisms of aquatic trophic levels, i. e. algae, crustacean and fish, were developed according to the OECD principles for the validation of QSARs, using the QSARINS software. These OLS models based on theoretical molecular descriptors calculated by PaDEL-Descriptor software, selected by genetic algorithm, are statistically robust, externally predictive and characterized by a wide structural applicability domain. They were applied to predict acute toxicity for over 500 PCPs without experimental data; a trend of acute aquatic toxicity was highlighted by PCA allowing the ranking of inherently more toxic compounds, using also a MCDM approach for prioritization purposes. Additionally, a QSAR model for the prediction of this aquatic toxicity index (ATI) was proposed to be applicable in QSARINS for the a priori chemical design of <b>non</b> environmentally <b>hazardous</b> PCPs...|$|R

Weed control through chemical {{means in the}} form of herbicide is commonly used to kill weeds or inhibit their growth throughout the world. However, the use of herbicides has increased toxic residues dangerously, indiscriminately targeting organisms, the environment, and ground water and creating serious upheaval in the ecosystem. Studies were conducted through a series of experiments for five consecutive wet seasons with a variety of alternative biological solutions to control the weeds. These solutions are benign, harmless, pollution free, <b>non</b> - <b>hazardous</b> and eco - friendly and control the pre-emergence of weeds in the rain-fed, upland rice ecosystem whereas in the high rainfall coastal region of eastern India, control was effected through soil solarization. This is a method of heating the soil's surface by using transparent low-density polyethylene (LDPE film) sheets placed on the soil's surface to trap solar radiation. This raises the soil temperature to a level which is lethal for many soil borne pathogens and weed seeds, thus killing weeds before they even begin to grow. The rise in soil temperature due to solarization by using LDPE film was significantly correlated to the soil temperature under normal conditions (uncovered) and the cumulative solar radiation (Wm- 2) of that day but the effect of the air temperature was found to be insignificant. A quadratic relationship was developed between temperature difference (DT) and soil temperature (ST) and the cumulative solar radiation (SR) for that day. The use of transparent and black LDPE sheets reduces weed growth and increases rice yield. Higher yields were found in treatments using transparent LDPE films of 200 gauges and 400 gauges for 30 days followed by black LDPE film. However, lower yields were recorded from the fields which were covered with LDPE films (both 200 and 400 gauge) beyond 30 days...|$|R

This study attempts to identify, health and safety practices prevailing in road construction projects, issues and propose measures to mitigate. The study was confined to seven contract packages implemented under Northern Road Connectivity Project (Additional Financing) funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB). Five of them were located in the North Central Province while {{the other two were}} in Northern Province. Data was gathered through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Questionnaire comprised six major criteria, namely, training and supervision, safe work procedures, communication, reporting safety, management commitment and injury and return to work. Study revealed that workers are exposed to hazards of frequent and heavy lifting, noise and vibration, hazardous substances such as oil, gas, hydraulic fluid, welding fumes, heavy vehicle operation, working in blasting faces, clearing operations, slips, trips and falls, struck by, being struck by falling objects, hand-arm-whole body vibration, dust, sources of noise, electrical hazards etc. In asphalting areas workers are exposed to high temperatures and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydro Carbons (PAHC) which are carcinogenic. Working in excavated areas is prone to collapse of slopes. Workers are also prone to ergonomic issues caused due to manual handling and awkward postures. Main causes of accidents have been identified as fall from height, fall of objects, struck on stationary objects, struck by moving objects, struck on moving objects, caught in between, exposure to heat, exposure to electricity and exposure to harmful substances. Information gathered from 250 respondents revealed a high positive response in overall health and safety management practices. Five of the six criteria concerned showed a high positive response of greater than 78 percent. Communication recorded the lowest. Contract package wise comparison shows that P 3 and P 4 had a low positive response in the criteria concerned other than management commitment. Interviews conducted with Project Managers revealed a high commitment. Safety Committees were nonexistent in six of the seven packages except (P 2).
