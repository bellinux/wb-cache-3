30|$|More {{recent work}} of Ribeiro et al.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a FEM model is {{proposed}} {{to simulate the}} guide wire <b>navigation</b> <b>procedure</b> in moving vascular structures. The virtual instruments are discretized with the multi-body representation, while the moving vascular structures are represented by a sequence of binary volumes segmented from the patient's data sets. The corresponding potential fields {{can be obtained by}} applying distance transform to the dynamic volumes. The collision and interaction between instruments and the moving vascular structures can be efficiently simulated with the potential fields and the FEM model, which drastically reduce the complexity of computation and makes interactive simulation possible. Comparing with mesh-based methods, the approach is both efficient and robust. Experimental results show the approach significantly improves the performance of simulation, especially in the circumstance of guide wire navigation in moving vessels. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{navigation}} {{of imagery}} from polar orbiting weather satellites includes the correction for geometric distortions due to earth shape/earth rotation, satellite orbit variations, and satellite attitude {{along with the}} resampling of the satellite image to a selected geographic map projection. The routine image <b>navigation</b> <b>procedure</b> also compensates for the distortion of the satellite imagery due to the nonlinear scanning of the sensor system. This paper reviews general methods for performing this image navigation, ranging from a method that assumes no orbital information and, thus, relies on nominal orbital parameter values and image corrections computed by matching ground control points (GCPs), to a method that uses high-quality satellite ephemeris data to make the correction with {{a limited number of}} GCPs. A procedure to optimize the image navigation by using a spatial remapping, or interpolation, is introduced and outlined. Recommendations are made for people interested in the processing of AVHRR imagery...|$|R

5000|$|The {{accident}} investigation board was split in its {{decision as to whether}} the flight crew or Air Traffic Control were responsible. The majority absolved the controllers as the plane was not on a published approach segment. The dissenting opinion was that the flight had been radar vectored. Terminology between pilots and controllers differed without either group being aware of the discrepancy. It was common practice at the time for controllers to release a flight to its own navigation with [...] "Cleared for the approach," [...] and flight crews commonly believed that was also authorization to descend to the altitude at which the final segment of the approach began. No clear indication had been given by controllers to Flight 514 that they were no longer on a radar vector segment and therefore responsible for their own <b>navigation.</b> <b>Procedures</b> were clarified after this accident. Controllers now state, [...] "Maintain (specified altitude) until established on a portion of the approach," [...] and pilots now understand that previously assigned altitudes prevail until an altitude change is authorized on the published approach segment the aircraft is currently flying. Ground proximity detection equipment was also mandated for the airlines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, the {{locomotion}} of an autonomously navigated undersea {{vehicle that}} uses vorticity control propulsion is computationally simulated. The <b>navigation</b> <b>procedure</b> employs {{a set of}} vehicle geometric and state variables to predict the needed vehicle body deformations in order to pass {{through a set of}} predefined path-points. To simulate the movement of the vehicle, a two-dimensional unsteady potential flow solver was developed based on the unsteady panel method coupled with the vehicle dynamics. The developed flow solver was validated against published computational results of unsteady flow standard test cases. Then, another set of properly planned test cases to cover the range of possible conditions were processed with the simulation and the output data was subsequently used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The trained network can predict what body deflection time history is necessary for the vehicle to pass through the given path-points. Several autonomous navigation test cases are presented to show the capabilities of the present method...|$|R

Given algorithms have been extensively tested in simulation and provided satisfactory results in run time and adaptation to the new situation.
