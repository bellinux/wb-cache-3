5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and <b>nonmetals.</b> Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with <b>nonmetals</b> (other than the noble gases). The majority of <b>nonmetals</b> are coloured or colourless insulating gases; <b>nonmetals</b> that form compounds with other <b>nonmetals</b> feature covalent bonding. In between metals and <b>nonmetals</b> are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than <b>nonmetals,</b> two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of <b>nonmetals,</b> and <b>nonmetals</b> form many more compounds than metals.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and <b>nonmetals,</b> there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic <b>nonmetals,</b> carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic <b>nonmetals),</b> is the least metallic of the polyatomic <b>nonmetals</b> but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic <b>nonmetals,</b> iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic <b>nonmetals,</b> radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, <b>nonmetals</b> therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic <b>nonmetals,</b> through one for the diatomic <b>nonmetals,</b> to zero for the monatomic noble gases.

Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the <b>nonmetals,</b> tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours.

5|$|Metal and <b>nonmetals</b> can {{be further}} {{classified}} into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows.

5|$|Four <b>nonmetals</b> are {{distinguished}} by polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). Consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic <b>nonmetals</b> show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic <b>nonmetals</b> given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some metallic character, either intrinsically or in its compounds with other <b>nonmetals.</b> Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E
5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like <b>nonmetals.</b> Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) <b>nonmetals,</b> have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, <b>nonmetals</b> adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic <b>nonmetals</b> have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic <b>nonmetals,</b> such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none.

The chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species.

5|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>nonmetals</b> and metals {{is by no}} means clear.

For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms.
