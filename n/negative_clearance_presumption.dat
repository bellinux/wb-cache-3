40|$|Abstract. Fine-{{blanking}} with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{is a kind}} of {{fine blanking}} processes. The punch size of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of blanking force in fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> and common blanking by DEFORM software, and the blanking force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of blanking force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation blanking force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual blanking force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum blanking force of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is higher than common blanking force. Compared with fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance,</b> the common blanking force reduces faster after the blanking force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> under a smaller blanking clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common blanking force, and the blanking quality of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is much better than that of common blanking. Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials. By means of the analysis on experimental curves, the paper further studies the changing law of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> blanking force...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{punching}} process, further enhance the blanking section quality. This paper studied the common blanking of 60 Mn and the fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> of 60 Mn blanking work piece metallographic structure by using scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> process can increase the work-hardening degree and further thin the punching surface tissue, inhibit the crack, and make the blanking surface smooth. The tensile and tear result in the generation of cracks and burrs, and the extrusion forming of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> inhibit the generation of cracks, and eliminate the conditions of the burrs. As the extrusion process, the degree of work hardening in fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is higher than the common blanking, the organizations are more closed. The mechanism of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> The fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> can be summarized as follows: Punch drop and contact sheets. The sheets produced elastic compression, tension and bending. As the punch dropping, the pattern edge pressed into the sheet metal. As the punch continues to drop, the material stress reaches the material yield limit, and the material enters the plastic state. The material flow around the hole, and began to squeeze into the die hole, resulting in plastic flow, and the bright surface of the shea...|$|R

The microstructure and fractography photograph in regions like rollover zone, shearing band, under sheared surface and fracture band were scanned by instrument of {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM-JSM- 6360 LV). The fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> makes the metal deformation regions {{into a state of}} triaxial stress precise and it causes an intense metallic stream that brings about inter-dislocation and distortion of metallic crystal product under the action of stronger force, so the metallic crystal is reset and the isometric metallic crystal of shearing zone is staved, sloped and pulled and it appears as dense lined and strip crystal.

This paper {{carried through}} {{fine-blanking}} with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> processing {{experiment with the}} AISI- 1020 and AISI- 1045 and obtained the work piece of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> The fractography photographs in the different deform regions of rollover zone, shearing band, fracture zone and under sheared surface were scanned by scanning electron microscope (SEM-JSM- 6360 LV). The research result indicates that the plastic flow of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{has been carried out}} to punch downspin, then jib at the place of allowance value, so that the length of work piece burnish band as much as possible to maximize and the length of the smooth shearing fracture could reach more than 90 % thickness of the metallic sheet.

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{experiments}} of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{show that}} the blanking force {{is very different from}} ordinary blanking in different blanking stages. Studying on the blanking force size of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> in different blanking stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of blanking force and stroke are measured, and the blanking force with different blanking stages of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that the simulation blanking force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the blanking force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the blanking force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after the blanking force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that the blanking force inches down, and the blanking force reaches a certain value in the place of blanking allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained the big blanking force all the time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation. The research result provides theoretic reference and the experimental data for the practice application of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance,</b> and has instructive significance and reference value to mould design...|$|R

Being an {{important}} blanking parameter, the blanking allowance of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{has a direct}} relationship {{with the quality of}} work piece and ejector force. The full process of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> for ASTM- 1022 in different blanking allowances is simulated through the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 2 D, then the ejector force under different blanking allowances is measured through the experiment of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> Based on the analysis of the ejector force, the proportion of burnish band and the work piece fracture, the following conclusions are summarized. The size of blanking allowance is not related with the blanking force with the sheet entering plastic state and the maximum blanking force, and is only related with the ejector force. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm, the friction force between the punch-die and the sheet affects ejector force, and the ejector force is not related with the mechanical properties of material. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm, with the blanking allowance increasing, the ejector force increases rapidly...|$|R

40|$|Summary]. The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss whether the timing for the Commission’s Proposal for {{reforming}} the implementation of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty is appropriate based on legal certainty considerations. The Proposal suggests to decentralise the day-to-day application of the EC antitrust rules further than is the case today and to abolish the present notification system whereby undertakings can apply for exemptions pursuant to Article 81 (3) and <b>negative</b> <b>clearances.</b> The article provides examples showing that presently, the answers to certain legal questions of EC competition rules are vague or contradictory, and that if the proposed reform were to be implemented in its present form, the undertakings would have to carry the full risk for compliance with the competition rules but without a simple or straightforward way of obtaining guidance or legally binding exemptions or <b>negative</b> <b>clearances.</b> While recognising the need for a reform of the implementation system of the EC competition rules, the article argues that consistency and coherence in the understanding and application of the competition rules are a prerequisite to ensure legal certainty which, in turn, is a prerequisite for the implementation of the Commission’s plans to decentralise EC competition law application. It is therefore suggested that the time is not yet ripe for the type of reform proposed by the Commission and that efforts should instead focus on creating the basis for such a reform by adopting clear guidelines and/or binding legislation that secure the legal certainty of the undertakings that have to operate under the EC competition law framework...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how mesozooplankton assemblages influenced phytoplankton in coastal and estuarine waters, we carried out a monthly investigation on mesozooplankton composition at two contrasting stations of Hong Kong coastal and estuarine waters and simultaneously conducted bottle incubation feeding experiments. The assemblage of mesozooplankton was omnivorous at both stations with varying carnivory degree (the degree of feeding preference of protozoa and animal food to phytoplankton) and the variations of carnivory degree {{were significantly associated with}} microzooplankton biomass (ciliates for the coastal station, both ciliates and dinoflagellates for the estuarine stations) and physical environmental parameters (primarily salinity). High carnivory was primarily due to high composition of noctilucales, Corycaeus spp., Oithona spp. and Acartia spp. Results of feeding experiments showed that grazing impacts on phytoplankton ranged from − 5. 9 to 17. 7 %, while the mean impacts were just < 4 % at both stations. The impacts were size-dependent, by which mesozooplankton consumed around 9 % of large-sized phytoplankton while indirectly caused an increase of 4 % of small-sized phytoplankton. Mesozooplankton clearance rate on phytoplankton, calculated from the log response of chlorophyll a concentrations by the introduction of bulk grazers after 1 -day incubation, was significantly reduced by increasing carnivory degree of the mesozooplankton assemblage. The mechanism for the reduction of mesozooplankton clearance rate with increasing carnivory degree was primarily due to less efficient of filtering feeding and stronger trophic cascades due to suppression of microzooplankton. The feeding rates of mesozooplankton on microzooplankton were not obtained in this study, but the trophic cascades indirectly induced by mesozooplankton carnivorous feeding can be observed by the <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> rate on small-sized phytoplankton. Overall, the main significance of this study is the empirical relationship between carnivory degree and clearance rate, which allow researchers to potentially predict the herbivory of mesozooplankton in the nature without conducting feeding experiments...|$|R

40|$|In the PHYTO-PAM {{phytoplankton}} analyzer {{the minimal}} fluorescence of dark-adapted samples (F 0) was assessed, which gives direct {{information on the}} chlorophyll- a content. Clearance rates (CR) of Daphnia and Brachionus were calculated from a decrease in chlorophyll-a concentration using the PHYTO-PAM fluorometer for non-sacrificial sampling of chlorophyll-a. Clearance rates of Daphnia were measured and compared with those based on the cell-counts method using an electronic particle counter (Coulter counter). Chlorophyll fluorescence-based CR for Daphnia magna were very strongly correlated with Coulter-based CR, signifying the potential suitability of the PHYTO-PAM in grazing experiments. A procedure for determination of rotifer clearance rates was developed {{and the effects of}} rotifer density, duration of the grazing period, and food concentration on CR were investigated. Between 10 and 30 rotifers in 2. 5 ml food suspension (i. e. 4 – 12 rotifers per ml) appeared optimal for calculating CR. The application of the deconvolution of F 0 -spectra in food selectivity experiments was evaluated using various mixtures of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa fed to Brachionus. CR for Brachionus on M. aeruginosa were lower than on S. obliquus but this was not caused by toxicity, because no mortality was observed. The higher CR on Scenedesmus than on Microcystis in the mixtures suggested selectivity. The importance of digital suppression of background fluorescence is highlighted in additional experiments with Daphnia feeding on mixtures of Microcystis and Scenedesmus, or on Microcystis alone. Without background correction of filtered samples, <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> rates were obtained for the `blue' Microcystis signal. Soluble fluorescing compounds of cyanobacterial origin, phycocyanin, were released from the Daphnia and contributed 40 % to the overall-fluorescence. Deconvolution of F 0 -spectra for the determination of chlorophyll-a using the PHYTO-PAM appears to be a suitable tool for determination of rotifer CR even at very low food concentrations. A drawback of the method is that rather high rotifer densities are required. The required grazing period, however, is shorter than for cell-count methods, the method is sensitive, clearance rates can be measured at low food concentrations (< 0. 1 mg C l- 1) and information on selective feeding can be obtained [KEYWORDS: Brachionus, chlorophyll-a, fluorescence, grazing, selectivity, trophic interactions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Characteristics of {{bacterial}} clearance were investigated in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea). Primary clearance kinetics were determined for three bacteria, a marine Gram negative motile rod, a marine Gram positive non-motile rod, {{and a fresh}} water fish pathogen, Aeromonas salmonicida. Various doses of live bacteria were injected into the perivisceral coelom of urchins, and coelomic fluid samples were removed for viable counts. Clearance of the two marine bacteria occurred in two stages. Reduction in viable counts was rapid and exponential during the first 90 min, followed by a period of slower clearance. The two bacteria exhibited similar clearance rates during the first 90 min, however the Gram positive bacteria were subsequently cleared more slowly than the Gram <b>negative.</b> <b>Clearance</b> of A. salmonicida was linear and not in two stages, although the initial rate of clearance was much {{lower than that of}} the marine bacteria. Attempts were made to determine whether a memory or inducible component exists in S. purpuratus' response to bacteria. After the kinetics of clearance of primary injections had been determined, the same urchins were challenged with a second injection of bacteria (9, 14, and 21 days after primary injections for the two marine bacteria, 19 days for A. salmonicida). The secondary clearance rates were not significantly different from the primary clearance rates for any of the three test bacteria. The cell-free coeloraic fluid of S. purpuratus was tested in vitro for bacterial agglutination and bactericidal activity against the two marine bacteria. Declines in viable counts of bacteria were observed with both bacteria in coelomic fluid, while viable counts in sea water controls did not change. Neither previous injection of urchins with bacteria nor prior heating of coelomic fluids (100 °C, 10 min) significantly altered the viable counts. It is not clear from these experiments whether the declines in viable counts were due to bacteria killing or agglutination. However, when the coelomic fluid was tested, agglutination was not observed with either of the bacteria. The cellular responses of the urchins were also investigated.

This has negative impact especially on the engine camshaft and valves due to excessive wear if the clearance setting is not working correctly. As mentioned, one may avoid this by using the manufacturer-recommended grade of engine oil, and by not exceeding the prescribed oil change interval. It is a myth that in certain circumstances, a lifter can [...] "pump up" [...] and create <b>negative</b> valve <b>clearance.</b> The engine oil pump cannot generate enough pressure to cause [...] "pump-up". The problem is due to weak valve springs which permit float at high engine speeds. The followers attempt to take up {{what they see as}} extra clearance. As this speed is maintained, the lifter will continue to expand until the valve is held off its seat when it should be closed. Maintenance of the valve springs at the correct strength is therefore very important to avoid engine damage.|$|R

AVP leads to a concentrated urine and <b>negative</b> free water <b>clearance.</b> Given this primary role of AVP, antagonizing its effect through blockade of its receptor in the distal tubule is an attractive therapeutic target. Lixivaptan is a newer, non-peptide, vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist. Recent studies have demonstrated efficacy. This review summarizes the clinical pharmacology and data for this new agent. Keywords: vasopressin, hyponatremia, heart failure, lixivaptan, therapy, outcome...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHalf-blanking {{of thick}} steel sheets is a metal forming process used to {{manufacture}} automotive seat recliner parts. During the forming process and in-use conditions (in case of crash) the material can {{be submitted to}} {{a high level of}} plastic strain and, in some cases, ductile damage. Recliners {{play an important role in}} the safety of passengers. Accurate computation results are thus needed. Forming stages have to be taken in account and damage and failure have to be modelled accurately. Two laboratory tests are developed to study the mechanical behaviour of half-blanked components. First, a cylindrical relief is half-blanked in a steel sheet sample. Then the cylindrical relief is wrenched using a shearing tool. During the tests, load and displacement are recorded. These tests enable the observation of failure mechanisms (SEM fracture observations) and give experimental data to validate numerical computations (geometries and load-displacement curves). During the wrenching test, a competition between ductile and shear failure is observed. Damage is modeled with a continuum mechanics based model (Lemaitre) and a phenomenological model (Xue-Wierzbicki). In the second one, the third invariant of the stress tensor is used to make difference between ductile and shear failure. Mechanical tests are performed to identify parameters model by inverse analysis. Tests are performed on different samples in order to have different stress states (stress triaxiality and Lode angle). In order to take into account material history, wrenching is performed with or without accounting for the half-blanking process. During both stages, large deformations are encountered. Automatic remeshing is needed and the finite element software Forge® is used. References : [1] W. F. Fan, J. H.

40|$|Mechanical {{model with}} {{detailed}} design parameters of a rotor slewing bearing with the structure type of double-row tapered roller {{for supporting the}} rotor of the wind turbine was presented. The internal geometrical relationships of the rotor slewing bearing were established in the Cartesian coordinate system. The elastic contact deformations between each tapered roller and the raceways were expressed through the geometrical transformation. The mechanical model was established using the equilibrium relations in the rotor slewing bearing. The safety factor and the fatigue life which represents, respectively, the ability of resisting the rolling contact plastic deformation failure and the rolling contact fatigue failure of the rotor slewing bearing were obtained based on {{the solution of the}} mechanical model. Effects of the detailed design parameters such as axial clearance, contact angle, and roller semi-cone angle on the carrying capacity of the rotor slewing bearing were analyzed. The results show that right amount of small <b>negative</b> axial <b>clearance,</b> increase in contact angle, and decrease in roller semi-cone angle are advantageous for enhancing the carrying capacity of the rotor slewing bearing. This provides the basis for the reasonable value selection of the design parameters of the double-row tapered roller slewing bearing for supporting the rotor of the wind turbine...|$|R
