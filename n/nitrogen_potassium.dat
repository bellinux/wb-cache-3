The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, the experimental design was completely randomized, in a 5 x 5 factorial scheme, corresponding to five nitrogen doses (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg dm- 3 of N) and five potassium doses (0, 90, 180, 270 and 360 mg dm- 3 of K 2 O), with four replicates. Three cuts of the shoots were performed every 30 days. Chlorophyll index, dry mass of shoots and roots, and <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> contents in the leaves were evaluated. The dry mass of shoots showed interaction between <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> in the three cuts; {{in the second and third}} cuts, it had maximum production at the <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> doses of 254 and 158 mg dm- 3, in the second, and 250 and 306 mg dm- 3 in the third, respectively.

Marandu) submitted to combinations of <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium,</b> in a nutritive solution, employing silica as substrate. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a greenhouse during the summer. It was used a 5 ² fractionated factorial scheme with 13 combinations of <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium,</b> which were distributed in a randomized block design, with four replications. The <b>nitrogen</b> × <b>potassium</b> interaction was significant for the number of tillers and leaves, for leaf area, for shoots and root section dry mass, for total length and surface and specific length and surface in the roots. Production of aerial part dry mass positively correlated with the number of tillers and leaves and grass leaf area. Nitrogen rates modulated the root system development, and the root specific length and surface decreased when high rates of <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> were supllied. <b>Nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> influence Marandu palisadegrass morphogenic characteristics, which are determinant for grass dry matter production...|$|R

Urea and potassium chloride were used for <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> sources, respectively. <b>Nitrogen</b> application rates were 0, 62. 5, 125 and 187. 5 kg N/ha and potassium rates were 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg K 2 O/ha. The {{experiment was}} laid in a 4 x 4 factorial arranged in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications. The plant samples were taken at 52 and 82 days after emergence for dry weights of stem, leaves, flower heads, and leaf areas, and 93 days after emergence for seed head dry weights, seed yields and 1000 -seed weights. The results showed that leaf dry weights and leaf areas of the sorghum plants at 52 days after emergence increased {{with an increase in}} <b>nitrogen</b> levels whilst <b>potassium</b> levels had no significant effect. At 82 days after emergence, total dry weights, stem dry weights, leaf dry weights, flower head dry weights and leaf areas were unaffected by both <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> levels.

50|$|The {{identification}} of <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>potassium,</b> and phosphorus (NPK) as critical factors in plant growth {{led to the}} manufacture of synthetic fertilizers, further increasing crop yields.

Five random soil samples were taken using a 5 cm diameter auger from the soil of each experimental field and were analyzed in the laboratory to measure carbon, <b>nitrogen,</b> phosphorus, <b>potassium</b> and pH levels.

50|$|This {{species is}} only known to grow on {{serpentine}} soils. Serpentine soils normally provide an inhospitable environment for most plants. Several {{factors contribute to}} serpentine soils being inhospitable to plant growth including a low calcium-magnesium ratio, lack of essential nutrients namely <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>potassium,</b> and phosphorus, and high concentrations of heavy metals. Many species that have adapted to grow on serpentine soils are not adapted to compete with other plants and do not survive well under competition in other soils that tend to have denser plant numbers; in serpentine soils plant densities are lower resulting in less direct competition for resources like light and water.|$|E
50|$|Coarse woody {{debris and}} its {{subsequent}} decomposition recycles nutrients {{that are essential}} for living organisms, such as carbon, <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>potassium,</b> and phosphorus. Saprotrophic fungi and detritivores such as bacteria and insects directly consume dead wood, releasing nutrients by converting them into other forms of organic matter which may then be consumed by other organisms. However CWD itself is extremely scarce in physiologically important nutrients. To fulfill nutritional requirements of consumers, CWD must be first nutritionally enriched by transport of nutrients from outside of CWD. Thus CWD is important actor contributing to soil nutrients cycles. CWD, while itself not particularly rich in nitrogen, contributes nitrogen to the ecosystem by acting as a host for nonsymbiotic free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Background: An {{adaptive}} mechanism in plant roots is initiated {{in the event}} of <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> deficiency, and it facilitates the active uptake of these elements in order to ensure plant growth and survival in stress conditions. Signaling and transduction of signals in response to changing <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> concentrations is a complex process, affected by interactions between various gene expression products, and often subjected to modifications. Results: In order to identify genotypic differences between phenotypes of two populations of recombinant inbred rye lines (153 / 79 - 1 x Ot 1 - 3 and Ot 0 - 6 x Ot 1 - 3) in response to nutrition stress caused by <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>potassium</b> deficiency at the seedling stage, bulk segregant analysis was utilized. Identification of genotypic differences between and within pooled DNA samples involved 424 RAPD, 120 ISSR primers and 50 combinations of R-ISSR. Identified markers were sequenced and converted to SCAR, attributing to them unique ESTs annotations, and chromosomal ones to selected localizations. Significant relationships with the examined trait were described for nine and eight RAPD markers, four and five ISSR, one and three R-ISSR markers for population 153 / 79 - 1 x Ot 1 - 3 and Ot 0 - 6 x Ot 1 - 3, respectively. Sequences identified for the rye genome were characterized by a uniqueness and a similarity to the sequence of aquaporin PIP 1, a gene encoding protein related to the function of the transcription factor in plant response to iron deficiency and the putative ethylene-responsive transcription factor, cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HvHKT 1 transporter, as well as HCBT proteins.
