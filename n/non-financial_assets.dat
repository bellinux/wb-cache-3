40|$|This paper {{examines}} the wealth accumulation patterns of cohorts of American households who are typically {{first-time home buyers}} {{at the onset of}} the housing boom earlier in this decade. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, I estimate the mean and median of various portfolio statistics of the households who were between age 25 and 30 in 2001 and follow them through 2007. I then compare their patterns of wealth accumulation to those of older cohorts at the same points in life cycle. The comparison group is the cohorts who were between age 25 and 30 in 1989. They are followed through 1995 when the housing markets were relatively stagnant. There are similarities and differences between the two cohorts in their early 30 ’s twelve years apart. While the levels of net worth are quite comparable, the composition of wealth and the accumulation patterns are strikingly different. Between 1989 and 1995, the older cohort accumulated financial wealth as they age while keeping the total debt level stable. As a result, these cohorts accumulated wealth steadily and the ratio of financial <b>asset</b> to <b>non-financial</b> <b>asset</b> (current ratio) increased consistently as they go through their prime working age.

50|$|While it is {{challenging}} to define over-indebtedness, definitions of over-indebtedness {{tend to have}} a few core elements in common. The first one refers to the capacity to meet the expenses associated with the contracted financial commitments. Over-indebtedness implies an inability to meet such recurring expenses. Second, this inability is structural. This is the time dimension, which holds that the definition must capture persistent and ongoing financial problems and exclude one-off occurrences that arise due to forgetfulness, for instance. The third core element refers to standard of living. The household must be unable to meet contracted commitments without reducing its minimum standard of living expenses. Fourth, comes illiquidity. The household is unable to remedy the situation by recourse to (financial and <b>non-financial)</b> <b>assets</b> and other financial sources such as credit. Lastly, all contracted financial commitments are included, among them mortgage and consumer credit commitments, utility and telephone bills as well as rent payments (recurring expenses).|$|E

40|$|The authors {{explore how}} Korea's {{financial}} structure affects {{the volatility of}} asset prices. Documented empirical evidence {{of the relationship between}} financial structure and financial crisis, sheds light on the relationship between asset price volatility - extreme variations in price - and financial structure. And the volatility of financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices provides an indirect link between an economy's financial structure and the likelihood of financial crisis. Using time-series data on a se of indicators measuring financial structure, the authors examine how Korea's financial structure affects the volatility of the real effective exchange rate, the money market rate, government bond yields, and stock prices. They find: 1) There is a stable long-term relationship between financial structure and volatility in the real effective exchange rate, the money market rate, stock prices, and the yield on government housing bonds. 2) Financial structure affects asset price variables asymmetrically. Some variables'volatility increases, and others'diminish, suggesting that monetary policies should target different asset markets to achieve different goals. If the goal of the monetary authority is to stabilize the money market rate, for example, intervening in the banking sector is more efficient than intervening in other financial sub-sectors. 3) The higher volatility of stock prices reflects the thin stock market in Korea. 4) The stability of the yield on government housing bonds reflects the Korean government's policy of stabilizing the nation's housing supply by isolating the housing market from the impact of Korea's financial structure. 5) Restrictions on foreigners'ownership of domestic stock in Korea during the periodanalyzed, and the fact that most capital flows through commercial banks, affect the exchange rate, which is determined (at least in the short run) by capital flows in the foreign exchange market.

The account of nonfinancial assets has his specific in medical establishments. Reforms, which implemented in Ukraine, affecting the account of <b>non-financial</b> <b>assets.</b> Medical institutions relate to the General government. Methodology. The survey is based on a comparison of data from the national and international reforms in medical industry. Results of the survey showed that in the dictionary of V. Raizberg next determination is driven: "public sector – it is a set of business units, that carry out economic activity, are in a public domain, controlled by public authorities or designated and hired persons" (Raizberg, 1999). In the Commercial code of Ukraine it is indicated: "The subjects of public sector of economy are subjects that operate on the basis of only public domain, and also subjects, which state share in authorized capital exceeds fifty percents or be value that provides a right to the state for decisive influence on economic activity of these subjects" (СС, 2003). Practical implications. Public sector structure specifies data of International Public Sector Accounting Standards. Substancial load concept "public sector" in national and international practice are relevant (Poznyakovska, 2009). Accounting in health institutions has specific terms, inherent to the government sector. They are determined by the types of activity and terms of assignation (Pasichnik, 2005). Medical services must be accessible to all stratum of population. They must have free basis. They come forward as a public benefit independent of individual possibility to pay for him. Therefore lion's part of general charges for health protection is used on the grant of medical services to the population. At the same time "upgrading of medical services lies inplane providing of unitization of going near the grant of medicare, standardization of medical documentation, approaching of services to the patients by their decentralization and integration, in accordance with health care level" (Eshchenko, 2016).
