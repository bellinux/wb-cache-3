Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire. The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening. In Gaul, which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s, perhaps worst in Armorica. By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted, and local use of money ceased about 360. Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians. Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians. Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay; as they farmed for themselves, their direct costs diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy. However, except for the provinces along the lower Rhine, the agricultural economy was generally doing well.

50|$|The miR-92 {{family is}} evolutionally conserved microRNAs, {{and has an}} {{ortholog}} in Caenorhabditis elegans, which has been extensively used as a model organism {{in the area of}} developmental biology. mir-235, the miR-92 ortholog in C. elegans, acts in the hypodermis and glial cells to maintain the quiescent state in both neuroblasts and mesoblasts until <b>nutritional</b> <b>state</b> becomes favorable, meaning that mir-235 couples stem cell behaviors to nutritional condition. Furthermore, mir-235 directly represses the expression of nhr-91, which is an ortholog of mammalian germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), to keep stem cell quiescent. The expression of mir-235 is regulated by the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway in respond to <b>nutritional</b> <b>state.</b> Once nutritional conditions becomes favorable, the expression of mir-235 is downregulated by IIS pathway, and stem cells leave from quiescent state and resume the developmental program, such as self-renewal, migration and differentiation.|$|E

50|$|The <b>nutritional</b> <b>state</b> of {{banded killifish}} {{influences}} individual's decisions to shoal or not. Food-deprived individuals {{spent more time}} by themselves and not in shoals. When food-deprived individuals were found in shoals their shoals were not any smaller {{than that of a}} well-fed banded killifish. Hungry banded killifish are more likely to leave a shoal than a well-fed individual. In the presence of a food stimulus, group size decreases, so that each individual does not have to compete with others for access to these resources. When presented with food odour, individuals were less attracted to neighbors, but when presented with a predatory stimulus, they were more attracted to neighbors and formed tighter shoals. When in the presence of both stimuli, the group size is intermediate.|$|E

40|$|In adults, the {{adrenal glands}} are {{essential}} for the metabolic response to stress, but {{little is known about}} their role in fetal metabolism. This study examined the effects of adrenalectomizing fetal sheep on glucose and oxygen metabolism in utero in fed conditions and after maternal fasting for 48 h near term. Fetal adrenalectomy (AX) had little effect on the rates of glucose and oxygen metabolism by the fetus or uteroplacental tissues in fed conditions. Endogenous glucose production was negligible in both AX and intact, sham-operated fetuses in fed conditions. Maternal fasting reduced fetal glucose levels and umbilical glucose uptake in both groups of fetuses to a similar extent but activated glucose production only in the intact fetuses. The lack of fasting-induced glucogenesis in AX fetuses was accompanied by falls in fetal glucose ultilization and oxygen consumption not seen in intact controls. The circulating concentrations of cortisol and total catecholamines, and the hepatic glycogen content and activities of key gluconeogenic enzymes, were also less in AX than intact fetuses in fasted animals. Insulin concentrations were also lower in AX than intact fetuses in both <b>nutritional</b> <b>states.</b> Maternal glucose utilization and its distribution between the fetal, uteroplacental, and nonuterine maternal tissues were unaffected by fetal AX in both <b>nutritional</b> <b>states.</b> Ovine fetal adrenal glands, therefore, have little effect on basal rates of fetal glucose and oxygen metabolism but {{are essential for}} activating fetal glucogenesis in response to maternal fasting.

5000|$|While {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} state-dependent memory, it is less clear what the advantage of this circumstance might be. In 2006, researcher Lorena Pomplio and her team tackled this question as they investigated the presence of state-dependent memory in invertebrates, specifically grasshoppers. Up until this point, only vertebrates had been used to study state-dependent memory. This study found that invertebrates did indeed experience the phenomenon as well, particularly in regard to conditions of low or high nutritional intake. Pomplio and associates (2006) concluded that their results demonstrated a potential [...] "adaptive advantage" [...] of state-dependent learning that explains its intrinsic presence in such a wide variety of species. State-dependent memory recalls a time that the organism was in a similar condition, which then informs the decisions they make in the present. For these grasshoppers, their low <b>nutritional</b> <b>state</b> sparked cognitive connections to similar states of duress and primed the insects to make decisions they had made when faced with low nutrition in previous conditions. The paper suggests that this phenomenon allows for quick decisions to be made when an organism does not have the time or neural capability to carefully process every option.|$|E

The environment and dietary intake of the animals were carefully controlled, so that environmental and physical variables were minimized. Dietary intake of zinc was varied while copper intake was held constant. Each experimental diet group was matched with a pair fed control group. ^ Of the tissues examined, only the serum was indicative of an early state of zinc imbalance. Neither hair nor the other tissues examined for copper and zinc concentrations were indicative of an acute zinc imbalance in a normal mature mouse.
