40|$|Aim To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of the <b>needle</b> <b>type,</b> insertion depth, and irrigant flow rate on irrigant flow pattern, flow velocity, and apical pressure by ex-vivo based endodontic irrigation computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Methods Human upper canine root canal was prepared using rotary files. Contrast fluid was introduced in the root canal and scanned by computed tomography (CT) providing a three-dimensional object that was exported to the computer-assisted design (CAD) software. Two probe points were established in the apical portion of the root canal model for flow velocity and pressure measurement. Three different CAD models of 27 G irrigation needles (closed-end side-vented, notched open-end, and bevel open-end) were created and placed at 25, 50, 75, and 95 % of the working length (WL). Flow rates of 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4 mL/s were simulated. A total of 60 irrigation simulations were performed by CFD fluid flow solver. Results Closed-end side-vented needle required insertion depth closer to WL, regarding efficient irrigant replacement, compared to open-end irrigation <b>needle</b> <b>types,</b> which besides increased velocity produced increased irrigant apical pressure. For all irrigation <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> and <b>needle</b> insertion depths, the increase of flow rate was followed by an increased irrigant apical pressure.

40|$|Study Objective To {{investigate}} the interference of experimentally induced heat pain on a subject’s ability to correctly differentiate between {{a real and}} sham acupuncture needle, using the Park sham device. Study Design A within subjects, signal-blinded study design was utilised. 20 healthy subjects (11 female and 9 male) were recruited using convenience sampling at Queen Margaret University. Subjects were both acupuncture exposed (25 %) and acupuncture naïve (75 %). Throughout the study, 6 real and 6 sham acupuncture needles were administered in a random order to the acupuncture point LI 10 in the upper limb. Concurrently, 6 heat pain stimuli and 6 visual stimuli were also administered in a random manner. Subjects were required to differentiate between <b>needle</b> <b>type</b> after each <b>needle</b> administration. A yes-no methodology was employed to compute the relevant outcome measures. Outcome Measures This study involved {{the completion of a}} needle discrimination task in the presence of either a heat pain or visual stimulus. The proportion of correct judgments [P(C) ] for each stimulus was computed. This P(C) value represented a subject’s in(ability) to differentiate between the real and sham acupuncture needle and hence represents the blinding effectiveness of the sham needle in each stimulus condition. Results It was observed that subjects participating in this trial could successfully differentiate between <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> at the acupuncture point of LI 10 in the upper, dominant limb. No significant difference was found between subject’s P(C) values {{in the presence of the}} heat pain stimulus and the control visual stimulus (z=- 0. 175, p= 0. 874), indicating that subjects can differentiate between <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> irrespective of the presence of experimentally induced pain. Furthermore, this ability to correctly differentiate between <b>needle</b> <b>type</b> was greater than chance levels as the observed median for both P(C) in the presence of the heat pain stimulus and P(C) in the presence of the visual control stimulus was significantly greater (p= 0. 002; 0. 007 respectively) than a hypothesised median of 0. 5 (pure guessing). Previous acupuncture exposure was observed to have no effect on subjects ability to differentiate between <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> in the presence of both the heat pain stimulus (rpb= 0. 16, p= 0. 5, rpb 2 = 3 %) and the visual control stimulus (rpb= 0. 41, p= 0. 07, rpb 2 = 17 %). Finally, no significant relationship was observed between subject’s heat pain intensity values and their P(C) values in the presence of the heat pain stimulus (rs 0. 37, p= 0. 11, r 2 = 14 %). Conclusion Subjects in this study could correctly differentiate between real and sham needles above chance levels. Hence, the Park sham device does not appear to effectively blind subjects to <b>needle</b> <b>type</b> when it is used at the acupuncture point LI 10 in the upper, dominant limb. The administration of an experimentally induced heat pain stimulus did not appear to negatively affect performance during this task of needle differentiation and no relationship was found between subjects reported pain intensities and their proportion of correct judgments throughout the trial. This ability to correctly differentiate between <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> was not associated with previous acupuncture exposure status.

Methods A validated CFD model was used to simulate irrigant flow from either a side-vented or an open-ended flat 30 -G needle positioned inside a prepared root canal (45. 06) at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 mm short of the working length (WL). Velocity, pressure, and shear stress in the root canal were evaluated. Results The flow pattern in the apical part of the root canal was similar among different needle positions.

40|$|Background: Infrequent but serious {{complications}} of transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) occur due to in-advertent intravascular injections. A few studies {{reported that the}} different <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> can influence on the occurrences of intravascular incidence in TFESI. This study prospectively evaluated whether short-bevel needle can reduce the inci-dences of intravascular injection of TFESI compared to long-bevel needles. Methods: From March 2013 to December 2013, 239 consecutive patients were enrolled and received 249 fluoroscopically guided TFESI using the classic technique. Confirmation of intravascular spread was done initially with real time fluo-roscopy and then with digital subtraction angiography method in a same patient. Injection technique for TFESI was the same for both short-bevel and long-bevel <b>needle</b> <b>types.</b> Results: The incidences of intravascular injections with the long-bevel and short-bevel needles were 15. 0 % (21 / 140) and 9. 2 % (4 / 140), respectively. More than half of intravascular injections occurred simultaneously with epidural injections (8. 0 %, 20 / 249). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between the long-bevel and the short-bevel needles in the rates of intravascular injections (P = 0. 17).

40|$|Aim The {{geographical}} {{extent and}} climatic tolerances of one- and two-needled pinyon pines (Pinus subsect. Cembroides) {{are the focus}} of questions in taxonomy, palaeoclimatology and modelling of future distributions. The identification of these pines, traditionally classified by one- versus two-needled fascicles, is complicated by populations with both one- and two-needled fascicles on the same tree, and the description of two more recently described one-needled varieties: the fallax-type and californiarum-type. Because previous studies have suggested correlations between needle anatomy and climate, including anatomical plasticity reflecting annual precipitation, we approached this study {{at the level of the}} anatomy of individual pine needles rather than species. Location Western North America. Methods We synthesized available and new data from field and herbarium collections of needles to compile maps of their current distributions across western North America. Annual frequencies of <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> were compared with local precipitation histories for some stands. Historical North American climates were modeled on a c. 1 -km grid using monthly temperature and precipitation values. A geospatial model (ClimLim), which analyses the effect of climate modulated physiological and ecosystem processes, was used to rank the importance of seasonal climate variables in limiting the distributions of anatomical <b>needle</b> <b>types.</b> Results The pinyon needles were classified into four distinct types based upon the number of needles per fascicle, needle thickness and the number of stomatal rows and resin canals. The individual needles fit well into four categories of <b>needle</b> <b>types,</b> whereas some trees exhibit a mixture of two <b>needle</b> <b>types.</b> Trees from central Arizona containing a mixture of Pinus edulis and fallax-type needles increased their percentage of fallax-type needles following dry years. All four <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> occupy broader geographical regions with distinctive precipitation regimes. Pinus monophylla and californiarum-type needles occur in regions with high winter precipitation. Pinus edulis and fallax-type needles are found in regions with high monsoon precipitation. Areas supporting californiarum-type and fallax-type needle distributions are additionally characterized by a more extreme May–June drought. Main conclusions These pinyon <b>needle</b> <b>types</b> seem to reflect the amount and seasonality of precipitation. The single needle fascicle characterizing the fallax type may be an adaptation to early summer or periodic drought, while the single needle of Pinus monophylla may be an adaptation to summer–autumn drought. Although the needles fit into four distinct categories, the parent trees are sometimes less easily classified, especially near their ancestral Pleistocene ranges in the Mojave and northern Sonoran deserts. The abundance of trees with both one- and two-needled fascicles in the zones between P. monophylla, P. edulis and fallax-type populations suggest that needle fascicle number is an unreliable characteristic for species classification. Disregarding needle fascicle number, the fallax-type needles are nearly identical to P. edulis, supporting Little’s (1968) initial classification of these trees as P. edulis var. fallax, while the californiarum-type needles have a distinctive morphology supporting Bailey’s (1987) classification of this tree as Pinus californiarum...|$|R
