The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper describes a noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomenon caused by impact of meshing gear teeth pairs, resulting in structural wave propagation and elastoacoustic coupling in the driveline system, referred to in industry as clonk. The numerical investigation combines multi-body dynamics analysis with flexible body oscillation behaviour predicted by finite element analysis (FEA) techniques. Particular attention is paid to local non-linearities such as the varying stiffness of meshing gear teeth and their <b>normal</b> <b>backlash.</b> The spectrum of vibration of lightly damped hollow driveshaft tubes shows good conformity with experimental results...|$|E

In order {{to solve the problem of}} its {{bearing capacity}} quantificationally, the concept of the maximal bearing capacity is put forward. Starting with that the single tooth bending stress is up to the bending fatigue strength, a mathematical model to determine the <b>normal</b> <b>backlash</b> of the gear teeth has been established, the maximal deformation of the single tooth has been determined. The mathematical relationships have also been setup between the normal backlashes of the tooth pairs, the maximal deformation and number of contact points, a corresponding MATLAB program is designed. The maximal bearing capacity of the reducer has been estimated through examples and proved by experiment. The results show that the calculation method is more effective and fully considers the factors that the elastic deformation of the gear tooth can increases its bearing capacity, so the structure of the reducer is more compact, which establishes the theory foundation for designing the reducer...|$|E
