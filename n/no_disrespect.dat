25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} , {{not only that}} the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian publicists it was almost as familiar as the British Constitution. It was known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And <b>no</b> <b>disrespect</b> is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial Committee were not regarded either as being familiar with the history or conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended from time to time, had played {{in the development of the}} nation, and the harmonious working of its political institutions.|$|E

He dedicated the award to his defence, saying [...] "The lads have been brilliant all month, in particular the back five. I accept this trophy on behalf of them". He was sent off in the 15th minute of York's 5–0 defeat away to Luton on 18 January 2011 after fouling Claude Gnakpa outside the penalty area.

Manager Danny Wilson described Cresswell as [...] "one for the future" [...] after admitting the player [...] "is not the striker people may perceive as the big one we were chasing". His debut came in Wednesday's 2–1 home defeat to Coventry City on 3 April 1999, before scoring his first goal with an 87th-minute winner at home to Liverpool in a 1–0 win on 8 May. He finished 1998–99 with one goal in seven appearances for Wednesday. Cresswell completed 1999–2000 with two goals in 25 appearances, having been given few opportunities in the team, as Wednesday were relegated into the First Division.|$|E

Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, [...] "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (<b>no</b> <b>disrespect</b> to intrepid reporters)." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, [...] "The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends {{the second half of the}} movie playing Rambo in the desert.

500|$|After a 13-10 Ravens win in Pittsburgh on November 18, 2012, Ray Rice {{walked off}} the field waving a Terrible Towel {{over his head and}} singing Steelers rally song [...] "Renegade" [...] with teammates. Rice {{publicly}} stated after the game that <b>no</b> <b>disrespect</b> was intended. Two weeks later on December 2, the Ravens lost to the Steelers 23-20 despite being at home and facing Pittsburgh's third-string quarterback, Charlie Batch. Losing 4 of their last 5 games notwithstanding, Baltimore would go on to win the AFC North and follow that with a playoff run to become Super Bowl XLVII Champions, giving them the distinction of being the first and only team in NFL history to have shown disrespect toward the Terrible Towel and win the Super Bowl. However, prior to the 2014 season, Ray Rice was suspended due to a domestic violence incident in the offseason and was subsequently released and has not been signed by another team since. Furthermore, up until their Super Bowl victory the Ravens had made the playoffs in each of the first five seasons under John Harbaugh and Joe Flacco but have had only one playoff appearance (and only one winning season) over the next four years, albeit their one playoff victory during that span was against the Steelers.|$|E

[...] Regarding the fight buildup, he also said, [...] "We've decided to promote this fight a different way.

5000|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that in the late 19th and early 20th century, the term [...] "Chicano" [...] was an insulting, disparaging term used by upper class Mexicans who lived in the U.S. to refer to indigent Mexican immigrants who had just crossed the border. Thus, Russell is not using the term as it was reclaimed and redefined as a source of pride and political power in the 1960s, although he does agree with the principal. In spite of this, Russell meant <b>no</b> offense or <b>disrespect</b> to those people who embraced the term Chicano; he just stated that it was not for him.|$|R

This leads to the conclusion that this honorific was not a Russian innovation.

[...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean <b>no</b> <b>disrespect</b> to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous.

[...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark.

The records were conceptualised from Diddy's comments to his producers. He told Alex da Kid (who produced [...] "Coming Home") [...] "I want a beat that makes me feel like a white man in a basement in Atlanta." [...] Diddy said that [...] "most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time.

In an interview with MTV News Diddy said [...] "One of the things [...] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records out right now — <b>no</b> <b>disrespect</b> to them, but they're all surface. It's about what people have or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion — you get a feeling, a vibe." [...] Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was [...] "assembled from 60 or so songs.

Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E

50|$|Probably {{the most}} notable early {{books on the subject}} were the French {{collections}} of essays by Jean Henri Fabre, which later were translated into English by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in the early 20th century. There were earlier publications, usually informal, including some by deservedly prominent authors, such as the Peckhams, whose working lives overlapped that of Fabre. However, most works before the late 19th century tended to be isolated observations and now require cautious interpretation of the species concerned, partly because most authors were amateurs, and partly because very little work had yet been accomplished along the lines of modern taxonomy. This is <b>no</b> reason to <b>disrespect</b> the authors of the time; even a century later, advances in molecular biology have led to an upheaval in Hymenopteran taxonomy that, however necessary, is a source of cognitive dissonance in workers brought up in the 20th century tradition, and who, for example, never would have thought of classifying hunting wasp taxa among the Apoidea.|$|R
