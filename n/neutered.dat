5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found <b>neutered</b> male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat <b>neutered</b> confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, <b>neutered,</b> immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as <b>neutered</b> and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if <b>neutered),</b> an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
50|$|The <b>neuter</b> n-stem and <b>neuter</b> t-stem nouns {{decline as}} soft <b>neuter</b> o-stems in the {{singular}} but as hard <b>neuter</b> o-stems in the plural. In addition, they have shortened nominative/accusative/vocative singular forms ending in -ę.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>neuter</b> {{singular}} nouns, when {{preceded by}} the <b>neuter</b> singular definite article, ’o, or by a <b>neuter</b> singular adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.|$|R
50|$|The name Acidiplasma derives from:New Latin <b>neuter</b> gender n acidum, an acid; Greek <b>neuter</b> gender noun plasma (πλάσμα), {{something}} shaped or moulded; New Latin <b>neuter</b> gender noun Acidiplasma, an acid-living form.|$|R
5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are <b>neutered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a <b>neutered</b> boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to {{recognize}} and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images. Cagney {{played a}} series of patriots, and his gangster in Angels with Dirty Faces (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is {{executed}} so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration. Breen in essence <b>neutered</b> Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel Over the White House where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>neuter</b> plural {{should have}} had the ending -u in short-stem <b>neuters,</b> but has lost it due to analogy with long-stem <b>neuters,</b> which exhibit syncope as in Old Saxon and Old English.|$|R
50|$|If every {{component}} is <b>neuter</b> plural, the whole compound is <b>neuter</b> plural.|$|R

25|$|<b>Neutered</b> dogs of {{both sexes}} have a 27% to 38% {{increased}} risk of adverse reactions to vaccinations. However, the incidence of adverse reactions for <b>neutered</b> and intact dogs combined is only 0.32%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neutered</b> {{dogs have}} also been known to develop hormone-responsive {{alopecia}} (hair loss).|$|E
25|$|A 2004 {{study found}} that <b>neutered</b> dogs had a higher {{incidence}} of cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture, a form of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.|$|E
50|$|This class {{consists}} of <b>neuter</b> nouns and corresponds to Greek <b>neuters</b> in -os and Latin <b>neuters</b> in -us (genitive -eris, -oris). Formally, these nouns look like regular <b>neuters</b> except that a suffix -ir (from Proto-Germanic -iz-, from Proto-Indo-European -es-) {{is added to}} the stem in the plural and triggers umlaut. This class was massively expanded in Middle and Modern High German.|$|R
50|$|The name Acidiphilium derives from:New Latin noun acidum (from Latin {{adjective}} acidus, sour), an acid; New Latin <b>neuter</b> gender adjective philum (from Greek <b>neuter</b> gender adjective philon (φίλον)), friend, loving; New Latin <b>neuter</b> gender noun Acidiphilium (sic), acid lover.|$|R

25|$|One {{study showed}} the {{incidence}} of hip dysplasia increased to 6.7% for dogs <b>neutered</b> before 5.5 months compared to 4.7% for dogs <b>neutered</b> after 5.5 months, although the cases associated with early age neutering seems to be of a less severe form. There was no association between age of neutering and arthritis or long-bone fractures. Another study showed no correlation between age of neutering and musculoskeletal problems. A study of large breed dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture associated early-age neutering {{with the development of}} an excessive tibial plateau angle.|$|E
25|$|Animal control {{agencies}} in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or <b>neutered</b> {{so that they do}} not have undesired puppies.|$|E
25|$|Ferrets: Mammary {{tumors are}} rare in ferrets. Appearance {{tends to be}} a soft, dark colored lump. Most seem to be benign and occur most {{frequently}} in <b>neutered</b> males. Surgery is recommended.|$|E

50|$|A {{small group}} of <b>neuter</b> nouns that follow the <b>neuter</b> n-stem, <b>neuter</b> s-stem or <b>neuter</b> t-stem declensions. These decline as hard o-stems, but have an {{additional}} consonant infix (-en-, -es-, -et-) in all forms except the nominative/accusative singular. The n-stem and t-stem nouns have a nominative/accusative in -e, while the s-stem nouns have -o or -e {{depending on whether the}} preceding stem is hard or soft.|$|R
25|$|<b>Neutered</b> dogs of {{both sexes}} are at a twofold excess risk to develop {{osteosarcoma}} (bone cancer) as compared to intact dogs. The risk of osteosarcoma increases with increasing breed size and especially height.|$|E
25|$|Perianal gland tumor (also called hepatoid tumor) {{is a type}} of tumor {{found near}} the anus in dogs that arises from {{specialized}} glandular tissue found in the perineum. They are most common in intact (not <b>neutered)</b> male dogs.|$|E
25|$|Domestic kittens in {{developed}} societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses {{from two to}} three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), feline calicivirus (C), and feline panleukopenia (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against rabies may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually spayed or <b>neutered</b> at seven months of age, but kittens may be <b>neutered</b> as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in animal shelters. Such early neutering {{does not appear to have}} any long-term health risks to cats, and may even be beneficial in male cats. Kittens are commonly wormed against roundworms from about four weeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neuter</b> genitive singulars of long-stem nouns, on {{the other}} hand, {{generally}} use -jis, byanalogy with short-stem <b>neuter</b> nouns.|$|R
50|$|The word hundrað is {{actually}} a <b>neuter</b> noun, þúsund can be either feminine or <b>neuter</b> and the higher multiples of a thousand are either masculine or feminine, according to the ending (e.g. milljón is feminine, milljarður is masculine and so on). Núll is <b>neuter.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{study showed}} that spayed females live longer than intact females (0.8 years more on average) but, unlike the {{previous}} study, {{there were no differences}} between <b>neutered</b> and intact males. But both groups lived 0.4 years more than intact females.|$|E
25|$|Susie's only {{reproducing}} offspring was {{a female}} Fold named Snooks who was also white; a second kitten was <b>neutered</b> shortly after birth. Three months after Snooks' birth, Susie {{was killed by a}} car. All Scottish Fold cats share a common ancestry to Susie.|$|E
25|$|Events such as {{the annual}} World Spay Day have {{resulted}} in large numbers of companion animals spayed and <b>neutered.</b> In 2014, 700 World Spay Day events were held in 41 countries, including all 50 U.S. states, and over 68,000 companion animals were sterilized.|$|E
2500|$|Muslim {{scholars}} are {{divided on the}} issue of <b>neutering</b> animals.

5000|$|Disappearance of the <b>neuter</b> gender for nouns. Most <b>neuter</b> nouns {{have become}} {{masculine}} instead {{under the influence}} of Italian, and their unstressed final vowels have almost universally lowered to /a/. In the Montemitro dialect, however, all <b>neuter</b> nouns have become masculine, and vowel lowering has not occurred.|$|R
