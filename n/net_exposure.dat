40|$|We {{consider}} how the introduction of centralized netting in financial networks affects total <b>netted</b> <b>exposures</b> between counterparties. In some cases there is a trade-off: centralized netting increases the expectation of <b>net</b> <b>exposures,</b> but reduces the variance. We show that the set of networks for which expected <b>net</b> <b>exposures</b> decreases is a strict subset of those for which the variance decreases, so the trade-off can only be in one direction. For some network structures, introducing centralized netting is never beneficial to dealers unless sufficient weight is placed on reductions in variance. This may explain why, {{in the absence of}} regulation, traders in a derivatives network do not develop central clearing. Our results can be used to estimate margin requirements and counterparty risk in financial networks...|$|R
40|$|Novating {{a single}} asset class {{to a central}} {{counterparty}} (CCP) in an over-the-counter derivatives trading network impacts both the mean and variance of total <b>net</b> <b>exposures</b> between counterparties. When {{a small number of}} dealers trade in a relatively large number of asset classes, central clearing increases the mean and variance of <b>net</b> <b>exposures,</b> which may lead to increased counterparty risk and higher margin needs. There are intermediate cases where there is a tradeoff: The introduction of a CCP leads to an increase in expected <b>net</b> <b>exposures</b> but this increase is accompanied by a reduction in variance. We extend the work of Duffie and Zhu (2011) by considering general classes of network structures and focus on scale-free and core-periphery structures, which {{have been shown to be}} accurate models of real-world financial networks. We find that a CCP is unlikely to be beneficial when the link structure of the network relies on just a few key nodes. In particular, in large scale-free networks a CCP will always worsen expected netting efficiency. In such cases, CCPs can improve netting efficiency only if agents have some degree of risk aversion that allows them to trade off the reduced variance against the higher expected <b>netted</b> <b>exposures.</b> This may explain why, in the absence of regulation, traders in a derivatives network may not develop a CCP themselves...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{sensitivity}} of cash flows generated by Taiwanese firms to changes in a trade-weighted index, as well as against the currencies of Taiwan's major trading partners. A traditional methodology, the capital market approach, typically found low or negligible levels of exposure for most firms. Moreover, this approach could not determine long-term exchange risks. We adopt the polynomial distributed lag model to examine {{the relative importance of}} economic versus transaction exposure by decomposing exposure into short-term and long-term components. Comparing this with the capital market approach, we find some evidence of the relative ability of cash flows to detect exposure. Our findings indicate that exporting firms show less significant <b>net</b> <b>exposures</b> to the U.

50|$|Equity swaps {{have many}} applications. For example, a {{portfolio}} manager with XYZ Fund can swap the fund's returns for the returns of the S&P 500 (capital gains, dividends and income distributions.) They most often occur when a {{manager of a}} fixed income portfolio wants the portfolio to have exposure to the equity markets either as a hedge or a position. The portfolio manager would enter into a swap {{in which he would}} receive the return of the S&P 500 and pay the counterparty a fixed rate generated from his portfolio. The payment the manager receives will be equal to the amount he is receiving in fixed-income payments, so the manager's <b>net</b> <b>exposure</b> is solely to the S&P 500.

30|$|We {{observed}} similar effects when NETs {{were added}} to macrophages or DCs for a relatively “prolonged” period, where the increased proportion of dead cells was noticeable at 6 h and clearly evident at 24 h. When we used rhodamine- 123 to assess if there was damage to the mitochondria, we found decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting an ongoing apoptotic process. This phenomenon was through the caspase- 3 and the AIF pathway. Indeed, others have shown that some components of neutrophil granules such as LL 37 can induce apoptosis in T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells {{as well as in}} airways epithelial cells (Barlow et al. 2006; Mader et al. 2011 a; Mader et al. 2011 b). On the other hand, elastase and cathepsin G mediated glomerular injury in vivo (Johnson et al. 1988); and cathepsin G has been shown as a critical component sustaining neutrophil-mediated acute tissue pathology and fibrosis after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (Shimoda et al. 2007). We show here that some NETs components such as histone H 2 A principally, and to a lesser degree elastase, can cause mitochondrial membrane damage to Mfs and DCs if sufficient time is given. By electron microscopy we observed that in the cultures of APCs exposed to NETs, intracellular changes appeared at the ultrastructural level in mitochondria. This corroborated the results obtained by flow cytometry about mitochondrial membrane damage caused by <b>NETs</b> <b>exposure,</b> suggesting that it might be due to some components of NETs.

We then specialize our analysis to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) as underlying portfolios, and construct a numerical scheme to evaluate the adjustment under a doubly stochastic default framework. In particular, we show that for CDS contracts a perfect collateralization cannot be achieved, even under continuous collateralization, if the reference entity’s and counterparty’s default times are dependent. The impact of re-hypothecation, collateral margining frequency, and default correlation induced contagion is illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{multiple}} motivations {{for the use of}} trade credit, firms tend to supply and receive trade credit at the same time, so the choice to engage in one of these activities could influence the other.

40|$|We {{present a}} network model for {{investigating}} {{the impact on}} systemic risk of central clearing of over the counter (OTC) credit default swaps (CDS). We model contingent cash flows resulting from CDS and other OTC derivatives by a multi-layered network with a core-periphery structure, which is flexible enough to reproduce the gross and <b>net</b> <b>exposures</b> {{as well as the}} heterogeneity of market shares of participating institutions. We analyze illiquidity cascades resulting from liquidity shocks and show that the contagion of illiquidity takes place along a sub-network constituted by links identified as ???critical receivables???. A key role is played by the long intermediation chains inherent to the structure of the OTC network, which may turn into chains of critical receivables. We calibrate our model to data representing net and gross OTC exposures of large dealer banks and use this model to investigate the impact of central clearing on network stability. We find that, when interest rate swaps are cleared, central clearing of credit default swaps through a well-capitalized CCP can reduce the probability and the magnitude of a systemic illiquidity spiral by reducing the length of the chains of critical receivables within the financial network. These benefits are reduced, however, if some large intermediaries are not included as clearing members...|$|R

The effects of loss of catch during net lifting, disturbance effect and fouling were eliminated {{as far as possible}} to reveal the true effect of accumulation. First we applied simple nonparametric and parametric tests in comparison of treatments. As expected, considerable reduction in catchability took place along with the increase in soak time, indicated by significantly lower total 24 h catches from longer soaks in comparison with shorter ones. The reduction was more pronounced for roach than for perch. Further, we compared a functional relationship regression (FRR), admitting correctly observation error variance also in the x-axis variable, with ordinary least squares regression (OLS) in modelling the relationship between cumulative 24 h catches for different treatments. We estimated the between-replicates proportional observation error variance within a treatment and found it to be similar in different treatments. Therefore the variance ratio could be assumed to be close to 1 enabling the use of major axis solution FRR. In this particular case the incorrect use of OLS obviously gives a seriously biased result, exacerbating the negative effect of accumulation for high x-axis values in comparison with FRR. We recommend the use of FRR for any analysis comparing different notoriously low precision fish abundance proxies...|$|R
