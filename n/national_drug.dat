5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of <b>National</b> <b>Drug</b> Control Policy, taking on the title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle {{to deal with the}} problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E
5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many <b>national</b> <b>drug</b> laws.|$|E
40|$|<b>National</b> <b>drugs</b> {{observatories}} have flourished {{and developed}} rapidly {{over the last}} two decades as a direct consequence of the decisions taken to establish regional drug monitoring systems, both in the European Union and in the Americas. Initially, there was no reference framework available — observatories were set-up using trial and error, taking into account different national contexts and resources. This explains why today there are as many models of observatories as there are countries establishing them. Looking back at this long process, there seemed to be a need to formalise the experiences in the field, and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region. This handbook, a joint production by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD–OAS), presents and describes in a clear and informative way the core operational processes and the key strategic factors that are common to all <b>national</b> <b>drugs</b> observatories.
