5|$|Computational neurogenetic {{modeling}} {{is concerned}} with the study and development of dynamic <b>neuronal</b> models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{this theory}} was updated, {{suggesting}} that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes <b>neuronal</b> connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the <b>neuronal</b> withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP {{by one of the}} same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a <b>neuronal</b> receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so {{it is possible that the}} N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially, and {{it was suggested that}} the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their <b>neuronal</b> algorithms were basically the same.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can cause}} severe {{damage to the}} brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier. It degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons, reduces their numbers, interferes with neurotransmission routes, and decreases <b>neuronal</b> growth.|$|E
5|$|Other cell-death {{mechanisms}} include proteasomal and lysosomal system dysfunction {{and reduced}} mitochondrial activity. Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed {{in conjunction with}} the protein inclusions. It may be related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation and <b>neuronal</b> death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in <b>neuronal</b> proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to <b>neuronal</b> stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|The HIV {{viral protein}} gp120 induces {{apoptosis}} of <b>neuronal</b> cells by inhibiting levels of furin and tissue plasminogen activator, enzymes responsible for converting pBDNF to mBDNF. gp120 induces mitochondrial-death proteins like caspases which {{may influence the}} upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis of <b>neuronal</b> cells, gp120 induces oxidative stress in the <b>neuronal</b> cells, {{and it is also}} known to activate STAT1 and induce interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in <b>neuronal</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{this new}} {{biological}} psychiatry viewpoint, <b>neuronal</b> plasticity {{is a key}} element. Increasing evidence points to various mental health disorders as a neurophysiological problem which inhibits <b>neuronal</b> plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide at 75-vol% reduce ischemia-induced <b>neuronal</b> death {{induced by}} {{occlusion}} {{of the middle}} cerebral artery in rodents, and decrease NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx in <b>neuronal</b> cell cultures, a critical event involved in excitotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neuronal</b> PLL (NPLL): Phase detector, {{filter and}} {{oscillator}} are neurons or small <b>neuronal</b> pools. Uses a rate controlled oscillator (RCO). Used for tracking and decoding low frequency modulations (< 1nbsp&kHz), {{such as those}} occurring during mammalian-like active sensing.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known and most common types of <b>neuronal</b> {{migration}} disorders is lissencephaly, a diffuse cortical malformation relating directly to agyria and pachygyria. Incomplete <b>neuronal</b> migration during the early fetal brain development is the precursor to lissencephaly.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} composition between conventional <b>neuronal</b> synapse and ribbon synapse {{is surprisingly}} dissimilar. At {{the core of}} synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery in vertebrate <b>neuronal</b> synapses is the SNARE complex. The minimally functional SNARE complex includes syntaxin 1, VAMP 1 and 2, and SNAP-25. In contrast, genetic ablation or application of botulinum, targeting SNAP-25, syntaxin 1-3, and VAMP 1-3, did not affect inner hair cell ribbon synapse exocytosis in mice. Additionally, no <b>neuronal</b> SNAREs were observed in hair cells using immunostaining, pointing {{to the possibility of}} a different exocytosis mechanism. However, several studies found SNARE mRNA and protein expressed in hair cell, perhaps indicating presence of a <b>neuronal</b> SNARE complex in ribbon synapse that is present in low levels and with very redundant components.|$|E
25|$|Analysis and {{modeling}} of <b>neuronal</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that neurons can produce {{hydrogen}} cyanide upon activation of their opioid receptors by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that <b>neuronal</b> production of HCN activates NMDA receptors and {{plays a role in}} signal transduction between <b>neuronal</b> cells (neurotransmission). Moreover, increased endogenous <b>neuronal</b> HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid analgesia, as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator.|$|E
25|$|NTSA Workbench {{is a set}} of tools, {{techniques}} and standards designed {{to meet the needs of}} neuroscientists who work with <b>neuronal</b> time series data. The goal of this project is to develop information system that will make the storage, organization, retrieval, analysis and sharing of experimental and simulated <b>neuronal</b> data easier. The ultimate aim is to develop a set of tools, {{techniques and}} standards in order to satisfy the needs of neuroscientists who work with <b>neuronal</b> data.|$|E
25|$|The Reissner's fiber is also {{important}} on the morphogenetic <b>neuronal</b> processes, being involved on <b>neuronal</b> survival, aggregation and neurite extension. In vitro studies demonstrated {{that the presence of}} RF, in conjunction with glial cells, is essential to the survival of <b>neuronal</b> cells. The studies seem to point that the RF might bind some of the growth factors produced by glial cells and transport them to the neurons. On the process of <b>neuronal</b> aggregation, RF seems to serve as a control factor in direct cell-to-cell communication, favoring <b>neuronal</b> aggregation when the density of neurons is low and preventing this aggregation when the density gets higher. Although the mechanism behind this is not well understood, it is known to be linked to the different domains in SCO-spondin that are related to coagulation factors and TSRs, as referred above. Furthermore, the RF as a part on the neurite extension, promoting neurite outgrowth from both spinal and cortical neurons, in cell cultures, which may also be connected to the TSR domains of SCO-spondin.|$|E
25|$|NEST, a {{simulation}} tool for large <b>neuronal</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the downregulation of KCC2 observed following <b>neuronal</b> trauma, and the consequent depolarizing shift of GABAA-mediated synapses, may be an aspect of <b>neuronal</b> de-differentiation. De-differentiation of damaged portions {{of the nervous system}} would allow for <b>neuronal</b> networks to return to higher levels of plasticity in order to rewire of surviving neurons to compensate for damage in the network. In addition, reduced glutamatergic transmission upon KCC2 downregulation may serve as a homeostatic process to compensate for the reduced GABA transmission due to altered chloride extrusion.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{identified}} some intrinsic <b>neuronal</b> properties that {{play an important}} role in generating membrane potential oscillations. In particular, voltage-gated ion channels are critical in the generation of action potentials. The dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well-established Hodgkin–Huxley model that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations. Using bifurcation analysis, different oscillatory varieties of these <b>neuronal</b> models can be determined, allowing for the classification of types of <b>neuronal</b> responses. The oscillatory dynamics of <b>neuronal</b> spiking as identified in the Hodgkin–Huxley model closely agree with empirical findings. In addition to periodic spiking, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, i.e. resonance behavior that does not result in action potentials, may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons. Like pacemaker neurons in central pattern generators, subtypes of cortical cells fire bursts of spikes (brief clusters of spikes) rhythmically at preferred frequencies. Bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations, and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance <b>neuronal</b> resonance.|$|E
25|$|After {{nerve damage}} or {{repeated}} stimulation, WDR (wide dynamic range) neurons experience a general increase in excitability. This hyper-excitability {{can be caused}} by an increased <b>neuronal</b> response to a noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia), a larger <b>neuronal</b> receptive field, or spread of the hyper-excitability to other segments. This condition is maintained by C fibers.|$|E
25|$|Phase {{resetting}} {{occurs when}} input to a neuron or <b>neuronal</b> ensemble resets {{the phase of}} ongoing oscillations. It is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to <b>neuronal</b> input (a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input, which {{is referred to as}} phase locking) and may also occur in <b>neuronal</b> ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously. Phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions because the timing of spikes can become phase locked to the activity of other neurons.|$|E
25|$|Loss of KCC2 {{following}} <b>neuronal</b> damage (i.e. ischemia, {{spinal cord}} damage, physical {{trauma to the}} central nervous system) results {{in the loss of}} inhibitory regulation and the subsequent development of <b>neuronal</b> hyperexcitability, motor spasticity, and seizure-like activity as GABAA receptors and glycine receptors revert from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing postsynaptic effects.|$|E
25|$|Vasomodulation: Astrocytes {{may serve}} as {{intermediaries}} in <b>neuronal</b> regulation of blood flow.|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} psycho-physical parallelism, superpositions appear {{rich enough}} to represent primitive conscious awareness. It seems that quantum superpositions have never been considered, for example, in <b>neuronal</b> models, since only classical states of deﬁnite <b>neuronal</b> excitation are usually taken into account. These quasi-classical states are also measured by external neurobiologists. Quantum theory would admit their superpositions, too, thus giving rise to a far greater variety of physical states which may be experienced by the subjective observer. When used for information processing, such superpositions would now be called “quantumbits” or qubits. As demonstrated by M. Tegmark, {{they can not be}} relevant for <b>neuronal</b> and similar processes in the brain.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies show}} that Notch can {{influence}} neurite development. In vivo, deletion of the Notch signaling modulator, Numb, disrupts <b>neuronal</b> maturation in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of Numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together these findings suggest Notch signaling might be crucial in <b>neuronal</b> maturation.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Dr. Clarren {{described}} a second infant whose {{mother was a}} binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal <b>neuronal</b> migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum. FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, <b>neuronal</b> migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.|$|E
25|$|Proneural {{genes are}} first {{expressed}} in neuroepithelial {{cells that are}} already specified for a neural fate and are self-renewing. Proneural activity results in the generation and delamination of progenitors that are restricted to the <b>neuronal</b> fate and have a limited mitotic potential. In some lineages, at least, proneural genes {{are involved in the}} commitment of neural progenitors to the <b>neuronal</b> fate at the expense of a glial fate.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} Ngn1 and Ngn2 are {{required}} to specify <b>neuronal</b> identity of cortical progenitors only in early stages of neocortex development.|$|E
25|$|The {{cell body}} of a neuron is {{supported}} by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. Other structural proteins that are important for <b>neuronal</b> function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during <b>neuronal</b> development.|$|E
