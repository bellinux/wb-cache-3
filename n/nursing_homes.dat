5|$|In {{the greater}} St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, area alone, 320,000 people {{evacuated}} {{ahead of the}} storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history. The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities, highways, and contingencies. Although {{the number of people}} required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters, only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters. Still, official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average, possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives, or increased awareness of available resources. Post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in Pinellas County, and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours, rather than the expected 15. With over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central Florida, evacuees became restless {{as a result of the}} duration of the storm. Supplies such as food ran short, and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely. The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients. Tampa General Hospital, at 84% of patient capacity, was evacuated; four more hospitals and around 19 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in Pinellas County were also cleared. Overall, nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety. Although successful, the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} participation in a home/community-based long-term care case management intervention (known as the Channeling demonstration), use of formal in-home care, and subsequent <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization. STUDY DESIGN. Structural analysis of the randomized Channeling intervention was conducted to decompose the total effects of Channeling on <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> use into direct and indirect effects. DATA COLLECTION METHOD. Secondary data analysis of the National Long-Term Care Data Set. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. The use of formal in-home care, which was increased by the Channeling intervention, was positively associated with <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization at 12 months. However, the negative direct effect of Channeling on <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> use was of sufficient magnitude to offset this positive indirect effect, so that a small but significant negative total effect of Channeling on subsequent <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization was found. CONCLUSIONS. This study shows why Channeling {{did not have a}} large total impact on <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization. The analysis did not provide evidence of direct substitution of in-home care for <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> care because the direct reductions in <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization due to other aspects of Channeling (including, but not limited to case management) were substantially offset by the indirect increases in <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> utilization associated with additional home care use...|$|R
