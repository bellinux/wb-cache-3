5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|To clarify, {{writing down}} further laws of Boolean algebra cannot {{give rise to}} any new {{consequences}} of these axioms, <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> rule out any model of them.

25|$|Because of {{the high}} level of {{microscopic}} detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, counterfeiting of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be scanned. In the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.|$|E
25|$|According to Strauss and Howe, {{there are}} many {{potential}} threats that could feed {{a growing sense of}} public urgency as the Fourth Turning progresses, including a terrorist attack, a financial collapse, a major war, a crisis of nuclear proliferation, an environmental crisis, an energy shortage, or new civil wars. The generational cycle cannot explain the role or timing of these individual threats. <b>Nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> account for the great events of history, like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Kennedy’s assassination, or 9/11. What the generational cycle can do, according to Strauss and Howe, is explain how society is likely to respond to these events in different eras. It is the response, not the initial event, which defines an era according to the theory. According to Strauss and Howe, the crisis period lasts for approximately 20 years.|$|E

25|$|An alternative, more esoteric, {{interpretation}} is expounded by Messianic Muslims in the Sufi and Isma'ili traditions {{so as to}} unite Islam, Christianity and Judaism into a single religious continuum. Other Messianic Muslims hold a similar theological view regarding Jesus, without attempting to unite the religions. Making use of the New Testament's distinguishing between Jesus, Son of Man (being the physical human Jesus), and Christ, Son of God (being the Holy Spirit of God residing {{in the body of}} Jesus), the Holy Spirit, being immortal and immaterial, is not subject to crucifixion — for it can never die, <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be touched by the earthly nails of the crucifixion, for it is a being of pure spirit. Thus, while the spirit of Christ avoided crucifixion by ascending unto God, the body that was Jesus was sacrificed on the cross, thereby bringing the Old Testament to final fulfillment. Thus Quranic passages on the death of Jesus affirm that while the Pharisees intended to destroy the Son of God completely, they, in fact, succeeded only in killing the Son of Man, being his nasut (material being). Meanwhile, the Son of God, being his lahut (spiritual being) remained alive and undying — because it is the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|Harmonix {{aimed to}} provide {{a wide range of}} music to players through {{additional}} content, stating that Rock Band is a music platform for discovering music. The developer released new songs, compatible with both games, through regular weekly downloadable content (DLC). including various singles, artist packs featuring three or more songs from the artists, and full albums. Downloadable songs are compatible with Rock Band and Rock Band 2. A portion of the downloadable song catalog is also compatible with Lego Rock Band, based on the songs' appropriateness for the game's family-friendly content rating. While The Beatles: Rock Band also supports downloadable content, the game does not share such content with the other Rock Band games, <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> use content from the other Rock Band games. Green Day: Rock Band does not have its own catalog of downloadable content but a select number of songs from the 21st Century Breakdown album were released to the Music Store prior to the game's release. These songs integrate with Green Day: Rock Band, enabling the player to play the complete 21st Century Breakdown album in the game. Downloadable content released on or after October 26, 2010 is restricted for use with Rock Band 3, Rock Band Blitz, and Rock Band 4 while content released on or after October 6, 2015 is restricted for use with Rock Band 4 only.|$|E

Members of the Jain community held nationwide protest marches against the ban on Sallekhana.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{discussed}} {{distinction is}} {{rejected by the}} majority of Western and Japanese scholars. It is contested by hermeneutic (interpretive) difficulties in the categorization of the different Taoist schools, sects and movements. Taoism does not fall under an umbrella or a definition of a single organized religion like the Abrahamic traditions; <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be studied as a mere variant of Chinese folk religion, as although the two share some similar concepts, much of Chinese folk religion is separate from the tenets and core teachings of Taoism. Sinologists Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn agree that [...] "Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{statement}} in the Institutes acknowledges its central theme. It states that the sum of human wisdom consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves. Calvin argues that the knowledge of God is not inherent in humanity <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be discovered by observing this world. The only way to obtain it is to study scripture. Calvin writes, [...] "For anyone to arrive at God the Creator he needs Scripture as his Guide and Teacher." [...] He does not try to prove the authority of scripture but rather describes it as autopiston or self-authenticating. He defends the trinitarian view of God and, in a strong polemical stand against the Catholic Church, argues that images of God lead to idolatry. At {{the end of the}} first book, he offers his views on providence, writing, [...] "By his Power God cherishes and guards the World which he made and by his Providence rules its individual Parts." [...] Humans are unable to fully comprehend why God performs any particular action, but whatever good or evil people may practise, their efforts always result in the execution of God's will and judgments.|$|E

500|$|Hippopotamuses have {{barrel-shaped}} {{bodies with}} short legs and long muzzles. Their skeletal structures are , adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity {{allows them to}} sink and move {{along the bottom of}} a river. Hippopotamuses have small legs (relative to other megafauna) because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotamuses can gallop at [...] on land but normally trot. They are incapable of jumping but do climb up steep banks. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer <b>nor</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom. The eyes, ears, and nostrils of hippos are placed high on the roof of their skulls. This allows these organs to remain above the surface {{while the rest of the}} body submerges. The testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. In addition, the penis retracts into the body when not erect. The genitals of the female are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large diverticula protrude from the vulval vestibule. The function of these is unknown.|$|E
