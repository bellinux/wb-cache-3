40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} time delay in several differential-delay equation focusing on the <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation.</b> We study these models for little or no delay to when the model has a very large delay parameter. We start with the logistic differential-delay equation applying techniques {{that would be used}} in subsequent chapters for other models being studied. A key goal of this research is to identify where the structure of the system does change. First, {{we investigate}} these models for critical point and study their behaviour close to these points. Of keen interest is the Hopf bifurcation points where we analyse the parameter associated with the Hopf point. The weakly nonlinear analysis carried out using the method of multiple time scale is used to give more insight to these model. The centre manifold method is shown to support the result derived using the multiple time scale. Then the second study carried out is the study of the transition from a sinelike wave to a square wave. This is analysed and a scale deduced at which this transition gradually takes place. One of the key areas we focused on in the large delay is to solve for a certain constant a' associated with the period of oscillation. The effect of the delayed parameter is shown throughout this thesis as a major contributor to the properties of both the logistic delay and the <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{injection}} of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) {{has been shown}} to induce a potent sequence-specific inhibition of gene function in diverse invertebrate and vertebrate species. The homology-dependent posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) caused by the introduction of transgenes in plants may be mediated by dsRNA. The analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants impaired with dsRNA-mediated silencing and studies in plants implicate a biological role of dsRNA-mediated silencing as a transposon-repression and antiviral mechanism. Results: We investigated the silencing of testis-expressed Stellate genes by paralogous Su(Ste) tandem repeats, which are known {{to be involved in the}} maintenance of male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that both strands of repressor Su(Ste) repeats are transcribed, producing sense and antisense RNA. The Stellate silencing is associated with the presence of short Su(Ste) RNAs. Cotransfection experiments revealed that Su(Ste) dsRNA can target and eliminate Stellate transcripts in Drosophila cell culture. The short fragment of Stellate gene that is homologous to Su(Ste) was shown to be sufficient to confer Su(Ste) -dependent silencing of a reporter construct in testes. We demonstrated that Su(Ste) dsRNA-mediated silencing affects not only Stellate expression but also the level of sense Su(Ste) RNA providing a <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of Su(Ste) expression. Mutation in the spindle-E gene relieving Stellate silencing also leads to a derepression of the other genomic tandem repeats and retrotransposons in the germline. Conclusions: Homology-dependent gene silencing was shown to be used to inhibit Stellate gene expression in the D. melanogaster germline, ensuring male fertility. dsRNA-mediated silencing may provide a basis for negative autogenous control of gene expression. The related surveillance system is implicated to control expression of retrotransposons in the germline...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model based on equilibrium binding between Gal 14 p and its specific DNA binding site has been developed. A model for GAL, gene expression solely due to cooperativity, {{as a function}} of Ga 14 p concentration, has been developed for a gal 80 mutant. The above model was extended to include other known regulatory molecules, namely Gal 80 p and Gal 3 p. Parameters determined from the above simulation were then used to represent a physiological status of gene expression in response to glucose (in terms of Gal 4 p concentration) and galactose in a wild-type strain. We demonstrate that in a wild-type strain glucose repression is more stringent due to cooperativity and <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation,</b> while the induction response to galactose is only through <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation.</b> The biological significance of <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is discussed vis-a-vis the lactose operon of Escherichia coli...|$|R

40|$|The rate of {{accumulation}} of each ribosomal protein is carefully {{regulated by the}} yeast cell to provide the equimolar ratio necessary for the assembly of the ribosome. The mechanisms responsible for this regulation have been examined by introducing into the yeast cell extra copies of seven individual ribosomal protein genes carried on autonomously replicating plasmids. In each case studied the plasmid-borne gene was transcribed {{to the same degree}} as the genomic gene. Nevertheless, the cell maintained a balanced {{accumulation of}} ribosomal proteins, using a variety of methods other than transcription. (i) Several ribosomal proteins were synthesized in substantial excess. However, the excess ribosomal protein was rapidly degraded. (ii) The excess mRNA for two of the ribosomal protein genes was translated inefficiently. We provide evidence that this was due to inefficient initiation of translation. (iii) The transcripts derived from two of the ribosomal protein genes were spliced inefficiently, leading to an accumulation of precursor RNA. We present a model which proposes the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of mRNA splicing as a eucaryotic parallel of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of mRNA translation in procaryotes.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} mRNA transcripts were synthesized in Escherichia coli during {{expression of}} FSendA, an endoglucanase gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes AR 1. Expression of FSendA required a ribosomal frameshift between {{open reading frame}} 1 (ORF 1) and ORF 2 to allow contiguous translation of a 453 amino acid protein (1). The primary transcript initiated upstream of ORF 1 and the secondary transcript from within ORF 1. Both transcripts terminated downstream of ORF 2 and termination was essential for endoglucanase expression. Deletion of the primary transcript promoter region allowed read-through of the secondary transcript beyond the terminator region, indicating that {{a component of the}} intact FSendA gene allowed efficient transcription termination.

This "autogenous regulation hypothesis" has recently shown to be erroneous, in the very organism for which it was first proposed. Nevertheless this erroneous hypothesis have led to a thorough dissection of the process of regulation of nitrate assimilation and more importantly to a hypothesis bearing on the origin of metabolite-responsive transcription factors.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{regulation}} of ribosomal protein (r-protein) synthesis in Xenopus anucleolate mutants, which lack the genes for rRNA. The accumulation of mRNA for the two r-proteins analyzed parallels the controls up to stage 30. This mRNA is mobilized onto polysomes and is translated as in normal embryos, but r-proteins are unstable {{in the absence of}} rRNA to assemble with. A translational control of rp-mRNA distribution between polysomes and mRNPs is observed, but this is not due to an <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> by r-proteins.

40|$|The type III {{secretion}} system (T 3 SS) is {{a principal}} virulence determi- nant of the model bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. T 3 SS effector proteins inhibit plant defense signaling pathways in susceptible hosts and elicit evolved immunity in resistant plants. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL coordinates the expression of most T 3 SS genes. Transcription of hrpL is depen- dent on sigma- 54 and the codependent enhancer binding proteins HrpR and HrpS for hrpL promoter activation. hrpL is oriented adjacently to and divergently from the HrpL-dependent gene hrpJ, sharing an intergenic upstream regulatory region. We show that association of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) -HrpL complex with the hrpJ promoter element imposes <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control on hrpL transcription in P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000. The hrpL promoter was upregulated in a Δ hrpL mu- tant and was repressed by plasmid-borne hrpL. In a minimal Escherichia coli back- ground, the activity of HrpL was sufficient to achieve repression of reconstituted hrpL transcription. This repression was relieved if both the HrpL DNA-binding func- tion and the hrp -box sequence of the hrpJ promoter were compromised, implying dependence upon the hrpJ promoter. DNA-bound RNAP-HrpL entirely occluded the HrpRS and partially occluded the integration host factor (IHF) recognition elements of the hrpL promoter in vitro, implicating inhibition of DNA binding by these factors {{as a cause of}} <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control. A modest increase in the HrpL concen- tration caused hypersecretion of the HrpA 1 pilus protein but intracellular accumula- tion of later T 3 SS substrates.

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae {{represents}} the primary model organism {{with which the}} molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions and co-evolution of host-specificity have been explored. Its virulence is dependent upon the needle-like Type-III secretion system (T 3 SS) for translocation of effector proteins that interfere with plant defence signalling into the host cell cytoplasm. The sigma factor (σ) HrpL co-ordinates the concomitant transcription of genes encoding the T 3 SS complex and its associated substrates. In P. syringae, the paralogous activator proteins HrpR and HrpS are both required for σ 54 -dependent transcription of hrpL. Furthermore, HrpS is subject to allosteric inhibition by HrpV, which is in turn relieved by HrpG. A holistic view of how signalling and regulatory processes control the transition into hrpL-dependent pathogenicity {{in response to the}} in planta environment is lacking. In this thesis, I first present evidence for <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control of the hrpL gene by its σ factor product in the P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 strain. This novel mechanism is dependent upon HrpL recruiting the bacterial RNA polymerase to the adjacent and divergently transcribed hrpJ promoter. Preliminary in vitro studies suggest that the physical proximity of the RNAP-HrpL holoenzyme complex inhibits at a distance one or more regulatory events required for transcription initiation at hrpL. With respect to its physiological significance, functional analyses infer that the fine control of HrpL expression afforded by <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control of HrpL expression contributes to correctly ordered T 3 SS secretion. Secondly, I show that by modulating the activity of the global Gac-Rsm signalling cascade the sensor histidine kinase RetS positively regulates T 3 SS gene expression as well as affecting other aspects of lifestyle switching. Control of hrpL expression by Gac-Rsm is exerted in part via post-transcriptional regulation of HrpV which, indicative of divergent target specificities, is achieved to varying extents by the three CsrA paralogues in P. syringae.

The lon (capR) gene deoxyribonucleic acid was cloned {{from a new}} F′ factor. The new plasmids, designated pBZ 201 and pBZ 203, (i) contained an additional 8. 2 -megadalton (Md) EcoRI fragment that had the same mobility {{as one of the}} EcoRI fragments of the F′, and (ii) conferred repression of capsular polysaccharide synthesis and repression of sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation in a bacterial transformation experiment with capR mutant recipient strains. A capR 9 mutant plasmid, pBZ 201 M 9, was also isolated and conferred expression of mucoidy and ultraviolet sensitivity to a capR+ (lon+) strain, indicating that the capR 9 allele was dominant. Plasmids pBZ 201 M 80, pBZ 201 M 9 -INSA, and pBZ 201 M 9 -INSB were characterized by transformation as containing recessive capR mutant alleles. Heteroduplex analyses and agarose gel electrophoresis of restriction endonuclease digests of plasmid DNA preparations revealed that (i) pBZ 201 M 9 -INSA and pBZ 201 M 9 -INSB each contains a 0. 5 -Md insertion (probably IS 1) in the cloned DNA fragment at the same site, and (ii) pBZ 201 and pBZ 203, both capR+ plasmids, contain the same 8. 2 -Md fragment cloned in opposite orientations with respect to the cloning vehicle, pSC 101. Plasmid-specified polypeptides were determined by using strain CSR 603 maxicells containing each plasmid. Two new polypeptides were coded by the lon+ (capR+) 8. 2 -Md DNA fragment: Z 1, 94 kilodaltons (94 K), and Z 2, 67 K. The maxicells containing recessive capR mutant plasmids were deficient only in synthesis of the 94 K polypeptide, and the dominant (capR 9) mutant plasmid specified 5 to 10 times more of the 94 K polypeptide than the maxicells containing the capR+ plasmid. Other data indicated that the capR 9 -specified “ 94 K polypeptide” was not identical to the capR+-specified “ 94 K polypeptide. ” Thus the altered mutant polypeptide was synthesized in increased quantities, suggesting a defective mode of <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> for the capR 9 polypeptide and effective <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of the capR+ polypeptide...|$|R
40|$|Yra 1 p is an {{essential}} RNA-binding protein that couples transcription to export. The YRA 1 gene {{is one of only}} ∼ 5 % of genes that undergo splicing in budding yeast, and its intron is unusual in several respects, including its large size and anomalous branchpoint sequence. We showed previously that the intron is required for <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of Yra 1 p levels, which cause a dominant negative growth phenotype when elevated. The mechanism of this regulation, however, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that growth is inversely correlated with splicing efficiency. Substitution of a canonical branchpoint moderately improves splicing but compromises autoregulation. Shortening the intron from 766 to ∼ 350 nt significantly improves splicing but abolishes autoregulation. Notably, proper regulation can be restored by insertion of unrelated sequences into the shortened intron. In that the current paradigm for regulated splicing involves the binding of protein factors to specific elements in the pre-mRNA, the regulation of YRA 1 expression appears to occur by a novel mechanism. We propose that appropriate levels of Yra 1 p are maintained by inefficient cotranscriptional splicing...|$|R

We specifically focus on (1) RNA interactions with fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP; (2) protein sequestration caused by CGG repeats; (3) noncoding transcripts regulated by TAR DNA-binding protein 43 TDP- 43; (4) <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of TDP- 43 and FMRP; (5) iron-mediated expression of amyloid precursor protein APP and α-synuclein; (6) interactions between prions and RNA aptamers.

40|$|Expression of the Escherichia coli StpA protein was {{investigated}} and a functional comparison undertaken with the structurally analogous nucleoid protein H-NS. Analysis of stpA and hns expression indicated that although stpA transcript levels are {{much lower than}} those of hns, the two gene products are capable of both <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control and cross-regulation. Examination of cellular proteins in stpA, hns, or stpA-hns backgrounds revealed that StpA can repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes. Mechanistic parallels in regulation of gene expression are indicated by the ability of both proteins to inhibit transcription from promoters containing curved DNA sequences, and to form nucleoprotein structures that constrain DNA supercoils. Despite their functional similarities, each molecule is capable of independent activities. Thus, H-NS regulates a class of genes that are unaffected by StpA in vivo, whereas StpA has much stronger RNA chaperone activity in vitro. We therefore propose that in addition to its role as a molecular back-up of H-NS, StpA's superior effect on RNA may be exploited under some specific cellular conditions to promote differential gene expression...|$|R

To define sequence and structural elements responsible for translational efficiency and autoregulation of the rpsA mRNA, a series of rpsA′–′lacZ chromosomal fusions bearing various mutations in the rpsA TIR was created and tested for β-galactosidase activity in the absence and presence of excess S 1. These in vivo results, as well as data obtained by in vitro techniques and phylogenetic comparison, allow us to propose a model for the structural and functional organization of the rpsA TIR specific for proteobacteria related to E. coli. According to the model, the high efficiency of translation initiation is provided by a specific fold of the rpsA leader forming a non-contiguous ribosome entry site, which is destroyed upon binding of free S 1 when it acts as an autogenous repressor...|$|R
40|$|Feedback-based control methods {{determine}} {{the behavior of}} cellular systems, an example being <b>autogenous</b> control, the <b>regulation</b> of production of a protein by itself. This control strategy was theoretically shown to be superior to an equivalent but nonautogenously regulated system when based on a repressor. Although some of its advantages were later confirmed with isolated synthetic circuits, the superiority of autogenous control in natural networks remains untested. Here, we use the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli, where autogenous control {{is part of a}} single-input module, as a valid model to evaluate the functional advantages and biological implications of this mechanism. We redesign the control of its master regulator, the protein LexA, so that it becomes nonautogenously controlled. We compare both systems by combining high-resolution expression measurements with mathematical modeling. We show that the stronger stability associated with the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> prevents false triggering of the response due to transient fluctuations in the inducing signal and that this control also reduces the system recovery time at low DNA damage. Likewise, autoregulation produces responses proportional to the damage signal level. In contrast, bacteria with LexA constitutively expressed induce maximal action even for very low damage levels. This excess in response comes at a cost, because it reduces comparatively the growth rate of these cells. Our results suggest that autogenous control evolved as a strategy to optimally respond to multiple levels of input signal minimizing the costs of the response and highlights reasons why master regulators of single-input modules are mostly autorepressed...|$|R

Genetic and biochemical studies have suggested that L 4 can interact with 23 S rRNA as well as with both RNA interactions. However, no significant similarities between its two RNA targets {{can be found at the}} primary or secondary structure level. To test if identical determinants of L 4 are involved in both ribosome assembly and autogenous control, we have isolated L 4 mutants defective in either of these functions and asked if a mutant protein divested of one function is also deficient in the other. Several mutations eliminated autogenous control, but still allowed assembly of the mutant L 4 protein into functional ribosomes. Conversely, several mutant L 4 proteins that could not be detected in 50 S subunits nevertheless could regulate expression of the S 10 operon.

We previously showed that this enzyme binds tightly to azacytidine-containing DNA in vitro and proposed that such binding is lethal in vivo. In support of this proposal, we now show that the enzyme sediments with the nucleoid of azacytidine-treated cells. Azacytidine treatment led {{to an increase in}} the amount of enzyme, and this increase required sequences in the ecoRIIM promoter region. Enzyme inducibility correlated with drug sensitivity: plasmids carrying the methyltransferase gene but lacking the wild-type promoter did not confer sensitivity. These results suggested that the ecoRIIM gene was under autogenous control. Transcriptional ecoRIIM'-lacZ fusions in E. coli were, therefore, constructed. They showed that expression from the ecoRIIM promoter was inhibited when EcoRII DNA (cytosine- 5) methyltransferase was introduced into the cell in trans and inhibition was reversed by treating the cells with azacytidine.

Understanding the decision-making strategies that enable bacterial plant pathogens to evade the host immune system and cause disease is essential for managing their ever growing threat to food security. Many utilise the needle-like type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to suppress plant immunity, by injecting effector proteins that inhibit eukaryotic signalling pathways into the host cell cytoplasm. Plants can in turn evolve resistance to specific pathogens via recognition and blocking of the T 3 SS effectors, so leading to an ongoing co-evolutionary ‘arms race’ between pathogen and host pairs. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL co-ordinates {{the expression of the}} T 3 SS regulon in the leaf-dwelling Pseudomonas syringae and similar pathogens. Recently, we showed that association of HrpL with a target promoter directly adjacent to the hrpL gene imposes <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control on its own expression level due to overlapping regulatory elements.

40|$|Lrp (leucine-responsive {{regulatory}} protein) {{is a major}} Escherichia coli {{regulatory protein}} which regulates expression {{of a number of}} operons, some negatively and some positively. This work relates to a characterization of lrp, the gene encoding Lrp. Nucleotide sequencing established that the coding regions of lrp and trxB (encoding thioredoxin reductase) are separated by 543 bp and that the two genes are transcribed in opposite directions. In addition, we used primer extension, deletion analyses, and lrp-lacZ transcriptional fusions to delineate the promoter and regulatory region of the lrp operon. The lrp promoter is located 267 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon of the lrp gene. In comparison with a wild-type strain, expression of the lrp operon was increased about 3 -fold in a strain lacking Lrp and decreased about 10 -fold in a strain overproducing Lrp. As observed from DNA mobility shift and DNase I footprinting analyses, Lrp binds to one or more sites within the region - 80 to - 32 relative to the start point of lrp transcription. A mutational analysis indicated that this same region is at least partly required for repression of lrp expression in vivo. These results demonstrate that <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of lrp involves Lrp acting directly to cause repression of lrp transcription...|$|R

Results of an RNA run-on assay indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis does not alter tubulin gene transcription. Analysis of the decay of tubulin mRNA in embryos in which RNA synthesis was inhibited by actinomycin D indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis prevents the destabilization of tubulin mRNA. The effect was similar whether mRNA was maintained on polysomes {{in the presence of}} emetine or anisomycin or displaced from the polysomes in the presence of puromycin or pactamycin; thus, the stabilization of tubulin mRNA is not dependent {{on the state of the}} polysomes after inhibition of protein synthesis. Even after tubulin mRNA declined to a low level after depolymerization of microtubules, it could be rescued by treatment of embryos with inhibitors of protein synthesis. Tubulin mRNA could be induced to accumulate prematurely in gastrulae but not in plutei if protein synthesis was inhibited, an observation that is indicative of the importance of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of tubulin mRNA stability during embryogenesis.

40|$|Background: TATA Binding Protein (TBP) is {{required}} for transcription initiation by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. It participates in transcriptional initiation at the majority of eukaryotic gene promoters, either by direct association to the TATA box upstream of the transcription start site or by indirectly localizing to the promoter through other proteins. TBP exists in solution in a dimeric form but binds to DNA as a monomer. Here, we present the first mathematical model for auto-catalytic TBP expression {{and use it to}} study the role of dimerization in maintaining the steady state TBP level. Results: We show that the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of TBP results in a system that is capable of exhibiting three steady states: an unstable low TBP state, one stable state corresponding to a physiological TBP concentration, and another stable steady state corresponding to unviable cells where no TBP is expressed. Our model predicts that a basal level of TBP {{is required}} to establish the transcription of the TBP gene, and hence for cell viability. It also predicts that, for the condition corresponding to a typical mammalian cell, the high-TBP state and cell viability is sensitive to variation in DNA binding strength. We use the model to explore the effect of the dimer in buffering the response to changes in TBP levels, and show that for some physiological conditions the dimer is not important in buffering against perturbations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> is {{a general}} {{strategy}} of balancing ribosomal protein synthesis in bacteria. Control mechanisms have been studied in detail for most of ribosomal protein operons, except for rpsB-tsf encoding essential r-protein S 2 and elongation factor Ts, where even the promoter has remained unknown. By using single-copy translational fusions with the chromosomal lacZ gene and Western-blot analysis, we demonstrate here that S 2 serves as a negative regulator of both rpsB and tsf expression in vivo, acting at a single target within the rpsB 5 ′-untranslated region (5 ′-UTR). As determined by primer extension, transcription of the Escherichia coli rpsB-tsf operon starts 162 nucleotides upstream of the rpsB initiation codon at a single promoter TGTGGTATAAA belonging to the extended − 10 promoter class. Both the promoter signature and the 5 ′-UTR structure of the rpsB gene appear to be highly conserved in γ-proteobacteria. Deletion analysis of the rpsB 5 ′-UTR within rpsB′-′lacZ fusions has revealed that an operator region involved in the S 2 autoregulation comprises conserved structural elements located upstream of the rpsB ribosome binding site. The S 2 -mediated autogenous control is impaired in rpsB mutants and, more surprisingly, in the rpsA mutant producing decreased amounts of truncated r-protein S 1 (rpsA∷IS 10), indicating that S 2 might act as a repressor in cooperation with S 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{products}} of the HIR 1 and HIR 2 genes have been defined genetically as repressors of histone gene transcription in S. cerevisiae. A mutation in either gene affects cell cycle regulation {{of three of the}} four histone gene loci; transcription of these loci occurs throughout the cell cycle and is no longer repressed in response to the inhibition of DNA replication. The same mutations also eliminate <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of the HTA 1 -HTB 1 locus by histones H 2 A and H 2 B. The HIR 1 and HIR 2 genes have been isolated, and their roles in the transcriptional regulation of the HTA 1 -HTB 1 locus have been characterized. Neither gene encodes an essential protein, and null alleles derepress HTA 1 -HTB 1 transcription. Both HIR genes are expressed constitutively under conditions that lead to repression or derepression of the HTA 1 gene, and neither gene regulates the expression of the other. The sequence of the HIR 1 gene predicts an 88 -kDa protein with three repeats of a motif found in the G beta subunit of retinal transducin and in a yeast transcriptional repressor, Tup 1. The sequence of the HIR 2 gene predicts a protein of 98 kDa. Both gene products contain nuclear targeting signals, and the Hir 2 protein is localized in the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The first enzyme for {{histidine}} biosynthesis, {{encoded in}} the hisG gene, {{is involved in}} regulation of expression of the histidine operon in Salmonella typhimurium. The studies reported here concern {{the question of how}} expression of the histidine operon is affected by a mutation in the hisG gene that alters the allosteric site of the first enzyme for histidine biosynthesis, rendering the enzyme completely resistant to inhibition by histidine. The intracellular concentrations of the enzymes encoded in the histidine operon in a strain carrying such a mutation on an episome and missing the chromosomal hisG gene are three- to fourfold higher than in a strain carrying a wild-type hisG gene on the episome. The histidine operon on such a strain fails to derepress in response to histidine limitation and fails to repress in response to excess histidine. Furthermore, utilizing other merodiploid strains, we demonstrate that the wild-type hisG gene is trans dominant to the mutant allele with respect to this regulatory phenomenon. Examination of the regulation of the histidine operon in strains carrying the feedback-resistant mutation in an episome and hisT and hisW mutations in the chromosome showed that the hisG regulatory mutation is epistatic to the hisT and hisW mutations. These data provide additional evidence that the first enzyme for histidine biosynthesis is involved in <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of expression of the histidine operon...|$|R
40|$|Carbon catabolic {{repression}} (CR) by the catabolite control protein CcpA has been analyzed in Staphylococcus xylosus. Genes encoding components needed to utilize lactose, sucrose, and maltose {{were found to}} be repressed by CcpA. In addition, the ccpA gene is under <b>negative</b> <b>autogenous</b> control. Among several tested sugars, glucose caused strongest CcpA-dependent repression. Glucose can enter S. xylosus in nonphosphorylated form via the glucose uptake protein GlcU. Internal glucose is then phosphorylated by the glucose kinase GlkA. Alternatively, glucose can be transported and concomitantly phosphorylated by glucose-specific permease(s) of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). S. xylosus mutant strains deficient in GlcU or GlkA showed partial relief of glucose-specific, CcpA-dependent repression. Likewise, blocking PTS activity completely by inactivation of the gene encoding the general PTS protein enzyme I resulted in diminished glucose-mediated repression. Thus, both glucose entry routes contribute to glucosespecific CR in S. xylosus. The sugar transport activity of the PTS is not required to trigger glucose-specific repression. The phosphocarrier protein HPr however, is absolutely essential for CcpA activity. Inactivation of the HPr gene led to a complete loss of CR. Repression is also abolished upon inactivation of the HPr kinase gene or by replacing serine at position 46 of HPr by alanine. These results clearly show that HPr kinase provides the signal, seryl-phosphorylated HPr, to activate CcpA in S. xylosus...|$|R
40|$|A plasmid (pRSE 562) {{containing}} the metE and metR genes of Escherichia coli {{was used to}} study the expression of these genes {{and the role of}} the MetR protein in regulating metE expression. DNA sequence analysis of the 236 -base-pair region separating these genes showed the presence of seven putative met boxes. When this plasmid was used to transform either wild-type E. coli, metE mutant, or metR mutant, MetE enzyme activity increased 5 - to 7 -fold over wild-type levels. The metR gene was subcloned from pRSE 562, and this plasmid, pMRIII, relieved the methionine auxotrophy of a metR mutant after transformation. The metR gene was also cloned into a vector {{containing the}} lambda PL promoter, and the MetR protein was overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity. This protein, when added to an in vitro DNA-dependent protein synthesis system in which the MetE and/or MetR proteins were synthesized, caused a large increase in the expression of the metE gene but a decrease in the expression of the metR gene. The in vitro expression of both genes was inhibited by the MetJ protein and S-adenosylmethionine in the presence or absence of MetR protein. These results provide evidence that the product of the metR gene is a trans-activator of the expression of the metE gene and that the expression of the metR gene is under <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> and is repressed by the MetJ protein...|$|R
