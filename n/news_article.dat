40|$|Automatically Linking News {{articles}} to Blog entries People often write in their blogs about <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> or events in <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> In this case, however, {{the details of}} the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> or events are often poorly described in such blog entries. Therefore, the readers of blogs need to find the original articles, which contain more details of the <b>news</b> <b>articles,</b> when they want to know about them. In this paper, we propose a method for linking <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> to blog entries that refer to them. Since blog entries and <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> are considered to be rather different, the common model for linking is not applicable.

The current study explores intertextuality and its function in reproducing the underlying ideology and power relations in the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> on Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the news Websites of AJE and CNN. The study adopted Fairclough’s (1995) approach to CDA, the Three Dimensional Framework, to examine the use and functions of intertextuality in 6 <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> of AJE and CNN. The study focuses on intertextuality, specifically in the inclusion and exclusion of the “voices” in the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> through the use of direct and indirect reporting of speech. A Critical Discourse Analysis in the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> of AJE and CNN reveals how the producers of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> in the <b>news</b> websites construct and incorporate the various voices for ideological purposes. The study demonstrates that the way writers incorporated the voices in the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> using the direct and indirect reported speech is found to be loaded with ideological bias. The study reveals that there is a relationship between the way writers report the voices of others in the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> and the objectives of the writers which clearly show the relationship between language, ideology and power in the new articles of AJE and CNN. The study suggests that the issue of intertextuality in the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> on to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict published in the international news Websites of AJE and CNN needs to be explored and examined in a broader political context which the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> are embedded...|$|R

In 2012, Satoru falls from the SPHIA facility's clock tower and loses consciousness. Cocoro wakes up {{in a room and}} is relieved to find that Yuni is safe. Yuni does not recognize her; when looking at herself in a mirror, she sees a man's body. Similarly, Satoru wakes up in a woman's body. Both eventually switch back to their respective bodies, but the phenomenon continues, with their minds moving between their bodies; they conclude that their consciousnesses are transcending time and space. In the cabin, a <b>news</b> <b>article</b> dated July 4, 2011 is found, which says that Yuni was the only survivor, with the other three having died in an avalanche on January 17.

Mercedes meets Doctor Browning {{at the hospital and}} he asks to keep seeing and paying Mercedes, which she agrees to. Mercedes convinces Lynsey to help a patient who is DNR. Lynsey is blamed for the incident and Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning had not put the patient's DNR request into their file. Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning is married and threatens him, telling him she will tell his wife of their relationship should he report Lynsey. Mercedes joins an escorting website. She is contacted by a client and arranges to meet him at a hotel. Lynsey finds Mercedes and stops her going ahead with it. Mercedes becomes depressed and Jacqui meets Riley, telling him if Mercedes were to see Bobby then she would feel better. Riley later arrives back in Hollyoaks asking Mercedes to sign legal documents so he will have full custody of Bobby. Mercedes and Riley agree to attend mediation, but Mercedes does not turn up as she gets drunk. Mercedes sees an online <b>news</b> <b>article</b> showing a picture of Riley and Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) together and considers running away with Bobby, but instead attends Bobby's christening service and slaps Mitzeee. She witnesses Riley and Mitzeee kissing in the car park and later confronts them. Mercedes begins stalking Mitzeee who leaves the village temporarily. Mercedes learns Silas will not be put to trial and will be put in an institute for the insane. Mercedes tells people she is fine but begins having nightmares of her time imprisoned by Silas. Mercedes meets up with Doctor Browning and has sex with him. Mercedes begins escorting again and while meeting a client, locks herself in the bathroom. Lynsey arrives and comforts Mercedes.|$|E

These classifiers need to be trained with data in order to predict a result for future input. The authors chose to investigate how accurate two classifiers are when classifying recent <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> on a classifier model that is trained with older <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> To reach a result the authors chose the Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers and conducted an experiment. The experiment involved training models of both classifiers with <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> from 2005 and testing the models with <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> from 2005 and 2017 to compare the results. The results showed that both classifiers did considerably worse when classifying the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> from 2017 compared to classifying the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> from the same year as the training data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Web is a {{collection}} of heterogeneous as well as unstructured set of <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> This paper presents a novel approach to retrieve relevant <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> from heterogeneous and unstructured collection of articles. Efficient retrieval requires analysis of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> based on keyword. Two problems that occur in the analysis of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> are synonymy and polysemy. In this paper, we present a News Retrieval approach based on Latent Semantic Index (LSI) and Clustering. It includes projection of keyword-news article matrix into small spaces called clusters. After that, clustering approach is used to group relevant articles into clusters...|$|R

Malcolm comes to visit his parents and detects all is not well between them. Susan becomes worried when Jim does not answer her calls and Karl confesses that he asked Jim to keep his distance, which angers Susan. She accuses Karl of being jealous. Karl invites Jim over for lunch and he notices the map and leaflets for Peru. Jim works out Susan is delaying the holiday for him. He then collapses and Susan begs Karl to save him. Susan comforts Jim when he realises he is going to die and she tries to take him out of {{the hospital}}, so they can visit his childhood home, as promised. Karl stops her and when they step outside to talk, Jim dies. Susan is devastated and blames Karl for keeping her from Jim. She then leaves to arrange Jim's funeral. On her return, Susan and Karl announce that they are separating. Malcolm initially blames Susan for the split, but Karl confesses it was his idea. Karl tells Susan that he cannot be just friends with her and he looks for somewhere else to live. Susan starts a book group with Kate and Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey).|$|E

40|$|Social media {{platforms}} {{have grown}} into an important medium to spread information about an event {{published by the}} traditional media, such as <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> Grouping such diverse sources of information that discuss the same topic in varied perspectives provide new insights. But the gap in word usage between informal social media content such as tweets and diligently written content (e. g. <b>news</b> <b>articles)</b> make such assembling difficult. In this paper, we propose a transformation framework to bridge the word usage gap between tweets and online <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> across languages by leveraging their word embeddings. Using our framework, word embeddings extracted from tweets and <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> are aligned closer to each other across languages, thus facilitating the identification of similarity between <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> and tweets. Experimental results show a notable improvement over baselines for monolingual tweets and <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> comparison, while new findings are reported for cross-lingual comparison.

40|$|In {{this era}} of the Internet, the amount of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> added every minute of {{everyday}} is humongous. As {{a result of this}} explosive amount of <b>news</b> <b>articles,</b> <b>news</b> retrieval systems are required to process the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> frequently and intensively. The news retrieval systems that are in-use today are not capable of coping up with these data-intensive computations. Cloudpress 2. 0 presented here, is designed and implemented to be scalable, robust and fault tolerant. It is designed in such a way that, all the processes involved in news retrieval such as fetching, pre-processing, indexing, storing and summarizing, exploit MapReduce paradigm and use the power of the Cloud computing. It uses novel approaches for parallel processing, for storing the <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> in a distributed database and for visualizing them as a 3 D visual. It uses Lucene-based indexing for efficient and faster retrieval. It also includes a novel query expansion feature for searching the <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> Cloudpress 2. 0 also allows on-the-fly, extractive summarization of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> based on the input query.

40|$|Retrospective news event {{detection}} (RED) {{is defined}} as the discovery of previously unidentified events in historical news corpus. Although both the contents and time information of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> are helpful to RED, most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> Few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information. In this paper, we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> On the one hand, <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> are always aroused by events; on the other hand, similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources. The former hints a generative model of <b>news</b> <b>articles,</b> and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform RED. With consideration of these characteristics, we propose a probabilistic model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified framework. This model gives new representations of both <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> and <b>news</b> events. Furthermore, based on this approach, we build an interactive RED system, HISCOVERY, which provides additional functions to present events, Photo Story and Chronicle...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a method for automatic construction of multi-document summaries of sets of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> that might be retrieved by a web search engine in response to a user query. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the cross-document discourse analysis, an event-based framework is proposed for integrating and organizing information extracted from different <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> It has a hierarchical structure in which the summarized information is presented at the top level and more detailed information given at the lower levels. A tree-view interface was implemented for displaying a multi-document summary based on the framework. A preliminary user evaluation was performed by comparing the framework-based summaries against the sentence-based summaries. Findings – In a small evaluation, all the human subjects preferred the framework-based summaries to the sentence-based summaries. It indicates that the event-based framework is an effective way to summarize a set of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> reporting an event or a series of relevant events. Research limitations/implications – Limited to event-based <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> only, not applicable to news critiques and other kinds of <b>news</b> <b>articles.</b> A summarization system based on the event-based framework is being implemented. Practical implications – Multi-document summarization of <b>news</b> <b>articles</b> can adopt the proposed event-based framework.
