Different operating conditions of the Hyshot scramjet nozzle were simulated and analyzed. Three chemical status, frozen flow, equilibrium flow, and non-equilibrium flow, were tested and compared to demonstrate the chemical reaction effect on nozzle flow field. The real non-equilibrium flow simulation result is between those of the two limiting cases: frozen flow and equilibrium flow, and is closer to that of frozen flow.

40|$|The {{development}} of the swirling flame flow field and gasification/ combustion dynamics at thermo-chemical conversion of biomass pellets has experimentally been studied using a pilot device, which combines a biomass gasifier and combustor by varying the inlet conditions of the fuel-air mixture into the combustor. Experimental modelling {{of the formation of}} the cold nonreacting swirling airflow field above the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the combustor and the upstream flow formation below the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> has been carried out to assess the influence of the <b>inlet</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter, as well primary and secondary air supply rates on the upstream flow formation and air swirl intensity, which is highly responsible for the formation of fuel-air mixture entering the combustor and the {{development of}} combustion dynamics downstream of the combustor.

40|$|The non-steady flow {{generated}} by convection of gas containing non-uniform temperature regions or "entropy spots" through a nozzle is examined analytically {{as a source}} of acoustic disturbance. The first portion of the investigation treats the "compact nozzle", the case where all wave lengths are much longer than the nozzle. Strengths of transmitted and reflected one-dimensional waves are given for supersonic and subsonic nozzles and for one configuration of supersonic nozzle with normal shock at the outlet. In addition to a wave reflected from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>inlet,</b> the supersonic nozzle discharges two waves, one facing upstream and the other facing downstream. For reasonable values of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>inlet</b> Mach number, the pressure amplitude of each wave increases directly as the discharge Mach number. The acoustic perturbations from a supercritical nozzle of finite length, in which the undisturbed gas velocity increases linearly through the nozzle, are analyzed for several inlet and discharge Mach number values and over a wide frequency range. The results, which agree with the compact analysis for low frequency, deviate considerably as the frequency rises, achieving pressure fluctuation levels of several times the compact values. It is shown that this result originates in a phase shift between the two waves emitted downstream and that the pressure fluctuations for moderate frequencies may be approximated from the compact analysis with an appropriate phase shift. In all cases, the pressure fluctuations caused by a 2...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Three-dimensional {{multiphase}} flow simulation is conducted {{in order to}} clarify {{the relationship between the}} internal flow in solid rocket motor and the erosion of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>inlet</b> part. The basic equations are described in the Eulerian approach for gas and alumina smoke, whereas they are described in the Lagrangian approach for aluminum/alumina droplets. The scheme is named Eulerian-Hybrid method because it deals with the particulates in both approaches. The size of the particles generated from the propellant surface is determined according to a bi-modal probability distribution function. The combustion of the aluminum/alumina droplets completes after floating for a finite time and alumina smoke is generated from the droplets {{as a result of the}} combustion. It is assumed that the local equilibrium of the velocity and the temperature between the alumina smoke and the gas exists and they are treated as one Eulerian phase. On the other hand, the aluminum/alumina droplets are called the Lagrangian phase and they exchange the mass, momentum, and energy with the Eulerian phase. Moreover, the breakup of the particle is considered with the criteria of critical Weber number. The numerical simulation has been conducted for a model solid rocket motor with seven axial slots in the propellant grain. From the results of simulation, the low temperature regions in the vicinity of the propellant burning surface are observed to recognize the effect of the distributed combustion. Also, particle streamlines from the slots impinge over the <b>nozzle</b> <b>inlet</b> region are observed and the mass and momentum fluxes of the colliding particle...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{impinging}} liquid jets in electronics {{thermal management}} is attracting some consideration {{due to their}} very high heat transfer coefficients, hot spot targeting capabilities and moderate hydraulic power requirements. In this investigation an experimental study of the cooling capabilities of impinging water jet arrays is presented. Of particular interest here is the influence that the inlet and outlet geometries have on the thermal-hydraulics of jet impingement heat transfer {{with the aim of}} determining practical configurations in which heat transfer to the impinging jets is increased and/or the hydraulic pumping power is decreased. For a square array of 45 jets of fixed 1. 0 mm diameter and fixed interjet spacing of 5 mm, six different nozzle geometries were investigated. The arrays impinged normally upon a heated circular copper surface of 31. 5 mm diameter for a nominal heat flux of 25. 66 W/cm 2. Each array was tested under confined-submerged flow conditions with a constant jet-to-target spacing of 2. 0 mm as well as free-surface conditions with a constant jet-to-target spacing of 20 mm. All nozzles were tested for a Reynolds number range of approximately 800 ≤ Redn ≤ 10000.

The enhanced tool {{is characterized by a}} targeted material removal footprint in the range 1 to 5 mm FWHM. The energy beam is provided by an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) torch equipped with a De-Laval nozzle. This thesis focuses on characterization and optimisation of the bespoke plasma torch and its plasma jet. Two research investigations were carried out using both numerical and experimental approaches. A novel CFD model was created to analyse and understand the behaviour of high temperature gas in the De-Laval nozzle. The numerical approach, that was based on appropriate profiles of temperature and velocity applied to the <b>nozzle</b> <b>inlet,</b> led to a significant reduction of computational resources. This model enabled to investigate the aerodynamic phenomena observed from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>inlet</b> up to the processed surface.

A challenging power dissipation analysis of the plasma torch was carried out. Temperature and flow rate in key components of the torch were measured. Experimental results enabled to calculate the power dissipation values for RF power up to 800 W and for the entire series of designed nozzles.

40|$|The {{increasing}} material {{temperatures of}} gas turbine components have the consequences that ceramic materials are taken {{more and more}} into account as construction materials. Typical components are turbine blades, <b>nozzles,</b> <b>inlet</b> liners, heat exchangers or combustion components. For their design the material data at operating temperatures have to be known. The most important data are strength, tensile creep and fatigue strength, and the gas corrosion behaviour, which are presented here for a sintered silicon carbide and for temperatures up to 1550 deg C. With slightly modified commercial water cooled hydraulic grips for tension-compression loading a maximum specimen temperature of 1550 deg C could be reached. The development of grips with hot elements have reduced the temperature gradient between the clamping and testing areas of the specimen. With this system specimen temperatures up to 1600 deg C can be reached over a measuring length of 25 mm. Due to the reduced thermal gradient also sh orter specimens can be used. The tensile creep experiments with the silicon carbide tested here show, that a maximum operating temperature for long term applications is limited to about 1500 deg C. Significant creep deformation at 20 OMPa occurs above 1500 deg C. The minimum creep rate can be described by a power law, and the activation energy by an exponential law as far as corrosion can be neglected. After cyclic tension-compression loading at 1 Hz over 100 hrs slightly reduced strength values are detected.
