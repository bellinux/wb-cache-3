5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b> Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E
5|$|HMS Collingwood was {{the lead}} ship of her class of ironclad battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship's {{essential}} design became the standard {{for most of the}} following British battleships. Completed in 1887, she spent the next two years in reserve before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b> After returning home in 1897, the ship spent the next six years as a guardship in Ireland. Collingwood was not significantly damaged during an accidental collision in 1899 and was paid off four years later. The ship was sold for scrap in 1909 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|Long {{decided in}} 1888 {{not to run}} for another term in Congress, and spent the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> in private practice. His clients were {{typically}} corporate interests, and he appeared on their behalf in court {{as well as in}} legislative committee hearings. He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott's Young Men's Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood into the party. When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused. In 1889 he was appointed to the committee overseeing the enlargement of the Massachusetts State House, a post he held until 1897.|$|E

In 2008, the station saw about 5,900 daily riders, compared to 3,000 for the tram, which had maintained steady ridership. Over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> the station experienced additional ridership growth. In 2016, {{an average of}} 6,630 daily riders used the station on an average weekday. This amounted to 2,110,471 total riders entering the station in 2016.|$|E
5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that}} the Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E
50|$|Due to World War II, Congress was {{not able}} to convene until June 1945. President Sergio Osmeña called for special {{sessions}} to convene the 1st Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines until elections could be organized. Originally, to observe the staggered terms, the eight candidates with the most votes were to serve for <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> for four <b>years,</b> and still the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> for two <b>years.</b> However, several members had died and others were disqualified because they were charged with collaboration with the Japanese, so the Senate conducted a lottery to determine which senators would serve until 1946 and which would serve until 1947. In the 1946 election, voters elected 16 senators; the first eight candidates with the highest amount of votes were to serve until 1951, the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> were to serve until 1949.|$|R

5|$|Inconstant, {{the fifth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was laid down on 27 November 1866 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales. The ship was {{launched}} on 25 March 1872 by Lady Muriel Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor. Inconstant was transferred to Portsmouth Dockyard to finish fitting out and was commissioned on 12 August 1869 by Captain Elphinstone D'Oyly D'Auvergne Aplin for duty with the Channel Squadron. He was relieved by Captain Charles Waddilove on 13 September 1870. The following year the ship was assigned to the Detached Squadron, commanded by Rear-Admiral Frederick Seymour, which visited ports in Scandinavia after Inconstant joined them at Gibraltar, finally arriving at Spithead on 11 October 1871. The ship was paid off in 1872 and spent the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> in reserve.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1906, Wörth was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only a maintenance staff. Over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with the III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, Konteradmiral Heinrich Sass. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel to maintain her for future service.|$|E
5|$|Rupert had {{demonstrated}} {{an interest in}} colonial issues for many years. On arriving in England in 1660, he had encouraged the government to continue Rupert's own exploration of the Gambia {{in an attempt to}} find gold, leading to Robert Holmes's expedition the following year. Rupert was an active shareholder in the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa that was established as a result in 1662. The company continued operations for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> with backers including the King, the Duke of York and the Royal Society, with operations including engaging in the West Africa slave trade until it folded in 1670. The company's operations merged with those of the Gambia Merchants' Company into the new Royal African Company, with a royal charter to set up forts, factories, troops and to exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade in gold, silver and slaves; Rupert was the third named member of the company's executive committee.|$|E

5|$|The fitting {{shop was}} {{designed}} to manufacture 40 locomotives {{a year and a}} total of 300 were produced in the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b> The first locomotive, given its trial in May 1854, was named Lady Elgin, after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time, the Earl of Elgin. For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey's specifications. These were all stamped and coded, loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail {{to the site of the}} bridge for assembly. The central tube of the bridge contained over 10,000 pieces of iron, perforated by holes for half a million rivets, and when it was assembled every piece and hole was true.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b> Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{gradually}} re-established royal {{authority in}} the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a Scottish incursion. Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name. Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics. Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly. Richard ruled peacefully for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> having reconciled with his former adversaries. Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived. In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.|$|E
