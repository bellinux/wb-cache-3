5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation.

In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan.

Vedder also opined that it was Amraal Lambert, Captain of the Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) who called the place Gobabis because he could not pronounce ǂKoabes.

25|$|Having survived section 98, and {{benefiting from}} the public sympathy wrought by persecution, Communist Party members set out to {{organize}} workers in the relief camps {{set up by the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act. Camp workers laboured on a variety of infrastructure projects, including such things as municipal airports, roads, and park facilities, along with a number of other make-work schemes. Conditions in the camps were poor, {{not only because of the}} low pay, but also the lack of recreational facilities, isolation from family and friends, poor quality food, and the use of military discipline. Communists thus had ample grounds on which to organize camp workers, although the workers were there of their own volition. The Relief Camp Workers' Union was formed and affiliated with the Workers' Unity League, the trade union umbrella of the Communist Party. Camp workers in BC struck on 4 April 1935, and, after two months of protesting in Vancouver, began the On-to-Ottawa Trek to bring their grievances to Bennett's doorstep. The Prime Minister and his Minister of Justice, Hugh Guthrie, treated the trek as an attempted insurrection, and ordered it to be stopped. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) read the Riot Act to a crowd of 3,000 strikers and their supporters in Regina on 1 July 1935, resulting in two deaths and dozens of injured.

In practice, such a test is best performed by seeking persistence in the returns of fund managers; if persistence is identified, then markets are not efficient. From the articles reviewed, around 18 papers found evidence of manager skill/persistence in fund manager returns, whilst around 7 supported market efficiency.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to evaluate, {{within the context}} of a selected Social Marketing Model, the strategies that South Africa has been using in the past 10 years in promoting Road Safety in the country. The underpinning aim of the study was to determine whether or not these strategies have been adequately addressing the essence of Road Safety Promotion in South Africa in the light of the many changes communities have experienced over the past decade. Another key reason for the quest to evaluate these strategies is the fact that even in spite of their partial implementation, the rate of road accidents in the country continues to increase. Effectively, South Africa is busy losing the Road Safety battle. The study argued that it is vital that South Africa embarks on effective strategies of Road Safety promotion in order to drastically reduce road accidents and mortalities to levels, at least, of between one to nine persons per year. All governmental strategies currently in use for promoting Road Safety in South Africa are more than four years old, and no in-depth study has been done to evaluate their effectiveness and the reasons for failure of those well-planned campaigns coming out of the strategies, where the mortality rates from accidents continue to increase. This study evaluated the strategies and the impact of the campaign messages emanating from them. Qualitative research methodology using group interviews was conducted in three of the nine provinces namely North West, Gauteng, and Free State Province, the presumption being that the three South African provinces, like the rest, contain characteristics that are generally prevalent in the country. The findings of the study revealed that Road Safety officers were neither fully conversant with the strategies for promotion of Road Safety in the country, nor adequately equipped to confidently and effectively manage their obligatory mandate to endorse the Road Safety Promotion programmes. The limited and often absent engagement of communities in the design and implementation of Road Safety Promotion Strategies has <b>not</b> <b>boded</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the country. Among the recommendations made were, adequate orientation and training of Road Safety practitioners in the area of Road Safety Strategies and promotion, which would result in the strengthening of community engagement in Road Safety Promotion Strategies, the need to conduct, at short intervals, the impact analyses of the promotional strategies being used, in order, where necessary, to design fresh promotional messages with impact, using the Social Marketing Framework for Road Safety promotion campaigns.

However, if he was beaten, Chopra did not betray any sign of that fact and played out the two frontline bowlers with assurance. Sehwag was beaten time and again by Nathan bracken, who, despite playing only his first test, generated a lot of bounce with his natural high-arm action and dominated Sehwag throughout.

In July and August, some simplification occurred, when Neuhausen was appointed as chief of the military administration staff, but Meyszner remained largely independent. Meyszner's police and security apparatus continued to carry out reprisals when requested by the Wehrmacht.

In December 1761 he asked Lord Shelburne, a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as Chief Justice of Chester, writing again in July 1762 to [...] "prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty's Notice", anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas.

However, in few empirical studies has this relationship been investigated, particularly in cities of developing economies. The structure of the land market in Mexico under the changing economic conditions heralded by the election of Carlos Salinas de Gortari as Mexican President for the six-year (sexenio) period 1988 - 94 is studied in this paper. It is argued that the immediate policies of Salinas, especially the control of inflation, brought about {{a return to the}} favourable conditions of real-estate investment that had existed throughout most of the 1970 s.

40|$|Oil palm {{monoculture}} comprises one of {{the most}} financially attractive land-use options in tropical forests, but cropland suitability overlaps the distribution of many highly threatened vertebrate species. We investigated how forest mammals respond to a landscape mosaic, including mature oil palm plantations and primary forest patches in Eastern Amazonia. Using both line-transect censuses (LTC) and camera-trapping (CT), we quantified the general patterns of mammal community structure and attempted to identify both species life-history traits and the environmental and spatial covariates that govern species intolerance to oil palm monoculture. Considering mammal species richness, abundance, and species composition, oil palm plantations were consistently depauperate compared to the adjacent primary forest, but responses differed between functional groups. The degree of forest habitat dependency was a leading trait, determining compositional dissimilarities across habitats. Considering both the LTC and CT data, distance from the forest-plantation interface had a significant effect on mammal assemblages within each habitat type. Approximately 87 % of all species detected within oil palm were never farther than 1300 m from the forest edge.

With {{seven years of experience}} in the courts, this article examines the impact of RLUIPA on local governments across the country through an analysis of how the courts have been interpreting and applying statutory ambiguities and creating inconsistent doctrine in an effort to define terms and implement RLUIPA 2 ̆ 7 s protections. Whether an appropriate Solomon-like balance can be developed under the Act to clearly recognize compelling governmental interests in protecting the public health, safety and welfare through land use planning and various land use and local environmental controls remains elusive {{at this point in time}} and may depend upon the wisdom of the individual federal courts. Section II of this article explores the uncomfortable relationship of government with religion, and the manner in which this relationship has affected the genesis of the constitutional interpretations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. What constitutes the establishment of religion and whether RLUIPA aids government in the establishment of religion is beyond the scope of this article and will not be discussed in detail. Section II also examines the precursor to RLUIPA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), enacted by Congress in 1993 and ruled unconstitutional in 1997. Understanding Congressional motivation for the enactment of RFRA, as well as its constitutional deficiencies, sets the backdrop for the last part of the section, which discusses the Congressional development and enactment of RLUIPA, including why Congress chose land use as a primary focus of religious freedom. Section III briefly reviews the arguments surrounding the constitutionality of RLUIPA, and while not attempting to fully analyze this issue, the discussion is provided since some believe that the statute 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionality as it relates to the land use provisions may be vulnerable to further constitutional attack. Section IV discusses the operative provisions of RLUIPA, including both the substantial burden rule and the Act 2 ̆ 7 s nondiscrimination provisions. It explores how the courts have interpreted RLUIPA and its ambiguous terms, and discusses how various cases have been decided. Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees are also touched on. Section V argues why RLUIPA, as drafted, may <b>not</b> necessarily <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> local governments and their historical use of the police powers to guide community planning and community development. The article concludes with some final comments concerning the propriety of and need for RLUIPA...|$|R
