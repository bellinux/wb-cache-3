40|$|Exposure to {{hazardous}} {{noise levels}} emitted by pneumatic nailing devices contributes significantly to risk of hearing damage among the construction workers throughout the world. This health problem {{comes from the}} lack of appropriate technology such as low noise devices which in turn results {{from the lack of}} scientific knowledge about designing reduced noise devices. This study contributes to the design improvement of pneumatic nailing devices through identifying the noise sources and developing the simulation tool required to redesign the pneumatic <b>nailing</b> <b>device.</b> To identify the noise sources, the study uses a combination of two complementary experimental approaches. The first makes use of time-synchronized data analysis of several variables during the machine operation. This strategy allows identifying the physical processes and provides a detailed separation of the noise generation mechanisms in successive time sequences. However, since multiple noise sources radiate at the same time, this observation approach is not sufficient for noise source identification and ranking. Thus, it is completed by a selective wrapping and muffler procedure. This technique provides overall generated noise associated with each process, as well as ranking of the three major sources: (1) exhaust noise, (2) machine body vibrations, and (3) workpiece vibrations. A special investigation is conducted on this third one with two cases: a workpiece/worktable setup representative of the actual field usage of a <b>nailing</b> <b>device</b> and a workpiece/sandbox setup used in a standardized laboratory test. The study evaluates the efficiency of the workpiece/sandbox setup in reducing the workpiece radiation and obtains a typical workpiece contribution on an actual worksite. To provide a simulation tool, a dynamic model of the pneumatic <b>nailing</b> <b>device</b> needs to be developed. Dynamic modeling of the <b>nailing</b> <b>device</b> requires mathematical modeling of the physical processes involved in its operation. All of these processes can be described through already existing mathematical relations, except for the penetration resistance force (PRF) imposed on the nails when penetrating the wood. The PRF depends on various factors. This study follows two approaches in parallel to develop an empirical prediction law for the PRF: quasi-static and high-speed. The quasi-static approach provides a rapid and precise representation of the law at quasistatic penetration velocities. The law covers the entire displacement range, various nail geometries and sizes, and wood types. The high-speed approach aims to provide a law which covers a much wider range of penetration velocities. The approach is complicated since it requires a sophisticated test machine to conduct the nail driving tests at high penetration velocities. The study designs and fabricates an advanced test machine to later extend the prediction range of the PRF law. The last part of this study develops the dynamic model of a nail gun while integrating the quasi-static PRF law. The model includes dynamics of all the air chambers and the moving parts, and interactions and impacts/contacts between different parts. The study integrates a comprehensive experimental validation of the model. Future improvements in the dynamic model precision will be possible by using the extended version of the PRF law...|$|E
40|$|Intramedullary nailing {{has become}} a popular and {{effective}} procedure {{for the treatment of}} most tibial fractures. However, concerns regarding difficulties with reduction, the use and extent of intramedullary reaming, and hardware failure are probably the only constraints to its widespread use. In this prospective study, we present the clinical and radiographic results of the Orthofix(R) tibial nailing system used in the treatment of tibial shaft fractures. One hundred and fifteen fresh tibial fractures in the same number of patients {{with a mean age of}} 37. 5 years (17 - 85 years) were treated with operative stabilisation using the Orthofix(R) tibial nailing system. ALL of the operations took place in a conventional operating theatre, on a simple tranlucent operating table and with manual reduction of the fracture. In the majority of the cases closed reduction and conventional reaming were performed and the mean duration of the operation was 38 min. Fracture heating occurred at 16 weeks (11 - 30 weeks) and was confirmed both clinically and radiographically. In six cases (two severely comminuted and four segmental fractures) delayed union occurred, however there were no tibial non-unions necessitating re-operation. There were no substantial differences in time to fracture union or in the rate of complications related to minimal open reduction. In addition, there seem to be more benefits than risks in the use of power intramedullary reaming during intramedullary fixation of tibial shaft fractures. In conclusion, most tibial shaft fractures can effectively and safety be treated using this type of locking intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>device,</b> with relatively few complications, and with satisfactory long-term clinical results.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the incidence of Z-effect after dual lag screw intramedullary nailing systems and risk factors contributing to this effect. We hypothesized that long nails provide more neck strength due to a longer lever than short nails and are therefore less likely to develop a misbalance of a higher head compressive strength than neck compressive strength. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study 103 patients treated operatively with a dual lag screw intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>device</b> for (sub) trochanteric hip fracture were included. We analysed patient charts regarding patient and operation characteristics. Furthermore we conducted radiologic measurements within the 2 -year follow-up period to investigate the quality of fracture fixation, implant failure and predictors for Z-effect. The re-operation risk was investigated with multivariate regression analysis. Results: The incidence of (reversed) Z-effect in this study was 9 % (n =  80); 6 out of 7 Z-effects occurred in the short nail group, which was not significant. Patients who were treated with a long nail had a significant larger number of complications in comparison with the short nail group (median 2 vs 0. 5, p =  0. 001). The long nail group received more often erythrocytes blood transfusions (82 % vs 31 %, p <  0. 01) and had a longer hospital stay (13 vs 21 days, p <  0. 05). Migration of lag screws (p < 0. 05) and unstable fracture type (p <  0. 05), were risk factors for re-operation. The re-operation rate within 2 year after surgery was 21 %, of which one fourth was due to a Z-effect. Conclusion: The nail length was not associated with the development of a Z-effect. Migration of lag screws after intramedullary nailing is common and a risk factor for re-operation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Internal {{fixation}} {{continues to}} be the surgical treatment of choice for trochanteric region hip fractures. Intramedullary nailing is the updated version of the Küntscher Y nail and provides stable osteosynthesis of trochanteric hip fractures, classically achieved by closed reduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report on our experience (which started in 2003), using a new fixation device featuring a metaphyseal antegrade nail locked with two cephalic screws and comprising a diaphyseal distal locking. Between April 2003 and September 2006, the first 100 patients who sustained an extracapsular intertrochanteric hip fracture and indicated for internal fixation were prospectively enrolled in this single-center study. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (mean age 80. 3) were reviewed at 6 months (nine had died, three had failure and two were lost to follow-up) and reported a satisfactory functional outcome (mean Merle d'Aubigné score was 16 and mean Harris Hip score was 90). Union was achieved within a mean delay of 3 months (median 102 days 1 / 2) in a good anatomical position (mean medialization was 1. 86 - ranging from - 16 to 0 mm, and mean shortening was 1. 72 mm - ranging from 0 to 24 mm). Functional recovery was satisfactory with a mean Parker score of 7. 52. Total operating time was shortened and good fracture stabilization allowed early weight bearing. DISCUSSION: Classically, such intertrochanteric fractures can be managed either with a dynamic screw-plate type fixation or with an intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>device</b> locked through a single cephalic screw and finally, in rare cases, with a hip arthroplasty supplemented with some sort of fixation. Most published clinical studies of screw-plate fixations have generally reported satisfactory results except for unstable fractures associated with a calcar area lesion. Screw-nail fixations featuring a single cephalic screw should be used in these latter fracture patterns. We believe this new implant design will significantly enhance the anatomical result and functional outcome of these fractures; all this is expected to bring about an earlier recovery of patient's walking ability. CONCLUSION: This original intramedullary nailing system provides reliable internal fixation means for intertrochanteric fractures since it combines the advantage of a closed reduction procedure with a more stable biomechanical construct...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundFixation {{devices to}} treat trochanteric {{fractures}} belong to two general categories: dynamic hip screw (DHS) type and intramedullary type implants. In spite of possible pitfalls, both are considered valid options. Comparing a sliding screw-plate system (DHS) along a mini-invasive <b>nailing</b> <b>device</b> (BCM™ nail) with primary insertion of the cephalic screw, {{sheds light on}} the debated management of trochanteric fractures. HypothesisDue to its design, the BCM™ nailing system allows a stable internal fixation and promotes enhanced postoperative functional recovery. ObjectivesTo test this hypothesis in a comparative prospective case-control study using the DHS screw-plate as a reference. Materials and methodsTwo groups of 30 patients, older than 60 years old, with trochanteric fractures were included in this study. The screw-plates were placed according to the standard method. Regarding the nailing system, the cephalic screw was positioned first, then the nail was inserted through the screw via a mini-invasive approach and locked distally using a bicortical screw. Comparison {{between the two groups}} was based on (1) operative data: operating time, intra- and postoperative blood loss; (2) immediate postoperative course: complications, length of hospital stay, delay to sitting in a wheelchair; (3) the postdischarge evolution: weightbearing, readmission to hospital; (4) functional outcomes: recovery and mobility; (5) anatomical outcomes: restitution and bone healing. ResultsThe operating time (54 ± 8. 8 min vs 59 ± 13. 8 min) and intraoperative (1. 37 ± 0. 98 vs 1. 90 ± 1. 43) and at Day 3 (1. 25 ± 1. 05 vs 1. 82 ± 1. 5) blood loss (haemoglobin loss), were favourable to the screw-plate subgroup (p< 0. 05). The delay to sitting in a wheelchair (4. 76 ± 1. 53 d vs 4 ± 1. 44 d) was favourable to the nail subgroup (p< 0. 05). There was a higher incidence of secondary displacements in the screw-plate subgroup (3 / 26 [11. 5 %] vs 0 / 25 [0 %]) (p< 0. 05). The screw-plate subgroup demonstrated a poorer healing rate at 3 months (88 % vs 100 %) (p< 0. 05). Regarding functional recovery, a lesser decrease in the Parker score was observed in the nail subgroup at 3 postoperative months (2. 42 ± 2. 3 vs 1. 52 ± 1. 44) (p< 0. 05). ConclusionThis study has shown the benefits of the BCM™ nail in terms of stability. But the potential advantages of this mini-invasive technique were limited by ancillary-related difficulties which need to be rectified. These preliminary results are in favour of a further development of this innovating device. Level of evidenceLevel III. Case-report study...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Correction of multi-apical {{long bone}} {{deformities}} in lower limbs is a challenging task. Correction of these deformities with Ilizarov–type external fixators, treating one segment {{at a time}} increases the total time of correction and decreases the patients’ compliance with considerable discomfort. Hence we preferred intramedullary <b>nail</b> <b>devices</b> which combines accuracy, minimal invasiveness, with patient compliance and with excellent functional outcome. Temporary external fixator used per-operatively {{in some cases to}} retain the correction till the insertion of the nail. Eight patients in the age group of 12 - 35 yrs. presented to us over the last 1 year with multi-apical lower limb deformities. The radiological parameters described by Paley et al 1 were used to assess the pre and post–operative radiographs. With the help of anatomical axes the CORA was identified. Percutaneous osteotomy and stabilization with intramedullary nail was done to correct the deformity. 13 Femora and 7 Tibiae were subjected to correction by this technique and followed up over a period of 1 year (Nov- 2014 to Nov- 2015) at MIMS Vizianagaram hospital...|$|R

40|$|Background: This paper {{introduces}} a percutaneous reduction technique using {{one or two}} Steinman pin(s) to reduce sagittally unstable intertrochanteric fractures.

Of 119 intertrochanteric fractures treated from June 2007 to December 2008, twenty-one hips showed sagittal instability.

30|$|Distal radius {{fractures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common upper extremity injuries, accounting for about 8 – 15  % of all skeletal injuries treated by orthopedic surgeons [1 – 3]. Late-diagnosed fractures are frequently complicated with many sequelae; among them, malunion and post-traumatic wrist arthritis due to post-traumatic distal radius deformity are most frequently seen [4 – 6]. Common deformities following an extra-articular distal radius fracture include loss of the normal volar tilt of the articular surface in the saggital plane, decreased ulnar inclination in the frontal plane, and loss of length relative to the ulna [6]. Post-traumatic deformity results in alteration of normal anatomy, biomechanics of distal radius, and functional impairment in hand and wrist [6 – 8]. Many surgical modalities in the treatment of acute fractures of the distal radius have been proposed [9, 10]. Intramedullary nailing is currently used to treat unstable extra-articular fractures of the distal radius [11]. Bearing the advantages of allowing load transfer across the fracture site and lessening soft-tissue dissection, intramedullary fixation can be used to stabilize the fracture bones through a less invasive approach and maintain periosteal vascular blood supply to promote fracture healing [12]. The purposes of this retrospective study were to describe our experience with mini-open osteotomy, local bone grafting, and fracture stabilization with the intramedullary <b>nail</b> <b>device</b> for treatment of post-traumatic deformity in late-diagnosed fractures of the distal radius. Clinical outcomes, radiographic analysis, and complications were reported.|$|R
40|$|Background: The sliding screw-plate <b>devices</b> and cephalo-medullary <b>nail</b> <b>devices</b> have {{performed}} well in stable inter-trochanteric fractures {{in patients with}} reasonably good quality of bone. However, their suboptimal performance in comminuted fractures {{in the presence of}} osteoporotic bone has prompted many surgeons to consider bipolar hemiarthroplasty as the primary modality of management of comminuted inter-trochanteric fractures in elderly patients. However, long term stability of the hemiarthroplasty implant also may be compromised due to the presence of postero-medial bone loss at the area of the calcar. Materials and Methods: We have presented a simple and effective technique of calcar grafting by harvesting cortical bone strut from the neck of the fractured femur. A total of 34 patients with inter-trochanteric fractures of the femur were treated with calcar grafting. The mean age was 79. 2 years. The graft was harvested from the calcar region {{of the head and neck}} fragment of the femur and wedged between the medial femoral cortex and medial edge of the prosthesis. The mean followup period was 54. 5 months. Results: In 32 of 34 (94 %) patients in our series, the calcar graft healed well without dislodgement. There was graft resorption in two patients associated with subsidence of the implant and loosening. Conclusion: Calcar grafting using this technique provides stability to the implant in the presence of comminution and incorporates well in the majority of patients.

The insertion of high dielectric materials in a specific pattern into a low dielectric matrix material is one means to accomplish this. This thesis studies the means to insert metal cylinders (wire or nails) into polymer foams to produce such a material. Depending on the antenna properties desired, the patterns and number of nails varies tremendously. To decrease the manufacturing time and, therefore, the cost of creating these materials, an automatic machine capable of rapidly inserting wires to a predetermined pattern is developed.

Penetration equations are developed to express the penetration capability of a nail into foam. All of this allows one to predict the forces required for a nail to be inserted into foam to a desired depth, thereby facilitating manufacture of these dielectric materials.

40|$|Stable {{insertion}} of large Schanz screws behind an intramedullary (IM) nail when lengthening over nails (LON) {{may be difficult}} due to the limited bone stock.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: : This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the specific type and incidence of implant failure in patients with a proximal femur fracture treated with a proximal femoral <b>nail</b> antirotation. This <b>device</b> has a helical-shaped blade as a neck-head holding device, instead of the lag screw used in other intramedullary nails. The advantage of the blade is believed to originate from bone impaction and a larger bone-implant interface in comparison with the lag screw design, with consequential greater mechanical resistance to torsion in the cancellous bone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at the state hospital of Winterthur, Switzerland. From December 2006 until November 2008, 210 consecutive patients were treated with a pertrochanteric femur fracture (OTA type 31 -A 1, 31 -A 2, and 31 -A 3) using a proximal femoral nail antirotation. One hundred and twelve patients were followed up clinically for a minimum of 12 months after discharge. Clinical and radiologic assessment of fracture healing and/or implant failure was investigated. RESULTS: : We report 7 cases of implant failure with a "Cut Through," defined as a postoperative central perforation of the spiral blade into the hip joint, without any displacement of the neck-head fragment. CONCLUSIONS: : Cut through needs to be distinguished from the well-known anterocranial perforation combined with a varus displacement of the neck-head fragment, known as "Cut Out," seen with intramedullary nails utilizing lag screws. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: : Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Femoral/tibial {{lengthening}} with a telescopic, magnetically-powered, intramedullary nail is {{an alternative}} to lengthening with external fixation. 				 					Methods: Pre-clinical testing was conducted of the PRECICE in a human cadaver. A retrospective review of the first 30 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral lengthening was also conducted. Nail accuracy was obtained by comparing the amount of nail distraction to the final bone length achieved {{at the end of}} the distraction process. Relative standard deviation of accuracy was used to calculate <b>nail</b> precision. 				 					Results: <b>Devices</b> performed successfully in a human cadaver. Thirty consecutive patients (10 females, 20 males; mean age, 23 years) with limb length discrepancy (LLD) were followed an average of 19 months (range, 12 – 24 months). Etiology included congenital shortening (14), posttraumatic deformities (7), Ollier disease (3), osteosarcoma resection (1), prior clubfoot (2), hip dysplasia (1), post-septic growth arrest of knee (1), and LLD after hip arthroplasty (1). Twenty-four femoral and eight tibial nails were implanted. Mean preoperative lengthening goal was 4. 4  cm (range, 2 – 6. 5  cm); mean postoperative length achieved was 4. 3  cm (range, 1. 5 – 6. 5 cm). Average consolidation index was 36. 4  days/cm (range, 12. 8 – 113  days/cm). Mean nail accuracy was 97. 3 % with a precision of 92. 4 %. Average preoperative and 12 -month postoperative Enneking scores were 21. 5 and 25. 3 (p <  0. 001), respectively. The preoperative and 12 -month postoperative SF- 12 physical and mental component scores were not statistically different. Nine complications (nine limb segments) resolved: two partial femoral unions, two suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), one delayed tibial union, one fibular nonunion, one peroneal nerve irritation, one knee joint subluxation, and one confirmed DVT. Twenty-nine (91 %) of 32 limb segments achieved successful bone healing without revision surgery. 				 					Discussion: Limb lengthening with PRECICE is reliable, but larger trials with longer follow-up will reveal limitations. Implantable nails prevent problems associated with external fixation, such as muscle tethering and pin-site infections...|$|R
30|$|Several {{reports in}} the {{literature}} show good results from nailing after or during external fixation. Femoral and tibial nailing with reaming is used commonly after damage control stabilization with external fixation for cases of multiple trauma [16] or open fractures of Gustilo type III [49, 50]. After {{the removal of the}} fixator, intramedullary nailing is carried out in the same operating session or delayed to occur after a period of traction [16, 49] or time in plaster [49, 50], (with or without an interim period of antibiotic therapy) for fear that the pins and wire sites could lead to potential deep intramedullary infections. As early as 1956, Bost et al. [51] described a lengthening technique with an inserted <b>nail,</b> involving external <b>devices</b> and Steinmann pins applied to the same bone segment. Forty years later, Paley et al. [52] presented a series of 32 cases of femoral lengthening using external fixators (Ilizarov or Orthofix) over intramedullary nails ensuring the pins or wires did not contact the nail. At the end of the lengthening period, the fixator was removed and the nail locked. Other cases of lengthening where external fixators were combined with intramedullary nails have also been reported [53, 54, 55]. In 39 cases of lengthening, Rozbruch et al. [53] reported one deep infection that was treated by nail removal. The authors attributed the low number of infections partly {{to the fact that the}} regenerated bone was well vascularized. In 13 lengthenings with fixators and nailing, Bilen et al. [54] had no cases of infection. In 56 lengthenings with fixators and nails which were either unreamed or only very slightly reamed, Park et al. [55] reported no deep infections and only 13 pin track infections, all which resolved with antibiotics. The literature also contains several reports describing intramedullary nails in bony segments already partially resected due to previous infections. Papineau [56] inserted a nail 2  weeks after surgical debridement and later filled the gap with cancellous bone grafts. Several other authors [57, 58, 59, 60] have presented cases of bone transport with fixators and nailing. Raschke et al. [57] have adopted a more cautious approach; in four cases of open tibial fractures of Gustilo types II and III, they first proceeded with debridement and application of external fixators, and after 4 – 6  weeks inserted locked undreamed intramedullary nails in combination with new monolateral fixators. There were no infections of the medullary canal. In 2002, Lai et al. [15] presented 27 cases of bony transport in femurs and tibias with regenerated bone or docking site problems or refractures. In these cases, with an average of 3 – 4  weeks after the removal of the fixator, reamed locked nails were inserted. Two cases of infection at the site of the distal docking screws were resolved after nail removal. Eralp et al. [58] presented a series of 17 resections due to chronic osteomyelitis, with antibiotic therapy for 6  weeks and then bone transport with reamed nails and fixators concurrently. They reported three deep infections. In another series of 17 patients, Li et al. [59] used external fixators with reamed nails for bone transport to resolve large defects of the femur which were created after resection for osteomyelitis; the patients were subjected to a 6 -week course of antibiotic therapy before bone transport surgery was performed. They reported 10 superficial pin track infections and one deep intramedullary infection that was treated by the removal of the nail and external fixator and reaming of the medullary canal.|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} of long bone defects {{in the lower}} extremity is a challenging reconstructive problem for orthopedic surgeons. For many years, bone grafting {{was the most common}} treatment to bridge segmental bone defects. Since the discovery of distraction osteogenesis, first introduced by Ilizarov, this method has become a successful alternative to bone grafting [5]. This method can be associated with several complications [9, 28]. Problems such as pin-track infection, pain, joint instability and stiffness are related mostly to the external fixator [7, 8, 29]. In an effort to reduce these complications, numerous new devices and implants have been developed [11, 12, 30]. Paley et al compared a standard Ilizarov method to a combination of external fixation with interlocking intramedullary nailing in a study on femoral lengthening. They concluded that lengthening over an intramedullary nail decreases the duration of external fixation, protects against refracture and allows earlier rehabilitation [31]. These results were supported by Kocaoglu et al. [32] in their report of external fixator-assisted bone segment transport over an intramedullary nail for reconstruction of bone defects of the lower extremity. Although several studies showed advantages in combining external with internal fixation, there is, still, the risk of pin-track infection leading to deep intramedullary infection [9, 33, 34]. With fully implantable intramedullary CDS, the potential is to overcome the problem of pin-track infection and to improve comfort during treatment [14, 28]. One of these intramedullary devices is the Albizzia nail comprising two telescopic cylinders in which lengthening is achieved by rotating movements of the limb [11]. Although clinical results were promising, patients complained about pain which made ratcheting difficult [16]. The Intramedullary Skeletal Kinetic Distractor (ISKD) is another mechanically driven device which lengthens through torsional movement of the limb [13]. Several authors published their experience with lengthening using the ISKD and described complications such as runaway nails, premature consolidation, severe pain and uncontrolled lengthening [17, 18, 19, 20, 28]. The ISKD has, so far, been described for the use in limb lengthening but not for the {{treatment of}} bone defects. Hyodo et al. [30] have recently reported a traction cable device for bone segment transport in the canine femur using an interlocking intramedullary rod for fixation. However, this device comprises an external distraction apparatus, and local infection at the exit side of the cable and along the cable tract has been reported. To our knowledge, only three fully implantable CDS have been described for the treatment of bone defects in humans. The recent Phoenix nail is a magnetically activated drive system, and the first results for the use in bone defect treatment are promising [14]. Another recent development is the magnet-operated telescopic PRECICE nail [35]. It has both CE mark and US FDA clearance for its first- and second-generation implants, and good results for the treatment of limb length discrepancies have been reported [35]. Although the reliability of this novel system seems to be comparable to other intramedullary <b>nails,</b> a magnet-driven <b>device</b> is a novel technology and literature regarding its efficacy, reliability, complication rate and safety is sparse [36]. Baumgart et al. [15] reported a patient with a 12 -cm bone defect after tumor resection who was treated successfully using an intramedullary motorized nail (Fitbone). Betz et al. [12] reported also of good clinical outcomes using the Fitbone nail in leg lengthening. These results were further supported by Singh et al. [37] and Krieg et al. [38] who published their experience with the Fitbone nail with a relatively low complication rate of 12.5  % in leg lengthening. Although these devices seem to be appropriate for the treatment of bone defects, few publications exist on their use in bone defect treatment [15]. Moreover, the Fitbone nail comprises a complex motorized mechanism that is expensive and increases the risk of technical failure which further limits its use. For that reason, our aim was to design a simple and non-motorized intramedullary CDS as a reasonable alternative to the currently existing treatment options.|$|R
