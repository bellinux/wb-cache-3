5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation</b> stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation,</b> together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E

25|$|On 4 December 2001, Marike de Klerk {{was found}} stabbed and strangled {{to death in}} her Cape Town flat. De Klerk, who was on a brief visit to Stockholm, Sweden, to {{celebrate}} the 100-year anniversary of the <b>Nobel</b> Prize <b>foundation,</b> announced he would immediately return to mourn his dead ex-wife. The atrocity was reportedly condemned strongly by South African president Thabo Mbeki and Winnie Mandela, among others, who openly spoke in favour of Marike de Klerk. On 6 December 21-year-old security guard Luyanda Mboniswa was arrested for the murder. On 15 May 2003, he received two life sentences for murder, as well as three years for breaking into Marike de Klerk's apartment.|$|R

5|$|It was {{announced}} on 30 May 2012 that the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation</b> had awarded the {{contract for the}} production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation.</b> Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved {{on the rim of the}} Economics medal. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.|$|E

" Klassiker der Nationalökonomie ", 140 p., Springer. (préface de William Baumol et Avinash Dixit ainsi qu'un cover book de Thomas Sargent, prix <b>Nobel</b> 2011). <b>Foundations</b> of a Pure Cost Theory {{represents}} the first {{translation of the}} original German version into English. This substantial book offers readers a critical and technical understanding of firms, how firms function and the environments in which they operate. Fundamental principles of cost production, market economy, optimum position and velocities of production are given prominence. Ultimately this work, which remains largely unknown, {{can be seen as}} a milestone text in our understanding of the strategies adopted by firms as a whole. The book has been meticulously translated from German into English, retaining the author's examples in their historical context and capturing the spirit of the time with all its subtlety and significance...|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Michael Nobel, great grand-nephew of Alfred Nobel, chairman, Appeal of <b>Nobel</b> Peace Laureates <b>Foundation</b> states, [...] "The world's {{hospitals}} {{are filled with}} expensive and advanced medical technology. It is also easy to find free hospitals. But {{the combination of the}} two, of a super speciality, highly advanced, state-of-the-art hospital which is free for the poor—that is a unique, completely unique concept. And if we add to that Sai Baba's presence, and the spirituality which his presence lends to the hospital, it becomes a very unique creation. I know hospitals very well, but I have {{never seen anything like this}} on earth." ...|$|R
2500|$|Physicists had {{believed}} that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another. Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The <b>Nobel</b> Prize <b>Foundation</b> paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: [...] "For {{their contributions to the}} theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current". [...] In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory.|$|R
5|$|Nobel's {{instructions}} named a Norwegian Nobel Committee {{to award}} the Peace Prize, {{the members of}} whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organisations were designated or established. These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June. The <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation</b> reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II. In 1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{first feature}} film Silent Grace, a prison drama, {{starring}} Orla Brady, Cathleen Bradley, Cara Seymour, Patrick Bergin and Conor Mullen, premiered at a market screening at Cannes and screened at the Galway, Moscow Film Festival, Taormina and the Hamptons Film Festival, USA, {{where it was}} nominated for the Conflict and Resolution Award in association with <b>Nobel</b> Peace Laureates <b>Foundation.</b> The film was positively reviewed by Ronnie Scheib in Variety [...] and by Michael Dwyer in the Irish Times. Silent Grace {{was based on a}} play/screenplay that Maeve co-wrote with other members of Trouble and Strife called Now and at the Hour of our Death and inspired by Nell McCafferty's The Armagh Women. Tara Brady, of the Dublin Hot Press, said of the film, [...] "Wonderfully humane, Maeve Murphy must be something of a genius, Orla Brady is magnificent."Silent Grace is a fictional drama based on real events, covering the largely untold story of Republican women prisoners’ involvement in the Dirty Protests and first Hunger Strikes of 1980/1981. Guerilla Films released it via UGC cinemas in London, Belfast and Dublin in 2004, and it was supported by the Irish Film Board. Maeve {{went on to win the}} Soka Art Award.|$|R
40|$|First of all, {{my thanks}} to the <b>Nobel</b> Lindau <b>Foundation</b> for their {{inspiration}} and leadership in sharing the excitement of scientific discovery with the public and with future scientists! I have {{had the pleasure of}} participating twice in the Lindau meetings, and recently worked with the Nobel Labs 360 project to show how we are building the world's greatest telescope yet, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). For the future, I see the greatest challenges for all the sciences in continued public outreach and inspiration. Outreach, so the public knows why we are doing what we are doing, and what difference it makes for them today and in the long-term future. Who knows what our destiny may be? It could be glorious, or not, depending on how we all behave. Inspiration, so that the most creative and inquisitive minds can pursue the scientific and engineering discoveries that {{are at the heart of}} so much of human prosperity, health, and progress. And, of course, national and local security depend on those discoveries too; scientists have been working with "the government" throughout recorded history. For the Lindau Nobel experiment, we have a truly abundant supply of knowledge and excitement, through the interactions of young scientists with the Nobelists, and through the lectures and the video recordings we can now share with the whole world across the Internet. But the challenge is always to draw attention! With 7 billion inhabitants on Earth, trying to earn a living and have some fun, there are plenty of competing opportunities and demands on us all. So what will draw attention to our efforts at Lindau? These days, word of mouth has become word of (computer) mouse, and ideas propagate as viruses (or memes) across the Internet according to the interests of the participants. So our challenge is to find and match those interests, so that the efforts of our scientists, photographers, moviemakers, and writers are rewarded by our public. The world changes every day, so there is no one way to go, and everything is an experiment - sounds scientific, yes? I think our partnership with Volker Steger in the Nobel Labs 360 is one of the most interesting I have seen. Computer viewers can see our scientific habitats and begin to experience being there in person, panning a viewpoint up, down, and all around us, and seeing or hearing explanations of what we are doing...|$|R
5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation,</b> each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
5|$|According to the statutes, the Foundation {{consists}} of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members, a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, {{all the members of}} the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation</b> is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: Nobelpriset i litteratur) {{is awarded}} {{annually}} by the Swedish Academy to authors for outstanding {{contributions in the}} field of literature.

As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Foundation</b> and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Swedish Academy. The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.|$|E
