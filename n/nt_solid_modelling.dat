40|$|To {{appear in}} the Encyclopedia of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ed. J. Webster, John Wiley & Sons, 1999. A <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> is a digital {{representation}} of the geometry of an existing or envisioned physical object. <b>Solid</b> <b>models</b> are used in many industries, from entertainment to health care. They {{play a major role}} in the discrete-part manufacturing industries, where precise models of parts and assemblies are created using <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> software or more general computer-aided design (CAD) systems. <b>Solid</b> <b>modeling</b> is an interdisciplinary field that involves a growing number of areas. Its objectives evolved from a deep understanding of the practices and requirements of the targeted application domains. Its formulation and rigor are based on mathematical foundations derived from general and algebraic topology, and from Euclidean, differential, and algebraic geometry. The computational aspects of <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> deal with efficient data structures and algorithms, and benefit from recent developments in the field of computational geometry. Efficient processing is essential, because the complexity of industrial models is growing faster than the performance of commercial workstations. Techniques for modeling and analyzing surfaces and for computing their intersections are important in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling.</b> This area of research, sometimes called computer aided geometric design, has strong ties with numerical analysis and differential geometry. Graphic user-interface (GUI) techniques also play a crucial role in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling,</b> since they determine the overall usability of the modeler and impace the user's productivity. There have always been strong symbiotic links and overlaps between the <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> community and the computer graphics community. <b>Solid</b> <b>modeling</b> interfaces are based on efficient three-dimensional (3 D) graphics techniques, whereas research in 3 D graphics focuses on fast or photo-realistic rendering of complex scenes, often composed of <b>solid</b> <b>models,</b> and on realistic or artistic animations of non-rigid objects. A similar symbiotic relation with computer vision is regaining popularity, as many research efforts in vision are model-based and attempt to extract 3 D models from images or video sequences of existing parts or scenes. These efforts are particularly important for <b>solid</b> <b>modeling,</b> because the cost of manually designing <b>solid</b> <b>models</b> of existing objects or scenes far excees the other costs (hardware, software, maintenance, and training) associated with <b>solid</b> <b>modeling.</b> Finally, the growing complexity of <b>solid</b> <b>models</b> and the growing need for collaboration, reusability of design, and interoperability of software require expertise in distributed databases, constraint management systems, optimization techniques, object linking standards, and internet protocols. This report provides a brief overview of the <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> field, its fundamental technologies, and some important applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ Arguably, {{computer-aided}} design {{has emerged as}} the most significant change agent in manufacturing during the past decade. The switch from constructive solid geometry based <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> systems to parametric <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> has positively impacted manufacturing industries worldwide. <b>Solid</b> <b>modeling</b> technology has now advanced to a stage where it has become the precursor to a wide array of engineering analyses including finite element analysis. These recent developments suggest that we can make a case for a mandatory course in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> enabled manufacturing analysis for all manufacturing engineering and technology majors. Until recently, the manufacturing engineering technology degree program at Northern Illinois University did not require students to take a course in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> or kinematic analysis. This paper describes the efforts made by the authors to fill this void that existed in the curriculum. We pose a rationale for establishing a new course and describe the planning and specific implementation details of the resulting three-credit course in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> and manufacturing analysis...|$|R

Our {{goal is to}} enable support for traditional database operations (sorting, distance metrics, range queries, nearest neighbors, etc) on large databases of <b>solid</b> <b>models.</b> As part of this research, we have developed a number of novel storage and retrieval strategies that extend the state-of-the-art in database research as well as change {{the way in which}} <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> software developers and design and manufacturing enterprises view CAD-centric data management problems. Past research and current commercial systems for engineering information management and Product Data Management (PDM) have predominantly taken annotation and document-based approaches [...] where the <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> data itself is simply stored as a related file to other project documents.

Our approach encodes <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> BRep information as a Model Signature Graph. We demonstrate how Model Signature Graphs can be used for topological similarity assessment of <b>solid</b> <b>models</b> and enable clustering for data mining of large design repositories.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{validity}} and feasibility of the <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> of oral tissue, a new method is provided based on reverse engineering. Biomechanical simulation with FEM is an important technique for orthodontic force analysis and evaluation, as well as treatment design. As the base of FEM simulation, the <b>solid</b> geometrical <b>models</b> of oral tissue including tooth, Periodontal Ligament (PDL) and alveolar bone are difficult to construct through conventional <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> methods because the oral models are very complicated in geometry and topology which are generally represented as triangular meshes.

40|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>models</b> {{traditionally}} use boundary-representation (B-rep) {{to define}} and model their geometry. However, performing modeling operations such as Boolean operations or computing point membership classification with B-rep is computationally intensive, since B-reps do not have volumetric information. Voxelized representations, on the other hand, can be extended to include volumetric information of <b>solid</b> <b>models.</b> However, {{in order to use}} voxelized representations for <b>solid</b> <b>modeling,</b> efficient methods for voxelizing a B-rep <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> needs to be developed. In this thesis, GPU-accelerated methods are presented for creating and rendering a multi-level voxelization of a <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> that can be used along with the existing B-rep for modeling operations. Two GPU-accelerated algorithms are described; one for creating a multi-level voxelization given a B-rep of a <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> and another for ray casting to render the multi-level voxelization of the <b>solid</b> <b>model.</b> Compact and flat data structures are described {{that can be used to}} store the multi-level voxelization data and can be efficiently retrieved in parallel using GPU-algorithms for rendering and modeling operations. The GPU-accelerated multi-level voxelization method can generate models with an effective voxel count of up to 8 billion voxels. In addition, the GPU voxelization algorithm is more than 40 x faster than the CPU implementation in generating the voxelization.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel methodology for locally updating an existing 3 D <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> {{of a complex}} monumental structure with the geometric information provided by a 3 D mesh (point cloud) extracted from the digital survey of a specific sector of a monument. <b>Solid</b> <b>models</b> are fundamental for engineering analysis and conservation of monumental structures of the cultural heritage. Finite elements analysis (FEA), the most versatile and commonly used tool for the numerical simulation of the static and dynamic response of large structures, requires 3 D solids which accurately represent the outside {{as well as the}} inside geometry and topology of the domain to be analyzed. However, the structural changes introduced during the lifetime of the monument and the damage caused by anthropogenic and natural factors contribute to producing complex geometrical configurations that may not be generated with the desired accuracy in standard CAD <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> software. On the other hand, the development of digital techniques for surveying historical buildings and cultural monuments, such as laser scanning and photogrammetric reconstruction, has made possible the creation of accurate 3 D mesh models describing the geometry of those structures for multiple applications in heritage documentation, preservation, and archaeological interpretations. The proposed methodology consists of a series of procedures which utilize image processing, computer vision, and computational geometry algorithms operating on entities defined in the <b>Solid</b> <b>Modeling</b> space and the Mesh space. The operand <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> is defined as the existing <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> to be updated. The 3 D mesh model containing new surface information is first aligned to the operand <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> via 3 D registration and, subsequently, segmented and converted to a provisional <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> incorporating the features to be added or subtracted.
