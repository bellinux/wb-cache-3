Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that <b>not</b> <b>everybody</b> believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E

25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} {{to succeed him}} because he was not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but <b>not</b> <b>everybody</b> was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E

500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, <b>not</b> <b>everybody</b> was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and I thought I did sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E
500|$|Adam Mitchell {{joins the}} Doctor and Rose in the episode [...] "Dalek". The {{character}} was first conceived during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC: {{it was always}} the intention for Adam to join the TARDIS team after Rose developed a liking for him. Contrasting against Rose, Adam was created to show that <b>not</b> <b>everybody</b> is suited to be a companion. Davies stated that he [...] "always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubbed Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". Upon returning Adam home, the Doctor informs him that [...] "I only take the best. I've got Rose". Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog, described Adam as fulfilling a role as [...] "the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions". From episodes nine through thirteen, Rose and the Doctor are joined by the con man Jack Harkness. Jack's appearances were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero. John Barrowman, reflecting on the interrelationships between The Doctor, Jack and Rose, felt that [...] "the subtle sexual chemistry between all three characters... was always in play" [...] with the caveat that [...] "the relationships were by no means driven by desire". SFX magazine also commented on the [...] "intoxicatingly flirtatious dynamic" [...] and compared the trio to [...] "a Buffy-style Scooby gang who can quip in the face of danger". Jack parts from the Ninth Doctor with a kiss which Barrowman felt to be [...] "full of fondess and respect" [...] and both [...] "a significant moment in the annals of the series" [...] and [...] "a moment full of melancholy and loss for the characters".|$|E
