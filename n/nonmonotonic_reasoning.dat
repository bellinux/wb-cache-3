Reiter’s {{default logic}} suffers the triviality, that is, a single contradiction in {{the premise of}} a default theory leads to the only trivial {{extension}} which everything follows from.

We define four-valued models for default theory such that the default logic has the ability of <b>nonmonotonic</b> paraconsistent <b>reasoning.</b> By transforming default rules in propositional language L into language L +, a one-to-one relation between the four-valued models in L and the extensions in L + is proved, whereby the proof theory of Reiter’s default logic is remained. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an architecture for dynamically handling spatial relations in an incremental, <b>nonmonotonic</b> diagrammatic <b>reasoning</b> system. The architecture represents jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) spatial relation sets as nodes in a dependency network. These spatial relation sets include interval relations, relative orientation relations, and connectivity relations, but in theory could include any JEPD spatial relation sets. This network then caches dependencies between low-level spatial relations, allowing those relations {{to be easily}} assumed or retracted as visual elements are added or removed from a diagram. For example, in the architecture’s Undo mechanism, the dependency network can quickly reactivate cached spatial relations when a previously-deleted element is restored. As part of this work, we describe how the system supports higher-level reasoning, including support for creating default assumptions. We also describe how this system was integrated with an existing drawing program and discuss its possible use in diagrammatic and geographic reasoning. ...|$|R

Only a few studies, though, have investigated this claim empirically. system p is a central, broadly accepted <b>nonmonotonic</b> <b>reasoning</b> system that proposes basic rationality postulates for reasoning about nonmonotonic conditionals.

This study reports a series of four experiments on probabilistic reasoning with inference rules about nonmonotonic conditionals, namely the cautious monotonicity, cut, and the right weakening rule of system p. As a critical condition, we investigated central monotonic properties of classical (monotone) logic, namely monotonicity, transitivity, and contraposition. In accordance with previous results, the present study suggests that people reason nonmonotonically rather than monotonically.
