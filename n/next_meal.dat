5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the <b>next</b> <b>meal,</b> or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|In the Ixodidae, {{the tick}} stays {{in place until}} it is {{completely}} engorged. Its weight may increase by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate this large expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; the tick may remain attached for days or weeks, depending on species, life stage and host. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, {{the weight of the}} tick increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its <b>next</b> <b>meal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many pre-Code films {{dealt with}} the {{economic}} realities of a country struggling to find its <b>next</b> <b>meal.</b> In Blonde Venus (1932), Marlene Dietrich's character resorts to prostitution to feed her child, and Claudette Colbert's character in It Happened One Night (1934) gets her comeuppance for throwing a tray of food onto the floor by later finding herself without food or financial resources. Joan Blondell's character in Big City Blues (1932) reflects that as a chorus girl she regularly received diamonds and pearls as gifts, but now must content herself with a corned beef sandwich. In Union Depot (1932), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. puts a luscious meal as {{the first order of}} business on his itinerary after coming into money.|$|E

5000|$|The parasitus (parasite) {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} selfish liar. He is {{typically}} associated with the miles gloriosus character, and hangs upon his every word.

500|$|In September 2009, Wade donated {{money from}} his {{foundation}} to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down. He handed the library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building, which brought Coatney to tears. He called the donation a [...] "small contribution", and reminisced about the difficult experiences he faced as a child, stating that he sometimes {{did not know how}} he would find his <b>next</b> <b>meal.</b> In January 2010, Wade and Alonzo Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti", which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days since the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the [...] "Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti" [...] had already raised over $800,000. Wade stated, [...] "I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, {{and we will continue to}} accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead." [...] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and has served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Cagney {{said that}} as a young man, he had no {{political}} views, since he was more concerned with where the <b>next</b> <b>meal</b> was coming from. [...] However, the emerging labor movement of the 1920s and 1930s soon forced him to take sides. The first version of the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935 and growing tensions between labor and management fueled the movement. Fanzines in the 1930s, however, described his politics as [...] "radical". This somewhat exaggerated view was enhanced by his public contractual wranglings with Warner Bros. at the time, his joining of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933, and {{his involvement in the}} revolt against the so-called [...] "Merriam tax". The [...] "Merriam tax" [...] was an underhanded method of funneling studio funds to politicians; during the 1934 Californian gubernatorial campaign, the studio executives would 'tax' their actors, automatically taking a day's pay from their biggest-earners, ultimately sending nearly half a million dollars to the gubernatorial campaign of Frank Merriam. Cagney (as well as Jean Harlow) publicly refused to pay and Cagney even threatened that, if the studios took a day's pay for Merriam's campaign, he would give a week's pay to Upton Sinclair, Merriam's opponent in the race.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the farmers}} {{dedicate}} part of their farms for wheat and corns, mainly for personal use. Wheat is used mostly to produce bulgur, which makes the main dishes all over the year; whether as a standalone <b>meal,</b> <b>next</b> to other <b>meals</b> or part of other meals; such as tabbouleh, kibbeh, mujaddara and many others. The soil fertility and Mediterranean climate, combined with the habit of keeping animal farms for milk, egg and meat, allow the locals to enjoy a great level of self-sufficiency.|$|R
2500|$|Later playwrights also {{borrowed}} Plautus's stock characters. One of {{the most}} important echoes of Plautus is the stock character of the parasite. Certainly the best example of this is Falstaff, Shakespeare's portly and cowardly knight. As J. W. Draper notes, the gluttonous Falstaff shares many characteristics with a parasite such as Artotrogus from Miles Gloriosus. Both characters seem fixated on food and where their <b>next</b> <b>meal</b> is coming from. But they also rely on flattery in order to gain these gifts, and both characters are willing to bury their patrons in empty praise. Of course, Draper notes that Falstaff is also something of a boastful military man, but notes, [...] "Falstaff is so complex a character that he may well be, in effect, a combination of interlocking types." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unprovoked wolf attacks {{motivated}} by hunger are categorized as [...] "predatory". In some such cases, a cautious wolf may launch [...] "investigative" [...] or [...] "exploratory" [...] attacks {{to test the}} victim for suitability as prey. As with defensive attacks, such attacks are not always pressed, as the animal may break off the attack or be convinced to look elsewhere for its <b>next</b> <b>meal.</b> In contrast, during [...] "determined" [...] predatory attacks, the victims may be repeatedly bitten {{on the head and}} face and dragged off and consumed, sometimes as far away as 1-2.5km from the attack site, unless the wolf or wolves are driven off. Experts in India use the term [...] "child lifting" [...] to describe predatory attacks in which the animal silently enters a hut while everyone is sleeping, picks up a child, often with a silencing bite to the mouth and nose, and carries a child off by the head. Such attacks typically occur in local clusters, and generally do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated.|$|E
2500|$|Some have {{suggested}} {{a connection between}} the date of Garland's death and funeral on June 27, 1969 and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern gay liberation movement, which started {{in the early hours of}} June 28. [...] In a 2009 interview, gay historian David Carter stated that this connection is untrue, and based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in The Village Voice the next day. Some observers of the riots contend that most of those involved [...] "were not the type to moon over Judy Garland records or attend her concerts at Carnegie Hall. They were more preoccupied with where they were going to sleep and where their <b>next</b> <b>meal</b> would come from." [...] However, the same historical documentary states that there were several patrons at the Stonewall bar that night, Garland fans who, according to bar patron Sylvia Rivera had come from the very emotional Garland funeral earlier in the day to drink and mourn. Rivera said that indeed there was a feeling in the air that something would happen that night: [...] "I guess Judy Garlandâ€™s death just really helped us really hit the fan." ...|$|E

Rediff.com {{criticized the}} film as [...] "rushed", however praised Pasupathy mentioning that he comes [...] "out the winner" [...] in acting scenes, citing that his portrayal was [...] "poetic". Meena is criticized, with the reviewer claiming that she [...] "tries hard to re-create the original version's magic, but perhaps she has been told to over-do it for Tamil: she wears lipstick and pastel shades of saris for every other scene, while {{trying to prove that}} they have no idea where the <b>next</b> <b>meal's</b> going to come from". As for the script, [...] "the freshness of the original has been denuded a little to accommodate dialogues that extol the many virtues of the superstar", becoming worse than that of the original. Whilst labelling Vadivelu as providing [...] "antics are the ones that really make you grin", the rest of the supporting actors Manobala, M. S. Baskar, Livingston and Vaiyapuri [...] "are absolutely wasted". Director P. Vasu is criticized by claiming that his [...] "script must shoulder the responsibility of how Kuselan has ultimately turned out" [...] with the only saving grace being [...] "the original story, which pulls the screenplay from descending into nothing". G. V. Prakash Kumar and Thotta Tharani were also singled out by the Rediff reviewer for their adequate performances in their respective fields.|$|R

50|$|The infective {{stage is}} the sporozoite which {{is present in}} the salivary glands of the vector. Once the vector bites a new host, the sporozoites enter the blood stream and invade endothelial cells of blood vessels within various tissues {{including}} those of the lung, liver and spleen. Within the endothelial cells, the sporozoites undergo asexual reproduction becoming schizonts. These in turn produce numerous merozoites which penetrate the erythrocytes and mature into either female gametocytes (macrogametocytes) or male gametocytes (microgametocytes). Gametocytes can then be ingested by another blood-sucking insect where they undergo sexual reproduction in the midgut of the insect to produce oocysts. The oocysts rupture and release numerous sporozoites that invade the salivary gland and serve as a focus of subsequent infection for another host once the insect takes its <b>next</b> blood <b>meal.</b>|$|R

50|$|On January 31, 1921, the Deering was sighted {{run aground}} on Diamond Shoals, an area {{off the coast}} of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, that has long been notorious as a common site of shipwrecks. Rescue ships were unable to {{approach}} the vessel owing to bad weather. The ship was not boarded until February 4, and {{it became clear that the}} ship had been completely abandoned. The ship's log and navigation equipment were gone, and the crew's personal effects and the ship's two lifeboats were gone as well. In the vessel's galley it appeared that certain foodstuffs were being prepared for the <b>next</b> day's <b>meal</b> at the time of the abandonment.

50|$|Life in Ireland, {{specifically}} in Limerick, during the 1930s and 1940s {{is described in}} all its grittiness. The family live in a dilapidated, unpaved lane of houses that flood regularly. The McCourts' house is in the farthest part of the lane, near the only outdoor lavatory for the entire lane. Malachy Sr. teaches the children Irish stories and songs, but he is an alcoholic and seldom finds work. When he does, he spends his pay in the pubs. His family is forced {{to live on the}} dole since he cannot hold down a paying job for long due to his alcoholism.
