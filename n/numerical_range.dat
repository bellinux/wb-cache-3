40|$|Three lectures {{are going}} to be given on <b>{{numerical}}</b> <b>ranges</b> of operators, Banach spaces with numerical index one, and polynomial numerical indices of Banach spaces. We give now a briefly account of each of the topic. 1. <b>Numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> of operators We give an exposition about the <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> of operators, start-ing with the emergence of this concept in 1918 for matrices and opera-tors on Hilbert space, presenting the mayor results here. Then, we present the definitions, preliminary properties and examples of <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> of operators on Banach spaces. The relation between <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> and one-parameter semigroups of operators is then presented to finally get a description of the Lie-algebra of a Banach space. The basic references for this part are the books by Bonsall and Duncan about <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> in normed algebras from the 1970 s [2, 3], and a paper by Rosenthal [22] which contains proofs of some of the results written just for operators.

40|$|We {{consider}} two-variable model spaces {{associated to}} rational inner functions Θ on the bidisk, which always possess canonical z_ 2 -invariant subspaces S_ 2. A particularly interesting compression {{of the shift}} is the compression of multiplication by z_ 1 to S_ 2, namely S^ 1 _Θ:= P_S_ 2 M_z_ 1 |_S_ 2. We show that these compressed shifts are unitarily equivalent to matrix-valued Toeplitz operators with well-behaved symbols and characterize their <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> and radii. We later specialize to particularly simple rational inner functions and study the geometry of the associated <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges,</b> find formulas for the boundaries, answer the zero inclusion question, and determine whether the <b>numerical</b> <b>ranges</b> are ever circular.
