5000|$|Lieutenant Commander David Balme DSC, {{who as a}} 20-year-old Royal Navy sub-lieutenant, was {{the officer}} {{commanding}} a party of eight ratings from HMS Bulldog who boarded U-110, a U-boat captured intact in the Atlantic on 9 May 1941. On board he captured a fully working naval Enigma encoding machine together with many code books and U-boat <b>navigational</b> <b>grid</b> charts.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the First World War {{and still}} {{continuing}} today, military personnel use ammunition casings to hide {{small amounts of}} critical information e.g. encryption/recognition codes or <b>navigational</b> <b>grid</b> references etc. The hiding place {{is very easy to}} prepare: the bullet is removed from the cartridge and the propellant powder poured away. A small piece of paper with writing on it can be stored inside. Given that ammunition can be found everywhere in a combat zone, it is very easy to hide or discard such items because they blend in easily. Similarly, if a soldier is captured, the enemy expects that soldiers will have ammunition in their pockets, so little attention is paid, beyond confiscating and discarding it.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{hyperbolic}} curves, a particular combination of a primary and two secondary stations can possibly result in a [...] "grid" [...] where the grid lines intersect at shallow angles. For ideal positional accuracy, it is desirable to operate on a <b>navigational</b> <b>grid</b> where the grid lines are closer to right angles (orthogonal) to each other. As the receiver travels through a chain, a certain selection of secondaries whose TD lines initially formed a near-orthogonal grid can become a grid that is significantly skewed. As a result, the selection of one or both secondaries should be changed so that the TD lines of the new combination are closer to right angles. To allow this, nearly all chains provide at least three, and as many as five, secondaries.|$|E
40|$|Living With a Star is a NASA {{initiative}} {{employing the}} combination of dedicated spacecraft with targeted research and modeling efforts to improve what we know of solar effects of all kinds on the Earth and its surrounding space environment, with particular emphasis on those that have significant practical impacts on life and society. The highest priority among these concerns {{is the subject of}} this report: the potential effects of solar variability on regional and global climate, including the extent to which solar variability has contributed to the well-documented warming of the Earth in the last 100 years. Understanding how the climate system reacts to external forcing from the Sun will also greatly improve our knowledge of how climate will respond to other climate drivers, including those of anthropogenic origin. A parallel element of the LWS program addresses solar effects on space weather : the impulsive emissions of charged particles, short-wave electromagnetic radiation and magnetic disturbances in the upper atmosphere and near-Earth environment that also affect life and society. These include a wide variety of solar impacts on aeronautics, astronautics, electric power transmission, and national defense. Specific examples are (1) the impacts of potentially- damaging high energy radiation and atomic particles of solar origin on satellites and satellite operations, spacecraft electronics systems and components, electronic communications, electric power distribution <b>grids,</b> <b>navigational</b> and GPS systems, and high altitude aircraft; and (2) the threat of sporadic, high-energy solar radiation to astronauts and high altitude aircraft passengers and crews. Elements of the LWS program include an array of dedicated spacecraft in near- Earth and near-Sun orbits that will closely study and observe both the Sun itself and the impacts of its variations on the Earth's radiation belts and magnetosphere, the upper atmosphere, and ionosphere. These spacecraft, positioned to study and monitor changing conditions in the Sun-Earth neighborhood, will also serve as sentinels of solar storms and impulsive events...|$|R
