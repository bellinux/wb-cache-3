5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and <b>nucleus</b> <b>accumbens</b> (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone, compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the <b>nucleus</b> <b>accumbens</b> of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. Dopamine and serotonin were collected using microdialysis, and increases in dopamine and serotonin were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the <b>nucleus</b> <b>accumbens,</b> and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the <b>nucleus</b> <b>accumbens</b> shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E

To empirically test these assumptions, we evaluated the (neuro) psychological trait and the functional organization of the resting state brain networks associated with the NAcs in 18 former cocaine abusers (FCAs), while being in drug abstinence since 5 months. The psychological data were grouped into three empirical variables related with emotion regulation, emotion awareness and strategic and controlled behaviour. Comparison of the resting state patterns between the entire sample of FCAs and 19 controls revealed a reduction of functional connectivity between the NAcs and the dPFC and enhanced connectivity between the NAcs and the dorsal-striatum. In the 8 FCAs who relapsed into cocaine use after 3 months, the level of functional connectivity between the NAcs and dPFC was lower than the functional connectivity estimated {{in the group of}} patients that did not relapsed. Finally, in the entire sample of FCAs, the higher the connectivity between the NAc and the oPFC the lower was the level of strategic and controlled behaviour.

Structural deficits were evaluated by quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunostaining in the cortex, striatum, <b>accumbens</b> <b>nuclei,</b> subthalamic nuclei, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra compacta of 10 -day, 1 - and 2 -month-old wildtype and weaver mutant mice. The results confirmed the progressive loss of dopamine during the postnatal development in the adult weaver mainly affecting the substantia nigra pars compacta, striatum, and subthalamic nucleus and slightly affecting the <b>accumbens</b> <b>nuclei</b> and ventral tegmental area. A general decrease in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunostaining with age was revealed in both the weaver and wild-type mice, with the decrease being most pronounced in the weaver. In contrast, there was an increase in the substantia nigra pars compacta nitric oxide synthase-immunostaining and a decrease mainly in the subthalamic and <b>accumbens</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the 2 -month-old weaver mutant. The decrease in the expression of nNOS may bear functional significance related to the process of aging. DA neurons from the substantia nigra directly modulate the activity of subthalamic nucleus neurons, and their loss may contribute to the abnormal activity of subthalamic nucleus neurons. Although the functional significance of these changes is not clear, it may represent plastic compensating adjustments resulting from the loss of dopamine innervation, highlighting a possible role of nitric oxide in this process.

However, changes in NMDA receptor expression in distinct subcellular compartments in PD have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated changes in subcellular expression of NMDA receptors in striatal neurons in a rodent PD model. Methods: Intracranial injection of the neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) was selectively lesioned into the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in adult Sprague Dawley rats, which is a common rat model of PD. A surface receptor crosslinking assay was conducted to examine the response of individual NMDA receptor subunits to dopamine depletion in isolated and confined surface and intracellular compartments of striatal neurons. Results: In PD rats where 6 -OHDA was selectively lesioned, surface expression of NMDA receptor GluN 1 subunits as detected by surface protein crosslinking assays was increased in the striatum. In contrast, intracellular levels of GluN 1 were decreased in the lesioned region. The NMDA receptor GluN 2 B subunit was elevated in its abundance in the surface pool of the lesioned striatum, while intracellular GluN 2 B levels were not altered. GluN 2 A subunits in both surface and intracellular fractions remained stable. In addition, total cellular levels of striatal GluN 1 and GluN 2 A were not changed in lesioned tissue, while total GluN 2 B proteins showed an increase. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the differential sensitivity of principal NMDA receptor subunits to dopamine depletion. GluN 1 and GluN 2 B expression in the distinct surface compartment underwent upregulation in striatal neurons after selective lesions of the dopaminergic pathway by 6 -OHDA.

Retrograde tracer injections into these areas labeled neurons specifically in Pa. Following a retrograde tracer injection into Pa, labeled neurons {{were found in}} the hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and periaqueductal gray.

A retrograde tracer injection into Pa combined with immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ORX and 5 -HT axons originate from neurons in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Pa-projecting neurons were localized in the same nuclei of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain as CRH neurons, although no double labeling was found.

25|$|The inhaled {{nicotine}} mimics nicotinic acetylcholine which when {{bound to}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptors prevents the reuptake of acetylcholine thereby increasing that neurotransmitter {{in those areas}} of the body. These nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {{are located in the}} central nervous system and at the nerve-muscle junction of skeletal muscles; whose activity increases heart rate, alertness, and faster reaction times. Nicotine acetylcholine stimulation is not directly addictive. However, since dopamine-releasing neurons are abundant on nicotine receptors, dopamine is released; and, in the <b>nucleus</b> <b>accumbens,</b> dopamine is associated with motivation causing reinforcing behavior. Dopamine increase, in the prefrontal cortex, may also increase working memory.|$|E
40|$|With the {{prevalence}} of obesity rapidly increasing worldwide, understanding the processes leading to excessive eating behavior becomes increasingly important. Considering the widely recognized crucial role of reward processes in food intake, we examined the white matter wiring and integrity of the anatomical reward network in obesity. Anatomical wiring of the reward network was reconstructed derived from diffusion weighted imaging in 31 obese participants and 32 normal-weight participants. Network wiring was compared {{in terms of the}} white matter volume as well as in terms of white matter microstructure, revealing lower number of streamlines and lower fiber integrity within the reward network in obese subjects. Specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum <b>nuclei</b> including <b>accumbens,</b> caudate and putamen showed lower strength and network clustering in the obesity group as compared to healthy controls. Our results provide evidence for obesity-related disruptions of global and local anatomical connectivity of the reward circuitry in regions that are key in the reinforcing mechanisms of eating-behavior processes...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} {{experiments were}} performed in rat brain sections from normal and 6 -hydroxydopamine-treated rats {{in order to}} map and identify the neurons expressing the D 1 receptor gene in the striatum and the substantia nigra. Procedures of combined in situ hybridization, allowing the simultaneous detection of two mRNAs in the same section or in adjacent sections, were used to characterize the phenotypes of the neurons expressing the D 1 receptor gene. D 1 receptor mRNA was found in neurons all over the caudate-putamen, the <b>accumbens</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and the olfactory tubercle {{but not in the}} substantia nigra. In the caudate-putamen and <b>accumbens</b> <b>nucleus,</b> most of the neurons containing D 1 receptor mRNA were characterized as medium-sized substance P neurons and distinct from those containing D 2 receptor mRNA. Nevertheless, 15 - 20 % of the substance P neurons did not contain D 1 receptor mRNA. The neurons containing preproenkephalin A mRNA did not contain D 1 receptor mRNA but contained D 2 receptor mRNA. A small number of cholinergic and somatostatinergic neurons exhibited a weak reaction for D 1 receptor mRNA. These results demonstrate that dopamine acts on efferent striatal neurons through expression of distinct receptors [...] namely, D 1 and D 2 in separate cell populations (substance P and preproenkephalin A neurons, respectively) [...] and can also act on nonprojecting neurons through D 1 receptor expression...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the rabbit}} brain, in {{particular}} the basal forebrain cholinergic system, has become a common model for neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease, detailed neuroanatomical studies on the morphological organization of basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei and on their output pathways are still awaited. Therefore, we performed quantitative choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunocytochemistry to localize major cholinergic nuclei and {{to determine the number}} of respective cholinergic neurons in the rabbit forebrain. The density of ChAT-immunoreactive terminals in layer V of distinct neocortical territories and in hippocampal subfields was also measured. Another cholinergic marker, the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR), was also employed to identify subsets of cholinergic neurons. Double-immunofluorescence labeling of ChAT and p 75 NTR, calbindin D- 28 k (CB), parvalbumin, calretinin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), tyrosine hydroxylase, or substance P was used to elucidate the neuroanatomical borders of cholinergic nuclei and to analyze the neurochemical complexity of cholinergic cell populations. Cholinergic projection neurons with heterogeneous densities were found in the medial septum, vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca, ventral pallidum, and magnocellular nucleus basalis (MBN) /substantia innominata (SI) complex; cholinergic interneurons were observed in the caudate <b>nucleus,</b> putamen, <b>accumbens</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and olfactory tubercule, whereas the globus pallidus was devoid of cholinergic nerve cells. Cholinergic interneurons were frequently present in the hippocampus {{and to a lesser extent}} in cerebral cortex. Cholinergic projection neurons, except those localized in SI, abundantly expressed p 75 NTR, and a subset of cholinergic neurons in posterior MBN was immunoreactive for CB and nNOS. A strict laminar distribution pattern of cholinergic terminals was recorded both in the cerebral cortex and in CA 1 –CA 3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In summary, the structural organization and chemoarchitecture of rabbit basal forebrain may be considered as a transition between that of rodents and that of primates. ...|$|R
