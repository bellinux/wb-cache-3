The soluble antigen that was isolated from calf thymus nuclei was demonstrated by enzyme degradation and ultracentrifugation studies, and by immunologic analysis, to be a complex of deoxyribonucleic acid and a moiety susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Antibody to soluble nucleoprotein did not react with the DNA portion of the complex released after proteolytic digestion or with purified calf thymus DNA. Immunologic reaction of identity was obtained between the soluble <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> and synthesized DNA-histone complex, suggesting that the protein moiety of soluble nucleoprotein might in part be composed of histone.

However, virus-specific class I MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were not detected after such immunization. Mice immunized orally with the nucleoprotein-expressing bacteria mounted a strong anti-viral antibody response and spleen cells from such mice proliferated specifically to virus challenge in vitro, producing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2).

40|$|The {{system of}} {{nomenclature}} for influenza A viruses recommended by WHO in 1971 provided {{a basis for}} the designation of these viruses into types based on their <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigens.</b> Influenza A viruses were further divided into subtypes based on the antigenic character of their haemagglutinin and neuraminidase components. To review the relevance to influenza virus nomenclature of new information on the antigenic and molecular characterization of influenza A viruses a meeting was held in Atlanta, GA, USA, in November 1978 under the auspices of WHO. Although the 1971 system of nomenclature has worked well, new information on relationships between haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes indicates that the number of subtypes could be reduced. However, for the present, the participants in the meeting recommend that the 1971 system should still be used, without modification, at least until a further meeting is held in 1980. In the meantime, WHO wishes to encourage studies that will further define these relationships and solicits comments relevant to the proposals outlined in this Memorandum...|$|R
25|$|A puzzling {{feature of}} the {{documented}} loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous human autoimmunity {{is that it is}} almost entirely restricted to the autoantibody responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies. Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell responses implicates <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigens.</b> In Celiac disease there are autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase but the T cell response is to the foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including type I diabetes) based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.|$|R

Besides the lung and the upper respiratory tract, viral antigen was detected in the small and large intestinal epithelial cells, hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, glial cells and neurons of the brain, and lymphocytes. The results confirmed that H 5 N 1 virus disseminated to multiple organs beyond the respiratory system. However, specific pathological changes were noted in the respiratory system only, and productive viral replication confirmed by culture was noted only in the lung.

40|$|Background: The {{persistent}} {{evolution of}} highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) highlights {{the need for}} novel vaccination techniques that can quickly and effectively respond to emerging viral threats. We evaluated the use of optimized consensus influenza antigens to provide broad protection against divergent strains of H 5 N 1 influenza in three animal models of mice, ferrets, and non-human primates. We also evaluated the use of in vivo electroporation to deliver these vaccines to overcome the immunogenicity barrier encountered in larger animal models of vaccination. Methods and Findings: Mice, ferrets and non-human primates were immunized with consensus plasmids expressing H 5 hemagglutinin (pH 5 HA), N 1 neuraminidase (pN 1 NA), and <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> (pNP). Dramatic IFN-c-based cellular immune responses to both H 5 and NP, largely dependent upon CD 8 + T cells were seen in mice. Hemaggutination inhibition titers classically associated with protection (. 1 : 40) were seen in all species. Responses in both ferrets and macaques demonstrate the ability of synthetic consensus antigens to induce antibodies capable of inhibiting divergent strains of the H 5 N 1 subtype, and studies in the mouse and ferret demonstrate the ability of synthetic consensus vaccines to induce protection {{even in the absence}} of such neutralizing antibodies. After challenge, protection from morbidity and mortality was seen in mice and ferrets, with significant reductions in viral shedding and disease progression seen in vaccinate...|$|E
40|$|The new {{pandemic}} influenza, {{occurred in}} april 2009 in Mexico is also called swine Influenza. It {{is caused by}} a new Influenza virus A(H 1 N 1) v, completely new, never before found in any species and results from complex genetic reassortment. The role of the laboratory is essential for the virological diagnosis of this emerging flu. It can provide the definitive diagnosis in patients whose clinical and epidemiological context is suggestive of infection with virus A(H 1 N 1) v. The virological confirmation of an infection case caused by this virus is provided by the positivity of the laboratory following tests: RT-PCR and/or viral culture and/or four-fold rise in the rate of specific neutralizing antibodies directed against A(H 1 N 1) v virus on a pair of sera collected two weeks apart. The real time RT-PCR is currently the tool of choice because of its rapidity, sensitivity and specificity. Immunological rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can detect the presence of the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigens</b> of seasonal influenza viruses type A and B. The evaluation of these tests showed, in the current pandemic context, a low sensitivity which not confer them a negative predictive value compatible with widespread use. Their results must be interpreted with caution and despite their good positive predictive value, they allow a presumptive diagnosis, confirmation by real time RT-PCR will be conducted whenever necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of influenza virus type {{has traditionally been}} based on the characterization of internal <b>nucleoprotein</b> (NP) <b>antigens</b> by the complement fixation (CF) test.

In this report we describe a double immunodiffusion (DID) test, which is proposed {{as a replacement for}} the CF test for the typing of influenza viruses. The DID test is simple and requires only the allantoic fluid content of a single infected embryonated egg. Virus from the infected fluid is precipitated with mild acid and disrupted by detergent. Anti-NP or anti-matrix protein (MP) antibody is equally effective in most instances for typing influenza isolates by this test. The latter is preferred, however, since it seemed to be slightly more sensitive than anti-NP antibody...|$|R

MethodsCase report, rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect and direct fluorescent antibody assays, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, phylogenetic reconstruction, isolation in tissue culture, pathology and immunohistochemistry. ResultsThe 9 year old died 76 days after presenting with rabies of vampire bat phylogeny transmitted by cat bite. Antibody response in serum and cerebrospinal fluid was robust and associated with severe cerebral edema. No rabies virus was cultured at autopsy. Rabies virus antigen was atypical in size and distribution. Rabies virus genome was present in neocortex but absent in brainstem.

40|$|The {{serology}} {{of chronic}} hepatitis B infection {{has been established}} {{through the use of}} commercial immunoassays to measure the structural antigens of the hepatitis B virus and their respective antibodies in serum. However, the commercial assays have not been designed to detect serum antibodies in the presence of an excess of circulating antigens. A series of serum samples from 200 HBeAg-positive, chronically infected hepatitis B patients with varying degrees of liver disease were analyzed using novel immunoassays designed to detect antibodies in the presence of circulating viral antigens. All patients, regardless of their liver disease, were seronegative for antibodies specific for the envelope antigens or the secreted <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBeAg) when the commercial assays were used. In contrast, virtually all chronically infected patients with liver disease and 50 % of patients without liver disease demonstrated anti-HBe and anti-envelope antibodies when sera were tested in the more sensitive immunoassays. Furthermore, asymptomatic patients could be serologically distinguished from symptomatic patients based on antibody fine specificity, titer, and IgG subclass. This study revealed that the majority of chronically infected hepatitis B patients produce a variety of antibodies for many years, and are not immunologically unresponsive, as suggested by the current assays.

Previous experiments {{have suggested that}} striated muscle cells are unique among mammalian cell types in their capacity to take up and express free DNA {{in the absence of}} a viral vector or physical carrier. However, we have found that mice injected into the superficial skin with free (naked) plasmid DNA encoding the influenza nucleoprotein gene had discrete foci of epidermal and dermal cells, including cells with dendritic morphology, that contained immunoreactive <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen.</b> A single intradermal administration of 0. 3 - 15 micrograms of free plasmid DNA induced anti-nucleoprotein-specific antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocytes that persisted for at least 68 - 70 weeks after vaccination. Intradermal gene administration induced higher antibody titers than did direct gene injection into skeletal muscle and did not cause local inflammation or necrosis. Compared with control animals, the gene-injected mice were resistant to challenge with a heterologous strain of influenza virus. These results indicate that the cells of the skin can take up and express free foreign DNA and induce cellular and humoral immune responses against the encoded protein.

40|$|Autoantibodies to the non-histone <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigens</b> SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, and RNP {{are highly}} {{associated}} with photosensitive cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE). In {{order to better}} understand the potential mechanisms of ultraviolet (UV) light on photosensitivity in patients with cutaneous LE, we designed immunopathologic in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the effects of UV on the binding of such autoantibodies to the surface of human keratinocytes, one major target of immunologic damage in photosensitive LE. Short-term 2 % paraformaldehyde fixation of suspensions of cultured human keratinocytes previously incubated with monospecific antiserum probes enabled the detection of ENA expression on the cell surface by flow-cytometry analysis. UVB light (280 - 320 nm) induced the binding of monospecific antibody probes for SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La on keratinocytes in a dose-dependent pattern with maximal induction observed at the dose of 200 mJ/cm 2 UVB. Binding of SS-A/ Ro, SS-B/La, and RNP antibody was augmented strongly, but binding of anti-Sm was very weak. In contrast, UVA (320 - 400 nm) light had no effect on the induction of binding of these antibody probes. Identical results were seen by standard immunofluorescence techniques. Hydroxyurea-treated keratinocytes showed similar induction of those antigens by UVB irradiation, which suggested that ENA expression on cultured keratinocytes by UVB were cell-cycle independent. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation of proteins, reduced UVB light effect on the SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antigen's expression. These in vitro FACS analyses revealed that ENA augmentation on the keratinocyte cell surface was dose dependent, UVB dependent, glycosylation dependent, and cell-cycle independent. In vivo ENA augmentation on the keratinocyte surface was examined in suction blister epidermal roofs. Specific antibody probes for SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, RNP, and Sm bound to human keratinocytes in intact suction blister epidermis following UVL irradiation in vivo. Using three different protocols, we have demonstrated that antibodies to SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, and U 1 RNP bind to UVL-irradiated human keratinocytes. We speculate that this antibody binding is an important inducer of antibody dependent keratinocyte damage in photosensitive cutaneous lupus...|$|R

Recombinant PRRSV <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> and the PCV 2 capsid antigen were coupled to fluorophore-dyed beads with distinct spectral addresses. Weekly serum samples from 72 pigs that were experimentally exposed to either PCV 2, PRRSV, or both PCV 2 and PRRSV were used to validate the microbead assay (MBA) in comparison with the âgold standard â enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

Study design: (a) Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against influenza-B viral antigens, and (b) their use in two different ELISA systems for detecting influenza-B antigen either directly in clinical specimens or after confirmation by rapid culture in MDCK cells. Results: Four monoclonal antibodies were selected for their specificity for the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. The specificity of these antibodies for different epitopes of the nucleoprotein was demonstrated by competition experiments, using unlabelled and biotin-labelled purified antibodies in a sandwich assay. All four antibodies belong to the mouse IgG(2 a) isotype, lack haemagglutination inhibition and neutralization properties and exhibit titres as high as 10 (- 6) in ELISA with as little as 30 ng purified influenza-B virus. ELISA methods using these antibodies detected only influenza-B viral antigens in direct testing of clinical specimens from patients with known influenza-B or influenza-A infections, or after reisolating virus from such specimens in tissue culture of MDCK cells.

40|$|IgG was {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} neutralize virions by blocking their attachment to or penetration into mucosal epithelial cells, a common site {{of exposure to}} viruses. However, we describe an intracellular neutralizing action for an influenza hemagglutinin-specific monoclonal antibody, Y 8 - 10 C 2 (Y 8), which has neutralizing activity only at an acidic pH. When Y 8 {{was applied to the}} basolateral surface of MadinâDarby canine kidney cells expressing the rat neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn), it significantly reduced viral replication following apical exposure of the cell monolayer to influenza virus. Virus neutralization by Y 8 mAb was dependent on FcRn expression and its transport of IgG. As both FcRn and Y 8 mAb bind their partners only at acidic pH, the Y 8 mAb is proposed to carry out its antiviral activity intracellularly. Furthermore, the virus, Y 8 mAb, and FcRn colocalized within endosomes, possibly inhibiting the fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes during primary uncoating, and preventing the accumulation of the neutralized viral <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> in the nucleus. Prophylactic administration of Y 8 mAb before viral challenge in WT mice, but not FcRn-KO mice, conferred protection from lethality, prevented weight loss, resulted in a significant reduction in pulmonary virus titers, and largely reduced virus-induced lung pathology.

The efficacy of the bELISA as a serum screening assay was compared to the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay using 251 serum samples obtained from experimentally infected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). The concordance between the AGID assay and bELISA was 94. 1 % (95 % CI = 89. 9, 98. 3) for raccoons, and 71. 2 % (95 % CI = 63. 5, 78. 9) for mallards and 82. 8 % (95 % CI = 78. 2, 87. 3) overall. The bELISA was more sensitive than the AGID assay as demonstrated by the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus at earlier time points in experimental infection studies and at higher serial dilutions.

Keratinocytes of canine footpad epidermis containing detectable CDV <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> and CDV mRNA were shown previously to have increased proliferation indices. Because various proteins that {{play a role in the}} proliferation of epidermal cells are viral targets, the potential participation of such proteins in CDV-associated keratinocyte proliferation was investigated. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), cell cycle regulatory proteins p 21, p 27 and p 53, and nuclear factor (NF) -kappaB transcription factor components p 50 and p 65 were studied in the footpad epidermis from the following groups of dogs inoculated with CDV: group 1, consisting of seven dogs with clinical distemper and CDV in the footpad epidermis; group 2, consisting of four dogs with clinical distemper but no CDV in the footpad epidermis; group 3, consisting of eight dogs with neither clinical distemper nor CDV in the footpad epithelium. Group 4 consisted of two uninoculated control dogs. The expression of TGF-alpha, p 21, p 27 and p 53, and p 50 in the basal layer, lower and upper spinous layers, and in the granular layer did not differ statistically between CDV-positive (group 1) and CDV-negative (groups 2 - 4) footpad epidermis. However, there were differences in the levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic p 65 expression between group 1 dogs and the other three groups. Thus, footpads from group 1 dogs had more keratinocytes containing p 65 in the cytoplasm and, conversely, fewer nuclei that were positive for p 65. These findings indicate that p 65 translocation into the nucleus is reduced in CDV-infected footpad epidermis. Such decreased translocation of p 65 may help to explain increased keratinocyte proliferation in hard pad disease and suggests interference of CDV with the NF-kappaB pathway...|$|E

In this system, NP antigen appeared first (at 3 hr) in the cell nucleus, whereas HA and neuraminidase appeared coincidentally, at 4 hr after infection, in the cytoplasm. The initial detectability of biological or complement-fixing activity of the proteins coincided with their demonstrability as stainable antigens. Late in infection, all three antigens were detected at the cell surface. Antibody specific for HA partially blocked the intracellular staining of neuraminidase and inhibited the enzymatic activity of both extracted and intact extracellular virus. These observations suggest the close intracytoplasmic proximity of the two envelope antigens and perhaps their initial association in a larger protein...|$|R
40|$|Among {{approximately}} 1000 adenoviruses from chimpanzees and bonobos studied recently, the Pan Adenovirus type 3 (PanAd 3, {{isolated from}} a bonobo, Pan paniscus) {{has one of}} the best profiles for a vaccine vector, combining potent transgene immunogenicity with minimal pre-existing immunity in the human population. In this study, we inserted into a replication defective PanAd 3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza <b>antigens</b> <b>nucleoprotein</b> (NP) and matrix 1 (M 1). We then studied antibody and T cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model. A single intranasal administration of PanAd 3 -NPM 1 vaccine induced strong antibody and T cell responses, and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge. Thus PanAd 3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines, including universal influenza vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Influenza virus type A H 5 N 1 {{has become}} {{epidemic}} in poultry population in Indonesia {{and has been}} suspected sporadically to cross humans. All the available evidences suggest that the most common primary introduction of AI viruses into an area is by wild birds. The ducks form the reservoir of influenza type A viruses in nature and may spread AI virus from farm to farm by mainly mechanical transfer of infective feces, in which AIvirus may be present at high concentrations and may survive for considerable periods. In the present paper, {{we report on the}} immunohistochemical and molecular investigations performed on nine ducks (Cairina moschata) naturally infected by influenza virus type A. The H 5 N 1 gene was detected by molecular analysis of the reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the parenchyma of the lungs, but neither in the pancreas nor the intestines. Immunohistochemical streptavidin biotin assay of monoclonal antibody anti <b>nucleoprotein</b> viral <b>antigen</b> also only corresponded to virus location within the vascular endothelia of the lung only. Our findings may suggest that the ducks provide an environment transmission of AI virus not only by a fecal route, but also by either an airborne route or direct contact with contaminated respiratory secretions. Moreover, we suggest that surveillance activities influenza viruses of the avian origin are critical for characterizing AI virus in the ducksand requires a high level of preparedness...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} suitability {{for national}} serosurveys, we compared two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for mumps antibody, Enzygnost Anti-Parotitis-Virus/IgG (which uses a whole-virus antigen) and Microimmune Mumps IgG Screen ELISA (which uses a recombinant <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen),</b> by testing 1, 915 opportunistically collected sera submitted to diagnostic laboratories across Australia in 1997 to 1998. The proportion of positive results increased with age in both ELISAs but {{was significantly higher}} with the Microimmune than with the Enzygnost ELISA overall (88 % versus 63 %; P < 0. 01) and in all age groups. However, the proportion of equivocal results was significantly higher with the Enzygnost than with the Microimmune ELISA (9 % versus 4 %; P < 0. 01). Of the 572 sera with discrepant or equivocal results, 508 had sufficient sample remaining to perform the neutralization test (NT). A proportion with concordant results in both ELISAs were also tested by the NT. For sera with discrepant results, there was significantly better agreement between the NT and Microimmune than between the NT and Enzygnost (310 / 444 [70 %] versus 135 / 348 [39 %]; P < 0. 01). Of 64 sera with equivocal Microimmune results, 45 (70 %) were positive in the NT compared with 140 of 160 (88 %) equivocal Enzygnost results (P < 0. 01). Compared with the NT, the Microimmune ELISA is more sensitive (96 % versus 80 %) but apparently less specific (36 % versus 85 %) than the Enzygnost ELISA. However, {{this is likely to}} be due to the generally lower sensitivity of the NT, since the Microimmune results reflect expected seroprevalence, based on vaccine uptake in the age groups studied. We conclude that the Microimmune ELISA is a more appropriate assay than the Enzygnost ELISA for estimation of mumps seroprevalence...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectives:The {{presently}} advocated {{tests for}} rapid diagnosis of rabies, {{such as the}} fluorescent antibody test (FAT) are expensive and require expertise to carry out and interpret the results. In this study, a simple direct dot blot enzyme immunoassay (DIA) has been developed and evaluated to detect the rabies antigen in brain specimens of animals and humans. The utility of this test in the ante-mortem diagnosis of human rabies has also been evaluated. Methods:Brain homogenates of suspected rabid animals (n = 250), humans (n = 16) and clinical samples like saliva (n = 12) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 12) were directly spotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) and the absorbed rabies <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen</b> was detected using biotinylated antinucleoprotein antibody followed by treatment with streptavidin peroxidase conjugate and color development with diamino benzedine (DAB). Rabies-infected and normal mouse brain homogenates were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The results of this test were evaluated with fluorescent antibody technique (for brain samples) and mouse inoculation test (for saliva and CSF samples). Results:A distinct dark brown color {{was seen in the}} positive control and all positive samples, while there was no color development with either the negative control or the negative samples. The concordance between the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and dot immunoassay was 98. 4 % for brain samples, 83. 3 % for saliva and 91. 6 % for CSF samples. The specificity of the test was found to be 100 %. Conclusions:The dot blot enzyme immunoassay (DIA) test described here is a sensitive, specific and rapid test for the post-mortem diagnosis of rabies in animals and humans. The utility of this test for the ante-mortem diagnosis of rabies needs to be further evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Newcastle disease virus (Herts strain), {{grown in}} embryonated eggs or {{in a line}} of bovine kidney cells, was {{purified}} and then separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation into infectious (IH) and noninfectious hemagglutinating (NIH) particles. These particles were morphologically similar, although the average size of IH was twice that of NIH particles. The activity of hemagglutinin per milligram of virus protein was two- to threefold higher in NIH particles than in IH particles, whereas the specific activity of neuraminidase did not differ in the two particle types. This was consistent with the observed particle size difference. The distribution of the major proteins in IH and NIH particles from egg-grown virus, determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), was significantly different. In IH particles the molar ratio of protein 1 (74, 000 daltons) to proteins 2 and 3 (56, 000 daltons) : protein 6 (41, 000 daltons) was 1. 0 : 2. 5 : 2. 5; in NIH particles the ratio was 1. 0 : 0. 6 : 1. 0. When Newcastle disease virus was grown in bovine kidney cells, the molar ratio of proteins in IH particles resembled that of of egg-grown virus. However, in NIH particles from bovine kidney cells, only protein bands corresponding to protein 1 and proteins 2 - 3 were present and their molar ratio was 1. 0 : 0. 6. Protein 6 was marginally detectable in these particles. Analysis of the proteins in [3 H]isoleucine- and [14 C]glucosamine-labeled virus showed proteins 1 and 2 (glycoproteins) present in the ratio of 1. 0 : 0. 5; protein 3, the nucleoprotein, was not detected. These results are compatible with previous findings by others that NIH particles are deficient in RNA and <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>antigen,</b> and suggest that formation of discrete particles of Newcastle disease virus by budding requires at most minimal amounts of proteins 3 or 6. The fatty acid composition of egg-grown IH and NIH particles was not significantly different and resembled that of normal allantoic fluid...|$|E
40|$|Adenoviruses are potent vectors for {{inducing}} and boosting {{cellular immunity}} to encoded recombinant antigens. However, the widespread seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies to common human adenovirus serotypes limits their use. Simian adenoviruses do not {{suffer from the}} same drawbacks. We have constructed a replication- deficient chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the conserved influenza <b>antigens,</b> <b>nucleoprotein</b> (NP), and matrix protein 1 (M 1). Here, we report safety and T-cell immunogenicity following vaccination with this novel recombinant simian ade-novirus, ChAdOx 1 NP+M 1, in a first in human dose-escalation study using a 3 + 3 study design, followed by boosting with modified vaccinia virus Ankara express-ing the same antigens in some volunteers.

40|$|Virus {{shedding}} was monitored in nasal secretions of 12 calves experimentally {{infected with}} bovine {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (BRSV) using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting the <b>nucleoprotein</b> (NP) <b>antigen</b> of BRSV, by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the fusion protein of BRSV, and by a microisolation assay combined with immunoperoxidase staining for the F protein of BRSV. Under the conditions of this study, similar limits of detection and quantitative results were obtained from all three assays. BRSV was detected in nasal secretions of all calves {{for a minimum of}} 4 d. Virus shedding began on Day 2 after infection, peaked on Days 3 - 5, and was cleared in most calves by Day 8. The PCR, {{and to a lesser extent}} the ELISA, may detect virus shedding for a longer period after infection than virus isolation, possibly due to neutralization of the virus by rising mucosal antibody. Simulated environmental conditions likely to be experienced during transport of clinical field specimens markedly reduced the sensitivity of virus isolation but had a minimal effect on the results of the NP ELISA. Actual field transport conditions (overnight on ice) had minimal apparent effect on the results of the PCR assay. The less stringent specimen handling requirements, combined with low limits of detection, of both the nucleoprotein ELISA and PCR, indicate either of these assays are more suitable for diagnostic applications than virus isolation...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies to nine calf thymus nuclear antigens were {{sought by}} {{complement}} fixation methods in twenty-four sera from sixteen patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. These antigens included whole nuclei, native and heat denatured DNA, particulate and soluble <b>nucleoprotein</b> and Sm <b>antigen.</b> Soluble antigens were also tested by tanned red-cell agglutination tests. A wide {{variation in the}} presence and titres of antibodies to these various antigens {{was found in the}} sera studied even when from the same patient but at different times. To further test the range and specificity of antinuclear antibodies in SLE, nineteen ribonucleosides, nucleotides and monophosphoric dinucleotides were coupled to human serum albumin and used as antigens in precipitin studies. A wide variation of reactivity was also found in each serum. Exquisite specificity became apparent, capable of reacting with a nucleoside but not with the corresponding nucleotide or vice versa, with a dinucleotide but not with the nucleotides or nucleosides which it contained, with a given dinucleotide but not with the opposite sequence...|$|R
