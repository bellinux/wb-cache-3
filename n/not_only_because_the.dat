25|$|Amate {{paper has}} a long history. This history is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> raw {{materials}} for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted {{to the needs and}} restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.|$|E
25|$|These {{changes were}} unusual <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> extent {{and timing of}} the changes meant that {{construction}} {{took place during the}} school year, but also because Drillbit Taylor production did not pay for the re-tiling. The district had provided money to re-tile floors throughout the LAUSD, so the re-tiling of the floors itself was not unusual or controversial. However, as the film's production needs guided the color choices for the re-tiling and the schedule for construction, many students were upset by the behavior of the movie company and the school.|$|E
25|$|Toungoo {{was to get}} a {{much needed}} breather, however. For much of the rainy season of 1542, the Confederation chiefs were still {{coming to terms with}} their new leader Hkonmaing (son of Hkonmaing I of Onbaung), and had no time to plan for an invasion. Initially, the {{leadership}} of Mohnyin was deeply unsatisfied with Hkonmaing, who was put on the throne by the Ava court, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> heirs of Sawlon felt the throne of Ava was theirs but also because Hkonmaing's father was someone they bitterly fought against in the 1520s. In the end, in August/September 1542, the chiefs reluctantly decided to back Hkonmaing, and form a united front against a rising Toungoo. They agreed to invade Lower Burma in the dry season of 1543–44.|$|E

25|$|When the Spanish arrived, {{they noted}} the {{production}} of codices and paper, which was also made from maguey and palm fibers as well as bark. It was specifically noted by Pedro Mártir de Anglería. After the Conquest, indigenous paper, especially bark paper lost its value as a tribute item <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Spanish preferred European paper but also because bark paper's connection to indigenous religion caused it to be banned. The justification for the banning of amate {{was that it was}} used for magic and witchcraft. This was part of the Spaniard's efforts to mass convert the indigenous to Catholicism, which included the mass burning of codices, which contained most of the native history as well as cultural and natural knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2000, Japan renewed {{its defense}} {{obligations}} with the US and {{embarked on a}} rearmament program, partly in response to fears that Taiwan might be invaded. Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch preemptive strikes on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to the ROC's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> ROC controls valuable shipping routes, but also because its capture by PRC would make Japan more vulnerable. During World War II, the Allied forces were invaded the Philippines, but another viable target to enable direct attacks on Japan would have been Taiwan (then known as Formosa). However, critics of the preemptive strike theory assert that the PRC would be loath to give Japan and the US such an excuse to intervene.|$|E
25|$|The paschal {{sacrifice}} {{belongs to}} the shelamim, thus forming one of the sacrifices in which the meal is the principal part and indicates the community between God and man. It is really a house or family sacrifice, and each household is regarded as constituting a small community in itself, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> lamb is eaten at home, but also because {{every member of the}} family is obliged to partake of the meal, on pain of ritual excommunication, although each man must be circumcised and all must be ritually clean. The fact that the paschal lamb might be killed only at the central sanctuary of Jerusalem, on the other hand, implies that each household was but a member of the larger community; this is indicated also by the national character of the sacrifice, which kept alive in the memory of the nation the preservation and liberation of the entire people.|$|E

25|$|While Eliot was in Europe, he {{was again}} {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} enter the world of active business. The Merrimack Company, one of the largest textile mills in the United States, tendered him an invitation to become its superintendent. In spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of $5000 (plus a good house, rent free), Eliot, after giving considerable thought to the offer, turned it down. One of his biographers speculated that he surely realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration. This post would have given it scope. He must have felt, even if dimly, that if science interested him, it was not because he was first and last a lover of her laws and generalizations, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> clarity and precision of science was congenial, but because science answered the questions of practical men and conferred knowledge and power upon those who would perform the labors of their generation.|$|E
25|$|Judge Advocate John Bingham {{presented}} the closing {{argument for the}} prosecution. The military tribunal had jurisdiction, he said, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> court itself had ruled {{at the beginning of}} the trials that it did but because they were crimes committed in a military zone, during a time of war, and against high government officials in carrying out treasonous activities. Bingham pointed out that the Surratt boarding house was where the conspiracy was planned, and Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell had all met with Surratt. Booth had paid for the rental of the carriage that took Surratt to Surrattsville each time, and Bingham said that was evidence that Surratt's trips were critical to the conspiracy. Bingham also said that Lloyd's testimony had been corroborated by others and that his unwillingness to reveal the cache of weapons in the tavern was prompted by his subservient tenant relationship to Surratt. Bingham concluded by reiterating the government's key point: Powell had returned to the Surratt house seeking Surratt, and that alone was proof of her guilt. Bingham also pointed out for the tribunal that the charge a person was indicted for was irrelevant. Under the law of conspiracy, if one person carries out a crime, all conspirators are guilty of the same crime.|$|E
25|$|Roughly at {{the same}} time the ramparts of the city opened to allow new housing to be built around the lakes ("Søerne") which bordered the old defence system to the west. This {{dramatic}} increase in space was long overdue, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> old ramparts were out of date as a defence system, but also because of bad sanitation in the old city. As the area within the ramparts had been almost constant since the reign of Christian IV despite a fourfold increase in the population, the buildings had become taller and the amount of space available to residents had decreased. By relaxing the demarcation line introduced as a result of the defences, unrestricted permission to build property outside the lakes was introduced in 1852. This caused a considerable growth in Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Frederiksberg. A new neighbourhood arose in 1861–77 on the island of Gammelholm as Holmen naval base was moved to Nyholm, and large parts of Nyboder were changed into ordinary residences. In 1868 it was decided to remove the ramparts and from 1872 the old glacises were converted into residential areas. By the construction of Frihavn harbour in 1894 another neighbourhood was founded stretching towards Hellerup. In 1900–01, the large developments of Brønshøj and Valby followed.|$|E

500|$|... "Sum" [...] and [...] "summand" [...] {{derive from}} the Latin noun summa [...] "the highest, the top" [...] and {{associated}} verb summare. This is appropriate <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> sum of two positive numbers is greater than either, {{but because it was}} common for the ancient Greeks and Romans to add upward, contrary to the modern practice of adding downward, so that a sum was literally higher than the addends.|$|E

Some Egyptians said that they thought the Colchians originated with Sesostris’ army, but I myself guessed their Egyptian origin <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Colchians are dark-skinned and curly-haired (which does not count for much by itself, because these features are common in others too) but more importantly because Colchians, Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only peoples in the world who practise circumcision and who have always done so.|$|E

500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of toothache can be challenging, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{list of potential}} causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable, and pain {{can be referred to}} and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any facial pain syndrome. However, the vast majority of toothache is caused by dental, rather than non-dental, sources. Consequently, the saying [...] "horses, not zebras" [...] has been applied to the differential {{diagnosis of}} orofacial pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of orofacial pain, all cases of orofacial pain may be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise. The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: history, followed by examination, and investigations. All this information is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} {{emasculation}} is prevalent in Hemingway's work, {{most notably in}} The Sun Also Rises. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, {{is a result of}} a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times. Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the [...] "natural" [...] versus the [...] "unnatural". In [...] "Alpine Idyll" [...] the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter.

Votta wrote, [...] "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception." [...] Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting [...] "its scope too wide", credited their storyline as the [...] "only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song". Votta stated that [...] "Glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can shake a stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence [...] "helped build their relationship into something we care more about". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her [...] "to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane".|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} [...] August 2001, his company's stock value still falling, Lay named Greg Whalley, {{president}} and COO of Enron Wholesale Services and Mark Frevert, to positions in the chairman's office. Some observers suggested that Enron's investors were in significant need of reassurance, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> company's business was difficult to understand (even [...] "indecipherable") {{but also because it}} was difficult to properly describe the company in financial statements. One analyst stated [...] "it's really hard for analysts to determine where [...] are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money." [...] Lay accepted that Enron's business was very complex, but asserted that analysts would [...] "never get all the information they want" [...] to satisfy their curiosity. He also explained that the complexity of the business was due largely to tax strategies and position-hedging. Lay's efforts seemed to meet with limited success; by September 9, one prominent hedge fund manager noted that [...] " [...] stock is trading under a cloud." [...] The sudden departure of Skilling combined with the opacity of Enron's accounting books made proper assessment difficult for Wall Street. In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using [...] "related-party transactions," [...] which some feared could be too-easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet. A particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of the [...] "related-party" [...] entities had been or were being controlled by CFO Fastow.|$|E
