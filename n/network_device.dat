[...] Claytronics consists {{of a collection of}} individual components called claytronic atoms, or catoms. [...] In order to be viable, catoms need to fit a set of criteria. First, catoms {{need to be able to}} move in three dimensions relative to each other and be able to adhere to each other to form a three-dimensional shape. Second, the catoms need to be able to communicate with each other in an ensemble and be able to compute state information, possibly with assistance from each other. [...] Fundamentally, catoms consist of a CPU, a <b>network</b> <b>device</b> for communication, a single pixel display, several sensors, an onboard battery, and a means to adhere to one another.|$|E

40|$|Distributed Large-Volume Metrology (LVM) {{systems are}} mainly used for {{industrial}} applications concerning assembly and dimensional verification of large-sized objects. These systems generally {{consist of a}} set of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> distributed around the measurement volume, and some targets to be localized, in contact with the measured object's surface or mounted on a hand-held probe for measuring the points of interest. Target localization is carried out through several approaches, which use angular and/or distance measurements by <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper presents a new methodology to support the design of <b>networks</b> of <b>devices</b> for distributed LVM systems based on triangulation (i. e., systems in which <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> perform angular measurements only). It is assumed that these systems use multi-sensor networks including two typologies of devices: some are accurate but expensive and other ones are less accurate but cheaper. The goal of the methodology is establishing a link between the following parameters: (i) density of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> (ii) mix between the two typologies of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> (iii) measurement uncertainty, and (iv) cost. The methodology allows to estimate the most appropriate density and mix between the two typologies of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> so that the distributed LVM system is conforming with the required measurement uncertainty and cost. The methodology relies on a large number of simulated experiments, defined and implemented using a dedicated routine; feasibility and practicality is tested by preliminary experiments on a multi-sensor photogrammetric system, developed at Politecnico di Torino - DIGEP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Current <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> enable {{connectivity}} between {{end systems}} with support for routing with a defined set of protocol software bundled with the hardware. These devices {{do not support}} user customization or {{the introduction of new}} software applications. Programmable <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> allow for the dynamic downloading of customized programs into <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> allowing for the introduction of new protocols and network services. The Oplet Runtime Environment (ORE) is a programmable network architecture built on a Gigabit Ethernet L 3 Routing Switch to support downloadable services. Complementing the ORE, we introduce the JFWD API, a uniform, platformindependent portal through which application programmers control the forwarding engines of heterogeneous network nodes (e. g., switches and routers). Using the JFWD API, an ORE service has been implemented to classify and dynamically adjust packet handling on silicon-based <b>network</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
