5|$|Secondary School {{is a big}} {{waste of}} time. What are French {{teachers}} doing? <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you know any history? What is the point in training people {{to do things that}} <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would be quite handy.|$|E

25|$|KMFDM are an art form—not a {{political}} party. From the beginning, our {{music has been}} a statement against war, oppression, fascism and violence against others. While some of the former band members are German {{as reported in the}} media, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> condone any Nazi beliefs whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> Department <b>of</b> Health and Human Services targets {{regarding}} {{incidence of}} foodborne infections were reached in 2007.|$|R

25|$|The {{apartment}} {{resembles a}} prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily {{on all of}} us. As <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do much, we haven’t got much to tell each other. Incapable of sharing our emotions, we each enclose ourselves in our own fear and distress. Since everyone {{is in the same}} black pit, there isn’t much point in repeating time and again that we can’t see clearly.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E
25|$|The film {{suggests}} Scotland {{had been}} under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and {{in the run-up to}} the Battle of Falkirk Wallace says to the younger Bruce, “e'll have what <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.|$|E

6000|$|It {{moved on}} with the bier, that {{travelling}} groan, as a fire moves on over grass in a thin line; it kept step, and marched alongside down the dense crowds mile after mile. It was a human sound, and yet inhuman, pushed out by animal subconsciousness, by intimate knowledge of universal death and change. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> us--none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can hold on for ever! ...|$|R

25|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{can ever}} forget how in that last Easter Sunday of his life, the Holy Father, marked by suffering, came {{once more to}} {{the window of the}} Apostolic Palace and one last time gave his blessing Urbi et Orbi. We can be sure that our beloved pope is {{standing}} today at the window of the Father's house that he sees us and blesses us. Yes, bless us, Holy Father. We entrust your dear soul to the Mother of God, your Mother, who guided you each day and who will guide you now to the eternal glory of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|How do you sum {{up one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} endings any of us will ever be fortunate enough to see? How do you sum {{up one of the}} most exciting bowl games ever contested? And how do you sum up what will one day be viewed as one of the most significant moments in the history of college football? I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will soon forget.|$|E

Don't let Mr. Maraton {{think too}} hardly <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Wherever his place {{may be in}} the future, he's done us a grand service to-night, and don't let's forget it. He's waked these people up as <b>none</b> other <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could have done. He's started this strike in such a fashion as <b>none</b> other <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could. Don't let's forget to be grateful. The {{education}} and the oratory isn't all on the other side now. If we don't see you again to-night, Mr. Maraton, or before you leave for London, here's my thanks, for one, for to-night's work, and I'll lay odds that the others are with me." ...|$|R
50|$|When the US entered World War Two in 1941 <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> {{services}} had a glider program. The German use of glider-borne {{attack on}} the Belgian fortress of Eben-Emael and their use in the Battle of Crete convinced the US military that they would need glider-borne forces of their own.|$|R

25|$|I {{regret to}} say that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which {{was not at all}} surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home {{on the day of}} his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E
50|$|On February 4, 2013, Castelli {{was convicted}} {{to seven years}} in prison, by a Milan court., along with three other CIA {{officials}}. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> the convicted <b>US</b> officials were present at the trial and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them have been extradited to Italy later.|$|R

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, a city {{ordinance}} that banned texting {{and driving}} passed 15 months after Governor Rick Perry veteod a similar state law.

5000|$|The 1912 {{race was}} held on 9 September in Clearing, Illinois. The race was 30 laps around an {{elliptical}} 4.14 miles km course, for a total distance of 124.8 miles km.

500|$|On January 15, 2014, Rodman again {{entered a}} {{rehabilitation}} facility to seek treatment for alcohol abuse.

500|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> did [...] It was just, you know, it's very conceptual.

25|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> {{the three}} <b>U.S.</b> Pacific Fleet {{aircraft}} carriers were in Pearl Harbor when the attack came.

Two species are IUCN Endangered: the Alabama red-bellied turtle (Alabama) and the loggerhead sea turtle (South Carolina, also the state saltwater reptile of Florida). However, in the United States, only the Alabama red-bellied turtle is legally an endangered species. The loggerhead sea turtle is only considered [...] "threatened" [...] under U.S. regulations.|$|R
