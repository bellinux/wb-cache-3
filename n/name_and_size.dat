40|$|We {{propose the}} rst self-stabilizing {{protocols}} for orienting arbitrary networks. We present three deterministic distributed network orientation protocols in arbitrary and asynchronous rooted networks. All the protocols {{set up a}} chordal sense of direction in the network. The protocols are self-stabilizing, meaning that starting from an arbitrary state, the protocols are guaranteed to reach a state, in which all node labels and edge labels are valid (meaning, they satisfy the specication of the orientation problem). We rst propose a very simple orientation protocol, called PEL. Algorithm PEL assumes that every processor knows the size (n) of the network and the processors are already assigned valid node labels. This protocol stabilizes in only 1 round. For the two other protocols, {{we assume that the}} network is rooted. We then compose these protocols with Algorithm PEL to obtain the corresponding orientation protocols for any arbitrary network. The second protocol is based on a sequential node <b>naming</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> computation algorithm which assumes an underlying depth-rst token circulation protocol. When this protocol is composed with Algorithm PEL, we obtain an orientation algorithm which stabilizes in O(n d) rounds where d is the diameter of the network. This protocol involves designing a parallel node <b>naming</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> computation algorithm, <b>and</b> assumes the existence of an underlying spanning tree protocol. The third protocol can be composed with Algorithm PEL to design an orientation algorithm which stabilizes in O(d) rounds. Although the third protocol assumes the construction of a spanning tree of the rooted network, it orients all edges|both tree and non-tree|of the network.
