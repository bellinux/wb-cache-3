25|$|In Canada, ramps are {{considered}} rare delicacies. Since {{the growth of}} ramps is not as widespread there as in Appalachia and because of destructive human practices, ramps are a threatened species in Quebec. Allium tricoccum is a protected species under Quebec legislation. A person may have ramps {{in his or her}} possession outside the plant's natural environment, or may harvest it for the purposes of personal consumption in an annual quantity <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> <b>50</b> bulbs or 50 plants, provided those activities do not take place in a park within the meaning of the National Parks Act. The protected status also prohibits any commercial transactions of ramps; this prevents restaurants from serving ramps as is done in the United States. Failure to comply with these laws is punishable by a fine. However, the law does not always stop poachers, who find a ready market across the border in Ontario (especially in the Ottawa area), where ramps may be legally harvested and sold.|$|E
