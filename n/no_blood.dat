5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> stains on the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, and that there was <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E

5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>blood</b> was shed {{during the}} event, {{and when the}} Gabonese people did not respond violently the {{military}} interpreted this {{as a sign of}} approval. Aubame was offered the presidency of the newly formed provisional government. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Gondjout. During the coup, he served as Minister of State. The coup's leaders were content at restoring security for the civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> on {{her feet}} or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The blood on her nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most famous}} of Olaechea's deeds during the Civil War was his sermon of 15 November 1936 No mas sangre (<b>No</b> More <b>Blood),</b> during the act of {{granting}} insignia to the Accion Catolica Feminina. Olaechea condemned the practice, often repeated, of executions that were like lynchings. When a man had been killed at the front and his body brought back to his town, the ceremony often concluded with the rapid execution, without any legal process whatever, of some rojillos, ( [...] little reds, meaning contemptible), from the locale. Olaechea sought to subdue the murders; [...] " [...] Forgiveness! Forgiveness! <b>No</b> more <b>blood,</b> <b>no</b> more <b>blood!</b> <b>No</b> more <b>blood</b> than Christ the Lord wishes to be spilt, by way of intercession, on the fields of battle, to save our glorious and shattered fatherland; - Catholics! When there arrives in the village {{the body of a}} hero who has died in battle and we feel the blood boil in our veins - then let there be a man and let there be a woman who, stretch out their arms over him and cry with all their strength 'No! No! Hold back! the blood of our son is blood that redeems us; we can hear his voice, like the voice of Jesus on the cross 'forgive!' Let no one be touched because of our son ! Let no one suffer! Let all be forgiven! If you wreak vengeance now, he would curse you, I and my son would curse you'. [...] " ...|$|R

5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had <b>no</b> <b>blood</b> on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypertension {{is closely}} related to {{impaired}} endothelial dependent vasodilation due to decreasing availability of <b>blood</b> nitric oxide (<b>NO)</b> and high fat intake. Objective: To analyze <b>blood</b> <b>NO</b> and fat intake differences in patients with hypertension andnon hypertension. Method: The study was a cross-sectional design and sampling was carried out in Sidoarjo District Hospital. Subjects of the study were 24 patients aged between 40 to 65 years, which consist of 12 cases and 12 controls. Measurement of <b>blood</b> <b>NO</b> and recall of fat intake were performed. Results: <b>Blood</b> <b>NO</b> in hypertension andnon hypertension patients were 72. 333 ± 40. 511 µM and 116. 083 ± 46. 962 µM respectively. Fat consumption in hypertension andnon hypertension were 51. 52 ± 5. 99 g and 41. 65 ± 8. 32 g respectively. Two independent samples t-test showed meaningful differences in the levels of <b>blood</b> <b>NO</b> (p= 0. 023) as well as fat intake (p= 0. 004) between the hypertension andnon hypertension patients. Conclusion: There is a difference in the levels of <b>blood</b> <b>NO</b> and fat intake in patients with hypertension andnon hypertension...|$|R
