50|$|A hypocenter (or hypocentre) (from ὑπόκεντρον hypόkentron for 'below the center') is {{the point}} of origin of an {{earthquake}} or a subsurface nuclear explosion. It is a synonym of the focus. The term hypocenter is also used as a synonym for ground zero, the surface point directly beneath a <b>nuclear</b> <b>airburst.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mark 10 was {{intended}} to be a general purpose <b>airburst</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon, unlike the Mark 8 which {{was intended}} to penetrate into the ground as a Nuclear bunker buster.|$|R
40|$|High Power Microwave {{technology}} has matured {{to the point}} where practical ElectroMagnetic Pulse [1] weapons are becoming technically feasible, with applications in Electronic Combat, Offensive Counter-Air, Combat Air Support and in Strategic Air Attack. The current development of conventional ElectroMagnetic Pulse devices allows their use in non-nuclear confrontations. This paper proposes a doctrinal foundation for the use of such devices in warhead and bomb applications. 1. Introduction The ElectroMagnetic Pulse (EMP) effect was first observed during the early testing of high altitude <b>airburst</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. The effect is characterised by the production of a very short but intense electromagnetic pulse, which propagates away from its source with ever diminishing intensity, governed by the theory of electromagnetism. The ElectroMagnetic Pulse is in effect an electromagnetic shock wave. This pulse of energy produces a powerful electromagnetic field, particularly within the vici [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{military}} bomber {{aircraft are}} designed around a large-capacity internal bomb bay while fighter bombers usually carry bombs externally on pylons or bomb racks, or on multiple ejection racks which enable mounting several bombs {{on a single}} pylon. Some bombs are equipped with a parachute, such as the World War II [...] "parafrag", which was an 11 kg fragmentation bomb, the Vietnam war-era daisy cutters, and the bomblets of some modern cluster bombs. Parachutes slow the bomb's descent, giving the dropping aircraft {{time to get to}} a safe distance from the explosion. This is especially important with <b>airburst</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, and in situations where the aircraft releases a bomb at low altitude. A number of modern bombs are also precision-guided munitions, and may be guided after they leave an aircraft by remote control, or by autonomous guidance.|$|R
25|$|A {{much larger}} number of firestorms, in the thousands, was the initial {{assumption}} of the computer modelers who coined the term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value <b>airbursting</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon use during an American-Soviet total war. This {{larger number of}} firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled, are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions {{as a result of}} the smoke inputted into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20°C (36°F) in core agricultural regions of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35°C (63°F) in Russia. This cooling would be produced due to a 99% reduction in the natural solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet in the first few years, gradually clearing over the course of several decades.|$|R
