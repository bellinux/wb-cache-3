Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only subject-matter experts (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among <b>non-SMEs</b> is that some official gene names have the word [...] "protein" [...] within them, so the phrase [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the gene) and [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the protein) are both valid. The AMA Manual gives another example: both [...] "the TH gene" [...] and [...] "the TH gene" [...] can validly be parsed as correct ("the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although {{it is easier to}} understand when explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) [...] "happens to use the same letter string" [...] that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase [...] "happens to" [...] implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it helps to have biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of fact-checking as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call p53 protein [...] "TP53" [...] in humans or [...] "Tp53" [...] in rats, most authors call it [...] "p53" [...] in both (and even refuse to call it [...] "TP53" [...] if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, TP53, and may even do so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.|$|E

30|$|The {{authors have}} {{detected}} some differences of {{views on the}} use of eLogistics applications. The results are presented in Table  8 showing that a majority (more than 50  %) of the SME sub-group uses the eLogistics applications in the following functional areas: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems and EDI. But the <b>Non-SME</b> sub-group had more usage of eLogistics applications: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Vehicle Tracking and Tracing, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems and EDI. The TLSP even have a higher (than the <b>Non-SME</b> group) usage: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Vehicle Tracking and Tracing, Route Guidance Systems- GPS, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems and EDI as well. The Terminal Operators have usage of eLogistics system in the following six functional areas: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems and EDI. The Shippers have a limited usage of eLogistics applications: only in Order Management Systems and Invoicing. The authors find that the similarity among the usage of eLogistics applications of the <b>Non-SME,</b> the TLSP and the Terminal Operator groups is possibly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the TLSP and Terminal Operator participants belong to <b>Non-SME</b> group. And these groups have higher technical and financial capacity and skills to use the eLogistics applications. On the other hand the lower usage of eLogistics applications by the SME (and the Shipper) sub-group is possibly due the fact that they lack technical and final capacity and skills.|$|R

One of the benchmarks that can be utilized to measure the performance of sharia banking is Financing Deposite Ratio (FDR) which is always within the safe range set by the Bank of Indonesia (BI). It is due to sharia banking being able to be good in distributing the fund, succesfully gathered from the community, back to community in the form of financing. Financing has an important role for the community and the bank. Financing is generally delivered to two groups, namely Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) and <b>Non-SME.</b> Before 2014, the focus of sharia banks’ financing was on SMEs but the focus changed toward <b>Non-SME</b> afterwards. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to find out the factors influencing the financing level (Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Financing and Non Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Financing) of sharia banks in Indonesia period 2010 -June 2015 by multiple linear regressions model. Result of research indicate that all of variables that variables of SBIS’s bonus rate, Inflation rate, Third Party Funds (DPK), Non Performing Financing (NPF), Financing Deposite Ratio (FDR), Return On Asset (ROA) are able to give explanation significantly to the both financing.

The main findings suggest the interdependent relationships between export participation, firm size, and access to credit. SMEs participating in export markets tend to gain more access to credit, while potential scale economies (firm sizes) of SMEs are positively associated with participation in export markets.

30|$|The study {{finds that}} eLogistics {{applications}} are generally used by {{majority of the}} participants in three areas: order management systems, booking (customers, carriers) and invoicing systems. They are less used in the remaining areas, although these areas are core activities of logistics sectors. There is a big difference in the use of eLogistics applications among different groups. The <b>Non-SMEs</b> have usage of eLogistics applications in a higher number of areas than the SMEs. The SMEs need to upgrade their technical and financial capability and skills to achieve higher usage of eLogistics applications. Similarly the TLSP have usage of eLogistics applications in a higher number of areas than the Terminal Operator or the Shipper sub-groups. There is a similarity of use of eLogistics applications (a majority use in seven similar areas) between Non-SME and TLSP sub-groups, possibly {{due to the fact that}} most of the TLSPs are <b>Non-SMEs.</b> It can be noted that the shipper group has a very small sample and thus it was disregarded.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the knowledge economy, intense global competition and considerable technological advance has seen innovation become increasingly central to competitiveness. Innovation is diverse and pervasive. It is applicable to every facet of business activity of each enterprise. SMEs are increasingly important components of the industrial structure. SMEs are the key drivers behind innovations and creative entrepreneurship. SMEs are the critical part of Singapore enterprise ecosystem. The role of SMEs in a country economic development is well recognized. But SMEs in Singapore are not as dynamic and innovative as many other developed countries, even compared with some other Asian economies like Hong Kong or Taiwan. Its productivity is only about half that of the <b>non-SME</b> establishment. Innovation of product, process, technology and business practices is imperative for Singapore SME. It will make Singapore SME improve competitiveness; unlock new markets and generating new customers; develop new and improved product and services; make management and administrative system more efficient and effective. However, managing the complex and risky process of innovation has been problematic and fraught with difficulty (Kanter, 1989; Quinn, 1985). Besides the barriers and challenges of innovation for SMEs, like capable talents, competitions etc, Singapore SMEs also face many challenges unique to Singapore economy; like the lack of innovation and entrepreneurial culture; dominance of economy by MNCs and GLCs, extremely small local market and lack of natural resources etc. This study {{is based on the}} questionnaire of the Singapore SME samples in Singapore about the innovation capability and planning. In this paper we will look into some of the key internal and external factors determining the Singapore SME innovation capability, like the management and strategy, source of innovation, innovation process, market, customer communication, national innovation system etc. The interaction among them, resulted innovation barriers and challenges for SME innovation capability and performance is analyzed systematically. The purpose of the paper is to 1) To define and review the key internal factors, external factors and their interactions which are instrumental to the SME innovation capability development 2) To perform the detailed analysis of Singapore firm innovation capability, performance, barriers and challenges in relation to the firm internal, external factors and their interactions 3) To develop the innovation model for Singapore SMEs and the recommendations for SMEs innovation development strategy SME innovation capability is determined by internal factors, external factors and the interactions between them. Singapore SMEs must now build up distinctive competencies and use innovation strategies to differentiate themselves in order to survive and thrive in today's dynamic business environment. It is argued in the paper that the internal factors are the most critical for the innovation success of Singapore SMEs. The government policy and national innovation infrastructure aiming mainly for the external factors improvement is recommended to address some main challenges and constraints faced by Singapore SMEs for the development and growth of innovation capability...|$|R

The definitions of collaborative research and contract research in the UK are as follows: ‘collaborative research’ includes research projects with public funding from at least one public body, and a material contribution from at least one external non-academic collaborator, and, by contrast, ‘contract research’ includes contract numbers and income identifiable by the institution as meeting the specific research requirements of external partners, excluding any already returned in collaborative research involving public funding and excluding basic research council grants. In Japan, {{there are two types}} of funding definition. One is collaborative research where both university and external partners produce something and share outcomes altogether under a contract. The external partners include commercial business, public bodies or non-commercial organisations. The other, contract research, is defined as research under which externals commit specified projects to universities under a contract. The outcomes from contract research are normally owned by the universities but then are purchased by externals which may include commercial business, public societies, non-commercial organisations or government. The UK data classifies collaboratives and contracts asbeing with SMEs or <b>non-SMEs,</b> reporting financial numbers and volume under each category. The Japanese data does not make this distinction but reports only the numbers (volume) with SMEs and <b>non-SMEs.</b> The two countries also have slightly different though similar definitions of SME.

40|$|Innovation is at {{the heart}} of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in order to promote higher levels of {{employment}} and productivity. Special attention is given to increasing the effectiveness of innovation policy instruments, mainly as some authors found evidence that productivity could be negatively affected by subsidies. The aim of the study is to assess how the expected impact on firm productivity and employment is taken into account, when firms apply for public funding for innovation. The analysis is based on the case study of the Portuguese Innovation Incentive System in the Alentejo region. In order to understand which factors influence the public decision to financially support private investment, we estimated a logit model based on firms’ and applications’ characteristics, controlling for the macroeconomic environment. The results indicate that government preferences for promoting exports, exploiting firms R&D results and stimulating the level of qualified employment are shown to be more relevant than the impact on firm productivity.

40|$|This study explores how firm {{specific}} and key personnel factors (resources) influence the internationalization process of small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing sector in developing countries. SME internationalization {{has been widely}} researched but little is known {{of how and why}} internationalization takes place in the developing countries, and such lack of evidence in the literature provides strong grounds for this study. The findings indicate that, compared to <b>non-SMEs,</b> developing countries SMEs are less likely to venture into international markets, and those that do, do so to a lesser degree; they are also less likely to engage in networking with other business, but are more likely to exhibit growth intention. Various paces and myriad of entry modes determine the pattern of internationalization undertaken. A traditional internationalization pattern is strongly evident, although some SMEs exhibited born-again global internationalization pattern as a result of occurrence of some critical events within the firm. These include the appointment of managers with the requisite expertise; knowledge and access to international business information. The main drivers of internationalization centered on key personnel managerial capabilities and firm specific factors such as organizational process and networking abilities. The study also found that the production capabilities, domestic market conditions, outcomes (financial and non-financial), are all critical to the international expansion of SMEs in developin...|$|E
40|$|Airline {{passenger}} segmentation {{is traditionally}} classified into {{the categories of}} Business, Leisure and VFR (visiting friends and relatives). Most academic studies to date have only focused on the differences between business and leisure passengers without further exploring potential segments among business passengers. Hence, this research aims to enhance {{our understanding of the}} flight choice behaviour of business passengers, and in particular, exploring the potential differences between those who work in small and medium enterprises (SMEs, with 200 or less staff) and those in <b>non-SMEs</b> (more than 200 staff). Descriptive analysis from revealed preference (RP) data and discrete choice models from stated preference (SP) choice surveys are used to ascertain attributes that are significant to choice behaviour. Descriptive analyses show that more business passengers work in the SME category. However, SME passengers tend to fly less, are more price-sensitive, and derive less satisfaction in flying with full-service carriers if they have previously flown with low-cost carriers. Discrete choice model results show that fewer flight service attributes are significant on flights between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane due to shorter flight duration. However, more attributes related to ticket flexibility are found significant for one-day trips. On flights between Perth and the east coast, willingness to pay calculates a range of $ 25 to $ 62 for one piece of checked baggage, and $ 30 to $ 46 for an extra legroom seat. Attributes related to flight comfort have a larger significance on inbound flights (i. e., return flights from Perth to the east coast). Self-funded passengers are more price-sensitive when purchasing flights. Furthermore, we observed in choice experiment that attribute non-attendance (ANA) is above 55 % for all tested attributes, with the exception of fare; not all attributes are perceived equally by business passengers. Flight product attributes are considered separately from ticket flexibility attributes by business passengers. Therefore, airlines may consider unbundling its products for them. New SP surveys can be deployed to test future flight products. The traditional segmentation method of passengers based on Business, Leisure and VFR trip purposes should be thoroughly reviewed, with the categorisation of business passengers expanded based on the findings of this research...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{search of}} the literature revealed {{that only a few}} studies (e. g. Mabey and Ramirez, 2005) have examined the effects of executive development on organisational outcomes. Furthermore, it has been postulated that limited measures of executive and leadership development exist (Collins, 2002), and therefore, based on Luoma’s (2006) model of management development, an integrated measure is constructed in this research. In addition, this research advances an empirical examination of the relationship between a measure of executive learning and development (L&D) and a composite perceptual organisational performance measure (financial, market share, customer satisfaction, innovation, and employee engagement). Executive L&D is hypothesised to affect organisational performance {{on the basis of a}} number of interrelated theoretical concepts: Resource-Based View (Barney, 1991; Barney, 2001; Clulow et al., 2007), Dynamic Capabilities (Chien and Tsai, 2012; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Zott, 2003), Human Capital (Rastogi, 2002; Ulrich, 1997; Wright et al. 2001) and Resource Dependency (Pfeffer, 1972; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Hitt and Tyler, 1991; Hillman, 2005). Furthermore, drawing on the Resource-Based View (Barney, 1991; Barney, 2001; Clulow et al., 2007) and Resource Dependency (Pfeffer, 1972; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Hitt and Tyler, 1991; Hillman, 2005) theories, it is hypothesised that differences in firm size will have a bearing on the effects of executive L&D on organisational performance. Based on empirical research findings on learning orientation differences across sectors (e. g. Hyland et al., 2000; Taylor and Bain, 2003; Wright and Dwyer, 2003; Dymock and McCarthy, 2006; Lee and Tsai, 2005; Khadra and Rawabdeh, 2006; Lee-Kelly et al., 2007), it is hypothesised the effects of executive L&D on organisational performance will differ across sectors (service versus industry). Initial validation of the executive L&D measure was based on data from a sample of 150 executives. Subsequently, data was collected from 222 organisational leaders across several geographic regions (Europe, USA, Africa, Asia, Australia) to allow further validation of the measure and to test the relations between executive L&D 5 and organisational performance (profitability, market share, innovation, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction). The results derived from ordinal regression analysis suggest that organisations that implemented executive L&D practices tended to show improved organisational performance. The positive effects of strategic, experiential, participative, and structured executive L&D dimensions on the composite measure of organisational performance underscores the contribution of both formal and informal learning to organisational outcomes. Firm sector and size characteristics were also found to modify the organisational performance effects of executive L&D. Specifically, industry firms produced better performance effects of executive L&D than their service counterparts. In terms of firm size, <b>Non-SMEs</b> produced better effects of executive L&D on organisational performance than SMEs. An important practical implication emerging from this result is that HRD practitioners may have to align executive L&D to firm size and sector characteristics. Importantly, the research offers theoretical extension to the Resource-Based View and Resource Dependency concepts of the firm. From the practical perspective, the amalgamation of executive L&D dimensions into a broad measure (reflecting ambidextrous learning), offers a unique nexus of both concepts with practical implications. Specifically, this suggests that HRD practitioners and senior executives need to account for a wide range of learning (formal and informal) dimensions when designing and implementing executive L&D. The results of this research provide theoretical extension for a number of theories: Resource-Based View, Human Capital, Resource Dependency, Knowledge-based, and Dynamic Capability, given the positive effects of executive L&D on organisational performance. To conclude, this research provides an integrated measure of executive L&D, which can be applied across different firm sectors/sizes to drive organisational performance...|$|E
40|$|Research {{to date on}} the {{economic}} development of the Republic of Korea and Taiwan has frequently contrasted the two economies by depicting the former as centered on large-scale enterprises and the latter on small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). The {{purpose of this study is}} to see if the appropriateness of this perception will also be verified by the statistical data. In Section I the authors utilized census data on the Korean and Taiwanese manufacturing sectors to compare the distribution pattern of the sizes of enterprises in the two economies. However, on examining the available data for making this comparison, the authors discovered that for Korea the statistics provided are those at the level of the establishment (a physical unit engaging in industrial activities such as a factory, workshop, office, or mine) while the statistics for Taiwan are those at the enterprise level. Mindful of this difference, the authors looked at the portion of the economy accounted for by large-scale establishments in Korea that employed 500 workers or more and by enterprises in Taiwan employing the same number of workers, and they discovered that the portion that these large-scale businesses account for, especially in the area of output, has steadily declined since the 1980 s. When comparing the share of total production that these large-scale establishments/enterprises account for in the two economies, the authors concluded that those in Korea accounted for a larger share of that economy's production than did their counterparts in Taiwan. The authors then compared the portion of the economy accounted for by establishments in Korea and enterprises in Taiwan that employed less than ten workers, and they found that the portion of the two economies that these very small-scale production units accounted for has also been on the decline. Section II compares the portions of the two economies accounted for by large business groups. After comparing the percentage of GDP accounted for by the total sales of these business groups, the authors found that large business groups in Korea have played a far more important role in Korean economy than has been the case for such groups in Taiwan. This difference in the importance of such business groups in the two economies has also played an significant part in fostering the perceived dichotomy of large-scale enterprises playing the important role in Korea versus SMEs being the important players in Taiwan. Section III compares the percentage of total exports accounted for by SMEs, and shows that SMEs in Taiwan account for a larger share of exports than do their counterparts in Korea. This section also shows that in Taiwan the share of export sales for SMEs has consistently exceeded that for <b>non-SMEs,</b> while in Korea the relationship between enterprise size and the rate of export sales has been directly proportional. This difference in the size of the major export players is another factor fostering the perception of the Korean economy being centered on big business while Taiwan's is on SMEs. Although there were difficulties and limitations when comparing the data of the two economies, the statistical comparison undertaken in this study shows that in general big business has played the major role in the development of the Korean economy while in Taiwan's economic development this role has been played by SMEs. Thus the statistical data also verifies the perceived dichotomy of these two economies. Small and medium-scale enterprises, Large-scale enterprises, Economic development, South Korea, Taiwan...|$|E
