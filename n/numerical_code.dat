National Alliance founder William Luther Pierce, who also appears in the game to discuss an [...] "upcoming white revolution", considered video games to be simply another medium to promote his organization's messages. Resistance released the game on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 21) of 2002.

For example, the integral [...] is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at [...] However, the substitution [...] transforms the integral into , which has no singularities at all.|$|E

40|$|The Bondi solution, which {{describes}} the radial inflow {{of a gas}} onto a non-rotating black hole, provides a powerful test for <b>numerical</b> relativistic <b>codes.</b> However, the Bondi solution is usually derived in Schwarzschild coordinates, which are not well suited for dynamical spacetime evolutions. Instead, many current <b>numerical</b> relativistic <b>codes</b> adopt moving-puncture coordinates, which render black holes in trumpet geometries. Here we transform the Bondi solution into trumpet coordinates, which result in regular expressions for the fluid flow extending into the black-hole interior. We also evolve these solutions numerically and demonstrate their usefulness for testing and calibrating <b>numerical</b> <b>codes.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures; matches version published in CQ...|$|R
