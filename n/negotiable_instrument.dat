5|$|A <b>negotiable</b> <b>instrument</b> {{is a type}} of {{contract}} that allows the transfer of money, such as a cheque. With a cheque there are three parties - the person holding the bank account who gives the cheque (the drawer), the party the cheque is made out to (the payee) and the drawer's bank which promises to pay the money to the payee (the drawee).|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} China’s market reforms, and how <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> {{have played}} {{an increasingly important}} role in China’s economy. The <b>Negotiable</b> <b>Instruments</b> Law, which came into effect January 1, 1996, consists of seven chapters, covering General Provisions, Drafts, Promissory Notes, Checks, Applicability of the Law to Foreign <b>Negotiable</b> <b>Instruments,</b> Legal Responsibilities, and Supplementary Provisions. This article illustrates that while the <b>Negotiable</b> <b>Instruments</b> Law constitutes a comprehensive financial statute; its scope is narrow in that it addresses <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> primarily {{in the context of}} banking transactions. This is especially apparent in the case of promissory notes that are regulated solely in their use as bank notes...|$|R

500|$|A {{substitute}} check (also {{called an}} Image Replacement Document or IRD) is a <b>negotiable</b> <b>instrument</b> {{used to represent}} the digital reproduction of an original paper check. In the United States, as a negotiable payment instrument, a substitute check maintains {{the status of a}} [...] "legal check" [...] in lieu of the original paper check as authorized by the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as the Check 21 Act). Instead of presenting the original paper checks, financial institutions and payment processing centers electronically transmit data from a substitute check by either the settlement process through the United States Federal Reserve System or by clearing the deposit based on a private agreement between member financial institutions of a clearinghouse that operates under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).|$|E
500|$|Burton {{argued that}} both {{constitutional}} provisions were violated because the crime {{had not occurred}} in the Eastern District of Missouri. Justice Peckham, writing for the entire Court except for Justice Harlan in dissent, reversed Burton's convictions on these grounds. The Court held that Burton's negotiation of the check in Washington, D.C. did not constitute conduct by Burton in St. Louis (the site of the drawee bank). In other words, whatever the Washington, D.C. bank did with the check afterwards, it did for itself, not as Burton's agent. [...] "From {{the time of the}} delivery of the check by the defendant to the bank it became the owner of the check; it could have torn it up or thrown it in the fire or made any other use or disposition of it which it chose, and no right of defendant would have been infringed." [...] Thus, the Court held that it was error for the trial judge to have submitted the question of the [...] "understanding [...] [...] [...] between the defendant and the bank" [...] to the jury. In support of this argument, the Court cited several of its own precedents concerning <b>negotiable</b> <b>instrument</b> law, as well as cases from the House of Lords and the courts of New York and Massachusetts.|$|E
