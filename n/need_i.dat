500|$|In early 1992 word {{leaked to}} the press on a {{possible}} merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public {{the fact that they}} had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we <b>need.</b> <b>I</b> still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} vocal critics of Peronism was the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. [...] After Perón ascended to the {{presidency}} in 1946, Borges spoke before the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE), saying Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still {{is the fact that}} they breed idiocy. [...] Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of caudillos, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking... Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. <b>Need</b> <b>I</b> remind readers of Martín Fierro or Don Segundo that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.|$|E
