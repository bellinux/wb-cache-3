Recently, {{researchers have}} begun to use similarity between classically unrelated people at their measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate genetic variation or covariation that is tagged by SNPs, using mixed effects models implemented in software such as Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). To do this, researchers find the average genetic relatedness over all SNPs between all individuals in a (typically large) sample, and use Haseman-Elston regression or restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the genetic variation that is [...] "tagged" [...] by, or predicted by, the SNPs. The proportion of phenotypic variation that is {{accounted for by the}} genetic relatedness has been called [...] "SNP heritability". Intuitively, SNP heritability increases to the degree that phenotypic similarity is predicted by genetic similarity at measured SNPs, and is expected to be lower than the true <b>narrow-sense</b> <b>heritability</b> to the degree that measured SNPs fail to tag (typically rare) causal variants.
