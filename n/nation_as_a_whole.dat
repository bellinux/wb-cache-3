30|$|For {{a nation}} to develop, it is {{essential}} that each of its locations is integrated into an urban system made up of inter-dependent cities that exchange people, goods and information (Fujita and Mori [1997]). This is because it is across cities of different sizes that the advantages of large urban areas, in terms of innovation and organization, pay off. In this view, development happens through the incorporation of new ideas and organizational forms into the structure of industrial and primary production, which, in turn, form the principal basis for the economies of smaller cities, and the material basis for <b>nations</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> (Christaller [1966]; Lösch [1954], Fujita et al.
