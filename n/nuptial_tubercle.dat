40|$|Historically, {{endocrine}} disrupting chemical {{research has}} focused on environmental androgens, estrogens, thyroid hormones, and their antagonists. Recent efforts have begun {{to examine the effects of}} gestagens, which include endogenous progestogens and synthetic progestins, on aquatic organisms. Gestagens have been measured in wastewater treatment plant effluent, pulp mill effluent, and runoff from agricultural fields. While studies have documented profound effects on the reproduction of fish and amphibians, the effects of gestagen exposure on reproductive behavior and male gamete quality have been relatively unexplored. As such, a series of studies were conducted in which fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to either a water control, EtOH control, or one of two concentrations of gestodene (GES), levonorgestrel (LNG), or progesterone (P 4) using a flow-through exposure system. Egg deposition was quantified daily, and alterations of reproductive behavior were examined on days 1, 2, and 8. After 8 days, fish were examined for the presence of secondary sexual characteristics (i. e. <b>nuptial</b> <b>tubercle,</b> fin spot, and dorsal fatpad formation). Egg deposition was affected by all treatments, with complete cessation observed at higher concentrations. Reproductive behaviors were affected after just one day in response to both treatments of LNG, GES, and P 4, with effects continuing through days 2 and 8. Exposure to both concentrations of LNG and GES also caused the physical masculinization of female fathead minnows. In a second set of studies using computer assisted sperm analysis, the same treatments were utilized to determine effects on sperm motility in males as a result of in vivo or in vitro exposure. LNG and GES showed no effect in either study, and P 4 caused decreases in sperm motility only as a result of in vivo exposure. Together, results from this study indicate that both GES and LNG function as environmental androgens in fishes, causing masculinization of secondary sex characteristics in females and disruption of reproduction over a short period of time. As altered reproductive behavior was observed after just one day of exposure for all treatments, this study underscores that behavior is an extremely sensitive endpoint that merits increased attention in future aquatic toxicology studies...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{responses}} of fathead minnows (FHM) exposed to known endocrine-disrupting substances (EDS) in our labs. As well, we wanted to examine the applicability and sensitivity of the full lifecycle FHM test for use on-site, exposing fish to a complex environmentally relevant Canadian effluent. Fathead minnows exposed from the egg stage to ethinylestradiol (EE 2, 0 – 32 ng/L) or methyltestosterone (MT, 0 – 3200 ng/L) had decreased growth (length, weight) at high concentrations. Development of secondary sex characteristics was a sensitive indicator of exposure to androgen and estrogen. Fish exposed to MT showed premature male sex characteristics such as <b>nuptial</b> <b>tubercles</b> by 30 days post-hatch (dph). These changes were more dramatic in older fish (at 60 and 90 dph), which showed premature male sex characteristics at very low MT concentrations (100 ng/L). Fish exposed to 3. 2 ng/L EE 2 had premature development of ovipositors at 60 dph. As well, exposure to very high MT concentrations (1000 and 3200 ng/L) caused development of ovipositors after 60 days (but not at 20 and 30 dph), presumably due to aromatizatio...|$|R

C. ornatum is the only species known from Arizona. According to NatureServe, “Set off from other Campostoma by numerous morphological and biochemical characteristics (Buth and Burr 1978. Morphologically variable in confounding geographic patterns. ” DESCRIPTION: Moderate-sized minnow with stout body that is not much compressed. Large head, with snout projecting and somewhat acute. Mouth is small with cartilaginous sheaths within jaws. Length rarely exceeds 12. 7 cm (5. 0 inches), however, large adults may obtain lengths of 15. 0 cm (5. 9 inches) or more (Minckley 1991). Scales relatively small, 62 to 76 in the lateral line. However according to Page and Burr (1991) they have 58 - 77 scales in the lateral line and 47 - 60 scales around the body at dorsal fin origin, 15 - 19 rakers on 1 st gill arch. Their pharyngeal teeth are 0, 4 - 4, 0 and they may reach a length of 15. 87 cm (6. 25 in). Breeding males with heads and predorsal areas swollen and greatly arched.

50|$|The body is {{fusiform}} {{and somewhat}} elongate. It is usually 100 to 175 mm (4 to 7 in) long, where the maximum length is approximately 225 mm (9 in). The back is olive-brown or dark brown, and the sides are leaden silver, hence the word plumbeus, referring to lead, {{in the scientific}} name of this fish. The snout is blunt and projects slightly beyond the upper lip. The corners of the mouth each bear a small barbel. The scales are small but well visible, and some may be black and form isolated dark spots on the lower sides. The dorsal, pelvic and anal fins each have 8 rays. The pectoral fins are broad and have 13-18, but more usually 15-16, rays. The fish has no teeth, adipose fin, or spines. The mouth is relatively small and the tail is forked. Breeding males can develop patches of bright orange or red {{at the base of}} the pectoral fins and sometimes near the mouth, and small <b>nuptial</b> <b>tubercles</b> on the top of the head, dorsal surface of pectoral rays, and on the belly near the base of the pectorals. The juveniles are similar to the adults, but have less obvious mottling or stripe. The females are typically larger than the males.|$|R
5000|$|Populations of Notropis buchanani usually {{breed in}} the second year of life during the period from May until late August {{depending}} on the location of the populations. In Tennessee, N. buchanani were reported to be in a reproductive state in late May, while in Kansas breeding individuals were found in mid-August. The majority of the populations breed during their second summer, and relatively few breed during the third because their lifespan is three years. Notropis buchanani spawn in rivers with sluggish sand or gravel riffles. In Tennessee, the spawning occurs in slow moving, silt covered gravel areas in the Stones River below the Walter Hill Dam or in the silty sand substrate of the Mississippi River in northwest part of the state. During the breeding season, males develop <b>nuptial</b> <b>tubercles,</b> particularly on the snout, internasal region, orbit, and underside of the lower jaw. The anterior pectoral rays are slightly thickened, and small blunt tubercles are densely packed along the dorsal surface of rays 2-6. For Notropis buchanani, the year of the young in October are on average 0.8” to 1.5” long. At one year, they are an average of 1.1” to 2.3 inches long, and as adults individuals grow to an average of 1.3” to 2.3” inches. The largest species of Notropis buchanani caught was recorded at a length of 2.6”.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} biology, ecology, and life-history styles of two closely-related redfin minnows, Pseudobarbus afer and P. asper (pisces; Cyprinidae), which both {{occur in the}} Gamtoos River system of South Africa. Five of the seven species of flexible-rayed redfin minnows are in the South African Red Data Book - Fishes. This {{investigation}} was designed to provide the data which would enable conservation authorities to manage the remaining populations of the Pseudobarbus species. A thorough understanding of the Gamtoos River system was necessary to properly interpret {{the findings of this}} study. The palaeo river systems and the changing climates since the break-up of Gondwanaland are discussed so that the present day environments could be considered as well as the past environmental changes. P. afer and P. asper occur in the Gamtoos River system with no physical barrier separating the two species. P. afer only occurs in the clear mountain streams of the Cape Fold Mountain Belt whereas P. asper occurs in the highly saline and turbid Karoo section of the system. P. afer were found to be the more precocial form of the sister species. They had bigger eggs, lower relative fecundity, shorter breeding season, lower gonadosomatic indices, larger first feeding larval fish, matured later and had a longer life-span than did P. asper, which had more altricial life-history attributes. They differ in their tradeoffs with P. asper devoting more resources earlier to reproduction and having a shorter lifespan. The improvement in the one aspect of fitness (early maturity) leads to the deterioration in another, namely lifespan. Both species undertake breeding migrations to riffle areas where they spawn in mid-channel immediately above a pool after an increase in water flow. P. afer and P. asper are non-guarders of their non-adhesive eggs and young, open substrate spawners on coarse substrates (rocks) and have photophobic free embryos. The breeding season is shorter for P. afer whereas P. asper can spawn as late as April and impoundment releases can induce them to spawn. A study of comparative neuroecology revealed that of the four groups of fish analyzed (males and females of both species) male P. afer had the largest brains, especially the optic lobes and cerebellum. P. asper females had the smallest brains. No neural compensation in the external gustatory centre, the facial lobe, was found for P. asper inhabiting the turbid waters. P. afer also had significantly larger eyes and longer barbels. P. afer males were also found to have the highest density and largest <b>nuptial</b> <b>tubercles</b> as well as the most pronounced breeding colouration. It was concluded that P. asper is the more derived of the sister species pair with regard to life-history attributes. It is further suggested that investment per offspring is important in determining the life-history trajectories. Paedomorphosis has occurred and by this mechanism variability has been restored to the redfin minnows in the Groot River which enables them to survive in the highly variable, intermittent Karoo stream. The more precocial P. afer do not require this variability in the more constant and predictable environment of the Wit River...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic {{receiving}} environments {{have long}} been used to dilute municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE) which are the largest discharge by volume into the aquatic environment in Canada. These treated effluents are a complex mixture of environmental contaminants that includes natural and synthetic hormones, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, nutrients and ammonia. Discharge of MWWE may lead to serious problems in aquatic environments such as eutrophication, hypoxia as well as increased occurrence of disease and toxicity in resident aquatic biota. Reproductive impairment in fish has also been widely reported in association with exposure to wastewaters. Recently, concerns have been raised {{about the potential for}} municipal effluents to cause endocrine disruption in fish and other organisms. The effects of MWWE on fish and fish populations in Canada are currently poorly understood. The overall objective of this thesis is to contrast the impact of MWWE discharged into two Canadian rivers on sentinel fish species across levels of biological organization ranging from biochemical responses to changes at the fish community level. Results from these studies support the development of robust effects-based biological monitoring approaches to assess the effectiveness of regulations and remedial actions for minimizing the effects of MWWE. Understanding the temporal changes in physiological and reproductive parameters across the annual cycle of a sentinel species is necessary to optimize biomonitoring programs. The annual variability in terms of survival, reproduction and energy storage in the Greenside Darter (Etheostoma blennioides), a potential sentinel species for the Grand River, Ontario, was documented at a reference site across two years. Variation in energy storage and reproductive development indicated by somatic indices (i. e., relative organ size) and steroid production suggest that biomonitoring can be optimized for this species by sampling in late fall or early spring (pre-spawning). With this new knowledge, field studies conducted with small bodied species, including Rainbow Darter (E. caeruleum), Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas) have demonstrated that, when sampled during the appropriate season (e. g., pre-spawning), they can be used as effective biomonitoring tools to detect fish responses associated with exposure to MWWEs. Two sentinel fish species, Rainbow Darter and Greenside Darter, were then used to examine the impact of two MWWE discharges on fish in the Grand River, Ontario, relative to reference sites in two seasons (fall and early spring). Fish responses, in terms of energy storage (condition factor, liver size), energy utilization (gonadosomatic indices) and reproduction (in vitro sex steroid production, cellular development and intersex) were assessed at each site. Both sentinel species were longer and heavier downstream of the wastewater outfalls. However, these larger fish did not demonstrate consistent increases in condition and liver somatic indices. MWWE-exposed male Rainbow and Greenside Darters had impaired capacity to produce androgens in vitro, lower gonadosomatic indices and altered sperm cell staging. Exposed female fish also had impaired capacity to produce estrogens in vitro, however, they did not demonstrate differences in oocyte development. Male Rainbow and Greenside Darters collected downstream of both MWWE discharges showed increased incidence of intersex (33 - 100 %) in contrast to very low occurrences of this condition in upstream agricultural and urban reference sites. This increased incidence of intersex coincided with reductions in gonadosomatic indices and capacity to produce steroids, demonstrating the ability of MWWE to alter the reproductive systems of these fish. The fish communities downstream of the the MWWE outfalls demonstrated differences in abundance, diversity, and species composition when compared to reference sites. MWWE exposed sites had few of the darter species that dominate the fish community at reference sites. More mobile fish species such as suckers (Catostomidae spp.) and sunfish (Centrarchidae spp.) were more common downstream of the outfalls, with occurances becoming more pronounced downstream of the second sewage discharge. Wascana Creek, Saskatchewan, downstream of the wastewater treatment plant for the City of Regina can be up to 100 % treated municipal wastewater. Brook Stickleback and Fathead Minnow exhibited delayed spawning and altered gonadal development downstream of the wastewater outfall. Exposed male Fathead Minnows were feminized, having lower expression of secondary sexual characteristics (i. e., loss of <b>nuptial</b> <b>tubercles,</b> dorsal pad, and dorsal fin dot) and induction of the female egg-yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin. Fathead Minnows also showed cellular damage to the gills and kidneys. These responses indicate exposure to a variety of environmental contaminants in the effluent such as ammonia as well as endocrine disruptors. The potential effect of MWWE discharges in these two Canadian watersheds on fish responses was demonstrated across various levels of biological organization including reduced sex steroid production, altered gonadal development, reduction in gonadosomatic indices, delayed spawning, and changes in fish assemblages. An effects-based monitoring approach using sentinel species can be successfully applied to detect changes associated with MWWE outfalls, as long as sampling of sentinel species is conducted during optimal time periods (i. e., when somatic indices are maximized and variability among individuals is minimized). MWWE can impair the reproductive potential of fish beyond a threshold where impacts are expressed at higher levels of organization such as populations or communities. It is essential to make mechanistic linkages between responses at different levels to determine the overall potential impact of effluents on fish. The collection of responses across multiple levels of biological organization can complement and support development of biomonitoring approaches that are focused at the population and community levels such as those being proposed for MWWE in Canada...|$|R
