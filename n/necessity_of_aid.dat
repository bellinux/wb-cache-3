40|$|This quantitative, {{descriptive}} study {{focuses on the}} effectiveness of the various services available for military families from the perspective of Rhode Island military residents. A review of the literature outlines the major stressors of the military lifestyle. The services available to help military families deal with these stressors are analyzed in the study. Five Rhode Island military families participated in this study. Results revealed overall satisfaction with the resources available through the military itself, dissatisfaction with services available through other areas, such as schools, churches, or organizations, the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> during the reintegration experience, the minimal usage of the services available to military families, the need for aid when going through a problem with a child, and effectiveness of the services that are used. Implications from this study include the need for future research on the potential reasons as to why these services are used so infrequently and for such a limited amount of time. More research also needs to be done about what military families need specifically during the reintegration period, especially since the War on Terror {{is coming to an end}} and many service members will be returning home soon. This study proved the effectiveness and necessity for services to remain in action to help the service members and their families that sacrifice so much for the good of the United States...|$|E
40|$|La tesis central de este artículo presenta a la enfermería como una relación humana entre un paciente y una enfermera, mediante {{la cual es}} posible reconocer y {{responder}} a la necesidad de ayuda y al problema del paciente. La reflexión está fundamentada en el pensamiento de Hildegard Peplau, quien construyó un modelo de cuidado para enfermería que plantea cómo en las relaciones interpersonales con los pacientes, la enfermera puede acercarse a los significados que éstos asignan a la enfermedad, a los comportamientos y a los sentimientos, para incorporarlos al cuidado y ayudarlos a dirigir sus potencialidades hacia formas útiles para sobrellevar sus dolencias. En la práctica profesional, la autora del artículo ha observado la forma en que los estados de inconciencia, la sedación obligatoria o la intubación endotraqueal, llevan a muchos pacientes hospitalizados en la unidad de cuidados intensivos, a tener interferencias en la comunicación con el entorno; esto suprime los símbolos para interpretar el ambiente y para actuar en consecuencia. Tanto la propuesta teórica como la experiencia profesional, permiten concluir que si los pacientes no tienen una interrelación eficaz con el entorno y con los enfermeros, se requiere que éstos los valoren integralmente para proponer alternativas de cuidado sustentadas en conocimientos científicos sólidos, habilidades prácticas y alto grado de sensibilidad humana para alcanzar la interpretación de la condición del paciente y ayudarlo a satisfacer sus necesidades básicas de bienestar. The aim of {{this article}} displays the nursing like a human relation between a patient and a nurse, by means {{of which it is}} possible to recognize and to respond to the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and to the problem of the patient. The reflection is based on the thought of Hildegard Peplau, who constructed a model of nursing care about the interpersonal relations with the patients, which the nurse can approach the meaning that patients assign to the disease, to the behaviors and the feelings, in order to incorporate them to the care and to help them to lead their potentialities towards useful forms to bear its illness. At the professional practice, the author of this article has observed the form in which the unconsciousness, the obligatory sedation or the endotraqueal intubations, take to many patients hospitalized in the intensive cares units, to have interferences in the communication with the surroundings; this aspects suppresses the symbols to interpret the atmosphere and to act consequently. The theoretical proposal like the professional experience, they allow to conclude that if the patients do not have an effective interrelation with the surroundings and the nurses, it is required that the nurses value them integrally to propose sustained alternatives of care in solid scientific knowledge, abilities practical and stop degree of human sensitivity to reach the interpretation of the condition of the patient and for helping it to satisfy its basic necessities with well-being...|$|E

60|$|I am {{disposed}} {{to think that}} Mrs. Butler Cornbury did Mrs. Tappitt an injury when she with so much ready goodnature accepted the invitation for the party, and that Mrs. Tappitt was aware of this before {{the night of the}} party arrived.

Mrs. Tappitt was a good wife, who never ran her husband into debt, and kept nothing secret from him in the management of her household,--nothing at least which it behoved him to know. But she understood the privileges of her position, and could it have been possible for her to have carried through this party without extra household moneys, or without any violent departure from her usual customs of life, she could have snubbed her husband's objections comfortably, and have put him into the background for the occasion without any inconvenience to herself or power of remonstrance from him.

40|$|Resumo: Procurou-se inicialmente, desvelar a necessidade da disciplina de socorros de urgência dentro do currículo da educação física (EF). Foram apontadas questões que demonstram a relação entre atividade física e a ocorrência de acidentes provenientes dessa prática. A importância de um atendimento correto e seguro foi destacada por estudos que comprovam a eficiência e eficácia de socorros de urgência no contexto da EF. Assim, o presente estudo procurou identificar o {{panorama}} da disciplina de socorros de urgência, a partir de quatro cursos de EF, com docentes de diferentes formações (medicina, enfermagem, fisioterapia e educação física) e, ainda, checou-se os conhecimentos absorvidos através de cinco profissionais formados por cada um desses docentes. Nesse sentido, é utilizada no trabalho uma pesquisa qualitativa a partir do estudo de caso, considerando os programas dos docentes alocados e, ainda, a aplicação de questionário aos profissionais por eles formados e que atuam no mercado de trabalho. Os resultados encontrados possibilitaram o entendimento de que a disciplina encontra-se fragilizada por diferentes aspectos, demonstrando a necessidade de revisão programática, aumento da carga horária e maior relação dos conteúdos com a área da educação física. É sugerido finalmente um programa para a disciplina de socorros de urgência nos cursos de EF, visando não só a superação do panorama encontrado, mas que venha suprir e responder às necessidade e demandas do mercado de trabalho desse profissionalAbstract: First of all, it {{was shown}} the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> first <b>aid</b> training in the Physical Education curriculum.

Therefore, this study searched to identify the scenery <b>of</b> the first <b>aids</b> training, from four Physical Education Courses with professors of different areas (medicine, nursery, physiotherapy and physical education) and also, it was checked the knowledge absorbed through five professionals graduated by any of those professors.
