5|$|James Clark {{was born}} to Robert and Susannah (Henderson) Clark on January 16, 1779, near the Peaks of Otter in Bedford County, Virginia. In 1794, {{the family moved to}} Clark County, Kentucky, where Clark was educated by Dr. James Blythe (who later became a {{professor}} at Transylvania University) and attended Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. Clark then went to Virginia, where he studied law with his brother, Christopher. He was admitted to the bar in 1797. He briefly traveled to Vincennes, Indiana and St. Louis, Missouri {{looking for a place to}} open his practice, but finding <b>none</b> <b>that</b> suited him, he returned to Kentucky and commenced practice in Winchester.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} men present at the battle is disputed. A major factor in this {{is the fact that}} no primary sources give the {{number of men}} present at the battle, which leaves modern historians to {{estimate}} the number of men. Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus' army as 30,000, while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim that the size of the Rus' army was 80,000.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81. de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20,000, while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23,000 men.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 118. However, historian John Fennell, an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history, and one well-versed in the primary sources, calls many of these figures into doubt, saying the numbers given in the Russian sources (there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources, at least <b>none</b> <b>that</b> have survived, and other sources from other cultures, if they exist, are rather dubious) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves. The information given in the Novgorod First Chronicle and the Primary Chronicle would imply a total of 11,000 soldiers for the Rus' forces, but Fennel considers even these numbers to be exaggerations. While Russian historians in the Soviet era have traditionally given estimates of around 80,000-100,000, modern Russian historians have taken a revisionist stance with a consensus settling on drastically lower numbers, with the Mongols having a numerical advantage. Russian historian D.G. Khrustalev estimated in 2013 that the Rus' army consisted of 10,000 soldiers (including mercenaries), while the Cumans brought 5,000 cavalry, for a total of 15,000.Khrustalev, p. 416 Carl Sverdrup estimates the army at 8,000, and says 30,000 and 80,000 are enormous exaggerations. The Mongols evidently believed it was a considerable force, given the extreme lengths the Mongols went to dislocate its formations.|$|E

Louis Kronenberger says that Shaw [...] "turns Chekhov {{into a sort}} of literary Hyde Park soapbox dialectic for the theatre...We should be brow-beaten indeed to accept the idea that in Heartbreak House there is more than the merest hint or tiny reflection of Chekhov's true method, <b>none</b> of <b>that</b> pure, pains-taking economy and drawing, <b>none</b> of <b>that</b> humility of vision, <b>none</b> of <b>that</b> shy certainty of intuition.

Meanwhile, Velocity wasted nearly three hours at the start {{trying to come up}} with a strategy, and while Ruth's sub-team performed well, Jo's sub-team wasted even more time by bargaining for items in shops that did not have them in stock, and failing to purchase the tyre required, resulting in a fine that cost them victory.|$|E

However, Grosse Ile on the U.S. side and Bois Blanc (Boblo) Island on the Canadian side have permanent populations.

For unknown reasons at an uncertain date, he crossed the Alps, soon taking up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches, where he taught for three years with conspicuous success. But in 1042 he embraced the monastic profession in the newly founded Bec Abbey. Until 1045 he lived at Bec in absolute seclusion.|$|E

500|$|In all, the Confederate {{artillery}} barrage on both flanks completely {{failed to}} achieve its objectives. Confederate fire did manage to kill Capt. John E. Beam of the Union's 1st New Jersey Artillery, {{along with a few}} others, and several Federal batteries (though <b>none</b> <b>that</b> were actually engaged) had to move to avoid the fire. Although the barrage by Lee's forces did claim a few lives, Union forces remained unfazed and continued their fearsome barrage. Indeed, Union Army Lt. Charles B. Haydon supposedly fell asleep during the artillery fight. On both the left and right flanks, several of the batteries that did engage lasted no more than minutes before being rendered incapable of fire. Moreover, in a failure of command that, according to historian Thomas M. Settles, must ultimately be placed on Lee's shoulders, the movements of the two flanks were never coordinated with one another. D. H. Hill found the failure of the Confederate artillery discouraging and later dismissed the barrage as [...] "most farcical".|$|E
500|$|In 1649, {{during the}} English Civil War, Parliament {{published}} {{a series of}} orders to reform the Court. Most were from the doctrines set out by Francis Bacon as Lord Chancellor, {{but there were some}} more modern reforms: counsels to the defendants could deliver pleas, rather than defendants in person, thus saving the cost of a Commissioner of Oaths, and cases were to be heard in the order they were accepted by the court. Parliament also fixed the fees that officers could charge, in an attempt to reduce the expense of a case. The following year, Parliament appointed a commission to look at court reform; this made many recommendations, but <b>none</b> <b>that</b> directly affected the Chancery. In August 1653 another debate took place in Parliament, lasting two days, in which a paper titled [...] "Observations concerning the Court of Chancery" [...] was circulated; this concerned the costs, workings, and officers of the Court. A second paper was given out, [...] "for the regulation or taking away of the Court of Chancery, and settling the business of Equity according to the original and primitive constitution of it; and for taking away all unnecessary fees, offices and officers and formalities now used, and for the speedy dispatch of business".|$|E
