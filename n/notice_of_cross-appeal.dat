40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination. The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.

5000|$|According to The New York Times, cases {{involving}} so-called sovereign citizens pose [...] "a challenge {{to law enforcement}} officers and court officials" [...] {{in connection with the}} filing <b>of</b> false <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> liens—a tactic sometimes called [...] "paper terrorism". Anyone can file a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> lien against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity of liens is not investigated or inquired into at the time <b>of</b> filing. <b>Notices</b> <b>of</b> liens (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating, ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. <b>Notices</b> <b>of</b> releases of liens generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity of a lien is determined by further legal procedures. Clearing up fraudulent <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> liens may be expensive and time consuming. Filing fraudulent <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> liens or documents is both a crime and a civil offense, a tort.|$|R

Furthermore, because the Act had come into operation on July 16, 1976,—that is, after the judgment in the court a quo—the relevant provision was inapplicable. The application, accordingly, was refused.|$|R
