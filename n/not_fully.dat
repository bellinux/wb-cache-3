5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim.

This did <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E
