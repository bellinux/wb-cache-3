Direct conversion of particle energy to thrust is theoretically simpler, merely requiring magnetically directing a <b>neutral</b> <b>plasma</b> beam. Present lab production of relativistic 5 MeV positron-electron beams mimic on a small scale the relativistic jets from compact stars, and allow small scale studies how different elements interact with 5 MeV positron-electron beams, how energy is transferred to particles, the shock effect of GRBs, and possible direct thrust and electricity generation from neutral plasmas. Lab positron-electron plasmas could be useful for studying compact star jets and other phenomena.

The coupling of the external electromagnetic field with the tower of quasi-normal modes of the plasmas supports the presence of various electromagnetic modes with different properties.

40|$|Abstract. Results of the {{modelling}} of {{a series}} of tokamak discharges with the fast central response to the boundary plasma perturbations of different nature are presented. The main attention is attended to the behaviour of the <b>neutral</b> <b>plasma</b> component which propagation time across the plasma column is sufficiently short (less than 100 µs) owing to the effect of multiple charge exchange. It is shown that the effects under consideration can be explained without the assumption on the non-local character of transport processes in tokamaks and may be attributed to the behavior of the <b>neutral</b> <b>plasma</b> component. In particular, the rapid electron temperature rise in the plasma core after the fast L-H mode transition {{can be explained by the}} reduction of the cold electron source and charge exchange losses caused by the decrease of neutral flux in plasma. An opposite effect of fast drop of the core electron temperature after deuterium pellet injection (faster that the pellet penetration) may be explained by the rise of deuterium atom density in the plasma core induced by charge exchange. Increase of the electron temperature in the central region of plasma in the experiments with impurity laser ablation can be attributed to the decrease of neutral density in the plasma core due to the drop of the characteristic energy of warm neutrals from the boundary and associated reduction of their penetration. Thus, the <b>neutral</b> <b>plasma</b> component can be responsible for the visible coupling of the plasma edge and the core in considered experiments at least during the time interval just after the edge plasma perturbations. 1...|$|E
