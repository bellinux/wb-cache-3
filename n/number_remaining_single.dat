40|$|The {{neutralization}} of type 1 poliovirus by {{monoclonal antibody}} 35 - 1 f 4 was studied. The virions were rapidly linked by antibody into oligomers and larger aggregates, followed by slow redistribution of antibody between the immune complexes. The antibody content and infectivity of immune complexes were determined. <b>Remaining</b> <b>single</b> virions were fully infectious {{and free of}} antibody. The oligomers and larger aggregates did not significantly contribute to the residual infectivity, which therefore correlated with the <b>number</b> of <b>remaining</b> <b>single</b> virions. Papain digestion of neutralized poliovirus released fully infectious, antibody-free virions from the immune complexes. Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies reneutralized these virions. Polymerization was shown to occur even at virus concentrations of less than 10 (3) PFU per ml...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} several censuses in China, {{including}} the newly released 2010 data, this study constructs net nuptiality tables as an analytical instrument to descriptively analyse {{the shape of}} China’s first marriage pattern from 1982 to 2010, including the age-specific probabilities of first marriage, the percentage of <b>remaining</b> <b>single</b> by age, and <b>number</b> of years <b>remaining</b> <b>single</b> by age {{for both males and}} females. Our analysis reveals that while age-specific probabilities of first marriage have significantly declined for females during the past three decades, such probabilities for males have declined much less. The percentage <b>remaining</b> <b>single</b> below age 30 has increased up to 2010. At age 50 the proportion is 4. 6 percent for males, while that for females is just one percent. Patterns of singlehood have also changed at younger ages, with an ever increasing period of singlehood, especially for males...|$|R
