25|$|The {{most recent}} album, Listen, {{includes}} much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums I made I <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about rhythms, I {{focused on the}} recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|E
25|$|Lopez {{was growing}} {{surrounded}} by shoes and everything related to shoe production. Her observations {{and attention to}} the techniques gave her deep knowledge of the shoe construction and design concepts. Later, in the interview for the Spanish Magazine Surrealista, Lopez admitted that she was always attracted by art and creative process but she <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> to work neither in the shoe industry nor in fashion.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{after the}} release of the American {{animation}} movie Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and other DreamWorks members visited the city of Chengdu. In addition to seeing live pandas, crew members learned about the local culture. Katzenberg has stated that Kung Fu Panda 2 incorporates many elements of Chengdu in the film. The film's landscape and architecture also found inspiration from those found at Mount Qingcheng, a renowned Taoist mountain. In an interview with Movieline, Berger stated that ‘we <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of this as a movie set in China for Americans; it's a movie set in a mythical, universalized China for everyone in the world'.|$|E

I create pictures using tightly cropped symbolic figurative imagery. I also leave smudges, smears, and traces {{of what happened in}} the making of the work to make process more visible. In my work I would like you to consider what you see and what you don’t see, to smile in recognition of something you might <b>never</b> have <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about before. And when I really get it right, you might even question your own feelings concerning the content...|$|R

"It {{would be}} nothing," [...] he resumed, turning round again and {{lowering}} his hammer, [...] "if you hadn't always protested {{that you would}} never marry, but--oh, Jessie, I wonder at a girl who has always been so firm in sticking to her resolves, turning out so fickle. I <b>really</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that the family of Macnab could be brought so low through one of its female members." ...|$|R
25|$|Akira Yamanaka {{was born}} in Yokohama, Japan, on September 2, 1946. He {{grew up in a}} family of seven children, though the only one of mixed descent as his father was a US Army soldier of Caribbean descent. In his autobiography, he {{mentions}} that he never met his biological father and that he came from a poor family in ruined Yokohama; being born in a brothel as his mother was a prostitute for the Recreation and Amusement Association. The only knowledge of his father was that he was a US soldier from either Cuba or Jamaica. Joe grew up in an orphanage after his mother and stepfather died. During an interview with Mainichi Shimbun, Akira stated that he was born with tuberculosis and that he <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about his biological father, believing those who raise you are your real parents.|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} debut for the Trinidad and Tobago {{national}} team on 29 January 2003 in a match against Finland. Jones scored his first goal on 25 May 2005 in a 4–0 win against Bermuda. He was later selected by Trinidad and Tobago for their 2006 World Cup campaign, {{where he made}} his first appearance in the competition in a 2–0 defeat against England on 15 June 2006 at Frankenstadion, Nuremberg. Jones was named as Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation's Player of the Year for 2007. Jones said, [...] "A lot of big names have won this before and I <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about something like this happening to me". Jones was named as captain of the Soca Warriors in August 2011 by manager Otto Pfister.|$|E
500|$|Cunningham sees A Handful of Dust as a {{forerunner of}} Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic novels. In keeping with Waugh's dismissive {{attitude}} to the Church of England, Anglicanism is shown as a farce (Mr Tendril the vicar's sermons), or a nullity (Tony's admission {{that he had}} <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> much about God). Instead, Christianity is evoked by presenting the awfulness of life without it; according to the writer and critic Frank Kermode, [...] "he callousness of incident and the coldness of tone work by suggesting the positive and rational declaration of the Faith". The reader, Stannard says, [...] "is never allowed to forget man's primal bestiality... God is the key that has been thrown away in this purely secular world". John Raymond in the New Statesman refers to Waugh's [...] "unique type of moral vision", and calls the novel a [...] "powerful twentieth century sermon on the breakdown of a Christian marriage".|$|E

My attention, from childhood, has been fixed upon this journey to the Soudan; and I never looked beyond it, nor did my mother discuss the future with me. Doubtless she would have done so, had she lived; and these papers I have may give me her advice and opinion about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ward {{described}} {{the show as}} a [...] "dark comedy" [...] and said he enjoys experiencing ambivalent emotions, such as {{the feeling of being}} [...] "happy and scared at the same time". He has also cited the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragonsof which many of the show's writers are devoteesas an inspiration for the show. Ward intends the show's world to have a coherent physical logic, and although magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in the characters' interactions with the world. In the United States, the series is rated TV-PG; Ward has said {{he does not want to}} push the boundaries of the PG rating, noting, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>really</b> even <b>thought</b> about the rating ... we don't like stuff that's overly gross. We like cute stuff and nice things." ...|$|R
60|$|Will was startled. Whatever {{the words}} might be, the tone {{seemed like a}} dismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way towards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange {{questioning}} gravity. Something was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to conjecture {{what was in the}} other. Will had <b>really</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of himself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held by Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand her present feeling.|$|R
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E

Kaline was named on 340 of the 385 ballots (88.3%) cast by sportswriters. Kaline and Duke Snider were the only candidates elected by the sportswriters in 1980. Kaline later said, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> I would choose an individual thing that happened just to me over a team thing like the World Series.

60|$|The fact was, Case {{and he had}} got {{after the}} same girl; or Maea {{suspected}} it, and concluded to make hay of the trader on the chance. He had dressed himself up, {{got a couple of}} his retainers cleaned and armed to kind of make the thing more public, and, just waiting till Case was clear of the village, came round to put the whole of his business my way. He was rich as well as powerful. I suppose that man was worth fifty thousand nuts per annum. I gave him the price of the beach and a quarter cent better, and as for credit, I would have advanced him the inside of the store and the fittings besides, I was so pleased to see him. I must say he bought like a gentleman: rice and tins and biscuits enough for a week's feast, and stuffs by the bolt. He was agreeable besides; he had plenty fun to him; and we cracked jests together, mostly through the interpreter, because he had mighty little English, and my native was still off colour. One thing I made out: he could <b>never</b> <b>really</b> have <b>thought</b> much harm of Uma; he could <b>never</b> have been <b>really</b> frightened, and must just have made believe from dodginess, and because he thought Case had a strong pull in the village and could help him on.|$|R
5000|$|Filming {{began in}} September 1942 and {{continued}} through to December. Jennings {{had decided that}} no professional actors would be brought in, and his entire cast consisted of untrained local people, although he was careful to ensure that nobody appeared on screen without giving their permission and that anyone who felt uneasy or uncomfortable about being filmed was excluded from shots. People were filmed going about their actual daily lives in a largely improvised manner with no script being provided. In {{a letter to his}} wife, he wrote: [...] "Down here I’m working on a reconstruction of the Lidice story in a mining community - but more important than that really is being close to the community itself and living and working inside it, for what it is everyday. I <b>really</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to live and see the honest Christian and Communist principles acted on {{as a matter of course}} by a large number of British - I won’t say English - people living together." ...|$|R
2500|$|Though {{the couple}} was popular, they were also controversial. Sosnovska was asked if she {{realized}} that by accepting this role she would be stepping into [...] "so much" [...] controversy. [...] "I’m still {{coming to terms with}} this phenomenon of Lianca," [...] she replied, [...] "with the devotion that I’m shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It’s horrible that even now in the 21st century [...] feel the need to hide. Not everyone is confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment." [...] She continued, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about it before--it doesn’t occur to you that this medieval type of mentality occurs. It’s horrifying what happens." [...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It’s frightening to the extent it’s a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can’t underestimate the force of it." ...|$|E
