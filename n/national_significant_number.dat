50|$|Following the Act of Free Choice {{plebiscite}} in 1969, West Papua {{was formally}} {{integrated into the}} Republic of Indonesia.

While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticized the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia support Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. 84 member states voted in favor for the United Nations to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining.

Even though the two respective sub-headings in the draft Constitutional Treaty (Article I, 46 and Article I, 47) have been omitted, the Intergovernmental Conference did not introduce any change in substance. Article 11 of the Reform Treaty pledges to give citizens and representative associations a voice 'in all areas of Union action', and to 'maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society', and it demands that the Commission 'carry out broad consultations with parties concerned {{in order to ensure that}} the Union's actions are coherent and transparent'. With Clause 4, it now also endows citizens with the right to initiate an action. However, first, that action is of one type only, i. e., 'where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties'. Second, that action is valid only when 'not less than one million citizens who are <b>nationals</b> of a <b>significant</b> <b>number</b> of Member States' engage in it.
