25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E
25|$|The season {{opens with}} the Conner women confronting {{the issue of}} {{pregnancy}}: Roseanne takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a job as waitress in the restaurant at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets Leon (Martin Mull) and Bonnie (Bonnie Sheridan). Jackie gets injured on the job, which results in her breaking up with her boyfriend Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy (Glenn Quinn); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father Ed and Crystal plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed's baby. Roseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy (Meagen Fay). Nana Mary (Shelley Winters) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While {{they are in the}} process of getting the business off the ground, Ziggy decides to leave because he doesn't want to feel responsible if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money for Dan to open it by himself. We <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> about him again.|$|E
25|$|In his What About Those Who Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So we were working on our second issue by the time I saw it. It {{was going to be a}} matter of somehow trying to restage the entire first issue, because it was a very similar coma opening.

500|$|In February 2011, McGuinness {{said that}} the album was almost {{complete}} and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent {{was no longer the}} likely title. The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll <b>Never</b> <b>Hear.</b> Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... we have to do what we do best and we have to focus on that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that." [...] Guetta clarified that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono.|$|E
500|$|Over time, {{the album}} {{continued}} to be delayed. In April 2010, U2's manager Paul McGuinness confirmed that the album would not be finished by June, but indicated that a release [...] "before {{the end of the}} year [...] increasingly likely." [...] In October 2010, Bono stated that their new album would be produced by Danger Mouse, and that 12 songs had been completed. He also noted that U2 were working on a potential album of club music in the spirit of [...] "U2's remixes in the 1990s". Around the same time, McGuinness said the album was slated for an early 2011 release. In February 2011, he said that the album was almost complete and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent was no longer the likely title.

500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life.

500|$|Although widely acclaimed, {{the album}} has been censured by some. It was voted the worst record ever {{made in a}} 1998 Melody Maker poll of pop stars, DJs and journalists. Among the harshest detractors was {{musician}} and journalist John Robb, who described the album as [...] "the benchmark of 1967 – the low water point of rock 'n' roll". In a scathing appraisal of the record prior to its 40th anniversary in 2007, Guardian critic Richard Smith wrote that it is [...] "if not the worst, then certainly the most overrated album of all time". He {{also said that the}} [...] "excruciating" [...] LP was often ranked by members of the music press as the best ever due to affection for its cultural impact, and [...] "not because of anything intrinsically great about the record". Asked in 2007 to nominate the [...] "supposedly great" [...] album he would [...] "gladly <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> again", artist and writer Billy Childish named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, saying that it [...] "signalled the death of rock 'n' roll". Musician and author Bill Drummond, in a 2010 publication, called the record [...] "the worst {{thing that ever happened to}} music". In 2015, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards denounced the album as [...] "a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like Satanic Majesties".|$|E
500|$|Walton's {{next major}} {{composition}} was the massive choral cantata Belshazzar's Feast (1931). It {{began as a}} work on a modest scale; the BBC commissioned a piece for small chorus, orchestra {{of no more than}} fifteen players, and soloist. Osbert Sitwell constructed a text, selecting verses from several books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. As Walton worked on it, he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow, and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival, to be conducted by Malcolm Sargent. Walton later recalled Beecham as saying, [...] "As you'll <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> the work again, my boy, why not throw in a couple of brass bands?" [...] During early rehearsals, the Leeds chorus members found Walton's music difficult to master, and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt. The first performance was a triumph for the composer, conductor and performers. A contemporary critic wrote, [...] "Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification for feeling that a great composer had arisen in our land, a composer to whose potentialities it was impossible to set any limits." [...] The work has remained a staple of the choral repertoire.|$|E

500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost <b>never</b> <b>hear</b> anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E
