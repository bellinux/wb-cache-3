5|$|Smalls Paradise had <b>no</b> <b>cover</b> {{charge and}} stayed open {{longer than most}} of the others, {{including}} the Cotton Club. At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve a seat at the club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} 27 February 1814 saw a light frost, but {{the ground was}} not frozen. At 8:30 am the 4th Division {{assaulted}} Taupin's soldiers at Saint-Boès. The initial rush seized the church which stood on a separate hill. The brigade of Robert Ross swept through Saint-Boès but was repulsed by the battery on the Plassotte knoll. When his soldiers fell back into the village, Cole brought up a KGL battery to duel with Taupin's guns. The battery immediately became {{the target of the}} French batteries on the Plassotte and Luc knolls; two guns were knocked out and Captain Frederick Sympher was killed. Cole deployed José Vasconcellos' Portuguese brigade on Ross' right and sent his line forward again. The result was a second repulse in which Ross went down with a wound. The subsequent counterattack by Taupin's troops recovered part of Saint-Boès. For a time there was a lull as the two sides fired away at each other from the houses, but Vasconcellos' men had <b>no</b> <b>cover</b> and began to edge backward. Wellington sent over the 1st Caçadores Battalion from the Light Division. Cole's line collapsed just as the reinforcement arrived. Taupin recovered the entire village and drove the Allies back to their starting point. Ross' brigade suffered 279 casualties and Vasconcellos' brigade lost 295.|$|E

25|$|On May 12, the German 1st Cavalry Division {{tried to}} cross the Afsluitdijk. However, at Kornwerderzand, the Dutch had built modern {{concrete}} fortifications to protect the dam.

The <b>No.</b> 3 <b>cover</b> set is composed of two versions of “Never Can Say Goodbye” performed by different singers. Both of them include main melody performed by female singer, and the accompaniment in these two tracks is weak when compared with the vocal sound. In this circumstance, the MLD descriptor performs better than the HPCP descriptor.

If they stayed on the air transmitting for more than 20 minutes, their signals {{were likely to be}} picked up by the enemy, and detection vans would trace the source of these suspect signals. When the operator moved location, the bulky transmitter had to be carried, sometimes concealed in a suitcase or in a bundle of firewood.

25|$|The {{ground in}} front was convex in shape, giving <b>no</b> <b>cover</b> and no forward {{observation}} points, while the ground from front and flank was swept by well-placed German and Ottoman machine guns and several field batteries. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was held up by Asim's German and Ottoman defenders on Hill 3039 which dominated the mounted rifles' position and {{made it difficult to}} advance, but by 16:00, the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment and the 4th Battalion Imperial Camel Corps Brigade had, managed to advance their line for a distance of , to the low ridges at the foot of Hill 3039. Rain was still falling and it was bitterly cold; supply of rations and forage caused some concerns and darkness found most of the attacking force in much the same positions they had held that morning.|$|E

25|$|As day broke, the Tigris Corps {{found itself}} {{advancing}} through a heavy fog. On left bank, Younghusband's brigades began their {{advance in the}} mid-morning. Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades paused in their movements to break for lunch. At midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through the rest of the afternoon, Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With <b>no</b> <b>cover</b> on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E
25|$|At first all firing was {{at close}} range; half the Indian men {{were killed or}} wounded before {{they had a chance}} to get off any shots. Some of the Indians grabbed rifles from the piles of confiscated weapons and opened fire on the {{soldiers}}. With <b>no</b> <b>cover,</b> and with many of the Indians unarmed, this lasted a few minutes at most. While the Indian warriors and soldiers were shooting at close range, other soldiers used the Hotchkiss guns against the tipi camp full of women and children. It is believed that many of the soldiers were victims of friendly fire from their own Hotchkiss guns. The Indian women and children fled the camp, seeking shelter in a nearby ravine from the crossfire. The officers had lost all control of their men. Some of the soldiers fanned out and finished off the wounded. Others leaped onto their horses and pursued the Indians (men, women, and children), in some cases for miles across the prairies. In less than an hour, at least 150 Lakota had been killed and 50 wounded. Historian Dee Brown, in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, mentions an estimate of 300 of the original 350 having been killed or wounded and that the soldiers loaded 51 survivors (4 men and 47 women and children) onto wagons and took them to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Army casualties numbered 25 dead and 39 wounded.|$|E

500|$|At {{midnight on}} 18 May the Turkish troops {{opened fire on}} the {{regiment}} until 03:30, then left their trenches and charged the mounted brigade, concentrating on the Auckland Mounted Rifles. The Turkish attackers were engaged by the regiment's machine-guns with enfilade fire and the attack petered out at dawn, leaving hundreds of Turkish dead. Both sides continued shooting {{at each other with}} artillery and small arms fire. At 13:25 General Alexander Godley, commanding that section of the beach-head, ordered the regiment to counter-attack the Turkish trenches at [...] "The Nek".
