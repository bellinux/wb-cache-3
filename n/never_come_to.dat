5|$|Smith {{was born}} as Frank Wenham in Tonbridge, Kent, on 9 June 1885. He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, {{a member of}} a {{prominent}} local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his domestic servants, Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would <b>never</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know. Considered an embarrassment by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland. From 1899 to 1901, he studied at Bedales School, where he developed his lifelong hobby of book binding, before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in Kendal until 1906.|$|E
5|$|The Nine Queries, as {{they came}} to be called, focused on the divine right (jure divino) of church government. While the presbyterian divines were capable of {{defending}} their vision for church government as established by divine right in the Bible, they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the Assembly and weaken their case in Parliament. In July 1647, the New Model Army invaded London and conservative members of Parliament were forced out. Parliament passed an ordinance establishing religious tolerance and ensuring that the Assembly's vision of a national, compulsory presbyterian church would <b>never</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition. In London, where support for presbyterianism was greatest, presbyteries were established in only sixty-four of 108 city parishes, and regional presbyterian classes were only formed in fourteen of England's forty counties. A planned national general assembly never met. Many presbyterians did, however, establish voluntary presbyteries in what was a de facto free church situation until the Restoration in 1660, when a compulsory episcopal system was reinstated.|$|E

5|$|Tom Mankiewicz {{completed}} a script titled The Batman in June 1983, focusing on Batman and Dick Grayson's origins, with the Joker and Rupert Thorne as villains, and Silver St. Cloud as the romantic interest. Mankiewicz took {{inspiration from the}} limited series Batman: Strange Apparitions, written by Steve Englehart. Comic book artist Marshall Rogers, who worked with Englehart on Strange Apparitions, was hired for concept art. The Batman was then announced in late 1983 for a mid-1985 release date on a budget of $20 million. Originally, Mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for Batman, William Holden for James Gordon, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, and Peter O'Toole as the Penguin, whom Mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature. Holden died in 1981 and Niven in 1983, so this would <b>never</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pass. A number of filmmakers were attached to Mankiewicz' script, including Ivan Reitman and Joe Dante. Reitman wanted to cast Bill Murray as Batman and Eddie Murphy as Robin. Nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers. Most of them were based on Strange Apparitions. However, it was Mankiewicz's script that was still being used to guide the project.|$|E

25|$|A {{major change}} was the {{introduction}} of television in 1956.

Nonetheless, {{he was unable to}} stem the tide of public opinion, and the Broadcasting and Television Act (1956) allowed for television in Australia {{just in time for the}} 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. The addition of television caused a spurt of growth at the ABC, as staff numbers grew from 2,000 in 1956 to 3,000 in 1960, while the budget doubled from ₤3.7 million to ₤7.4 million.|$|E

25|$|Spring Heeled Jack (known {{alternatively}} {{for a time}} as Spring Heeled Jack U.S.A.) is a {{third wave}} ska band based out of New Haven, Connecticut. The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist Ron Ragona and drummer Dave Karcich in 1991. After a short breakup, Ragona and Karcich reformed the band with a new lineup. This lineup went on to record two albums before announcing a hiatus in 2000. While the band members moved on to perform in several new bands, their intention was to play the occasional reunion show. This plan would <b>never</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition as a cerebral aneurysm would be cause for Karcich's death in 2002. In 2015, several band members returned to reform the band full-time. A third studio album, Sound Salvation, followed in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of the New 52 Superman, Luthor decides to assume Superman's symbol in a new suit of battle-armour (apparently powered by a Mother Box) to protect Metropolis, but he is confronted by the pre-Flashpoint Superman, who refuses to believe that Luthor's {{intentions}} are as noble as he claims. This results in a brief conflict between the two, Luthor claiming that Superman's 'unprovoked' attack proves that he is an impostor while Superman counters that Luthor's brutal response proves him right, but the fight is cut short when Doomsday apparently emerges. Despite Superman's uncertainty about Luthor and Luthor's own beliefs about Superman, Superman convinces Luthor to help him by focusing on evacuating civilians while he deals with Doomsday due to his greater experience. After the crisis is over, Superman talks with Luthor and agrees to let him continue acting as a hero using his logo when Superman concedes that he has no clear evidence that this Luthor has any criminal activity. Luthor is later attacked by an alien warrior who attacks people who, according to visions of the future he receives, will go on to commit various acts of death and violence, but Superman appeals to them to let Luthor free by arguing that the future is always changing and he will do his best to ensure that the dark future they foresaw for Luthor will <b>never</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pass.|$|E
