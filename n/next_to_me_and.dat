According to Keane, Petraeus was shot [...] "accidentally, {{standing}} right <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I had to fight to save his life. He had a hole {{about the size of}} a quarter in his back and is gushing with blood, and we stopped the bleeding and got him on a helicopter and got him to a surgeon and so we were sort of bonded ever since that time." ...|$|E

[...] "I had (Gordon) cleared," [...] Logano said. [...] "I should have pulled {{down in front of}} him. He got <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I couldn't get away." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the first}} music rehearsal, {{or rather the}} first time the music was played over to us by Sullivan at the piano we arrived at Dick Dauntless's [...] "Parlez vous" [...] song. [...] After playing it over Sullivan said [...] "That's your song, Lely." [...] Gilbert {{happened}} to be seated <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I said quite innocently [...] "It sounds as though a hornpipe should follow." [...] Gilbert grunted. [...] Nothing more was said or thought [...] at least by me [...] about the matter. [...] A few days later at rehearsal Gilbert, without any preamble, said [...] "Lely, can you dance a hornpipe?" [...] I was rather taken aback, as I had quite forgotten having spoken about one. [...] So, trying to be funny I suppose, I said [...] "Well, Mr. Gilbert, as the man said when asked if he could play the fiddle, I've never tried so I don't know." [...] Gilbert answered quite seriously [...] "How soon can you know?" [...] and I said equally seriously [...] "To-morrow".|$|E
2500|$|Jane Kowalski's {{call was}} placed by {{cellphone}} at 6:30p.m. {{while she was}} driving on U.S. Route 41. [...] "I was at a stoplight and a man pulled up <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> there was a child screaming in the car", she said. [...] She explained further that she heard [...] "terrifying screaming" [...] {{and that she had}} [...] "never heard anything like that". [...] Kowalski believed that she was witnessing a child abduction. [...] She also identified the car as a Camaro but stated the color as blue (rather than green). [...] She stated that she had made eye contact with the driver after which [...] "a hand came up and started banging on the passenger window". [...] Since she had crossed the county line into Charlotte, the call was routed to Charlotte County's 9-1-1 call center. [...] It was only after she saw the news the following day that she realized she had witnessed the abduction of Lee rather than that of a child. [...] When she called the North Port Police Department to explain who she was and that she had made a 9-1-1 call, it became apparent that the call had not been forwarded to the correct authorities. [...] It is this call that is alleged to have been mishandled {{due to the fact that}} the operatives neglected to file it correctly. [...] This call was also presented by the state prosecutors as part of the key evidence at King's trial.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} that {{to complete the}} story I introduced several other leopards, a mother and two three-part-grown cubs, also a wounded buffalo, and told how Mr. Scroope finished them off {{one after the other}} with a hunting knife. The thing was to watch his face as the history proceeded. Luckily he was sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I could kick him under the table. It was all very amusing, and very happy also, for these two really loved each other. Thank God that I, or rather Brother John, was able to bring them together again.|$|E

6000|$|We first spliced the main-brace {{and then}} got our suppers, eating between the guns, where we {{generally}} messed, indeed.

[...] Tom went down and got the rug, which was an article for the camp that he had laid hands on, and it made us a capital bed-quilt. As all hands were pretty well tired, we lay down, with our heads on shot-boxes, and soon went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Dinner {{was soon}} announced, and I had the honour of leading in Miss B., who looked back rather angrily, I thought, at Captain Fizgig, because that gentleman had offered {{his arm to}} Mrs. Brough.

I think he lives in Capel Street, and has an ugly fine wife in a fine coach. Dr. Freind and I dined in the City by invitation, and I drank punch, very good, but it makes me hot. People here are troubled with agues by this {{continuance}} of wet, cold weather; but I am glad to find the season so temperate. I was this evening to see Will Congreve, who is a very agreeable companion.|$|R

As for the men who denounced me, they were small men, and I had no fear of them in a fight, unless; as I thought likely enough, they might have pistols. One of them is the fellow whose jaw I broke; I hit him hard, for he had a pistol in his hand." ...|$|E
60|$|Dirck, and I {{were near}} enough to reach our glasses, at need. My mother was <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{reasonably}} close; for I did not smoke, while aunt Mary and Kate had taken post just without {{the influence of the}} tobacco. On the shore was a large skiff, that contained a tolerably sized trunk or two, and a sort of clothes-bag. In the first were a portion of my clothes, while those of Jaap filled the bag. The negro himself was stretched on the grass, about half-way between the tree and the shore, with two or three of his grandchildren rolling about, at his feet. In the skiff was his son, seated in readiness to use the sculls, as soon as ordered.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very important, Dick, {{and will}} {{probably}} change all our plans. Travancore is in alliance with us, and every one thinks that Tippoo's attack on it will end in our being engaged in war with him. I {{was talking to the}} officer who sat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> he told me that, {{if there had been a}} capable man at the head of government here, war would have been declared as soon as the Sultan moved against Travancore. Now that General Meadows had been appointed governor and commander-in-chief, there was no doubt, he said, that an army would move against Tippoo in a very short time--that it was already being collected, and that a force was marching down here from Bengal.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} startled on hearing his voice, loud in anger. In {{the fear that}} {{something}} serious had happened, she left her room to make inquiries, and saw Helena on the landing of the flight of stairs beneath, leaving the study. After waiting till my sister {{was out of the}} way, Selina ventured to present herself at the study door, and to ask if she could be of any use. My father, walking excitedly up and down the room, declared that both his daughters had behaved infamously, and that he would not suffer them to speak to him again until they had come to their senses, on the subject of Mr. Dunboyne. He would enter into no further explanation; and he had ordered, rather than requested, Selina to leave him. Having obeyed, she tried <b>next</b> <b>to</b> find <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> had just looked into the dining-room to see if I was there, when she was frightened by the sound of a fall in the room above--that is to say, in the study. Running upstairs again, she had found him insensible on the floor and had sent for the doctor.|$|R
6000|$|Went to my box at Covent Garden to-night; and my {{delicacy}} felt {{a little}} shocked at seeing S----'s mistress (who, to my certain knowledge, was actually educated, from her birth, for her profession) sitting with her mother, [...] "a three-piled b----d, b----d Major to the army," [...] in a private box opposite. I felt rather indignant; but, casting my eyes round the house, in the <b>next</b> box <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>next,</b> and the next, were the most distinguished old and young Babylonians of quality;--so I burst out a laughing. It was really odd; Lady----divorced--Lady----and her daughter, Lady----, both divorceable--Mrs.----, in the next the like, and still nearer------! [1] What an assemblage <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> who know all their histories. It {{was as if the}} house had been divided between your public and your understood courtesans;--but the intriguantes much outnumbered the regular mercenaries. On the other side were only Pauline and her mother, and, <b>next</b> box <b>to</b> her, three of inferior note. Now, where lay the difference between her and mamma, and Lady----and daughter? except that the two last may enter Carleton and any other house, and the two first are limited to the opera and b----house. How I do delight in observing life as it really is!--and myself, after all, the worst of any. But no matter--I must avoid egotism, which, just now, would be no vanity.|$|R
60|$|Besides this, I {{observed}} that the men made no scruple to set themselves out, and to go a-fortunehunting, as they call it, when they had really no fortune themselves to demand it, or merit to deserve it; and that they carried it so high, that a woman was scarce allowed to inquire after the character or estate of the person that pretended to her. This I had an example of, in a young lady in the <b>next</b> house <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> with whom I had contracted an intimacy; she was courted by a young captain, and though she had near #2000 to her fortune, she did but inquire {{of some of his}} neighbours about his character, his morals, or substance, and he took occasion at the <b>next</b> visit <b>to</b> let her know, truly, that he took it very ill, and that he should not give her the trouble of his visits any more. I heard of it, and I had begun my acquaintance with her, I went to see her upon it. She entered into a close conversation with <b>me</b> about it, <b>and</b> unbosomed herself very freely. I perceived presently that though she thought herself very ill used, yet she had no power to resent it, and was exceedingly piqued that she had lost him, and particularly that another of less fortune had gained him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Philip Lefrank, {{this is my}} overlooker, Mr. Jago," [...] {{said the}} old man, {{formally}} presenting us. [...] "John Jago, this is my young relative by marriage, Mr. Lefrank. He is not well; he has come over the ocean for rest, and change of scene. Mr. Jago is an American, Philip. I hope you have no prejudice against Americans. Make acquaintance with Mr. Jago. Sit together." [...] He cast another dark look at his sons; and the sons again returned it. They pointedly drew back from John Jago {{as he approached the}} empty chair <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> moved round to {{the opposite side of the}} table. It was plain that the man with the beard stood high in the father's favor, and that he was cordially disliked for that or for some other reason by the sons.|$|E
60|$|He {{came and}} sat down again <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> my {{attention}} wandered. The q-b was raging for her dinner. It must be quite half-past eight. The kid, the perfect kid would be cold and ruined. Both fire and candle were burning low. Someone had been out for a new candle, but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire. The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers. He had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand. The girovago, blond, round-faced, mature and aggressive with all his liveliness, {{was more like a}} northerner. In the background were four or five other men, of whom I had distinguished none but a stout soldier, probably chief carabiniere.|$|E
60|$|It was {{our first}} dinner, and dressed by our new cook, Munseer Cordongblew. I bore it very well; eating, for my share, a filly dysol allamater dotell, a cutlet soubeast, a pully bashymall, and other French dishes: and, for the frisky sweet wine, with tin tops to the bottles, called Champang, I must say that me and Mrs. Coxe-Tuggeridge Coxe drank a very good share of it (but the Claret and Jonnysberger, being sour, we did not much relish). However, the feed, as I say, went off very well: Lady Blanche Bluenose sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> being so good as to put me down for six copies of all her poems; the Count and Baron von Punter {{engaging}} Jemimarann for several waltzes, and the Field-Marshal plying my dear Jemmy with Champagne, until, bless her! her dear nose became as red as her new crimson satin gown, which, with a blue turban and bird-of-paradise feathers, made her look like an empress, I warrant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{him on the}} Subway {{a couple}} of days before I left New York. You know how crowded the Subway is at the rush hour. I had a seat, of course, but this poor little fellow--so good-looking, my dear! he {{reminded}} me of the pictures of Lord Byron--was hanging from a strap and being jerked about till I thought his poor little arms would be wrenched out of their sockets. And he looked so unhappy, as though he had some secret sorrow. I offered him my seat, but he wouldn't take it. A couple of stations later, however, the man <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> got out <b>and</b> he sat down and we got into conversation. There wasn't time to talk much. I told him I had been down-town fetching an elephant-gun which I had left to be mended. He was so prettily interested when I showed him the mechanism. We got along famously. But--oh, well, it was just another case of ships that pass in the night--I'm afraid I've been boring you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{history of}} the {{expedition}} is not well known, however it appears that their plan was to sail to Etah and hire local Inuit to help them reach the Pole. While stopping at the Carey Islands in Baffin Bay to pick up supplies at a cache there, the Ripple was driven on shore and wrecked. The men attempted to sail a small sloop (also purchased in Newfoundland) back to Etah, but were forced {{to return to the}} Carey Islands.

60|$|But {{at such a}} time as this there‚Äôs {{always one}} person who seems {{interested}} in what I say‚Äîa German gentleman, a professor, who sits <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at dinner <b>and</b> whom I must tell you more about another time.
