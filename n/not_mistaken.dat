Thus passing to signal that one believes that there are no more useful moves may be conceived as simply being a convenient device to accelerate the end of the game – assuming one is <b>not</b> <b>mistaken.</b> The result will always be the same as if the game had been played out entirely.|$|E
25|$|Irish-register ships {{could fly}} the Red Ensign until September 1939, after the {{outbreak}} of World War II, when a decree under {{the state of emergency}} was made, to ensure neutral Irish ships were <b>not</b> <b>mistaken</b> for British ships. Some ships flying the tricolour were nevertheless sunk by Germans. When the tricolour was hoisted over the passenger ferries in Holyhead their British crews went on strike. Five days later their owners transferred the ferries to the British register and the Red Ensign was restored. On the other hand, the Belfast to Liverpool ferry, British owned and British crewed, used the tricolour as a flag of convenience; so did the whalers of Christian Salvesen Shipping, {{to take advantage of the}} Irish whale quota.|$|E

All three Wistert brothers wore number 11 for the Wolverines football team, and all three were All-Americans. Interviewed by The Detroit News in 2004, Alvin recalled: [...] "And if I'm <b>not</b> <b>mistaken</b> I think this is unprecedented in the annals of college football: that three brothers all would go to the same school, all played football. All played tackle, all wore the same number 11, all made All-American. Two of us played on four national championship teams. And all were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame." ...|$|E

500|$|The Act of February 21, 1853, {{that had}} {{lightened}} the silver coins also authorized a gold three-dollar piece, which {{began to be}} produced in 1854. To ensure that the three-dollar piece was <b>not</b> <b>mistaken</b> for other gold coins, it had been made thinner and wider than it would normally be, and Longacre put a distinctive design with an Indian princess on it. [...] Longacre adapted both the technique and the design for the gold dollar, which was made thinner, and thus wider. [...] An adaptation of Longacre's princess for the larger gold coin {{was placed on the}} dollar, and a similar agricultural wreath on the reverse. The idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in Congress as early as 1852, and had been advocated by Pettit, but Guthrie's desire for an annular coin stalled the matter. In May 1854, Snowden sent Guthrie a letter stating that the difficulties with an annular coin, especially in getting the coins to eject properly from the press, were more than trivial.|$|E
500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is <b>not</b> <b>mistaken,</b> I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm <b>not</b> <b>mistaken.</b> We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

2500|$|The book in {{question}} was Milton's Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, {{and it is possible}} that the polygamy comment is in reference to rumours of Milton's pursuit of Miss Davis. This rumour continued to prevail, and Anne Sadleir, in a letter to Roger Williams in 1654, writes, [...] "For Milton's book that you desire I should read, if I be <b>not</b> <b>mistaken,</b> that is he that has wrote a book of the lawfulness of divorce; and if report say true, he had, at that time, two or three wives living." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geocaching {{is legal}} {{in every country}} except North Korea (where GPS devices and mobiles are illegal to possess) and is usually {{positively}} received when explained to law enforcement officials. However, certain types of placements can be problematic. Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Caches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g. near schools, children's playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could {{be mistaken for a}} drug stash or a bomb (especially in urban settings, under bridges, near banks, courthouses, or embassies). As a result, geocachers are strongly advised to label their geocaches where possible, so that they are <b>not</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a harmful object if discovered by non-geocachers.|$|E

2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was <b>not</b> <b>mistaken.</b> Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Their tutor Aristotle {{described}} friendship as [...] "...one soul abiding in two bodies". That {{they themselves}} considered their friendship {{to be of}} such a kind is shown by {{the stories of the}} morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus, Arrian and Curtius all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying [...] "You were <b>not</b> <b>mistaken,</b> Mother; this man too is Alexander." [...] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said [...] "...you know that Alexander means more to us than anything." [...] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as [...] "...the friend I valued as my own life." [...] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: [...] "Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego." ...|$|E

Snatching away the unfinished letter, he reads the words addressed not to Godvino but to Aroldo - [...] "I am no longer worthy of you" [...] - and realizes that he was <b>not</b> <b>mistaken.</b> [...] He begins to demand that Mina keep silent and ensure Aroldo's continued love (Duet: Dite che il fallo a tergere / [...] "You mean that your heart lacks the strength to wipe away your guilt?") while she further resists. [...] Again, demanding that she obey him, he continues to make his demands: (Duet: Ed io pure in faccia agl'uomini / [...] "And must I smother my rage....Must I conquer my shame?"). [...] Finally, Egberto repeats his demands that she relent: it is his will, it is her duty as a wife, she must stop crying, and no one must suspect anything.
