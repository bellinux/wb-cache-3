The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E

Retro Studios developed the storyline {{under the supervision of}} Yoshio Sakamoto, who verified that the ideas were consistent with the lore of the earlier games.

Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities".

500|$|Keats's {{use of the}} odal hymn in his six odes, {{along with}} {{his use of the}} odal hymn with a responsal voice in [...] "Ode to a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", created, {{according}} to Walter Jackson Bate, [...] "a new tone for the English lyric." [...] Bate, when speaking about the 1819 odes, wrote: [...] "The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer. Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning. It was rather a matter of becoming more alive in preparation for the next beginning." [...] In addition to this, Bate argued that [...] "It is because [...] "To Autumn" [...] is so uniquely a distillation, and at many different levels, that each generation has found {{it one of the most}} nearly perfect poems in English. We need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of continuing to use the adjective [...] The 'Ode to a Nightingale,' for example, is a less 'perfect' though a greater poem." [...] Charles Patterson argued the relationship of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats, [...] "The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of [...] "To Autumn" [...] but is much superior in these qualities to the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Later, Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] drew neither attention nor admiration. Herbert Grierson believed [...] "Nightingale" [...] to be superior to the other odes because it and [...] "To Autumn" [...] were more logical and contained stronger arguments. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
