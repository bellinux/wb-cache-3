60|$|The Good Venture had, {{flying the}} Dutch flag, joined Boisot's fleet at Romerswael, {{a few miles}} below Bergen, on the 27th of January; and when the Hollanders became aware <b>of</b> the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> which had just joined them, they welcomed them with {{tremendous}} cheers. Two days later the fleet of Romero were seen coming down the river in three divisions. When {{the first of the}} Spanish ships came near they delivered a broadside, which did considerable execution among the Dutch fleet. There was no time for further cannonading. A few minutes later the fleets met in the narrow channel, and the ships grappling with each other, a hand to hand struggle began.|$|R
60|$|Wallace {{now seemed}} a little ashamed, the sang froid of the other {{throwing}} dust in his eyes, {{and he was in}} a hurry to change the subject. Se¤or Don Juan was very civilly condoled with again, and he was made to repeat the incidents of the loss, as if his auditor took a deep interest in what he said, but no further hint was given touching the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b> The lieutenant's tact let him see that Se¤or Montefalderon was a person of a very different calibre from Spike, as well as of different habits; and he did not choose to indulge in the quiet irony that formed so large an ingredient in his own character, with this new acquaintance. He spoke Spanish himself, with tolerable fluency, and a conversation now occurred between the two, which was maintained for some time with spirit and a very manifest courtesy.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{formerly}} denoted fleets of both {{commercial and}} military nature. In modern usage [...] "navy" [...] used alone always denotes a military fleet, although the term [...] "merchant navy" [...] {{for a commercial}} fleet still incorporates the non-military word sense. This overlap in word senses between commercial and military fleets {{grew out of the}} inherently dual-use nature of fleets; centuries ago, nationality was a trait that unified a fleet across both civilian and military uses. Although <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> commercial <b>vessels</b> has little importance in peacetime trade other than for tax avoidance, it can have greater meaning during wartime, when supply chains become matters of patriotic attack and defense, and when in some cases private vessels are even temporarily converted to military vessels. The latter was especially important, and common, before 20th-century military technology existed, when merely adding artillery and naval infantry to any sailing vessel could render it fully as martial as any military-owned vessel. Such privateering has been rendered obsolete in blue-water strategy since modern missile and aircraft systems grew to leapfrog over artillery and infantry in many respects; but privateering nevertheless remains potentially relevant in littoral warfare of a limited and asymmetric nature.|$|R

50|$|When a {{crime is}} {{committed}} outside {{the territory of}} any country, such as in Antarctica, on watercraft in international waters, on aircraft in international airspace, and on spacecraft, jurisdiction is usually determined by the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> defendants or victims, or by the flag state <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b> This {{is determined by the}} admiralty law of the countries involved and in international agreements.|$|R
40|$|Caşın, Mesut Hakkı (Dogus Author) [...] Conference full title: Symposium on the Straits Used for International Navigation : 16 - 17 November 2002, Ataköy Marina, Istanbul, TurkeyDuring {{the last}} century, Turkish Straits {{witnessed}} {{two world wars}} and, following them, the Cold War tension between the NATO and Warsaw Pacts just near {{the coast of the}} magnificent blue waters. Also, just a decade ago the terrible Soviet Black Sea Armada was the main threat 1 for NATO Alliance security strategies around these waters. But today, NATO has signed important agreements with Russia, the ex-arch-enemy of the Alliance which formulated (19 + 1) new security relationship and cooperation, also ongoing friendly common exercises with Black Sea riparian states naval fleets 2 and Black Sea rapid deployment forces. Nowadays they are ready for humanitarian missions to protect democratic humanitarian ideas. All these tremendous peaceful steps exchange legal and security aspects of Turkish Straits in an optimistic dimension. However, up to 1, 500 ships a day sail through the Bosphorus, Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles Straits that links the Mediterranean and Black Seas off the coast of habitat of more than ten millions people in Turkey. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, an increasing energy transport has been aimed at taking the pressure off these strategic waterways that link the Caspian Sea oil and gas resources to the world market. 3 Indeed, as Dana MUNRO stressed the Russians were the first to import petroleum to Germany in 1883 from rich Russian wells in Baku. According to this, German oil market demand jumped up from 300. 000 tons to 755. 199 tons in 1911, creating a big competition between Russia, Austria, Romania, and the USA, 4 just before the "Great Game" oil operation in the region.

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{the international}} legal regime which regulates the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> both a physical and a legal person. The authors discuss the juridical nature <b>of</b> <b>nationality,</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a res and of humans, and reflect upon the recent sale by states <b>of</b> their <b>nationality</b> to non-citizens thereby shifting human nationality {{closer to the}} commodification <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> which ships are a traditional instance. It concludes that <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> ships and of humans has in some legal systems {{moved away from the}} classical International Court of Justice’s Nottebohm case requirement of a pre-existing genuine link to one where nationality is reduced to a commodity...|$|R
50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> either spouse, nor shall a change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a married woman was no longer dependent on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.|$|R
