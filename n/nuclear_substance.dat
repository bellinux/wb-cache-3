In the former I {{did not get a}} good result, but I found that the phage growth was accelerated in a high degree in the latter, and consequently this report was written. First, I defibrinierted the 2 cc. blood of cook and tortoise, and made the bloodsuspension by ordinary method and then centrifuged it; added distilled water to the blood-corpuscle after the centrifugation, oscillated, mixed well, and demolished the protoplasm by distilled water. As soon as the white nucleus is suspended uniformly, physiological salt, water is added to it in a large quantity; dissolving the pure dregs which were obtained after severaltimes of centrifugation in 5 cc. salt water, I presented the same substance that was completely solved for experiment. Then I dyed and microscoped it, and noticed thickly dyeing nucleus as well as a large number of fine granular substance dottes arround it. The strength of colibacteriophage as contrast was 10 (- 3), but it rose to 10 (- 27) when the nucleus and <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance</b> of cock was added to it so that it might he diluted same as the first. Moreover, the strength of phage rose to 10 (- 20) in the filtrate of this nucleus and <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance.</b> In regard to nucleus and <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance</b> of tortoise, the strength of phage was not so strong as cock, but it rose to 10 (- 14) When I heated the nucleus and <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance</b> of cock bloodcorpuscle in the water bath, the degree of growth facility decreased together with the heat, and it seemed that the effect of growth facility is lostt almost at 100 - 120 °C.

The progress of the degenerative changes in each megakaryocyte is not necessarily uniform even in the same medium conditions, and these megakaryocytes present varied features. 2. The duration in which megakaryocytes can carry on their functions in a simple culture medium is 90 hours at most in the case of human and up to 48 hours in the case of guinea pigs; and the peak of their activities is reached 18 to 30 hours after the culture in the case of human, and 15 to 18 hours in the case of guinea pigs. 3. It has been confirmed that tentacle-like processes indicative of platelet formation can be observed only when megakaryocytes are most actively moving. 4. The mottled appearance due to multiple small areas or so-called platelet separation of megakaryocytes as observable in the bone-marrow smear is due to the degenerative changes or artificial products of megakaryocytes and it is in no way associated with the mechanism of the platelet separtion. 5.

40|$|Abstract Since Flemming {{described}} a <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance</b> {{in the nineteenth}} century and named it “chromatin, ” this sub-stance has fascinated biologists. What is the structure of chromatin? DNA is wrapped around core histones, forming a nucleosome fiber (10 -nm fiber). This fiber has long been assumed to fold into a 30 -nm chromatin fiber and subsequent-ly into helically folded larger fibers or radial loops. However, several recent studies, including our cryo-EM and X-ray scat-tering analyses, demonstrated that chromatin is composed of irregularly folded 10 -nm fibers, without 30 -nm chromatin fibers, in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes. This irregular folding implies a chromatin state that is physi-cally less constrained, which could be more dynamic com-pared with classical regular helical folding structures. Consis-tent with this, recently, we uncovered by single nucleosome imaging large nucleosome fluctuations in living mammalian cells (∼ 50 nm/ 30 ms). Subsequent computational modeling suggested that nucleosome fluctuation increases chromatin accessibility, which is advantageous for many “target searching ” biological processes such as transcriptional regu-lation. Therefore, this review provides a novel view on chro-matin structure in which chromatin consists of dynamic and disordered 10 -nm fibers...|$|E

40|$|Changes in both {{external}} form and internal arrangement of nuclear material {{have been investigated}} in the differentiation of the sperm of the pulmonate snail, Otala lactea. Sperm head differentiation begins with a flattening of the previously spherical nucleus and a thickening of the nuclear envelope covering the anterior and posterior surfaces of that nucleus. Tail filaments {{can be seen in}} the cytoplasm at this time. At a slightly later period the mitochondria begin to form the tail filament sheath and at this time the nucleus begins to elongate in a direction parallel to the future axis of the sperm. At the same time the nuclear material begins to orient itself at right angles to the nuclear surface which lines the pit occupied by the centriole. As nuclear elongation proceeds, this orientation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance</b> takes on the appearance of 60 A thick sheets bent in a direction parallel to the sperm axis.

40|$|Root tip meristems were stained to {{demonstrate}} ATPase activity by two different methods, with general agreement in localization but not specificity, and {{with emphasis on}} mitotic cells. In interphase, ATPase was localized in nucleoli and nuclear membranes, with lesser activity in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance.</b> In prophase, chromosomes were outlined by ATPase stain which gradually declined in intensity at prometaphase, becoming least evident in metaphase. Staining activity increased again in anaphase, and remained high in telophase. In prometaphase, ana-phase and late anaphase-early telophase, the ATPase was concentrated in a fibril which appeared to coil around the chromosomes. The ATPase fibril was thinnest at metaphase and shorter and thicker at telophase. In addition, granules farmed {{in association with the}} coils of the fibril in late anaphase and early telophase. Later on, these granules may have fused and contributed to nucleolar reformation. The ATPase never localized in the chromosomal fibre nor in any other region of the spindle. RNA generally localized like ATPase, but ATPase loci were unchanged after ribonuclease (RNase) treatment. Because of certain similarities between ATPase and argentaffin localization, some relationship between the nucleolus and ATPase is suggested.

40|$|The unique {{reticulum}} in the {{basal membrane}} {{of the adult}} newt's skin consists {{of a series of}} nodular swellings from which there radiate fibers. Electron micrographic studies showed that the nodules consist of layers of fibrillae arranged approximately and irregularly at right angles to one another. Some are packed to form a capsule; still others extend into the internodular zone to form the radiating fibers. The fibrils are banded and are revealed best after fixation with potassium permanganate. The retieulum is compared with that of the larval newt and the frog tadpole. The epidermal side of the reticulum is bounded by a membrane separated from the plasma wall of the epidermal cell by a clear space. These we have termed adepidermal membrane and space, and have compared them with similar structures in larvae.

In PET this substance is tagged with a radioactive isotope, such as Carbon- 11, Fluorine- 18, Oxygen- 15. This substance has also chemical and biological properties that enable to visualize metabolism and functions of patient organs (such as blood flow). This substance, called radiotracer, emits a positron per decay. The positron annihilates with an electron, which results in the emission of two opposite gamma rays detected in a PET system. Thanks to detectors surrounding the patient and a powerful electronic processing, coincident photon pairs can be sorted, meaning that the emission occurred on the line joining both detectors.

This general approach has been used in working out solutions for the isolation of mt liver nuclei; and a buffered salt-sucrose mixture has been found in which nuclei are optically similar to those within intact liver cells (4).

40|$|Nuclear {{condensation}} during spermiogenesis in the ostrich {{follows the}} basic pattern established in other vertebrates. The fine granular <b>nuclear</b> <b>substance</b> of early spermatids is gradually replaced by numbers of coarse dense granules which appear to arise by aggregation of smaller dispersed {{elements of the}} chromatin. The granules increase in size and eventually coalesce to form the compact homogenous mass of chromatin typical of the mature sperm. In ostrich spermatids, however, the aggregation of the nuclear material produces large numbers of longitudinally oriented rod-shaped structures in addition to some granular material. Although fibrillar chromatin has been observed during spermiogenesis {{in a number of}} vertebrate species, the hollow nature of the rod-shaped chromatin granules in ostrich spermatids is a unique phenomenon. The spiralisation of the chromatin material observed in ostrich spermatids and in some other nonpasserine birds is possibly related to the reduction in nuclear length demonstrated during spermiogenesis in these species. In common with other nonpasserine birds, spermiogenesis in the ostrich is characterised by the appearance both of a circular and a longitudinal manchette. The circular manchette consists of a single row of microtubules reinforced by additional peripherally arranged microtubules. Links between adjacent microtubules, and between the nucleolemma and some of the microtubules, are evident. The longitudinal manchette consists of arrays of interconnected microtubules arranged in approximately 4 – 6 staggered, ill defined rows. This structure seems to originate {{as a result of the}} rearrangement of the microtubules of the circular manchette and is only formed once the process of chromatin condensation is well advanced. Based on the sequence of morphological events observed during spermiogenesis in the ostrich, it is concluded that the circular manchette is responsible for the initial transformation in shape of the spermatid nucleus. Thereafter, the chromatin condenses independently within the confines of the nucleolemma with the circular manchette merely acting to maintain the shape of the nucleus while this process is underway, to compress the nuclear membrane, and possibly to orientate the subunits of the condensing chromatin. The longitudinal manchette appears to assist in the translocation of material during spermatid elongation. There are indications that the developing acrosome is instrumental in effecting nuclear shaping of the apical (subacrosomal) head region of the ostrich spermatid...|$|E
