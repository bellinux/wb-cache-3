40|$|Nonylphenol (NP), an {{anaerobic}} {{breakdown product}} of a widely used nonionic surfactant <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> (NPEO), is currently of environmental concern because of its toxicity, estrogenic properties and widespread contamination. Nonylphenol has been detected in surface and ground water, sediments, aquatic organisms, wastewater effluent, air, and human food. Although concentrations of NP are typically low, the potential risk to human populations and ecosystems at these concentrations is still unclear and is a topic of considerable debate. A {{better understanding of the}} fate and transport of NP and its parent compound, NPEO, is needed for determining the associated risk to the environment and human health posed by these compounds. This paper presents a critical review of the literature and issues related to NP in the environment, including the associated gaps, conflicts and research needs in this area. The similarities and differences between NP and historical contaminants of interest such as PCBs and current contaminants such as pharmaceuticals are noted, as is the need for analyzing the life cycle of chemicals in the environment prior to widespread use.

Pervasive usage of chemicals generates micropollutants throughout the environment. Anaerobic environments in particular accumulate {{high levels of}} hydrophobic micropollutants, and {{it is estimated that}} over 200 metric tons of micropollutants are discharged with biosolids each year. It is important to understand how treatment processes impact the fate of micropollutants as well as understand how micropollutants impact microbiological communities so that environmental risks can be minimized. This research elucidated the impact of an emerging treatment process, thermal-hydrolysis coupled to mesophilic anaerobic digestion (TH-MAD), on the fate of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> as well as the impacts of triclosan and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) on methanogenic community structure and function. The TH-MAD process inhibited biodegradation of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> to <b>nonylphenol</b> relative to MAD with no pretreatment. Indeed, the ratio of nonylphenol to the sum of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> + <b>nonylphenol</b> only increased by 24. 6 ± 3. 1 % in TH-MAD reactors compared to a 56 % increase following MAD treatment. While post-aerobic treatment did reduce the sum of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> + <b>nonylphenol,</b> and concomitantly reduced estrogenicity, this research implied that source control is likely the most efficient option for removing these micropollutants. Triclosan is another wide-spread micropollutant that is persistent under anaerobic conditions. Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent that could therefore impact environmental systems that rely on healthy functioning of microorganisms. Methanogenic communities with no previous exposure to triclosan were able to adapt to triclosan at environmentally relevant levels and maintain function. When previously-exposed communities were exposed to triclosan at 4 x current detected environmental levels, community structure shifted and methane production was inhibited. These levels of triclosan also selected for mexB, a gene that confers multidrug resistance, in previously unexposed communities. Lastly, PFOS was found to directly impact methanogenic communities and augment the impacts of triclosan in long-term exposure studies (140 days), but not in short-term (14 day) exposure studies...|$|R

40|$|An {{alkylphenol}} ethoxylate-degrading bacterium {{was isolated}} from activated sludge of a municipal {{sewage treatment plant}} by enrichment culture. This organism was found {{to belong to the}} genus Pseudomonas; since no corresponding species was identified, we designated it as Pseudomonas sp. strain TR 01. This strain had an optimal temperature and pH of 30 degrees C and 7, respectively, for both growth and the degradation of Triton N- 101 (a <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> in which the average number of ethylene oxide [EO] units is 9. 5). The strain was unable to mineralize Triton N- 101 but was able to degrade its EO chain exclusively.

By oxygen consumption assay, the alkyl group or arene corresponding to the hydrophobic part of alcohol ethoxylates or alkylphenol ethoxylates was shown to contribute to the induction of the metabolic system of the EO chain of Triton N- 101, instead of the EO chain itself, which corresponds to its hydrophilic part.

Igepal CO- 630 inhibited F 9 -D 79 cells from adhering to the interface, and cells grew dispersed in the aqueous phase as 0. 5 -μm cocci rather than 2. 5 -μm rods. The surfactant increased total petroleum hydrocarbon removal by strain JA 5 -B 45 from 4 to 22 % and included both saturated compounds and aromatics.

By adding alkali to the solution, the efficiency of the UV-enhanced ozonation increased with respect to COD reduction but decreased with respect to TOC reduction. This indicates partial oxidation with lower degree of mineralization of the surfactants...|$|E
40|$|At {{a time of}} {{increased}} concern about environmental issues in the building sector, {{it is essential to}} know the environmental performance of different building materials. Knowledge of the possible release of hazardous substances in building materials is scarce, and these aspects have often been neglected in environmental assessment methods. This research has studied the content and leaching behaviour of hazardous substances in concrete constituents and paints on wooden facades. The leaching tests for both materials were diffusion tests to study the time-dependent leaching, and availability tests to find the fraction that is available for leaching in the long term. The first part presents studies of concrete with additives of admixtures and industrial by-products such as slag and fly ash. The complex leaching process is studied both theoretically and in laboratory experiments. There {{was no significant difference in}} leaching of metals between the concretes with by-products and concrete with Portland cement. Each of the studied metals showed a unique leaching pattern. A new availability test instead of commonly used standard tests is proposed, when the purpose is to estimate the leaching during the service life of monolithic concrete. A different view of the leaching process and its changes over time is also presented. The leaching of concrete with admixtures containing thiocyanate, resin acids or <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> was also studied, because of their toxic character. Both the diffusion test and the availability test showed relatively high leached fractions. Two thirds of the total amount were leached from crushed concrete containing thiocyanate. Not only <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> but also nonylphenol was found in the leachate water  a more toxic, genotoxic and low-degradable substance. The results imply risks of using unspecified, crushed concrete in landfills. Part Two of this thesis presents leaching studies of biocides in wooden fa¸ade paint. Painted wood panels is a common fa¸ade cladding in Sweden, and microbiological growth in the paint is hampered by means of biocides. Panels in the field were exposed to natural rain, and both the run-off water and the surface analysis showed that considerable leaching from paint might occur Time-dependent leaching tests in laboratory environment gave lower leached amounts and a different behaviour than in the field study, which could be due to different climatic conditions and paint systems. A more aggressive, long-term availability test yielded profiles of the paint film with a non-steady-state condition, and clear signs of leaching about 30 - 50 % when comparing profiles before and after leaching. The profiles reveal that the biocide IPBC migrates not only towards the surface, but also into the wood...|$|E

Three types of surfactants, namely, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylate,</b> {{were used as}} templating agents. The effects of surfactant type and pH on the morphology, particle size, surface area, pore-size distribution, UV-Vis absorbance, and TiO 2 phase transformation were traced by SEM, TEM, BET, and XRD. In absence of surfactants, XRD revealed 54. 5 % anatase at pH 3 - 4 and 97. 0 % at pH 7 – 9. In presence of surfactant, phase transformation of anatase has been significantly inhibited such that anatase amounts to 82 – 100 % in acidic media. In basic media, the brookite phase appeared in low concentrations (8 – 15 %) while rutile totally disappeared. The photocatalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts was tested via naphthalene degradation, which exhibited high activity in visible irradiation (> 400 [*]nm). The data obtained indicate that the surface area and pore volume of the current catalysts are the most effective factors for photocatalytic performance. Nevertheless, at the low pH (acidic) range, the CTAB templated catalyst gave the highest surface area (86. 7 [*]cm 3 /g), which is mainly assigned to acquiring the highest photocatalytic degradation of naphthalene (97 % after 4 [*]h irradiation time) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA risk-based {{screening}} exercise {{was carried out}} to evaluate the significance of chemicals of emerging concern measured in water and sediment of the Great Lakes Basin. Chemical classes included pesticides, pharmaceuticals, organic wastewater constituents, <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates,</b> perfluorinated surfactants, chlorinated paraffins, synthetic musks and flame retardants. Maximum measured concentrations were compared to benchmarks selected or developed to reflect a conservative no-effect level and/or the lowest-effect level. These benchmarks reflected traditional effect information such as survival, growth and reproduction. From this analysis, several pesticides, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> were identified as potential concerns and needs for further work were identified. Five of these chemicals (all pesticides) were identified in waters of both the US and Canada (azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion and metolachlor). Chlopyrifos, malathion and metolachlor are still registered for use in both jurisdictions; diazinon is registered for use only in the US and azinphos-methyl is not registered for use in either jurisdiction, reflecting the persistence of these chemicals. The results of this {{screening exercise}} also were compared to those of several other studies, revealing some common chemicals. Although there are several uncertainties and data gaps in the benchmarks and monitoring data used in the current screening exercise, {{the results of this}} risk-based screening can be used by agencies for priority setting, program development, and to support ongoing collaborative research and monitoring programs...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Düşük köpürme özelliğine sahip, soğuk suda iyi çözünebilen ve bu özellikleri nedeniyle düşük konsantrasyonlarda bile etkili olan noniyonik yüzey aktif maddeler çok geniş bir kullanım alanına sahiptirler. Noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerden nonil fenol etoksilatlar kısa süre öncesine kadar yüzey aktif madde pazarının % 80 ‘ini oluşturan türler olarak bu pazarda ciddi bir paya sahiptiler. Sucul ortamda yarattıkları olumsuz etkiler anlaşılana kadar nonil fenol etoksilatlar kağıt, tekstil, deri, gıda, boya gibi bir çok endüstriyi kapsayan geniş bir yelpazede yaygın olarak kullanılmaktaydılar. Ancak 1990 ‘lı yılların başlarında endokrin bozucu ve toksik etkilerinin fark edilmesinin ardından nonil fenol etoksilatların yerine kullanılabilecek başka bir noniyonik yüzey aktif madde arayışına girilmiştir. Gelinen bu aşamada birinci alternatif olarak toksik etkileri bilinmeyen, yüksek biyolojik bozunurluğa sahip ve yüzey aktif madde olarak uygulamada nonil fenol etoksilatları ikame edebilecek nonil alkol etoksilatlar görülmektedir. Bahsedilen özellikleri nedeniyle nonil alkol etoksilatların üretimleri ve kullanımları gün geçtikçe artmakta ve yaygınlaşmaktadır. Her ne kadar bilinen herhangi toksik, kanserojenik veya mutajenik etkiye sahip olmasalar da, giderek artan miktarda üretilen ve kullanılan alkol etoksilatların arıtılabilirliklerinin araştırılması ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Literatürde alkol etoksilatların biyolojik olarak arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili gün geçtikçe artan sayıda araştırma yer almasına karşın söz konusu yüzey aktif maddelerin fiziko-kimyasal, elektrokimyasal ve fotokimyasal arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili sınırlı ve yetersiz sayıda araştırma mevcuttur. Bu çalışmanın amacı alkol etoksilatlara örnek teşkil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eter (Brij 30) ‘in 20 mg/L konsantrasyonundaki sulu çözeltilerinin koagülasyon, elektrokoagülsyon ve TiO 2 /UV-A fotokatalitik oksidasyon prosesleri esas alınarak fizikokimyasal ve kimyasal yöntemler ile arıtılabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve maksimum Brij 30 ve organik madde (TOK) giderimini sağlayacak en uygun proses reaksiyon koşullarının belirlenmesidir. Yukarıda belirtilen amaç doğrultusunda yürütülen deneysel çalışmadan elde edilen sonuçlar koagülasyon-flokülasyon ve çelik elektrotların kullanıldığı elektrokoagülasyon proseslerinin gerek Brij 30 gerekse organik madde gideriminde istenilen verimi sağlamadığını göstermiştir. İki farklı TiO 2 katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon deneylerinde Aeroxide PF 2 heterojen katalizörü ile yine istenilen düzeyde giderme verimleri elde edilememiştir. Buna karşılık Degussa P 25 TiO 2 heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon denemelerinde uygun reaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde gerek Brij 30 ‘un tamamı giderilmiş, gerekse % 90 civarında organik madde minerilizasyonu gerçekleştirilmiştir. Elde edilen bu sonuçlardan hareketle Degussa P 25 TiO 2 xvi heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak UV-A ışınımı altında alkol etoksilatları temsil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eterin sulu çözeltilerden uygun reareaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde etkin şekilde arıtılabildiği sonucuna varılmıştır. Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have low}} foaming properties, are highly soluble {{in cold water}} and are effective even in very low concentrations in water. Because of these advanteges, nonionic surfactants are widely used surface active substances especially in the industries such as leather, food, pulp and paper, cosmetics etc. <b>Nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> which used to dominate the surfactant market with a consumption rate of 80 %, {{have been the most}} preferred nonionic surface active compound. <b>Nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In early 90 ‘s the toxic and endocrine distrupting effects of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> in the aquatic environment have been revealed. Nonylphenol, a breakdown product of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates,</b> has been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen. Concerns have focused on the potential for <b>nonylphenol</b> and <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> to cause feminisation in wildlife, such as fish exposed to <b>nonylphenol</b> and <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> contaminated effluents, as well as being a potential factor in the increasing incidence of reproductive organ disorders and decreasing sperm counts in men. Whereas <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> is reasonably readily degradable, its breakdown product nonylphenol is more persistent. It has been determined that these compouns exhibit the estrogenetic activity by mimicing the hormones mentioned. Especially in the aquatic environment, fishes are the most affected organisms. It is known that <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> are also very slowly biodegredable and have bioaccumulating property. After realizing the adverse effects of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> in the environment, espacially in aquatic environment, several countries have been taken act by regulations restricting production and consumption of <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates.</b> It was necessary to replace <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> with another nonionic surface active agent. At this point alcohol ethoxylates seem to be the most appropriate alternative due to it‘s high biodegredability, low toxicity, high water solubility and surface active effectiveness. Alcohol ethoxylates are the second largest group of surfactants in terms of manufacture (after linear alkylbenzenesulphonates) and the main group of non-ionic surfactants. The main area of alcohol ethoxylate application is in the manufacture of washing powders, liquids etc. Alchol ethoxylates are classifed as easily biodegradable surfactants, in contrast to previously used oxyethylated alkylphenols or oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers. xviii However, the massive stream of alcohol ethoxylates directed into sewage systems and then to sewage treatment, is required strict control in order to prevent pollution of the aquatic environment. A very important chain in this control is the examination of the biodegradability of surfactants prior to their uses in washing powder formulations. After replacing <b>nonylphenol</b> <b>ethoxylates,</b> production and consumption of alcohol ethoxylates have rapidly increased. This progression brought on the requirement of knowlege on the treatability, biodegradability and toxicity properties of alcohol ethoxylates. There are several research on the biodegradability of nonyl alcohol ethoxylates, however there are very little information about the chemical treatablity of these compounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the treatability of alcohol ethoxylates in aqueous solutions by coagulation, electrocoagulation and TiO 2 /UV-A photocatalitic oxidation processes and to determine the optimum process conditions for the most effective treatment process. As a model nonyl alcohol ethoxylate compound poly(oxyethylene) (4) loryl ether, Brij 30 was selected to be used in the experiments. This study consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter, the purpose and scope of the study was described briefly. In the second chapter, classification of surfactants, properties of surfactants, a brief explanation about toxicity of nonylphenol ethoxyltes, properties of alcohol ethoxylates and treatability of alcohol ethoxylates were defined. In the third chapter, fundamentals of coagulation and electrocoagulation were defined. Basic chemicals‘ reactions which occur during these processes were explained. In the fourth chapter, photochemical oxidation process was described, the fundamentals and basic reactions were explained. The factors which effecting photocatalitic activity were also explained in the end of the chapter. In the fifth chapter, the materials and methods were introduced which were used during the experimental part of the thesis. Since three different processed were used, three different treatment methods were explained. These processes were: classical coagulation-floculation process, electrocoagulation process and TiO 2 catalized photocatalitic oxidation process. For every process the same analytical analysis were applied to the sampes in order to follow the treatment efficiency such as colourimetric surfactant determination and TOC analysis. In the sixth chapter all of the experimental results were evaluated and discussed. In the last chapter of the study the results were briefly evaluated and the most important results were stressed by the explanation of importance. In this experimental study, three different chemical treatment alternatives were evaluated and it was determined that only one of them was suitable to treat model pollutant, Brij 30 compound from its aqueos solution. The first alternative was classical coagulation-flocculation process derived in different coagulant (FeCl 3) concentrations varing between 100 and 1000 mg/L, in pH 6. 5 and 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentration. In this process the least Brij 30 removal was observed with 25 % Brij 30 removal in 100 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage and the highest Brij 30 removal efficiency was achieved with 39 % in 750 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage. These results showed that coagulation-floculation process was not practical for removing Brij 30 from its aqueous solution. xix The second process was electrocoagulation process using stainless steel electrodes and NaCl as electrolyte. Electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6), various NaCl concentrations (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg NaCl/L) and two different current densities (9, 3 and 18, 6 mA/cm 2). When experimental results were evaluated; in 500 mg/L NaCl concentration, current density of 18, 6 mA/cm 2 after 180 minutes 70 % of Brij 30 removal was achieved. In the coagulation-flocultion experiments there was no significant removal result neighter in Brij 30 nor in TOC. The last but the most effective process was photocalalytic oxidation using TiO 2 as catalyst under UV-A radiation. In this experiments firstly two different TiO 2 types (Degussa P 25 and Aeroxide P 2) were compared and it was proved that Degussa P 25 was significantly more effective than Aeroxide P 2 in removing Brij 30 and TOC. The experiments were conducted in 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentrations, in two different pH (original pH ~ 6 and pH= 3) to determine the effect of initial pH, in two different TiO 2 concentrations (1 and 1. 5 g/L) to determine the effect of TiO 2 dosages and for the selected test periods (5, 10, 15, 60, 240, 480 minutes). The aim of experiments were to determine the optimum process terms. In these experiments that in the original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6) and 1 g/L Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage after 15 minutes more than 96 % Brij 30 removal was obtained. Under these experimental conditions only after 240 minutes 64 % TOC removal was achieved. After increasing the Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage to 1. 5 g/L, after 480 minutes of photocatalitic oxidation TOC removal increased to 86 %. In general after decreasing the pH to 3 resulted in decreases the Brij 30 removal efficiencies. The experimental results showed that coagulation-floculation and electrocoagulation processes were not suitable effective treatment methods in removing Brij 30 from aqueous solutions. Additionally very limited organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of TOC could be obtained by appliying these processes. The most effective process was photocatalitic oxidation under UV-A radiation from the three different processes. By using photocatalitic oxidation it is possible to remove practically all of the model pollutant and most of the TOC from the water under mentioned conditions. Even in short reaction periods (15 minutes) high rates of Brij 30 removals are achieved but longer experiment periods (240 - 480 minutes) are needed in order to reach significant TOC removals.
