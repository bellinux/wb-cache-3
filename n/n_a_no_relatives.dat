40|$|AbstractUltra short laser pulses are used, when high {{requirements}} concerning machining quality are demanded. The cost- effectiveness {{plays an}} important role for a successful transfer of this technology into industrial applications. Therefore systems with longer ps-pulses could offer an attractive alternative compared to short ps- and fs systems. Beside fiber based systems with ∼ 50 ps pulse durations also small systems with sub-ns pulses are available today. In contrast to the dramatic drop of the material removal rate when the pulse duration is raised from 10 ps to 50 ps the impact is weaker for a further increase to 540 ps and the removal rate even increases when the pulse duration is raised to 1. 4 <b>ns.</b> <b>As</b> <b>no</b> crater formation is observed and the surface quality is better than for 1. 4 ns pulses, sub-ns pulses could be an attractive alternative to machine steel compared to fiber based systems with ∼ 50 ps pulse duration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} {{the roles of}} information from optic flow and body senses (eg vestibular and proprioceptive information) for path integration, using a triangle completion task in a virtual environment. In two experiments, the contribution of optic flow was isolated by using a joystick control. Five circular arenas were used for testing: (B) both floor and wall texture; (F) floor texture only, reducing information for rotation; (W) wall texture only, reducing information for translation; (<b>N)</b> <b>a</b> <b>no</b> texture control condition; and (P) an array of posts. The results indicate that humans can use optic flow for path integration and are differentially influenced by rotational and translational flow. In a third experiment, participants actively walked in arenas B, F, and N, so body senses were also available. Performance shifted from a pattern of underturning to overturning and exhibited decreased variability, similar responses with and without optic flow, and no attrition. The results indicate that path integration can be performed by integrating optic flow, but when information from body senses is available it appears to dominate. ...|$|R

Actually, because the generalized force in certain mode of the plate depends on the characteristic of the mode shape, the effective span of the cantilever pate could not be measured as plate side L_b but the wavelength of the mode shape of the track. It is noted from Eq. (13) that the wavelength of the mode shape of the track deceases with the increase in mode number <b>n.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>no</b> matter how long the plate side L_b is, the effective span of the plate, namely the wavelength of the modal shape, will become small enough in higher modes of vibration.

40|$|Equations {{describing}} {{the evolution of}} particles, solitons, or localized structures, driven by a zero-average, periodic, external force, and invariant under time reversal and a half-period time shift, exhibit a ratchet current when the driving force breaks these symmetries. The biharmonic force f(t) =ϵ₁cos(qωt + ϕ₁) +ϵ₂[*]cos(pωt + ϕ₂) does it for almost any choice of ϕ₁ and ϕ₂, provided p and q are two coprime integers such that p + q is odd. It has been widely observed, in experiments in semiconductors, in Josephson junctions, photonic crystals, etc., {{as well as in}} simulations, that the ratchet current induced by this force has the shape vαε_ 1 ^p ε_ 2 ^q[*]cos(pϕ₁−qϕ₂+θ₀) for small amplitudes, where θ₀ depends on the damping (θ₀ = π/ 2 if there is no damping, and θ₀ = 0 for overdamped systems).

30|$|Moreover, the 1975 land {{policies}} and proclamations were poorly implemented especially to protect women’s right of land during divorce {{and the death}} of a husband. As a result, land related disputes were mainly dictated traditionally. A case in point, if it is a husband that wants to get divorce, women can get equal access to a household land. But it would have been impossible to use the land if a divorced woman left her residence and went to other kebles or areas. If she left the kebele or remarried outside the kebele, the land could be appropriated by the PA officials as yemote keda land and the woman would be forced to leave the area with nothing.

40|$|Deconfinement phase {{transition}} and neutrino trapping in (proto) neutron star matter are investigated in a chiral hadronic model (also {{referred to as}} the FST model) for the hadronic phase (HP) and in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) quark model for the deconfined quark phase. We include a perturbative QCD correction parameter alpha(s) in the CFL quark matter equation of states. It is shown that the CFL quark core with K- 0 condensation forms in neutron star matter with the large value of alpha(s). If the small value of alpha(s) is taken, hyperons suppress the CFL quark phase and the HP is dominant in the high-density region of (proto) neutron star matter. Neutrino trapping makes the fraction of the CFL quark matter decrease compared with those without neutrino trapping. Moreover, increasing the QCD correction parameter alpha(s) or decreasing the bag constant B and the strange quark mass m(s) can make the fraction of the CFL quark matter increase, simultaneously, the fraction of neutrino in protoneutron star matter increases, too. The maximum masses and the corresponding radii of (proto) neutron stars are not sensitive to the QCD correction parameter alpha(s).
