Consumers in the late 1800s understood that a newborn chick doesn't scratch the ground for three days; thus the correlation to the <b>non-scratching</b> benefits of Bon Ami.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of oxygen}} {{consumption}} (VO 2) were made during sleep in 10 patients with atopic dermatitis. Two groups of healthy children acted as controls. All subjects were studied {{in bed in}} an environmental temperature of 24 - 26 degrees C, and sleep was confirmed during continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. Mean (SD) values of VO 2 in sleeping patients who were not scratching ranged from 4. 0 (0. 4) to 7. 4 (0. 7), which was not statistically significantly different from control values which ranged from 3. 24 (0. 3) to 5. 56 (0. 4). During scratching (while asleep), which occurred in nine out of 10 patients with atopic dermatitis, the mean values of VO 2 ranged from 4. 5 (0. 04) to 10. 4 (2. 7), and this {{was significantly higher than}} the <b>non-scratching</b> patients and the control values. Scratching during sleep in children with atopic dermatitis is associated with increased VO 2...|$|E
