5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is a town}} in Somerset, England, at {{the mouth}} of the River Parrett and Bridgwater Bay. Burnham was a small fishing village until the late 18th century, when it began to grow because of its {{popularity}} as a seaside resort. It forms part of the parish of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge and shares a town council with its <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> town of Highbridge. According to the 2011 census the population of the parish (i.e. including Highbridge) was 19,576, of which the populations of the wards of Burnham Central and Burnham North, which made up most of the town, totalled 13,601.|$|E

[...] "Smiffle," [...] {{it must be}} explained, is a fond {{abbreviation}} for Smithfield, near to which great mart of mutton and oxen our school is situated, and old Cistercians often playfully designate their place of education {{by the name of}} the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
30|$|In large {{watersheds}} longer hydrological forecasts are possible. Reservoir {{levels can}} be used to manage seasonal fluctuations in demand as well as to profit from seasonal price fluctuations. This is done by selling hydro production to <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> when prices are high and, when prices are low, conserving water in the reservoirs for future use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tradition}} of producing Šar cheese {{has been passed}} on to generations for centuries. [...] By the 1890s, the cheese became popular; the Serbian newspaper Carigradski glasnik of 28 July 1901 said that the cheese had overwhelmed the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> because of its yellow fatty look and taste which had not been seen in other cheeses.|$|R

It has a comprehensive sales and distribution network in Finland {{as well as in}} the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> of Sweden and the Baltic countries. The group head offices are located in Sipoo near Helsinki.|$|R
60|$|Their two {{confidential}} friends, Mr Shepherd, {{who lived}} in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride.|$|E
60|$|The <b>{{neighbour}}ing</b> <b>Market</b> House and Town Hall abutted {{against its}} next neighbour the Church {{except in the}} lower storey, where an arched thoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called Bull Stake. A stone post rose in the midst, to which the oxen had formerly been tied for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they {{were killed in the}} adjoining shambles. In a corner stood the stocks.|$|E
60|$|So Fin {{gave his}} arm to Mrs. Shandon, and Mary went {{skipping}} down the passages of the prison, and through the gate into the free air. From Fleet Street to Paternoster Row is not very far. As the three reached Mr. Bungay's shop, Mrs. Bungay was also entering at the private door, holding in her hand a paper parcel and a manuscript volume bound in red, and, indeed, containing an account of her transactions with the butcher in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market.</b> Mrs. Bungay was in a gorgeous shot-silk dress, which flamed with red and purple; she wore a yellow shawl, and had red flowers inside her bonnet, and a brilliant light blue parasol.|$|E
2500|$|This {{demand for}} more grain {{resulted}} in the reintroduction of requisitioning which was resisted in rural areas. In 1928 there was a 2-million-ton shortfall in grains purchased by the Soviet Union from <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets.</b> Stalin claimed the grain had been produced but was being hoarded by [...] "kulaks." [...] Instead of raising the price, the Politburo adopted an emergency measure to requisition 2.5 million tons of grain.|$|R
25|$|The {{new system}} would allow {{stations}} to transmit into <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets,</b> as {{an affiliate of}} one of the three metropolitan networks. For instance, before aggregation, there were three separate licence areas in northern New South Wales – Newcastle, New England, and the Mid North Coast, each served by a single commercial station. After aggregation, these three licence areas merged, with the three stations in direct competition for viewers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Transport {{constraints}} limit {{competition and}} arbitrageurs' possibilities of exploiting price differences between commodities in <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets.</b> We analyze a transportation network where oligopoly producers compete with supply functions under uncertain demand, as in wholesale electricity markets. For symmetric networks with a radial structure, {{we show that}} existence of symmetric supply function equilibria (SFE) is ensured if demand shocks are sufficiently evenly distributed. We can explicitly solve for them for uniform multi-dimensional nodal demand shocks...|$|R
6000|$|Julian {{stepped out}} of the vehicle, {{carefully}} supported on either side by his companions, and also by one or two turnkeys, whom the first summons of the deep bell at the gate had called to their assistance. That attention, it may be guessed, was not bestowed lest he should make a false step, so much as for fear of his attempting an escape, of which he had no intentions. A few prentices and straggling boys of the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market,</b> which derived considerable advantage from increase of custom, in consequence of the numerous committals on account of the Popish Plot, and who therefore were zealous of Protestants, saluted him on his descent with jubilee shouts of [...] "Whoop, Papist! whoop, Papist!

60|$|Leger {{threw up}} {{the window and}} looked into the street. The lights of a big gin palace flared down in the narrow gap, and a stream of perspiring {{humanity}} flowed along beneath them, slatternly women, and men with flattened chests and shoulders bent by unhealthy toil, jostling one another. The garish brilliancy touched their pallid faces, and the harsh murmur of their voices came up hollowly between the tall houses with the reek of gas fumes and other confused odours. There were many poor in Hoddam, and in hot weather bargains were to be had in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> at that hour; while trade was bad just then, and a little lower down the street shadowy figures were flitting into a pawnbroker's door. Leger's face grew a trifle weary as he watched them.|$|E
60|$|I {{have spoken}} {{something}} slightingly of the acquirements and doings of the family; and indeed their acquirements had been few and their doings little. At Allington, Dale of Allington {{had always been}} known as a king. At Guestwick, the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> town, {{he was a great}} man--to be seen frequently on Saturdays, standing in the market-place, and laying down the law as to barley and oxen among men who knew usually more about barley and oxen than did he. At Hamersham, the assize town, he was generally in some repute, being a constant grand juror for the county, and a man who paid his way. But even at Hamersham the glory of the Dales had, at most periods, begun to pale, for they had seldom been widely conspicuous in the county, and had earned no great reputation by their knowledge of jurisprudence in the grand jury room. Beyond Hamersham their fame had not spread itself.|$|E
40|$|Evidently, Korean dramas have become, within just a decade, one of {{the types}} of {{broadcasting}} content most in demand in many Asian countries, but this popularity, frequently called the Korean Wave, seems to have been obtained rather unexpectedly. This thesis examines how the Korean broadcasting industry succeeded in breaking into <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> over {{a relatively short period of}} time, and whether the Korean government played a certain role in supporting the fast acquisition of Korean dramas of Asian audiences. Through the analysis, using a combined research method, the thesis uncovers how the government’s support policies have not provided meaningful help for drama exports. Rather, the subordinate relationship of Korean broadcasters to the government and the relatively early marketisation of the Korean broadcasting industry have more efficiently stimulated Korean dramas’ entrance into <b>neighbouring</b> broadcasting <b>markets...</b>|$|R
50|$|Conglomerate mergers involve {{firms that}} operate in {{different}} product markets, without a vertical relationship. They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure conglomerate mergers, i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets. In practice, {{the focus is}} on mergers between companies that are active in related or <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets,</b> e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.|$|R

During the Qing Dynasty, the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> were known for Halal beef and mutton, even until today, the presence is still quite strong with Muslim grocery stores with Arabic sign along the road. The actual {{name of the}} Mosque is Lǐbàisì, which is given by the Chenghua Emperor in 1474, since it is located in Oxen Street (Niú means Oxen and jiē means street) this Mosque is simply called Niujie.

60|$|It {{was late}} on Saturday night, and unpleasantly {{hot in the}} little dingy room where Ingleby sat with a {{companion}} beneath the slates of a tall, four-story house in a busy cloth-making town. There were several large holes in the threadbare carpet, and {{a portion of the}} horsehair stuffing protruded from the dilapidated sofa, while the rickety chairs and discoloured cloth on the table were equally suggestive of severe economy. A very plain bookcase hung on the wall, and the condition of the historical works and treatises on political economy it contained seemed to indicate that they had been purchased secondhand; while an oil lamp burned dimly on the mantel, for the room was almost intolerably stuffy already, and the gas supplied at Hoddam was bad and dear. A confused murmur of voices came up from the narrow street below, with the clatter of heavy shoes and the clamour of the cheap-Jacks in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> square.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} he ransacked the best sweet shop in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> town for {{a box of chocolates}} that by its size and {{contents}} should fitly atone for the dismal deed done under the oak tree in the meadow. The two first specimens that were shown him he hastily rejected; one had a group of chickens pictured on its lid, the other bore the portrait of a tabby kitten. A third sample was more simply bedecked with a spray of painted poppies, and Octavian hailed the flowers of forgetfulness as a happy omen. He felt distinctly more at ease with his surroundings when the imposing package had been sent across to the grey house, and a message returned to say that it had been duly given to the children. The next morning he sauntered with purposeful steps past the long blank wall {{on his way to the}} chicken-run and piggery that stood at the bottom of the meadow. The three children were perched at their accustomed look-out, and their range of sight did not seem to concern itself with Octavian’s presence. As he became depressingly aware of the aloofness of their gaze he also noted a strange variegation in the herbage at his feet; the greensward for a considerable space around was strewn and speckled with a chocolate-coloured hail, enlivened here and there with gay tinsel-like wrappings or the glistening mauve of crystallised violets. It was as though the fairy paradise of a greedyminded child had taken shape and substance in the vegetation of the meadow. Octavian’s bloodmoney had been flung back at him in scorn.|$|E
60|$|Lord Clifford had rebuilt Douglas Castle, {{making it}} larger and much {{stronger}} than before, and had committed it {{to the charge of}} Captain Thirlwall, with a strong garrison. Douglas took a number of his retainers, who had now joined him in the field, and some of these, dressing themselves as drovers and concealing their arms, drove a herd of cattle within sight of the castle toward an ambuscade in which Douglas and the others were laying in ambush. The garrison, seeing what they believed a valuable prize within their grasp, sallied out to seize the cattle. When they reached the ambuscade the Scots sprang out upon them, and Thirlwall and the greater portion of his men were slain. Douglas then took and destroyed the castle and marched away. Clifford again rebuilt it more strongly than before, and placed it in charge of Sir John Walton. It might have been thought that after the disasters which had befallen the garrison they would not have suffered themselves to be again entrapped. Douglas, however, ordered a number of his men to ride past within sight of the castle with sacks upon their horses, apparently filled with grain, but in reality with grass, as if they were countrymen {{on their way to the}} <b>neighbouring</b> <b>market</b> town, while once more he and his followers placed themselves in ambush. Headed by their captain, the garrison poured out from the castle, and followed the apparent countrymen until they had passed the ambush where Douglas was lying. Then the drovers threw off their disguises and attacked them, while Douglas fell upon their rear, and Walton and his companions were all slain. The castle was then attacked, and the remainder of the garrison being cowed by the fate which had befallen their leader and comrades, made but a poor defence. The castle was taken, and was again destroyed by its lord, the walls being, as far as possible, overthrown.|$|E
30|$|The {{ability of}} such “water trading” {{entities}} to generate profits from time varying electricity prices in <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> {{is limited by}} the ability to store water. Even the largest reservoirs cannot prudently be filled above an upper threshold nor drawn down below a lower threshold. If future water inflows are uncertain, these “safety limits” must be computed by taking into account certain risk factors. If, on the other hand, future water inflows can be well characterized, water supplies can be managed much more aggressively. This approach has significant potential economic value as described by (Hamlet et al. [2002]).|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, the {{emerging}} economies, being exporters of manufactured goods, and rentier states, being exporters of commodities, have eroded the dominant position of developed {{countries in the world}} market; for the latter, they have also represented opportunities for growth and been partners in the international division of labour. As the EU 15 has a fair share in these dynamic markets, its global exports have only slightly receded. Such an achievement, which was mainly made in <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets,</b> is put at risk by the economic downturn which is affecting European emerging countries and rentier states in particular.

Riots sparked throughout the city as mourners continued to stone ambulances and torch cars. Despite the City Government's appeal for a calmer reaction, the place of the original incident was set ablaze by the angry crowd. Around 3,000 shops in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> fell victim to the arson as people looted and then blazed the shops. Aggressive reactions resulted in the destruction of businesses incurring losses of up to a few billion rupees.|$|R

50|$|René Lévesque {{appointed}} Coulombe {{as president}} and chief executive officer of Hydro-Quebec in late 1981, with a term beginning on January 15, 1982. In September 1982, Coulombe introduced a significant restructuring program for Hydro-Quebec's upper management. He released a revised capital spending program shortly thereafter, indicating that the agency would avoid significant new projects over the next five to six years due to a recession and reduced demand. Hydro-Quebec posted a forty-three per cent profit increase for 1982, despite a drop in consumption. Coulombe introduced another revised plan in 1983 that further downgraded capital spending in light of ongoing difficulties selling surplus energy to <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets.</b>|$|R

Overall, there is evidence of market integration, increasing over time, despite an underlying inefficiency in each market with respect to the forward and spot price convergence. The spatial analysis, on a financial dimension, is undertaken using causality tests, cointegration and impulse-response techniques, for both price levels and volatilities. In general we find less influence of the size and proximity of <b>neighbouring</b> <b>markets</b> than other studies, more integration at baseload than peak, and, surprisingly, less integration in forwards than spot prices.

5000|$|In mid-1985, Coulombe criticized a plan by Robert Bourassa (then {{the leader}} of the {{opposition}} in the Quebec legislature) to export twelve thousand megawatts of power to the United States of America. Although Coulombe also favoured increased sales to the United States, he argued that Bourassa's strategy could lock Quebec into unfavourable rates and was too risky in the long term. After Bourassa became premier again in late 1985, Coulombe indicated that Hydro-Quebec could be confident of exporting 3,500 to 4,500 megawatts of power by the mid-1990s.
