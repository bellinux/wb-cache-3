5|$|When the United States entered World War II, the {{military}} {{was in need of}} <b>nurses.</b> Hispanic female <b>nurses</b> wanted to volunteer for service, however they were not accepted into the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment. As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual <b>nurses</b> became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic <b>nurses.</b> In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican <b>nurses.</b> Thirteen women submitted applications, were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these <b>nurses</b> were assigned to the Army Post at San Juan, Puerto Rico where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five <b>nurses</b> were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico. One of these <b>nurses</b> was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.|$|E
5|$|Cadet <b>nurses</b> {{came from}} across the nation and from all backgrounds.

The corps was the largest of the federal nurse-training programs, and allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student <b>nurses</b> with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing during the war.|$|E
