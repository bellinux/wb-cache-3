5000|$|In free-market economies, {{technological}} advances lead {{to increases in}} productivity, but {{at the expense of}} older, less-efficient means of production, creating a level of subjective risk for which the compensation (in theory) is the return on capital. This rate or return is a reflection of all of the perceived risks associated with the capital financing of the means of production, including technology risks. From a capital finance point of view, advances in technology are the classic definition of systemic market risk. The outflow of this condition is the [...] "creative destruction" [...] of a portion of the means of production as evidenced by businesses discontinuing the production of obsolete products and/or the cessation of business activities that are no longer profitable. In its purest form, capitalism entails a constant level of creative destruction of a portion of the means of production and the increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the subject economy reflects the growth after the losses due to economic obsolescence have been reconciled. Accordingly, increases in GDP provides a substantive measurement that demonstrates that capitalism does not in effect create an economic construct where one party can only make a gain {{at the expense of the}} other party (i.e.: if one party could only profit at the expense of another party, then it would be impossible to achieve any <b>nominal</b> <b>growth</b> in GDP).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies found}} {{evidence}} for nominal wage rigidity {{during periods of}} relatively high <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth.</b> It has been argued, however, that in an environment with low <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth,</b> when <b>nominal</b> wage cuts become customary, workers’ opposition to nominal cuts would erode and, hence, firms would no longer hesitate to reduce nominal pay. If this argument is valid nominal wage rigidity is largely irrelevant because in a high-growth environment there is little need to cut nominal pay while in a low-growth environment the necessary cuts would occur. To examine this argument we use data from Switzerland where <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth</b> has been very low {{for many years in}} the 1990 s. We find that the rigidity of nominal wages is a robust phenomenon that does not vanish in a low growth environment. In addition, it constitutes a considerable obstacle to real wage adjustments. In the absence of downward nominal rigidity, real wages would indeed be quite responsive to unemployment. Moreover, the wage sweep-ups caused by nominal rigidity are strongly correlated with unemploymen...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the view that}} monetary policy operates within a set of basic constraints that limit the set of outcomes that it can achieve. These include constraints on aggregate supply behavior that determine how a given path of <b>nominal</b> income <b>growth</b> will be divided between inflation and output growth, as well as "velocity" constraints that influence the path of <b>nominal</b> income <b>growth</b> that will result from any given time path for the monetary base, monetary aggregates, or interest rates. The interaction of monetary policy decisions with shifts in constraints helps to explain the sources of deteriorating macroeconomic performance in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. The role of aggregate supply behavior is illustrated with a one-equation approach to the econometric problem of predicting how changes in <b>nominal</b> GNP <b>growth</b> will be divided between inflation and real GNP growth. The results from the equation estimated through 1980 are {{used to examine the}} behavior of inflation during the 1981 - 82 recession, and to predict the behavior of inflation and unemployment that would ac-company alternative paths of <b>nominal</b> GNP <b>growth</b> after 1982. The role of velocity is examined in a new set of multivariate exogeneity tests using the vector-autoregressive (VAR) approach for three separate sample periods (1953 - 61, 1962 - 70, and 1971 - 79). The major conclusions are that the monetary base has no significant explanatory role for spending changes. The Treasury bill rate appears to carry the main explanatory power, working directly on spending in the 1950 s and indirectly through the money multiplier in the 1970 s. ...|$|R
