30|$|This {{special issue}} {{presents}} research in applied game theory for signal processing and communications. In order to solve conflict situations in communication {{and in particular}} wireless networks, game theory provides a systematic approach. The limited resources in wireless communications are spectrum, space, power, and time. Game theory is used to analyze spectrum sharing, resource allocation, power control, transmit strategies, and <b>network</b> <b>etiquette</b> in wireless multiuser networks. The interest in these methods is increased significantly during {{the last ten years}} in the networking and signal processing communities.|$|E

40|$|State {{and contextual}} awareness, {{reasoning}} and conclusions formation, and {{a means of}} directing application, structural and parameter-level radio reconfiguration are key elements of a cognitive radio. This paper describes a cognitive radio design capable of scaling between the two extremes of minimal cognitive capabilities and complex highly-evolved cognitive radio abilities, which is being adopted for real tests using licensed cognitive radio test spectrum. A memory element stores state, sensor, objectives, actions and conclusions information and the relevance of this information can be varied {{in order to identify}} or ignore common traits or occurrences. The decision-making and conclusions formation abilities of this cognitive radio design can use (or choose to ignore using the variable weighting facility) external information relating to the <b>network,</b> and <b>etiquettes</b> in conjunction with the memory element. A set of actions formulated by the reasoning and conclusions formation stages direct the radio reconfiguration. This design is implemented using a general-purpose processor (GPP) platform as it currently offers the very high level of reconfigurability required for very malleable cognitive radio desig...|$|R

She and her three sisters lived in an orphanage after her parents divorced, where her youngest sister died of a mastoid infection at age 2. After her mother remarried they returned to live with her. She attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Council Bluffs. After graduating, she married scientist Jack Davison Young and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1941. She became a model and {{came into contact with}} Washington society as a result. She went on to teach etiquette and manners to children, including Richard M. Nixon's daughters, and Dwight D. Eisenhower's granddaughter. She moved to Kewanee, Illinois in 1965 after her divorce from Mr. Young and remarriage to attorney William E. Stewart. She created a <b>network</b> of <b>etiquette</b> classes, which at its height had locations in several hundred U.S. cities. These classes were called White Gloves (for girls) and Blue Blazers (for boys); they usually ran in cooperation with department stores. She wrote fifteen books on etiquette including, Marjabelle Stewart's Book of Modern Table Manners (1981), Can My Bridesmaids Wear Black? And 325 Other Most Asked Questions (1989), and Executive Etiquette in the New Workplace (1996).|$|R
