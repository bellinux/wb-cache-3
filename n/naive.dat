5|$|Jamie Bell as Jimmy, a <b>naive</b> {{young man}} who was found on the Venture, wild and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Jolin, {{as well as}} Dardel, used a <b>naïve</b> {{style in}} their {{paintings}} before this concept had been introduced into the Swedish art world. Both Jolin and Dardel were inspired by French naïvists, not just by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but also by Séraphine Louis who lived in Sentis and Wilhelm Uhde, a specialist in <b>naïve</b> painting. Matisse, Jolin's and Dardel's mentor, {{was no stranger to}} <b>naïve</b> art but it was not prominent in his work. Jolin also appreciated the cultivated and sophisticated, older painting, and was deeply impressed during his visits to the Louvre, where he was inspired by the works of masters such as Rubens, Watteau and Chardin.|$|E
5|$|Adriana Caselotti as Snow White: Snow White {{is a young}} princess. Her wicked {{stepmother}} {{has forced}} her {{to work as a}} scullery maid in the castle. Despite this, she retains a cheerful but <b>naïve</b> demeanor.|$|E

5|$|After ruining an improv class, Michael {{decides to}} crash Jim's party, {{much to the}} staff's dismay and Dwight's <b>naïve</b> delight. Michael awkwardly tries his hand at karaoke but Jim then joins in, easing the tension considerably. The {{documentary}} crew catches Angela and Dwight making out in Jim's backyard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly <b>naïve</b> style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{symposium on}} Stuckism {{took place in}} October 2006 at the Liverpool John Moores University during the Liverpool Biennial. The programme was led by <b>Naive</b> John, founder of the Liverpool Stuckists.

5|$|Eventually, {{halfway through}} the third day, only Shogo, Shuya, Noriko, and Kiriyama remain, with Kiriyama dead set on hunting down the trio. After a frantic car chase, Kiriyama is finally gunned down - but Nanahara and Nakagawa are held at gunpoint by Shogo, who taunts them over being so <b>naive</b> as to trust anyone in the Program. The collars record gunshots and Shuya and Noriko flatlining.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Rossen {{wrote and}} {{directed}} his first play,The Body Beautiful, a comedy about a <b>naive</b> burlesque dancer. Although the play closed after four performances, Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy was so impressed that in 1936 he signed Rossen to a personal screenwriting contract.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Manning {{directed}} the Belvoir St Theatre {{production of a}} play, Black Cockatoos, {{about the relationship between}} a white woman and an Aboriginal man. The script (not by Manning) was criticised by reviewer Angela Bennie, who nevertheless described Manning's direction as delicate and perceptive in places, if also <b>naive</b> and self-conscious.|$|E

Though young and <b>naive,</b> Mary is intelligent and mature. She finds {{a job as}} a kindergarten teacher to sustain herself while she seeks her sister's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{perception}} {{is concerned with}} the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within philosophy {{of perception}} include <b>naive</b> realism, enactivism and representional views.|$|E
5|$|Roger however has a secret: he {{once had}} a {{long-term}} affair with the French aristocrat the Prince of Soissons, with whom he begins anew soon after arriving in Paris. Through the actions of courtiers jealous of Barbara's devotion to Roger, pamphlets eventually spread about the affair. The young and <b>naive</b> Barbara is among the last to hear of it and breaks down in tears and shock.|$|E
5|$|The Good Terrorist is a 1985 {{political}} novel {{written by}} the British novelist Doris Lessing. It {{was first published in}} September that year by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom and by Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. The book's protagonist is the <b>naïve</b> drifter Alice, who squats with a group of radicals in London and is drawn into their terrorist activities.|$|E
5|$|The Hudsucker Proxy is a 1994 comedy film co-written, produced, and {{directed}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Sam Raimi co-wrote the script and served as second unit director.

5|$|The Powerpuff Girls is an American superhero {{animated}} {{television series}} created by animator Craig McCracken for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three girls with superpowers, {{as well as}} their father, the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the city of Townsville. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike and <b>naive</b> mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers.|$|E
5|$|They {{are both}} <b>naive</b> {{about sex and}} technology. Tracy, for example, {{attempts}} to telephone Robert to inform him that he's lost his mobile phone, and believes {{that she is a}} lesbian when she discovers her husband in women's clothing. They have a baby, who is seen or referred to occasionally. This reflects, as the writer observes, Moffat's inexperience of looking after children at the time.|$|E
5|$|Van Dormael's films, while few, {{have strong}} common themes between them. They make {{distinctive}} use of <b>naive</b> voiceover {{and examine the}} world from an innocent perspective (the young Thomas in Toto le héros, the mentally handicapped protagonist of Le huitième jour, and the unborn child of Mr. Nobody). These characters views are often colorful, imaginative, and somewhat removed from reality, with slight elements of surreal imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations.|$|E
5|$|Bratislava is {{the seat}} of the Slovak National Theatre, housed in two {{building}}s. The first is a Neo-Renaissance theatre building situated in the Old Town at the end of Hviezdoslav Square. The new building, opened to the public in 2007, is on the riverfront. The theatre has three ensembles: opera, ballet and drama. Smaller theatres include the Bratislava Puppet Theatre, the Astorka Korzo '90 theatre, the Arena Theatre, L+S Studio, and the <b>Naive</b> Theatre of Radošina.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his <b>naive</b> expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|Hilarion, a local gamekeeper, {{is also in}} {{love with}} Giselle and is highly {{suspicious}} of the newcomer who has won Giselle's affections. He tries to convince the <b>naive</b> Giselle that her beau cannot be trusted, but she ignores his warnings. Giselle's mother, Berthe, is very protective of her daughter, as Giselle has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, and disapproves of Giselle's fondness for dancing.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{according}} to Sean Wilentz, favorable views of Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars, who portray {{him as the}} visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by an energetic executive. Modern scholars favoring Hamilton have portrayed Jefferson and his allies, in contrast, as <b>naïve,</b> dreamy idealists. The older Jeffersonian view attacked Hamilton as a centralizer, sometimes {{to the point of}} accusations that he advocated monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{has also}} {{appeared}} in other media relating to The Simpsons. She has appeared in each Simpsons video game, including The Simpsons Game, released in 2007. In addition to the television series, Lisa regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, first published on November 29, 1993 and published monthly. The comics focus on the sweeter, more <b>naive</b> incarnation from the early seasons. Lisa also {{plays a role in}} The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants {{may be the}} only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a <b>naive</b> nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{companion}} characters, NPCs {{significant to}} the Origins plot include Duncan, the Grey Warden who recruits the player; King Cailan, Ferelden's <b>naive</b> but courageous leader {{and son of}} the legendary King Maric; Queen Anora, Cailan's politically-savvy wife, whose youth and beauty are matched by a commanding personality but somewhat offset by her ambition and ruthlessness; and Flemeth, Morrigan's mother, {{who appears to be}} a harmless old woman in public, but in truth is an infamous dark witch of Ferelden legend.|$|E
5|$|Quisling {{spent the}} last months of the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the {{showdown}} that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German prisoner-of-war camps. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a <b>naïve</b> offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob is {{depicted}} as being a good-natured, optimistic, <b>naïve,</b> and enthusiastic yellow sea sponge residing in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom alongside an array of anthropomorphic aquatic creatures. He works as a fry cook at a local fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to which he is obsessively attached. At work, SpongeBob answers to Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who shows SpongeBob favor, alongside his ill-tempered, snobbish next-door neighbor Squidward Tentacles. His hobbies include jellyfishing, practicing karate at an elementary level, and blowing bubbles.|$|E
5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's <b>naïve</b> and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
25|$|Croatian Museum of <b>Naïve</b> Art (works by Croatian primitivists at 3 Ćirilometodska Street) {{is one of}} {{the first}} museums of <b>naïve</b> art in the world. The museum holds works of Croatian <b>naïve</b> {{expression}} of the 20th century. It is located in the 18th-century Raffay Palace in the Gornji Grad.|$|E
25|$|The antigen {{sensitivity}} {{is higher}} in antigen-experienced T cells than in <b>naive</b> T cells. <b>Naive</b> T cells pass {{through the process of}} functional avidity maturation with no change in affinity. It is {{based on the fact that}} effector and memory (antigen-experienced) T cell are less dependent on costimulatory signals and higher antigen concentration than <b>naive</b> T cell.|$|E
25|$|Ozone (late 1950s) —Zero's bigger, {{even more}} <b>naïve</b> friend.|$|E
25|$|Linda Marshall, Kenneth's 16-year-old daughter, Arlena's <b>naive</b> stepdaughter.|$|E
25|$|For most purposes, however, <b>naive</b> {{set theory}} is still useful.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for <b>naïve</b> listeners to identify ethnicity through speech.|$|E
