25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
25|$|Further north, French cavalry {{was pushed}} {{back to the}} Yser by the XXIII Reserve Corps and by nightfall was dug in from the {{junction}} with the British at Steenstraat to the vicinity of Dixmude, the boundary with the Belgian army. The British closed the gap with {{a small number of}} reinforcements and on 23 October, the French IX Corps took over {{the north end of the}} Ypres salient, relieving I Corps with the 17th Division. Kortekeer Cabaret was recaptured by the 1st Division and the 2nd Division was relieved. <b>Next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> Corps had been relieved and the 7th Division lost Polygon Wood temporarily. The left flank of the 7th Division was taken over by the 2nd Division, which joined in the counter-attack of the French IX Corps on the northern flank towards Roulers and Thourout, as the fighting further north on the Yser impeded German attacks around Ypres. German attacks were made on the right flank of the 7th Division at Gheluvelt. The British sent the remains of I Corps to reinforce IV Corps. German attacks from 25–26 October were made further south, against the 7th Division on the Menin Road and on 26 October part of the line crumbled until reserves were scraped up to block the gap and avoid a rout.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

[...] "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to [...] "...Baby One More Time".

500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

Background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin. Spears also recorded a track called [...] "Autumn Goodbye", written and produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a b-side to [...] "...Baby One More Time".
