5|$|The Kclass proved {{successful}} on well-maintained track. It {{was capable}} of high speeds on express passenger duties, although their use was limited by the lower storage capacity of tank locomotives, which meant the Kand K1classes were prone to water shortages on the long Kent Coast routes, and precluded them from working many of the former London and South Western Railway (LSWR) routes west of London. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> weight meant that compromises were made in {{some aspects of the}} design. The boiler size was constrained by the SECR’s axle-loading restrictions, with the result that the design’s full steaming potential was not realised. The failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler would also affect Maunsell’s subsequent 2-6-0 classes, as they were given the same boiler despite their lower axle-loadings.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

25|$|The force {{crossed the}} English Channel, {{landing on the}} Quiberon peninsula, where 2,500 men met them, giving Puisaye a total force of 6,000. The force relied on {{expected}} support from the peasants, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. The British recognised Puisaye as the commander of the force, but French royalist forces recognised the Comte d'Hervilly as the commander of the forces, and internal power struggles plagued the unit. With its leadership divided, the force did little, and republican forces attacked Puisaye's expedition while it was still on the peninsula, unready to fight. The royalists suffered defeat, with thousands of men drowning while trying to escape; those who surrendered were immediately executed. Puisaye escaped to England, claiming the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> official correspondence, although he was accused of cowardice.|$|E

25|$|The {{database}} {{features of}} the HyperCard system {{are based on the}} storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database did not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists.

From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, {{there was no difference between}} moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply changed the state of the target object within the stack.

25|$|Manchester United's team {{selection}} {{was dominated by}} the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> several players for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich four days later. Midfielders Roy Keane and Paul Scholes were suspended for the Champions League final, so they were paired in central midfield for the FA Cup final as the swansong for their season; their deputy for the Champions League final, Nicky Butt, was {{left out of the}} matchday squad entirely to guard him against injury. Top scorer Dwight Yorke was dropped to the bench for a similar reason, while first-choice centre-back Jaap Stam was named among the substitutes to {{give him a chance to}} prove his fitness after an Achilles tendon injury. Denis Irwin missed the match due to suspension after being sent off against Liverpool in the Premier League on 5 May and was replaced in the starting line-up by Phil Neville. Several players, including Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville, were suffering from a flu virus in the lead-up to the game, and were still suffering the effects on matchday, but were all deemed fit enough to play. Henning Berg was injured.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, {{the force}} was {{involved}} in heavy fighting against strong Turkish defences; during a counter-attack it lost more than two batteries of artillery, which was captured by the advancing Turkish soldiers. On 1 May, 60th Division was supposed to attack Shunet Nimrin again but failures elsewhere caused the assault to be cancelled. Instead, the Australian Mounted Division which had advanced to occupy Es Salt, sent the 5th Mounted Brigade to attack Shunet Nimrin from the rear. To assist them, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to cut off any retreat from there northwards. The Australian attack faltered, partly in response to Turkish successes in the west, and by 20:00 they were still stationary. Another frontal assault by 60th (London) Division at 02:00 on 2 May also failed; by now the British position was turning more to defence than attack. In the three days since crossing the Jordan valley, the force {{had been involved in}} almost continuous fighting. On 3 May, yet another frontal attack by 60th Division failed and the ANZAC Division covering the flanks were confronted by growing numbers of Turkish troops. At 16:00 on 3 May, with an acceptance of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> his command, Chauvel ordered a withdrawal back from Es Salt to the Jordan valley. The last unit to cross back across the Jordan was the New Zealand Brigade, leaving the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles as the east bank guard force, along with the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead.|$|E

500|$|When Alexei Kosygin {{resigned}} in 1980 Tikhonov, {{at the age}} of 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. During his five-year term as premier Tikhonov refrained from reforming the Soviet economy, despite all statistics from that time showing the economy was stagnating. Tikhonov presented the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85) at the 26th Party Congress, and told the delegates that the state would allocate nine million rubles for mothers who were seeking parental leave. In his presentation to the congress, Tikhonov admitted that Soviet agriculture was not producing enough grain. Tikhonov called for an improvement in Soviet–US relations, but dismissed all speculations that the Soviet economy was in any sort of crisis. Despite this, Tikhonov admitted to economic [...] "shortcomings" [...] and acknowledged the ongoing [...] "food problem"; other topics for discussion were the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> energy resources, boost labour productivity and {{to improve the quality of}} Soviet produced goods. Early in his term, in January 1981, Tikhonov admitted that the government's demographic policy was one of the weakest areas of his cabinet. In reality, however, he along with many others, were beginning to worry that not enough Russians were being born. The Era of Stagnation reduced the birth rate, and increased the death rate of the Russian population.|$|E

Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{suggestion}} from C was to {{make the}} belt armor a load-bearing member by connecting plates end to end. This was found inordinately difficult to be practical and, while it would have added girder strength where most badly needed, was considered too radical a proposition to be truly safe. Another idea, subsequently adopted, was to design the forecastle to break abaft the turrets. The challenge then became to continue the longitudinal strength contributed by the armored deck past this point {{to the end of the}} stern. This became a difficult design problem, especially with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> weight wherever possible and the fact that light structural members combined with heavy armament weight had become a source of grief for the British. One proposed solution was to use a combination of three decks—a strength deck at the top of the hull, a protective deck which would rest atop the belt armor, [...] above the waterline, and a splinter deck below that, just above the waterline. [...] A third idea, also adopted, was to continue the longitudinal bulkhead between the protective and splinter decks down to the bottom of the ship to add strength. The severity of the strength and weight challenges necessitated a larger displacement of 33,000 tons and a hull of [...] instead of [...] to give enough internal volume to accommodate all the needed machinery. Even so, the size of the power plant meant pushing the main turrets further toward the ends of the ships, which increased hull stress. This was why the idea was adopted to place half the boilers above the armored deck.|$|E
