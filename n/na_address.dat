The paper {{will focus on the}} interaction between genres, seen in the light of intertextuality as defined by Michael Riffaterre and M. H. Abrams among others. It highlights, moreover, the thematic and aesthetic contribution of the oral artist Ali Na Maliki to contemporary Hausa orature and culture. It reposes on an analysis of the manipulation of certain images and animal symbols {{of leadership and}} power borrowed from the world of tales used with a certain degree of innovation in order to evoke, symbolically, the mythical attributes of power in the artistic universe of his songs.

The main objec- tive is to provide data for their chronology and provenance, and to confirm under which regent they were issued. With this data at hand, an analysis will be made, connecting them with their inter- national background. The reason for their appearance in Sigtu- <b>na</b> will be <b>addressed,</b> {{as well as the}} difference in the circulation compared to the urban predecessor Birka. I will conclude the article by stressing the continuous need for interregional trade from the ninth to the eleventh centuries, with the aim of acquiring raw materials and socially ostentatious objects, but with dimin- ishing distances covered...|$|R
40|$|When an ultrarelativistic {{electron}} traverses two closely spaced foils, a radiation spectrum 'resonance' appears, {{arising from}} the photon formation length extending from one foil, across the gap and into the second foil. Several theoretical approaches yield quite different answers to the spectral location of this 'resonance', and we have therefore in the CERN <b>NA</b> 63 collaboration <b>addressed</b> the question experimentally with a 178 GeV electron beam. The experimental technique used - where a variable gap separates two thin gold foils - allows for a direct measurement of a length that {{is closely related to}} the distance over which the photon formation takes place. These are the first measurements to observe the gap dependence of the energy of the 'resonance' in the radiation spectrum from a structured target on a truly macroscopic scale up to 0. 5 mm. The results are compared with the theory of Baier and Katkov, with both the modified and unmodified theories of Blankenbecler as well as with a naïve, straightforward expectation. Surprisingly, the experiment shows a clear preference for the two latter, comparatively unsophisticated, approaches. © 2014 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{quantifying}} the Tissue Sodium Concentration (TSC) in the rat brain from 23 Na-MR images was developed. TSC {{is known to}} change {{in a variety of}} common human diseases and holds considerable potential to contribute to their study; however, its accurate measurement in small laboratory animals has been hindered by the extremely low signal to noise ratio (SNR) in 23 <b>Na</b> images. To <b>address</b> this, the design, construction and characterisation of a double tuned 1 H/ 23 Na dual resonator system for 1 H-guided quantitative 23 Na-MRI is described. This system comprised of an SNR-optimised surface detector coil for 23 Na image acquisition, and a volume resonator producing a highly-homogeneous B 1 field (< 5 % inhomogeneity) for the Na channel across the rat head. The resonators incorporated channel independent balanced matching and tuning capabilities with active decoupling circuitry at the 23 Na resonance frequency. A quantification accuracy of TSC of < 10 mM was achieved in Na-images with 1. 2 ?l voxel resolution acquired in 10 minutes. The potential of the quantification technique was demonstrated in an in vivo experiment of a rat model of cerebral stroke, where the evolution of the TSC was successfully monitored for 8 hours after the stroke was induced...|$|R
40|$|At present {{there is}} no {{adequate}} means by which natural area planners and decision- makers can undertake a comprehensive and integrated assessment of individuals' values for natural areas. Although instrumental values {{can be measured in}} a number of ways, there exists no accepted mechanism in natural resource management planning through which intrinsic values can be measured for a large sample. In this article, we describe the Natural Area Value Scale (<b>NA</b> VSj which <b>addresses</b> this need. The NAVS has been designed to suit a general public sample, but also to have application across different population groups and resource types. The 20 -item NA VS can measure, distinguish between and gauge the relative strengths of individuals' intrinsic. non-use and use values for nature. Use values have distinct recreation and non-recreation components. For a general population sample, the four value sub-scales have good reliability. Evidence for construct validity is given by the presence of expected correlations between the sub-scales, the verification of expected relationships between the relative sub-scale values for different population samples, and the verification of expected relationships between sub-scale values and management preferences. The NA VS also provided coherent results across two very different types of environments, forests and wetlands, as well as in circumstances involving endangered species...|$|R

However, because noradrenergic terminals contain other neuromodulators and the noradrenaline (NA) transporter, which may act as a neuroprotective buffer, {{it was unclear whether}} this enhancement of METH neurotoxicity was caused by the loss of noradrenergic innervation or the loss of <b>NA</b> itself. We <b>addressed</b> the specific role of NA by comparing the effects of METH in mice with noradrenergic lesions (DSP- 4) and those with intact noradrenergic terminals but specifically lacking NA (genetic or acute pharmacological blockade of the NA biosynthetic enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase; DBH). We found that genetic deletion of DBH (DBH-/- mice) and acute treatment of wild-type mice with a DBH inhibitor (fusaric acid) recapitulated the effects of DSP- 4 lesions on METH responses. All three methods of NA depletion enhanced striatal DA release, extracellular oxidative stress (as measured by in vivo microdialysis of DA and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid), and behavioral stereotypies following repeated METH administration. These effects accompanied a worsening of the striatal DA neuron terminal damage and ultrastructural changes to medium spiny neurons. We conclude that NA itself is neuroprotective and plays a fundamental role in the sensitivity of striatal DA terminals to the neurochemical, behavioral, and neurotoxic effects of METH...|$|R
40|$|Naphthalene (NA) is a semivolatile {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon to which humans are exposed {{from a variety}} of sources. NA results in acute cytotoxicity to respiratory epithelium in rodents. Cytochrome P 450 -dependent metabolic activation to form reactive intermediates and loss of soluble cellular thiols (glutathione) are critical steps in NA toxicity, but the precise mechanisms by which this chemical results in cellular injury remain unclear. Protein thiols are likely targets of reactive NA metabolites. Loss of these, through adduction or thiol oxidation mechanisms, may be important underlying mechanisms for <b>NA</b> toxicity. To <b>address</b> the hypothesis that loss of thiols on specific cellular proteins is critical to NA-induced cytotoxicity, we compared reduced to oxidized thiol ratios in airway epithelial cell proteins isolated from lungs of mice treated with NA or the nontoxic glutathione depletor, diethyl maleate (DEM). At 300 mg/kg doses, NA administration resulted in a greater than 85 % loss of glutathione levels in the airway epithelium, which is similar to the loss observed after DEM treatment. Using differential fluorescent maleimide labeling followed by 2 DE separation of proteins, we identified more than 35 unique proteins that have treatment-specific differential sulfhydryl oxidation. At doses of NA and DEM that produce similar levels of glutathione depletion, Cy 3 /Cy 5 labeling ratios were statistically different for 16 nonredundant proteins in airway epithelium. Proteins identified include a zinc finger protein, several aldehyde dehydrogenase variants, β-actin, and several other structural proteins. These studies show distinct patterns of protein thiol alterations with the noncytotoxic DEM and the cytotoxic NA...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the Range Trie, a new multiway tree data structure for address lookup. Each Range Trie node maps to an address range [Na, Nb) and performs multiple comparisons {{to determine the}} subrange an incoming address belongs to. Range Trie improves on the existing Range Trees allowing shorter comparisons than the address width. The maximum comparison length in a Range Trie node is ⌈log 2 (Nb − <b>Na)</b> ⌉ bits. <b>Address</b> parts can be shared among multiple concurrent comparisons or even omitted. Addresses can be properly aligned to further reduce the required address bits per comparison. In so doing, Range Tries can store in a single tree node more address bounds to be compared. Given a memory bandwidth, more comparisons are performed in a single step reducing lookup latency, memory accesses per lookup, and overall memory requirements. Latency and memory size scale better than related works as the address width {{and the number of}} stored prefixes increase. Considering memory bandwidth of 256 -bits per cycle, five to seven Range Trie levels are sufficient to store half a million IPv 4 or IPv 6 prefixes, while memory size is comparable and in many cases better than linear search. We describe a Range Trie hardware design and evaluate our approach in terms of performance, area cost and power consumption. Range Trie 90 -nm ASIC implementations, storing 0. 5 million IPv 4 and IPv 6 prefixes, perform over 500 million lookups per second (OC- 3072) and consume 3. 9 and 11. 4 Watts respectively...|$|R
40|$|North Atlantic (<b>NA)</b> stock {{assessments}} <b>address</b> {{the marine}} phase, estimating returns to home waters, with Pre-Fishery Abundance (PFA) estimated through raising of national (or regional) annual catches by exploitation rates and attributing unreported catch and natural mortality ranges in Monte Carlo simulations. Baltic stocks in contrast, are estimated through integrated Bayesian life cycle state-space models including riverine and sea phases (Michielsens et al., 2008). There is presently no {{interaction between the}} two methodologies. We detail the two approaches specifying similarities in biology, as a prerequisite to their harmonization for parallel inference and risk analysis, independent of scales, available data and management objectives. Through aggregations of scale and availability, assimilations of data differ. For the Baltic much is performed within the forecasting framework, and while aggregations in the NA case are disparate, finer scale details are available. In the Baltic a scale of “river” is used as the geographical unit, while in the NA, 3 geo-regions are treated independently, each operating at arbitrary regional scales. To harmonize NA and Baltic approaches, a multi-scale integrated life cycle model in a Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) framework is proposed for the NA to capture inherent complexities from mixing of life cycle age and stage cohorts, which is currently not addressed. A stage-structured life cycle approach is proposed, incorporating freshwater and marine phase variability of life histories (survival and life history choices) and auto-regenerated cohort dynamics. This represents a large change in both the modelling and statistical inference framework. Key structural hypotheses and common informative prior distributions for modelling demographic processes, for both NA and Baltic models are developed. Together with the Bayesian methodology these form {{the core of the}} harmonization process. To harmonize modelling of the demographic process the following items are necessary:  State-space representation of all life stages including those not directly observed to explicitly separate out modeling of the demographic and observation processes, so as the harmonization of the models for the core ecological process can be thought independently from the data availability.  Age/stage-based demographic models to integrate biological and ecological knowledge of population dynamics, characterized by seaward migrations of smolts and spawning migration of adults back to freshwater, accommodating intra- and inter-population variability in life history traits.  Probabilistic demographic transitions and between-years variability of certain parameters to capture both environmental and demographic stochasticity.  Variable egg to juvenile density-dependent average survival, of classical survival functions.  Common approach to forecast yearly variations of marine post-smolts survival. The general aim of the ECOKNOWS project is to improve the use of biological knowledge in fisheries science and management. The lack of appropriate calculus methods and fear of statistical overparameterisation has limited biological reality in fisheries models. This reduces biological credibility perceived by many stakeholders. We solve this technical estimation problem by using up-to date methodology supporting more effective use of data. The models suggested will include important knowledge about biological processes and the applied statistical inference methods allow to integrate and update this knowledge in stock assessment. We will use the basic biological data (such as growth, maturity, fecundity, maximum age and recruitment data sets) to estimate general probabilistic dependencies in fish stock assessments. In particular, we will seek to improve the use of large existing biological and environmental databases, published papers and survey data sets provided by EU data collection regulations and stored by ICES and EU member countries. Bayesian inference will form the methodological backbone of the project and will enable realistic estimations of uncertainty. We develop a computational learning approach that builds on the extensive information present in FishBase (www. fishbase. org). The developed methodology will be of fundamental importance, especially for the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. It has been a difficult challenge even for target species with long data series, and now the same challenge is given for new and poorly studied species. We will improve ways to find generic and understandable biological reference points, such as the required number of spawning times per fish, which also supports the management needs in the developing countries. ECOKNOWS applies decision analysis and bioeconomic methods to evaluate the validity and utility of improved information, helping to plan efficient EU data collection.
