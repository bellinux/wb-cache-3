5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, {{in which}} {{biological}} vulnerability and adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April the men {{informed}} their landlord {{that they}} were going to Bristol for a week and then returning to Iraq, stated that they would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 (BST) on 30 April. Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and submachine guns), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a diplomatic bag belonging to Iraq. Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in Lexham Gardens in South Kensington, the six men arrived outside the embassy.|$|E

25|$|The country's tourism {{industry}} {{is generally considered}} to be underdeveloped, but it does provide crucial support for Ukraine's economy. Ukraine does have certain advantages, including much lower costs than other European destinations, as well as visa-free access for most people from Europe, the former Soviet Union, and North America. Since 2005 citizens of European Union and EFTA, United States, Canada, Japan and South Korea <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> a visa to visit Ukraine for tourism purposes. Also, no visa has been required for citizens of Russia, and other CIS countries (except Turkmenistan).|$|E
25|$|The V8 Security Feature Pack (a mid-release product update {{designated}} 8.5) added {{important new}} security features designed to lock down Pervasive.SQL data files. Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data {{was controlled by}} the operating system's security mechanism. This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying data files. 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user {{has access to the}} underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI connection string.|$|E

25|$|The nomadic phase begins around 10 {{days after}} the queen lays her eggs. This phase will last {{approximately}} 15 days to let the larvae develop. The ants move during the day, capturing insects, spiders, and small vertebrates to feed their brood. At dusk, they will form their nests or bivouac, which they change almost daily. At {{the end of the}} nomadic phase, the larvae will spin pupal cases and <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> food. The colony can then live in the same bivouac site for around 20 days, foraging only on approximately two-thirds of these days. Among the army ants are some species that venture out only at night, but no adequate studies of their activities have been made.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{the airport}} was {{discussed}} in the Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. The committee was split on whether it should nationalize the airport. The Labour Party and the Conservative Party, who had a majority in Parliament, wanting to {{wait until after the}} Triangle Link—a fixed link from Stord and Bømlo southwards to Haugaland—was built, so see how it affected patronage at Sørstokken. The Centre Party, the Socialist Left Party and the Christian Democratic Party wanted to nationalize the airport. A unanimous committee chose to give a NOK1 million grant to build a new terminal and <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> the airport to follow the Civil Aviation Administration's fees, allowing it to set its own.|$|E
25|$|Points {{that differ}} from the modern Laws (use of italics is to {{highlight}} the differences only): (a) the wickets shall be pitched at twenty three yards distance from each other; (b) that twelve Gamesters shall play on each side; (c) the Batt Men for every one they count are to touch the Umpire's Stick; (d) no Player shall be deemed out by any Wicket put down, unless with the Ball in Hand. In modern cricket: (a) the pitch is 22 yards long; (b) the teams are eleven-a-side; (c) runs were only completed if the batsman touched the umpire's stick (which was probably a bat) and this practice was eventually replaced by the batsman having to touch the ground behind the popping crease; (d) run outs <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> the ball to be in hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew was}} sent from Karljohansvern on 15 November 1918 and the command flag was hoisted on 17 November. The same day Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen flew {{the first of}} two Sopwith Babys to the station. Seven people were {{stationed}} at Avaldsnes, under the command of First Lieutenant Riiser-Larsen. He was subordinate to the captain of HNoMS Tordenskjold, which was stationed in Haugesund. The Spowiths were used in minesweeping duty. They would survey the North Sea for mines. In case they found any, they would note its location on a map and drop it to the crew on the nearest minesweeper. Work was carried out around Karmøy and the shipping channel towards Stavanger. By January it was decided that minesweeping in the area would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> aerial aid. The aircraft were flown to Kristiansand on 17 January 1919 and the station was closed on 21 January 1919.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, the {{emergency}} medical service also encompasses the role of moving patients from one medical facility to an alternative one; usually to facilitate the provision of a higher level or more specialized field of care but also to transfer patients from a specialized facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> the services of that specialized hospital, such as following successful cardiac catheterization due to a heart attack. In such services, the EMS is not summoned by members of the public but by clinical professionals (e.g. physicians or nurses) in the referring facility. Specialized hospitals that provide higher levels of care may include services such as neonatal intensive care (NICU), pediatric intensive care (PICU), state regional burn centres, specialized care for spinal injury and/or neurosurgery, regional stroke centers, specialized cardiac care (Cardiac catheterization), and specialized/regional trauma care.|$|E
25|$|Jerry and Charlie O'Connell {{left the}} series to pursue film careers, and because Jerry was denied an {{executive}} producer credit on the series. When he left, they informed Charlie {{that they would}} <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> him either. The brothers leaving the show upset many fans and Tracy Tormé was asked {{what could be done}} to win them back. This resulted in an unsuccessful effort to bring back some popular previously recurring characters. The producers negotiated with John Novak (Ross J. Kelly, the ambulance-chasing lawyer), Alex Bruhanski (Pavel Kurlienko, the taxi driver) and Lester Barrie (Elston Diggs the waiter at the Chandler Hotel) for their return in season five. Zoe McLellan (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and Jason Gaffney (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale. However, none of these guest stars appeared. Why Bennish didn't appear in the fifth season {{is one of the biggest}} behind-the-scenes mysteries of the show.|$|E

25|$|Evolution is not {{a random}} process. Although {{mutations}} in DNA are random, natural selection {{is not a}} process of chance: the environment determines the probability of reproductive success. Evolution is an inevitable result of imperfectly copying, self-replicating organisms reproducing over billions of years under the selective pressure of the environment. The outcome of evolution is not a perfectly designed organism. The end products of natural selection are organisms that are adapted to their present environments. Natural selection does not involve progress towards an ultimate goal. Evolution does not strive for more advanced, more intelligent, or more sophisticated life forms. For example, fleas (wingless parasites) are descended from a winged, ancestral scorpionfly, and snakes are lizards that <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>require</b> limbs—although pythons still grow tiny structures that are the remains of their ancestor's hind legs. Organisms are merely the outcome of variations that succeed or fail, dependent upon the environmental conditions at the time.|$|E
500|$|As Richardson explains, in Original Stories {{adulthood}} {{is defined}} by the ability to discipline oneself by [...] "constructing moral tales" [...] out of one’s life.
