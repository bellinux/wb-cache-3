5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> historical figure.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the path}} of Emmy was {{uncertain}} whether it would affect the Lesser Antilles. As a result, officials issued a hurricane watch for the northeastern Leeward Islands. The warning was cancelled when the storm turned more to the north, with the outer fringes of the hurricane slightly impacting Antigua. Several ships experienced rough seas and strong winds from Emmy, though none reported any damage. After Emmy turned to the west for the final time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center considered the hurricane <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> threat to land, though they indicated it had a remote chance to affect land masses. The hurricane also posed {{a threat to the}} island of Bermuda initially, though it remained away from the island. Two days before Emmy passed through the Azores, the National Hurricane Center advised citizens there to closely monitor the progress of the storm. No damage reports exist from the Azores, though it was likely not severe.|$|E
5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E

25|$|The Wang LOCI-2 Logarithmic Computing Instrument desktop {{calculator}} (the earlier LOCI-1 in September 1964 was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> product) {{was introduced}} in January 1965. Using factor combining {{it was probably the}} first desktop calculator capable of computing logarithms, quite an achievement for a machine without any integrated circuits. The electronics included 1,275 discrete transistors. It actually performed multiplication by adding logarithms, and roundoff in the display conversion was noticeable: 2 times 2 yielded 3.999999999.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} expedition begin to explore. Victoria and Kaftan discover a chamber with a sarcophagus-like wall inset facing a projection device that was apparently used to revitalise the Cybermen. She curiously climbs inside, and Kaftan secretly seals her in the sarcophagus and tries to activate the projector but the Doctor frees her, suspecting Kaftan is to blame. Meanwhile, Haydon and Jamie have been experimenting with a control panel in another room; a Cyberman emerges and a gun fires, killing Haydon. However, the Doctor works {{out that it is}} <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> Cyberman, but a testing range for weapons.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{transformation}} (transduction): Package {{the desired}} genetic material into a suitable plant virus and allow this modified virus to infect the plant. If the genetic material is DNA, it can recombine with the chromosomes to produce transformant cells. However, genomes of most plant viruses consist of single stranded RNA which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cell. For such genomes {{this method is}} a form of transfection and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> transformation, since the inserted genes never reach the nucleus of the cell and do not integrate into the host genome. The progeny of the infected plants is virus-free and also free of the inserted gene.|$|E
25|$|The {{eigenvalues}} of unitary matrices {{are pure}} phases, {{so that the}} value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> number. Another way of saying this is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2π. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.|$|E

25|$|Consider {{the natural}} {{logarithm}} function mapping the real numbers to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> number, so the natural logarithm function doesn't associate any real {{number in the}} codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, {{but it is a}} partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the positive reals (that is, if the natural logarithm function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural logarithm is a total function.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{conflict}} with Zionism helped to make Palestinian Arab society more conservative in cultural, social, religious and political affairs because people were highly motivated to preserve their distinct heritage and identity against the dual impact of British colonialism and Jewish innovation. Traditionally, the Arabs had an elite, but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> leadership. Both of these things changed {{over the course of}} the 1930s. During this period new political organizations and new types of activist began to appear, marking the involvement of a far broader cross-section of the population; in particular, nationalism, which had been long-rooted in rural society began to take hold in urban society.|$|E

On some occasions, Kelly has had to stop the reading as the client has become extremely emotional, with Kelly offering counselling instead, which she has been trained in. She has also said that intelligent people are easier to read as they have a larger pool of references to use to respond to her cues.|$|E

25|$|Lord Hawke, in {{the early}} days of his captaincy, {{designed}} the white rose badge. Copying the idea from Lancashire, who already had adopted the red rose as a symbol, Hawke designed a rose which, unlike Lancashire's, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> flower. He created a rose with eleven petals, to represent the eleven players of the team, based on the hedge rose. Only players who had received their county cap were allowed to wear the badge. It was not until the 1980s it was allowed by the committee to be placed on merchandise as a marketing device. Yorkshire's club colours are dark blue, light blue and gold; these are knitted in bands forming the v-neck of each player's sweater.|$|E
25|$|Stephen F. Jones {{argued that}} while South Ossetia was seeking for union with Russia, the {{political}} {{realities of the}} South Caucasus made this an unlikely prospect. In the 2012 presidential elections, Alla Dzhioyeva, an opposition representative had victory snatched from her by the South Ossetian Supreme Court. This illustrated the region’s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia {{does not have the}} functions of a state to provide for its citizens. There is little popular support for independence.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of squat toilets {{is that they}} are very easy to clean. They are also cheaper to make, they consume less water per flush than Western toilets, and, {{due to the lack of}} direct contact with the seat, some people claim that they are more hygienic. However, seat contact is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> health risk and squat toilets allow splatter on one's own legs and feet. The waterless trough minimizes the risk of splash-back of water during defecation. However, because the products of excretion sit exposed to the open air until flushed away, they commonly produce much stronger odors than they would when submerged as in a Western toilet, an effect that is often quite noticeable in or anywhere near a Japanese restroom.|$|E

25|$|Harlacher {{grew up in}} Camarillo, California, {{and started}} acting in school plays. When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, {{you could go to}} work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded that it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that she really got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E
25|$|The {{negotiations}} dragged on, and Colonel Zorbas {{lacked the}} political skills {{to keep up}} with the seasoned veterans on the government side. Mavromichalis, in securing passage of a large number of mildly reformist bills, implemented part of the programme demanded by the Military League, this time under threat of an actual military takeover. Thus, the general staff was reorganised and those close to Constantine (such as Ioannis Metaxas) were removed while budget cuts were made in order to finance army modernisation. But his government clearly showed that the old system endured: only Finance Minister Athanasios Eftaxias had reformist ideas. With the revolution running out of steam, the League began to crumble. It was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> political movement: its ideology and programme lacked coherence; its leaders were popular but unskilled. They were above all soldiers ill at ease outside their barracks. The League had known how to link its corporatist demands to public discontent by using populist and nationalist slogans, but it unsettled the bourgeoisie. Although it saw the necessity of modernising the country, the middle classes feared the drift towards a military dictatorship, considered deleterious to the normal progress of affairs.|$|E
