Two identical segmented nozzles, consisting of graphite inserts and silica phenolic insulation in the convergent and divergent sections, were tested at same operating condition.

The erosion rates, following the distribution of Reynolds number, exhibit an upward trend in the convergent section and decrease in the divergent section for both silicon phenolic and graphite. At high temperature, the graphite erosion rate {{is limited by the}} diffusion rate of the oxidizing species,while the erosion rate is limited by the chemical kinetics at low temperature.

Hydrazine mixtures gave similar thrust efficiencies at the same power level with specific impulse values between 395 and 430 sec. Large, spontaneous voltage mode changes were not observed once the thruster had passed a period of instability immediately following start up.

Astudy is conducted to predict carbon–carbon nozzle erosion behavior in full-scale solid-rocket motors for wide variations of motor operating conditions. The numerical model considers the solution of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations in the nozzle, heterogeneous chemical reactions at the nozzle surface, ablation species injection in the boundary layer, variable multicomponent transport and thermodynamic properties, and heat conduction in the nozzle material. Two different ablation models are considered: a diffusion-limited approach and a finite-rate approach. The numerical model is used to study the erosion of carbon–carbon <b>nozzle</b> <b>inserts</b> for the second- and third-stage solid-rocket motors of the European Vega launcher.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effect}} of nozzle area ratio on the operating characteristics and performance of a low power dc arcjet thruster. Conical thoriated tungsten nozzle inserts were tested in a modular laboratory arcjet thruster run on hydrogen/nitrogen mixtures simulating the decomposition products of hydrazine. The converging and diverging sides of the inserts had half angles of 30 and 20 degrees, respectively, similar to a flight type unit currently under development. The length of the diverging side was varied to change the area ratio. The nozzle inserts were run over a wide range of specific power. Current, voltage, mass flow rate, and thrust were monitored to provide accurate comparisons between tests. While small differences in performance were observed between the two nozzle inserts, it was determined that for each <b>nozzle</b> <b>insert,</b> arcjet performance improved with increasing nozzle area ratio to the highest area ratio tested and that the losses become very pronounced for area ratios below 50.

The actuated atomizer includes an outer shell formed by an inner ring; an outer ring; an actuator insert and a cap. A nozzle framework is positioned within the actuator insert. A {{base of the}} nozzle framework defines swirl inlets, a swirl chamber and a swirl chamber. A <b>nozzle</b> <b>insert</b> defines a center inlet and feed ports. A spool is positioned within the coil housing, and carries the coil windings having a number of turns calculated {{to result in a}} magnetic field of sufficient strength to overcome the bias of the spring. A plunger moves in response to the magnetic field of the windings. A stop prevents the pintle from being withdrawn excessively. A pintle, positioned by the plunger, moves between first and second positions. In the first position, the head of the pintle blocks the discharge passage of the nozzle framework, thereby preventing the atomizer from discharging fluid. In the second position, the pintle is withdrawn from the swirl chamber, allowing the atomizer to release atomized fluid. A spring biases the pintle to block the discharge passage. The strength of the spring is overcome, however, by the magnetic field created by the windings positioned on the spool, which withdraws the plunger into the spool and further compresses the spring...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{investigation of the}} noise produced by high-subsonic and supersonic three-stream jets was conducted. The exhaust system consisted of externally-mixed-convergent nozzles and an external plug. Bypass- and tertiary- to-core area ratios between 1. 0 and 2. 5, and 0. 4 and 1. 0, respectively, were studied. Axisymmetric and offset tertiary nozzles were investigated for heated and unheated conditions. For axisymmetric configurations, {{the addition of the}} third stream was found to reduce peak- and high-frequency acoustic levels in the peak-jet-noise direction, with greater reductions at the lower bypass-to-core area ratios. For the offset configurations, an offset duct was found to decrease acoustic levels on the thick side of the tertiary nozzle relative to those produced by the simulated two-stream jet with up to 8 dB mid-frequency noise reduction at large angles to the jet inlet axis. Noise reduction in the peak-jet-noise direction was greater for supersonic core speeds than for subsonic core speeds. The addition of a tertiary <b>nozzle</b> <b>insert</b> used to divert the third-stream jet {{to one side of the}} nozzle system provided no noise reduction. Noise predictions are presented for selected cases using a method based on an acoustic analogy with mean flow interaction effects accounted for using a Green's function, computed in terms of its coupled azimuthal modes for the offset cases, and a source model previously used for round and rectangular jets. Comparisons of the prediction results with data show that the noise model predicts the observed increase in low-frequency noise with the introduction of a third, axisymmetric stream, but not the high-frequency reduction. For an offset third stream, the model predicts the observed trend of decreased sound levels on the thick side of the jet compared with the thin side, but the predicted azimuthal variations are much less than those seen in the data. Also, the shift of the spectral peak to lower frequencies with increasing polar angle is over-predicted. For an offset third stream with a heated core, it is shown that including the enthalpy-flux source terms in the acoustic analogy model improves predictions compared with those obtained using only the momentum- flux...|$|E

Pressure and temperature surveys, combined with Mie and Rayleigh scattering visualization, were used to investigate the flow field.

The results indicate that the mixing process is dominated by the streamwise vorticity generated by the ramp, the injectors' inner geometry having a minor effect.

During control flow conditions, 30 min after the delivery of the radiolabel, 21 % of the tracer remained at the deposition site. Of the total delivered tracer, maximum blood uptake was 18 % (n = 3). When bronchial perfusion was stopped, airway retention 30 min after deposition increased to 43 %, and maximum blood uptake decreased to 7 % of the total delivered tracer.
