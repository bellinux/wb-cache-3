25|$|The decisive {{municipal}} council meeting {{was held on}} 14 April 1905, although the actual vote did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> 02 hours the following day, after a nine-hour debate. Among the issues raised was the impartiality of those councilor who owned shares in or were employed by KSS. The Ministry of Justice found neither a KSS conductor nor a councilor who owned shares in the private company as impartial. Arguments presented for privatization {{was the lack of}} profits in KKS, that the municipality would increase the number of employees, that the sale would reduce the municipal debt and that KSS had offered favorable conditions. Arguments presented for munisipalization was this would be profitable for the municipality, as it would be taking over a profitable company, that the shortfall in revenue was because of a temporary bust in the economy and that the majority of KSS was owned by foreign, German company.|$|E
500|$|French cavalry {{had similar}} {{problems}} with horses on the Western Front as the British, although {{the treatment of}} their horses created additional difficulties. [...] Opinion generally was that the French were poor horsemen: [...] "The French cavalryman of 1914 sat on his horse beautifully, but was no horsemaster. It did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> him to get off his horse's back whenever he could, so {{there were thousands of}} animals with sore backs...". One French general, Jean-François Sordet, was accused of not letting horses have access to water in hot weather. By late August 1914, a sixth of the horses in the French cavalry were unusable. [...] The French continued to eschew mounted warfare when in a June 1918 charge by French lancers the horses were left behind and the men charged on foot.|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely what I would have done or said.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Robertson {{returned}} to Australia in March 1946 {{to take over}} Southern Command. In June he was appointed to replace Lieutenant General John Northcott as commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in the occupation of Japan. Northcott had negotiated the Northcott-MacArthur agreement in January 1946 with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, which governed the terms and conditions under which the BCOF would occupy part of Japan. They agreed that the BCOF would serve under American command, with American policy being followed. It remained to make the occupation work. Robertson had a poor relationship with the British component commander, Major General David Tennant Cowan, who resented being placed under an Australian officer. [...] "It did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> me", Robertson later wrote, [...] "that officers of the British and Indian armies looked upon us from Australia and New Zealand as they looked upon Indians, and were prepared {{to do anything to}} avoid being publicly commanded by us." ...|$|E
500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy visited Meyer's {{house and}} suggested, [...] " [...] the wall comes down in outer space? You know, the Klingons {{have always been}} our stand-ins for the Russians..." [...] Meyer {{recalled}} that he replied [...] "'Oh, wait a minute! Okay, we start with an intergalactic Chernobyl! Big explosion! We got no more Klingon Empire...!' And I just spilled out the whole story!" [...] The story deliberately included references to the contemporary political climate; the character of Gorkon was based on Mikhail Gorbachev, while the assassination storyline was Meyer's idea. He thought it was plausible that the Klingon leader who turned soft towards the enemy would be killed like similar peacemakers throughout history: Anwar El Sadat, Gandhi, and Abraham Lincoln. Nimoy's hiring of Meyer was not only beneficial because Meyer knew the material and could write fast (having produced The Wrath of Khans screenplay in twelve days), but if Meyer was to direct it would offset any acrimony from Shatner, whose ire would have been aroused if Nimoy returned to direct his third Star Trek feature after [...] and The Voyage Home. Meyer {{said that when he}} started work on the screenplay it did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> him that he would direct the film. Meyer's wife {{was the first person to}} suggest that he should direct.|$|E

500|$|In 1781, the {{astronomer}} William Herschel was searching {{the sky for}} elusive stellar parallaxes, when he observed what he termed a comet in the constellation of Taurus. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased {{in proportion to the}} power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his [...] "comet", his colleague, British Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, wrote to him, saying, [...] "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it." [...] The [...] "comet" [...] was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named Uranus after the father of Saturn.|$|E

2500|$|The post-war years brought {{increased}} {{wealth and}} {{a demand for}} much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979, with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of Urban Planning and identified induced demand as a pivotal change from [...] "predict and provide" [...] toward a sustainable approach incorporating land use planning and public transit. Public investment in transit, walking and cycling declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.|$|E
2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went {{to take a closer}} look, he discovered that:two or three men were on the floor and he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|E

2500|$|The American scholar Susan Morgan called Mansfield Park {{the most}} {{difficult}} of all Austen’s novels as it features the weakest of all of Austen’s heroines who ends up the most beloved member of the Bertram family. Morgan argued that to understand the novel properly requires understanding of the capacity for characters to change or not to change. Mary Crawford, while possessing some good qualities and having much charm and vivacity is ultimately doomed by her superficiality, materialism and an inability to change. A telling example of Mary’s character occurs when says [...] "Look, where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be", as she assumes that what she sees before her is all that will ever be, and the possibility of anything else existing does <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> her. Through not devoid of kindness, Mary has a strong competitive streak that leads her to see love as a game where one party conquers and controls the other, which coupled with her cynicism and narcissism makes her insensitive towards the feelings of others, as she insists that Edmund abandons his clerical career merely it is not prestigious enough for her and her inability to appreciate improvements, as she likes things whole and lacks the discernment to value change in one's moral character and the hard work necessary to bring it about. Price by contrast is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is 10 and traces her story up to the age 17. When Price is sent to Mansfield Park, her tears at leaving the only home she has ever known, shows her awareness of the past, of who she is and was, and her wish to maintain her identity. Morgan wrote though Price is a flawed heroine, she possesses [...] "…the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge, and that generosity of mind which should illuminate our view of the people around us.". Austen also suggests change can be either for the worse or the better as Price almost succumbs to Henry Crawford’s charm and apparent reformation of character, even though she knows deep down that he is by nature malleable and undependable because he does not feel very much, and therefore whatever his passions are now will be easily replaced. Morgan argued that Price’s principle virtue is that of" [...] growing worth", her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.|$|E
