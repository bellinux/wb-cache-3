25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E
500|$|Feroz Khan's Janbaaz (1986) {{told the}} story of a man {{fighting}} the drug menace. The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested. She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period, noting, [...] "I shudder even <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of those films. As an artiste I got totally corrupted." ...|$|E
500|$|Moffat {{joked that}} [...] "since I was a kid, I've been {{thinking}} of Doctor Who monsters, just <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do, it costs the art department [...] a lot of money". To create the rigid structure of the angels' dresses, prosthetics supervisors Rob Mayor soaked fabric in fibreglass resin, which was then painted over. Although they are never shown moving on screen, all of the Weeping Angels were played by actresses Aga Blonska and Elen Thomas wearing makeup and prosthetics. The actresses wore two distinct masks: one that was more docile looking, and one with fangs bared. Blonska later noted that [...] "I'm partly painted, partly glued into the costume, but it's quite comfortable." [...] Although the actresses were slightly [...] "wobbly" [...] when they stood still, the producers used digital effects to, in essence, freeze the angels on film. Moffat was {{very pleased with the}} results, and called them [...] "fantastic". Mulligan later called the effects [...] "so good" [...] and [...] "really creepy".|$|E

2500|$|Using the Tralfamadorian {{passivity}} of fate, Billy Pilgrim {{learns to}} overlook {{death and the}} shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. [...] When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E

2500|$|Solomon, while {{noting that}} Mozart's biographers often {{left out the}} [...] "crueler memories" [...] {{surrounding}} his death, stated, [...] "Constanze Mozart told Nissen that just before the end Mozart asked her what [...] Dr. Closset had said. When she answered with a soothing lie, he said, 'It isn't true,' {{and he was very}} distressed: 'I shall die, <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am {{able to take care of}} you and the children.

[...] Mozart's older, seven-year-old son Karl was present at his father's death and later wrote, [...] "Particularly remarkable is in my opinion the fact that a few days before he died, his whole body became so swollen that the patient was unable to make the smallest movement, moreover, there was stench, which reflected an internal disintegration which, after death, increased to the extent that an autopsy was impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Zhou Yu died, he, {{along with}} Gan Ning and others, had {{constantly}} urged Sun Quan to attack Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang.

[...] Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence.

2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes.

From the time I came out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head.
