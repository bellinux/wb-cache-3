40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 The project {{focused on}} {{creating}} {{a method of}} prevention for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in low-income hospitals. PPH a severe loss of blood after a woman gives birth and {{the leading cause of}} maternal mortality worldwide. In low and middle income countries, the shortage of skilled birth attendants means that maternal death due to PPH is especially common. Uterine atony is when the uterus does not contract after birth and is {{the most common cause of}} PPH. The current method for preventing PPH is called the Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), which includes the administration of uterotonic drugs, placenta removal, and manual massage by a doctor, nurse, or midwife. The solution produced by this project is a mechanical massaging device that is meant for use when a medical professional is not available to perform the uterine massage. The design of the massaging device includes a housing, motor, turning plate, and silicone cover with a <b>nylon</b> <b>insert.</b> The silicone rests in direct contact with the patient’s skin and the turning plate applies pressure through the nylon, silicone, and skin and onto the smooth muscle of the uterus. The shear force felt by the uterus causes contraction and prevents PPH. The massaging device is held onto the patient using a vinyl securing mechanism which is weighted on each side. The weights keep the securing mechanism in place without requiring straps around the patient backs. The prototype of this device was successfully fabricated and tested during the course of this semester and proved to be effective, safe, and durable.

40|$|Polymer gel {{dosimetry}} {{has been}} shown to be an effective tool in the analysis of radiotherapy treatments in cancer therapy, being used to map the dose distribution around an irradiation pattern of a polymer gel dosimeter. Combined with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), polymer gel dosimetry can be an effective dosimetry tool to map dose distributions with high spatial resolution (∼ 100 μm). Previously polyacrylamide polymer gel dosimetry required a strict hypoxic environment to protect the gel from oxygen infiltration as oxygen inhibits the polymerization reaction used to correlate to absorbed dose. However, with the advent of normoxic polymer gels, a strict hypoxic environment is not required. Normoxic polymer gel dosimeters can be manufactured under normal atmospheric conditions. This study assessed the use of a MAGIC normoxic polymer gel dosimeter to accurately map the dose distribution of a single-line irradiation and a point source irradiation from a brachytherapy radiation source administered through a <b>nylon</b> catheter <b>inserted</b> into the gel dosimeter. The phantoms were irradiated to a dose of 10 Gy at 2 mm from the source center and imaged using high-resolution MRI with an in-plane pixel size of 0. 1055 mm/pixel.

As a result solid silver chloride particles are formed and retained on a <b>nylon</b> filter <b>inserted</b> in the line. The emission intensity is read at a silver characteristic wavelength. By plotting the drop in silver signal versus the chloride concentration, a straight line is obtained. As regards bicarbonate, this anion has been on-line transformed into carbon dioxide {{with the help of a}} 2. 0 mol L− 1 nitric acid stream. Carbon signal is linearly related with bicarbonate concentration. Finally, information about sulfate concentration has been achieved by means of the measurement of sulfur emission intensity. All the steps have been simultaneously and automatically performed. With this setup detection limits have been 1. 0, 0. 4 and 0. 09 mg L− 1 for chloride, bicarbonate and sulfate, respectively. Furthermore, it affords good precision with RSD below 6 %. Cation (Ca, Mg, Na and K) concentration, in turn, has been obtained by simultaneously reading the emission intensity at characteristic wavelengths. The obtained limits of detection have been 8 × 10 − 3, 2 × 10 − 3, 8 × 10 − 4 and 10 − 2 mg L− 1 for sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, respectively. As regards sample throughput, about 30 samples h− 1 can be analysed.

Mycorrhizal roots and extraradical mycelium increased the degradation of atrazine in soil and modified the soil enzyme activities and total soil phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Atrazine declined more and there was greater stimulation of phosphatase and dehydrogenase activities and total PLFAs in soil in the extraradical mycelium compartment than in the mycorrhizal root compartment when the atrazine addition rate to soil was 5. 0 mg kg(- 1). Mycelium had a more important influence than mycorrhizal roots on atrazine degradation. However, when the atrazine addition rate was 50. 0 mg kg(- 1). atrazine declined more in the mycorrhizal root compartment than in the extraradical mycelium compartment, perhaps due to inhibition of bacterial activity and higher toxicity to AM mycelium by atrazine at higher concentration. Soil PLFA profiles indicated that the AM fungus exerted a pronounced effect on soil microbial community structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In the {{amphibian}} urinary bladder, water permeability {{is correlated}} with the insertion of intramembrane particle aggregates (IMPAs) into the apical plasma membrane (AM) of the granular cells. These aggregates are believed to contain water channels. Characterization of the IMPAs by comparing AM fractions of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) -treated and resting epithelia requires isolation and purification of AM-rich material, free of other cytoplasmic aggregate-containing organelles, in both cases. A technique derived from freeze-fracture was chosen to isolate large sheets of apical membrane material from frog (Rana esculenta) urinary bladder epithelium. The apical side was plated on a polylysine-coated glass slide, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and fractured. A <b>nylon</b> mesh was <b>inserted</b> between the glass slide and the bladder, {{in order to bring}} the fracture plane back to the AM periodically.

A phase contrast picture was obtained only at a high magnification, indicating a low thickness of the recovered material. Further characterization was made with SDS-PAGE. Protein contents of samples were extracted under various experimental conditions and the patterns of ADH-treated, resting AM samples, or whole epithelial cell crude homogenates, were compared.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an experimental model {{for the study of}} local prostaglandin production by platelets and the vessel wall following stimulation 'in vivo'. A <b>nylon</b> thread was <b>inserted</b> into the external jugular vein of rabbits; its presence did not induce an occluding thrombus. Thromboxane (TXB 2) values in the blood, sampled through the facial vein, immediately distal to the stimulus, rose and remained high for at least 4 hr, while 6 -keto prostaglandin (PG) F 1 alpha levels, after a first increase, gradually returned to normal ('exhaustion' of the endothelial cells?). No changes were observed in the contralateral jugular vein without thread. After infusion via the femoral vein of 10 mg/kg dazoxiben, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, local TXB 2 production was completely abolished, whereas 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha formation no longer returned to basal values, but tended to increase. This leads to the conclusion that upon inhibition of TXB 2 formation endoperoxide metabolism is reoriented 'in vivo' towards prostacyclin, and this mainly at the site where platelets are activated. Injection of 100 mg/kg lysine acetylsalicylic acid resulted in complete inhibition of TXB 2 and 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha formation, the latter, however, slowly recovering with time. The administration of nafazatrom to the animals did not influence the local TXB 2 changes, but partially prevented the decline of 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha with time. The antithrombotic properties of this drug thus could be related to protection of the endothelial cells from 'exhaustion'. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of a microdialysis technique for measurement of substances in the interstitial water space in intact human skin. Glucose was selected to validate the method. The cutaneous glucose concentration was measured by microdialysis and compared to that in venous blood. Single dialysis fibers (length 20 mm, 2, 000 Da molecular weight cutoff) were glued to <b>nylon</b> tubings and <b>inserted</b> in forearm skin by means of a fine needle. Dialysis fibers were inserted in duplicate. Seven subjects were investigated after an overnight fast. Intradermal position of the dialysis probes was established by C-mode ultrasound scanning. The implantation trauma lasted 90 – 135 min as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Each dialysis fiber was calibrated in vivo by perfusing it with four to five different glucose concentrations. The perfusion rate was 3 μl/min. Regression analysis of the calibration curves yielded the relative in vivo recovery of glucose. The skin glucose concentration was calculated as that particular perfusate glucose concentration that resulted in no net glucose transport across the dialysis membrane. Correlation coefficient of the regression lines was 0. 93 ± 0. 03 (mean ± SEM). After the injection trauma had vanished, recovery was 20. 5 ± 0. 7 %. Coefficient of variation (CV) on recovery was 10. 9 %. The cutaneous glucose concentration was 99. 1 ± 1. 8 % of the glucose concentration in venous plasma water (CV 4. 1 %).

Corn of a high (flint) and a low (dent) vitreousness variety was ground over a 3 -mm screen, weighed in nylon bags with a pore size of 37 µ m, and washed in cold water. Samples of washed cornstarch were incubated in 40 -mL tubes with faunated and defaunated ruminal fluid. An additional amount of washed corn, in <b>nylon</b> bags, was <b>inserted</b> in each incubation tube. Incubations were carried out for 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h, and starch residue in tube and nylon bag was determined. In general, starch disappearance from the nylon bag was less than from the tube, and was less with faunated than defaunated rumen fluid, but corn variety did not affect starch disappearance. When no protozoa were present, the disappearance of starch from the bags was higher after 6 and 12 h incubation compared with presence of protozoa. However, in the tubes, {{there was no difference}} in starch disappearance due to presence or absence of protozoa. Estimated lag time was higher in presence (4. 6 h) then absence (3. 6 h) of protozoa. It was concluded that the effect of presence or absence of protozoa on starch disappearance differs within or outside nylon bags. The reduced disappearance rate of starch inside the nylon bags in the presence of protozoa helps to explain the underestimation of starch degradation based on the in sacco procedure when compared with in vivo data upon incubation of slowly degradable starch sources...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{protective}} effects of Naomaitong, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, used together with thrombolysis therapy, on injuries of the lung and stomach in rats with cerebral ischemia. Methods: Rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, untreated group, urokinase group (thrombolysis group), Naomaitong group, thrombolysis plus Naomaitong group. Cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by autonomous blood blot and <b>inserted</b> <b>nylon</b> thread. Rats were administrated with thrombolysis therapy through artery 3, 6 and 9 h after cerebral ischemia respectively. Twenty-four {{hours after the}} administration, mortality of the rats, and the brain and stomach hemorrhage ratios, {{as well as the}} pathological changes of the brain, lung and stomach were observed, and then cerebral infarct size (CIS) and lung water ratio (LWR) were measured. Results: Compared with the sham-operated group, the rat mortality, and the brain and stomach hemorrhage ratios increased, the CIS enlarged, pathological changes of the brain, lung and stomach appeared obvious, and the LWR increased. Naomaitong plus thrombolysis treatment improved the changes above significantly. In the untreated rats with cerebral ischemia, injuries of the brain, lung and stomach were aggravated, the CIS enlarged and the LWR increased in the 9 h group as compared with those in the 3 h group. In the thrombolysis plus Naomaitong group, the pathological changes were improved, the CIS diminished and the LWR reduced. Conclusions: Injuries of the lung and stomach can be caused by cerebral ischemia, and the impairment was exacerbated following the prolongation of the ischemia. Thrombolysis therapy can cause brain and stomach hemorrhage. Thrombolysis therapy used early can perform protection against the injuries. Naomaitong, used together with thrombolysis, can reduce the mortality，the brain and stomach hemorrhage ratios, and perform protective effects on the injuries of cerebral ischemia...|$|R

Twenty samples of maize silage and 20 samples of grass silage were used. The samples were selected to represent a broad range in digestibility and chemical composition. Prior to the intestinal incubations, samples were incubated in the rumen for 6 h (starch), 12 h (CP) or 24 h (aNDFom) using the rumen nylon bag technique. Residues from the rumen incubations were transferred to mobile <b>nylon</b> bags and <b>inserted</b> in the duodenum through a cannula. Half of the bags for CP and starch were collected from the ileal cannula and the remaining half of the bags from the faeces. For aNDFom, all the bags were collected from faeces.
