Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E

5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing <b>number</b> <b>is</b> even if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing <b>number</b> <b>is</b> zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
