5000|$|The Kennedy Round officially {{opened on}} May 4, 1964, at the Palais des Nations. It {{was the last}} GATT round to have tariff {{reduction}} as its primary focus. However, {{it was the first}} GATT round to deal with <b>non-tariff</b> <b>issues,</b> such as dumping, a practice whereby a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it charges in its home market. It notably also pioneered a [...] "linear" [...] style of negotiations. In contrast to the item-by-item negotiations of previous GATT rounds, many countries offered across-the-board cuts of a certain percentage on all tariffs of participating countries. Members of the so-called [...] "Bridge Club"—the United States, European Economic Community, Japan, and the UK—led the negotiations and offered linear cuts. Six other European countries joined them in linear cuts. Another 36 countries were nonlinear participators, a difference which led to tension within the negotiations, as linear countries often felt nonlinear countries had no right to participate in the [...] "confrontation and justice" [...] procedure for dealing with proposed exceptions. Thus, although the Kennedy Administration had originally contemplated finishing the round in six months, the round was plagued with delays and slow progress. In addition to the linear and nonlinear divides, disputes arose over agricultural policy and tariff disparities. The United States wanted Europe to agree to cut farm tariffs before moving on to industrial tariffs, but gridlock forced the United States to relent. Only low expectations stopped the concluding agricultural agreements from being considered a disaster. Further, equivalent percentage cuts to high U.S. tariffs (18% on average) and medium EEC tariffs (12% on average [...] ) were seen to favor the United States. Since President Lyndon Johnson had little chance of success in reauthorizing the Trade Expansion Act, its July 1, 1967 deadline served as the effective deadline for the Kennedy round. After a marathon session, negotiators announced a satisfactory agreement at a midnight meeting with the press on May 15, 1967. The final agreement was signed on June 30, 1967. However, within the United States, Congress repealed several provisions of the round of global tariff cuts, hurting the future credibility of the United States in worldwide trade negotiations.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor thesis Analysis of {{expectation}} of the EU from TTIP is an overview analysis. This text covers four main areas regarding TTIP. Those topics are engineering industry, automotive industry, public procurements and agriculture. The analysis covers {{expectations of the}} European Union, partly of the Czech Republic and touches expectations of the United States of America a little bit. The author used only official document of the governmental institutions and scientific documents as resources. Any scientific documents and official papers issued before 8 th of November 2016 were not used. The reason behind that are American presidential elections. Those elections shifted expectations from the TTIP. Unofficial and non-professional texts were not used at all. The analysis follows topics from several points of view. Those perspectives are social sphere, tariff measures, <b>non-tariff</b> <b>issues,</b> possible gains, and controversial topics. Requirements regarding the customer's safety are included as well. Possible changes in regulations are also analyzed. The text is interspersed with figures that support numerical data...|$|E
40|$|Information and {{communications}} technology (ICT) {{has been seen}} as a major contributor to productivity growth and as a key tool for innovation. Trade liberalisation can play a role in encouraging ICT adoption by fostering competition and by reducing ICT prices. While the trade in ICT goods has more than doubled since the mid- 1990 s, the share of trade involving low and middle income countries has significantly increased, with China now being the largest trader. During the same period, tariff levels have declined {{thanks in part to the}} Information Technology Agreement (ITA), although substantial tariffs remain with respect to ICT goods not covered by the ITA and by those imposed by non-participants to the ITA. The multilateral trading system produced early successes in the ITA and the negotiations on basic telecommunications at the World Trade Organization (WTO), but the progress has since been more modest. Yet it provides opportunities to further trade liberalisation in ICT goods, both with respect to tariffs and to <b>non-tariff</b> <b>issues,</b> not least through the Doha negotiations.

40|$|The {{issue of}} free trade has fueled {{political}} debate in North America for the past decade. The authors, members of the Canadian free trade negotiating team, provide an inside view and defense of the Canada-US. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Their three-part story begins with ail outline of the economic theory and macroeconomic reality that prompted Canada and the United States to consider free trade. It also reveals the political skirmishes in Canada and the US. that {{set the stage for}} FTA negotiations. Section two delineates the actual free trade negotiations, key negotiators, and issues. The authors describe how philosophical differences over the implications {{of free trade}} nearly derailed the FTA. While Canadians viewed it as the most important trade agreement in the twentieth century, Americans considered the FTA as a mere opportunity to resolve existing trade irritants and a step towards renewed multilateral trade relations. The final section describes how this impasse was surmounted by dogged determination and last-minute compromise (hence the title, Decision at Midnight). While the book presents a Canadian perspective, there is much to interest American readers. The authors deftly summarize the history of US. Canada trade relations and the personalities involved. They also explain why agriculture was such a controversial issue during the trade talks: Canada insisting on retaining its agricultural marketing boards and supply management programs; the United States staunchly defending its farm subsidies and import quotas. As a result, agriculture was largely exempted from the FTA due to <b>non-tariff</b> <b>issues...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{period of}} the ‘Tensions’ in Solomon Islands, from 1999 to 2002, forms the {{backdrop}} to recent developments. In 1998 a militant group, the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army (later renamed the Isatabu Freedom Fighters) began a violent campaign against people from the island of Malaita {{with the aim of}} removing them from Guadalcanal. In 1999 the violence escalated when the Malaitan Eagle Force, a militant group made up of disenfranchised Malaitans, reacted violently. Honiara, along with other parts of Guadalcanal, became lawless and unstable. During the conﬂict as a whole an estimated 20, 000 or more people were displaced and up to 200 killed (UNDP 2004). GDP fell 24 %, many businesses closed and the central authorities struggled to govern eﬀectively. By 2002 the Government was insolvent. In 2003, {{at the request of the}} Solomon Islands Government, the Australianled Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) was put together to restore law and order. Afer the RAMSI intervention the Government reprioritised its budget and consolidated and renegotiated its debts. A large-scale technical assistance program is underway in a number of areas. Despite RAMSI’s successes and rapid economic growth in the years afer its intervention, a number of macroeconomic challenges remain, which are discussed in Chapter one. Tese include moving away from reliance on logging as a source of export earnings and fscal revenues. Some of the causes of the Tensions still exist, including the economic divide between urban areas, provincial capitals and rural areas. Inﬂation has become an increasing challenge in recent months, although the slowing global economy and the division between the capital and outlying areas may somewhat reduce the need for greater fscal austerity and tighter monetary policy, despite rapid growth in the money supply over recent years. Given the difculties that many frms face in obtaining credit, the expansion of fnancial services, particularly outside the capital, may serve the dual ends of making growth more equal and assisting with the expansion of productive capacity. Solomon Islands, like many other Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Pacifc island economies, has considerable market access to both developed and developing economies. Te key challenge is to develop the supply side to take advantage of this market access, which will require building the institutional capacity to better develop and implement trade policy. To a large extent the task of Government in years to come is to defend the policy space required to enact strategic policies, and to develop the required capabilities. Tis will require signifcant donor co-oper ation, in some areas in the form of a ‘hands-oﬀ ’ approach, rather than increased intervention. Wider consultation on economic and trade policy is also vital, along with greater inter-Ministerial coordination. Chapter two, on cross-cutting issues, identifes land and fnancial services as among the most pressing issues facing the business environment and productive capacity. Some recommendations are made as to how to improve the use of land and access to fnancial services. Te chapter also includes shorter sections on transport and infrastructure; utilities and energy; information communications technology. Chapter three examines the business environment and investment policy, with particular emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Te chapter frst presents some features of doing business in Solomon Islands and makes an assessment of the most pressing priorities. Next, some key characteristics of the public and private sector are outlined, with some examples of some of the challenges facing representative private-sector players. Afer this is a discussion of investment and investment policy, followed by a look at the key institutions aﬀecting the business environment, as well as training and human resources development. Chapter four addresses trade facilitation, which currently receives relatively little attention. Considerable institutional improvements can be achieved. Te frst priority should be to re-establish the National Trade Facilitation or Trade Policy Committee and formulate an active work program. Customs reform should involve a clearer, costed and sequenced modernisation program. Solomon Islands is likely to encounter increased SPS challenges in the years ahead, particularly if it successfully builds productive capacity and diversifes exports, and a number of recommendations are made in this area. Reform in the area of standards and conformance should focus mainly on metrology in the frst instance, while a training program with Papua New Guinea’s National Institute for Standards and Industrial Technology may be a useful step towards greater regional co-operation. Chapter five, on trade policy, frst provides a summary of the trade regime including trade taxes, <b>non-tariﬀ</b> <b>issues</b> and relevant legislation. Policy objectives are then identifed, with suggestions for designing and implementing these objectives. Te chapter provides a descriptive analysis of the existing institutional framework for trade and trade-related policy making, with discussions on the current constraints and opportunities for improvement. A suggested basic position on trade negotiations is also presented. Chapter six, on trade and human development, focuses on inequality and poverty, which are of particular concern when economic activity is becoming increasingly concentrated around natural resources such as logging and minerals. Gender and health issues receive considerable attention, along with the environmental impact of mineral extraction. Numerous opportunities exist—many trade-related—to address these challenges. Tis chapter analyses the challenges, documents some opportunities and puts forward a set of policy recommendations aimed at ensuring that human development is achieved across the country and that resources are used in a sustainable and equitable manner. Chapter seven outlines the key challenges facing the country’s largest economic sector—logging and forestry. Forest resource governance is inadequate, both economically and environmentally, while girls and women tend to suﬀer most and receive the fewest benefts from the industry. Using participatory methods, the chapter shows how the state’s actions and inaction have contributed to resource exploitation. Te chapter also shows how existing opportunities in plantation forestry and downstream processing could lead to sustainable growth. Te chapter discusses the obstacles and opportunities for future sources of income from the trade of environmental services like carbon credits, forestry plantations, especially sustainable logging; value-addition and linkages; land ownership as it relates to forestry and logging. Chapter eight assesses the agriculture, agro-processing and livestock (AAL) sector in terms of identifying the trade gaps which need to be flled in order to mainstream trade into development planning and poverty reduction strategies and to assist in the co-ordinated delivery of trade-related technical assistance. More specifcally, the focus of the chapter is on the improved commercialization and value enhancement to both traditional agricultural products and emerging higher value commodities. Te chapter assesses and prioritises key issues such as the potential for growth and sustainability; current bottlenecks and trade gaps; value creation and addition; expansion, and the integration of stakeholders along the production and supply chains. Current initiatives are assessed and possible future areas of donor assistance proposed. Chapter nine addresses fsheries and aquaculture. In the short to medium term the industrial tuna sector is one of the sectors capable of flling the gap lef in foreign exchange as logging declines. Small-scale fsheries and aquaculture have less potential to contribute to national aggregate economic fgures but are vital in terms of food security and livelihoods for rural areas. Te chapter examines the background to the fsheries sector, including its contribution to the economy and governance issues, before moving on to a description and analysis of tuna fsheries and processing, coastal and nearshore fsheries, and aquaculture. Chapter ten begins with an overview of the tourism sector’s development, before making an assessment of the current size and characteristics of the sector and its clients. While the industry is at an embryonic stage, the country’s natural geography make it an ideal tourist destination, and considerable progress can be achieved in this area. A comparative assessment of Solomon Islands tourism product is then presented—focusing on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Te discussion subsequently focuses on ways in which visitor yield can be enhanced—with a particular emphasis on poverty alleviation...|$|E
