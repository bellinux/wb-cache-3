5|$|The 3.1 Sarge {{release was}} made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of the {{software}} and included over 9,000 new packages. A new installer with a modular design, Debian-Installer, allowed installations with RAID, XFS and LVM support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates {{that it must be}} solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74TBq (20Curie) of radioactive activity. In a recent example, the ships Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331kg (730lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River, South Carolina.|$|E

The shooting was baffling to those who knew him, as he appeared outgoing and never appeared to have social problems. This has also confused investigators, who have not found a suicide note. Some of Kazmierczak's former NIU roommates described him as a quiet man who usually stayed to himself. [...] They stated that, while fairly normal, they did not see him spend much time with other students.|$|E
500|$|The {{large sums}} of money being made and spent caused an upsurge in crime and illicit {{activity}} in towns along the pipeline route. This was exacerbated by the fact that police officers and state troopers resigned in large groups to become pipeline security guards at wages far in excess of those available in public-sector jobs. Fairbanks' Second Avenue became a notorious hangout for prostitutes, and dozens of bars operated throughout town. In 1975, the Fairbanks Police Department estimated between 40 and 175 prostitutes were working in the city of 15,000 people. Prostitutes brought pimps, who then engaged in [...] In 1976, police responded to a shootout between warring pimps who wielded automatic firearms. By and large, however, the biggest police issue was the number of drunken brawls and fighting. On the pipeline itself, thievery was a major problem. Poor accounting and record keeping allowed large numbers of tools and large amounts of equipment to be stolen. The Los Angeles Times reported in 1975 that as many as 200 of Alyeska's 1,200 yellow-painted trucks were missing from Alaska and [...] "scattered from Miami to Mexico City". Alyeska denied the problem and said only 20–30 trucks were missing. The theft problem was typified by pipeliners' practice of mailing empty boxes to pipeline camps. The boxes then would be filled with items and shipped out. After Alyeska ruled that all packages had to be sealed {{in the presence of a}} security guard, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> being sent from camps dropped by 75 percent.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{introduce}} a new multi-objective optimization problem derived from a real-world application: the package server location problem. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> servers are to be located at nodes of a network. Demand for these package servers is located at each node, and a subset of nodes are to be chosen to locate one or more package servers. Each client is statically associated to a package server. The objective is to minimize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> servers while maximizing the efficiency and {{the reliability of the}} broadcast <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> to clients. These objectives are contradictory: the broadcast becomes more efficient as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> servers increases. This problem is analyzed as a multi-objective optimization problem and a mathematical formulation is proposed. In addition, the criteria combination can be specified via a small dedicated language. Results for exact multi-objective solution approaches based on mixed integer linear programming are reported...|$|R

40|$|Packaging the {{integrated}} circuit (IC) chip {{is a necessary}} step in the manufacturing process of IC products. In general, wafers with {{the same size and}} process should have a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaged</b> dies. However, many factors decrease the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the actually <b>packaged</b> dies, such as die scratching, die contamination, and die breakage, which are not considered in the existing die-counting methods. Here we propose a robust method that can automatically determine the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> actual <b>packaged</b> dies by using machine vision techniques. During the inspection, the image is taken {{from the top of the}} wafer, in which most dies have been removed and packaged. There are five steps in the proposed method: wafer region detection, wafer position calibration, dies region detection, detection of die sawing lines, and die number counting. The abnormal cases of fractional dies in the wafer boundary and dropped dies during the packaging are considered in the proposed method as well. The experimental results show that the precision and recall rates reach 99. 83 % and 99. 84 %, respectively, when determining the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> actual <b>packaged</b> dies in the 41 test cases...|$|R

60|$|The Miss Maplesones {{and their}} {{accomplished}} parent {{arrived in the}} course of the afternoon in a hackney-coach, and accompanied by a most astonishing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages.</b> Trunks, bonnet-boxes, muff-boxes and parasols, guitar-cases, and parcels of all imaginable shapes, done up in brown paper, and fastened with pins, filled the passage. Then, there was such a running up and down with the luggage, such scampering for warm water for the ladies to wash in, and such a bustle, and confusion, and heating of servants, and curling-irons, as had never been known in Great Coram-street before. Little Mrs. Tibbs was quite in her element, bustling about, talking incessantly, and distributing towels and soap, like a head nurse in a hospital. The house was not restored to its usual state of quiet repose, until the ladies were safely shut up in their respective bedrooms, engaged in the important occupation of dressing for dinner.|$|E

Looking at the mountainous heap of our luggage the night before, we had missed a great carpet-bag; and we now found that Miss M------'s trunk had been {{substituted}} for it, and, there being the proper <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> as registered, it was impossible to convince the officials that anything was wrong. We, of course, began to generalize forthwith, and pronounce the incident to be characteristic of French morality. They love a certain system and external correctness, but do not trouble themselves to be deeply in the right; and Miss M------ suggested that there used to be parallel cases in the French Revolution, when, so long as the assigned number were sent out of prison to be guillotined, the jailer did not much care whether they were the persons designated by the tribunal or not. At all events, we could get no satisfaction about the carpet-bag, and shall very probably be compelled to leave Marseilles without it.|$|E
