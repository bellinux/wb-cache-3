5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast of Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression turned toward the <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Mount Vision, the two roads {{parallel}} {{each other}} {{into the town}} of Hartwick, where both intersect with another highway crossing Otego Creek, CR11D. The roads enter the hamlet of Jones Crossing, intersecting with another crossroad, the locally maintained Jones Crossing Road. In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing, NY205 intersects with CR45's western terminus. The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 end a short distance to the <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the community on the east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego.|$|E
5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E

5|$|During {{the field}} season of 1987 (early July), {{volunteer}} Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485. By {{the end of}} August, it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. On 23 June 1988, another site was discovered in the vicinity – the Blacktail Creek <b>North.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1989, graduate student Scott D.

5|$|During {{the winter}} the English murdered Earl William and Robert fitz Richard, the {{custodian}} {{of the new}} castle at York, and trapped William Malet, the first Norman sheriff of York, in the castle. King William went <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring or summer of 1069, relieved the siege of Malet, and restored the castle, placing William fitz Osbern in charge. The leaders of the revolt were Edgar the Ætheling (claimant to the English throne), Gospatric of Northumbria, and, among others, Mærle-Sveinn, former sheriff of Lincoln, and many senior Northumbria nobles.|$|E
5|$|Early {{inhabitants}} of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, and various ethnic groups {{of the west and}} northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms.

5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E

5|$|In 1508, the Caribbean {{coast of}} Honduras was superficially {{explored}} by Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez, but {{the focus of}} their expeditions lay further to the <b>north.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1510s, expeditions from the Spanish settlements on Cuba and Hispaniola reported that the Bay Islands were inhabited.

5|$|It {{undertakes}} seasonal {{movements in}} response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return <b>north</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall.

Wandering birds can turn up far beyond the normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.|$|E
