Information was taken from sources published between 1970 - 2010, especially from the database PubMed, drugsafetysite. com, and from publications in The Essential Guide To Herbal Safety and Léčiva v těhotenství - vliv léků a vitamínů na zdravý vývoj plodu. Absolutely contraindicated drugs found were Arnicae flos, Absinthii herba and <b>Boldo</b> <b>folium.</b> The paper also briefly discussed the inappropriateness of substance abuse during pregnancy and lactation. The issue of safety for pregnant women has not been clearly answered among other plants such as Rubi idei folium, Leonuri cardiacae herba, Ginkgo folium, Angelicae sinensis radix or Andrographis paniculatae herba. The work also included an overview of positive and harmful effects of vitamins and minerals in pregnancy. Keywords: pregnancy, {{medicinal plants}}, drug, contraindication...|$|R

Rodriguez;C. Theoduloz. Departamento de Ciencias Biomedicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Talca, Casilla 747, Talca, Chile. The dry {{leaves of}} Peumus boldus (Monimiaceae) {{are used in}} {{infusion}} or decoction as a digestive and to improve hepatic complains. Preliminary assays showed free-radical scavenging activity in hot water extracts of boldo leaves, measured by the decoloration of a methanolic solution of the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl radical (DPPH). Assay-guided isolation led to the active compounds. Catechin {{proved to be the}} main free-radical scavenger of the extracts. Lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes was inhibited by boldo extracts and fractions at 500 Î¼g/ml with higher effect for the ethyl acetate soluble and alkaloid fractions. The IC[sub 50] for catechin and boldine in the lipid peroxidation test were 75. 6 and 12. 5 Î¼g/ml, respectively. On the basis of dry starting material, the catechin content in the crude drug was 2. 25 % while the total alkaloid calculated as boldine was 0. 06 %. The activity of boldine was six times higher than catechin in the lipid peroxidation assay. However, the mean catechin:total alkaloid content ratio was 37 : 1. The relative concentration of alkaloids and phenolics in boldo leaves and their activity suggest that free-radical scavenging effect is mainly due to catechin and flavonoids and that antioxidant effect is mainly related with the catechin content. The high catechin content of boldo leaves and its bioactivity suggest that quality control of <b>Boldo</b> <b>folium</b> has to combine the analysis of catechin as well as their characteristic aporphine alkaloids...|$|R
