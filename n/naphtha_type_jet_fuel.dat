40|$|Abstract. There {{are mainly}} four {{pathways}} to get liquid fuels from the coal including the direct liquefaction process, the Fischer-Tropsch process, coal-tar refining, and pyrolysis process. The characteristics {{of these four}} processed have been described. As the first two pathways {{are considered to be}} promising, the characteristics of these two <b>types</b> of coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are discussed and the component characteristics of coal-based synthesis fuels are investigated, respectively. The component characteristics of coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are compared with the traditional petroleum-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> There are large differences between the properties of the coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> via direct and indirect liquefaction pathways. Comparing with the conventional petroleum-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> the coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> via direct liquefaction pathway has the higher aromatics content, while the fuel via indirect pathway (F-T process) has more paraffin and nearly no naphthenes or aromatics.

50|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>fuel</b> is {{very similar}} to diesel fuel, and in some cases, may be burned in diesel engines. The {{possibility}} of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas, and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance, has left aircraft designers and pilot's organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft. As a result, a few aircraft engine manufacturers, most notably Thielert and Austro Engine, have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> This technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> required. <b>Jet</b> <b>fuel</b> is available in most places in the world, whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of general aviation aircraft. A diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine. However, very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities. Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today, even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the Junkers Jumo 205 family had been used during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} {{of light}} fuel oil, very similar to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are <b>Jet</b> A-1 <b>type</b> <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, cetane number). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|R

Compressed air at room temperature is supplied with a blower, and is injected into the atmosphere through the co-axial channels. Distilled water is supplied with a liquid pump, and is injected from hole nozzles mounted in the pintle. The number of nozzles is 8 and 16. The liquid jets impinge onto impingement walls mounted on the intermediate ring, forming a free liquid film. From {{the tip of the}} liquid film, fine droplets are formed. The droplet size is measured using an LDSA, and the spray cross section is visualized using time-average Mie scattering method. It is shown that the droplet size is almost the same as the atomization of a simple wall impingement jet, which is much smaller than that for a conventional air-blast fuel injector, and it is observed that a relatively uniform spray is formed using the fuel injector...|$|R

Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by turbine engines, either turbofans or turboprops.

The use of a common <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> - kerosene-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> - is another advantage. Prior to the Jet Age, it was common for the same or very similar engines to be used in civilian airliners as in military aircraft.

Surrogate fuels are defined as mixtures of few hydrocarbon compounds with combustion characteristics {{similar to those of}} commercial fuels. The combustion characteristics considered here are extinction and autoignition in laminar non premixed flows. The ‘‘reference’’ fuels used as components for the surrogates of <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are n-decane, n-dodecane, methylcyclohexane, toluene, and o-xylene. Three surrogates are constructed by mixing these components in proportions to their chemical <b>types</b> found in <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> Experiments are conducted in the counterflow system. The fuels tested are the components of the surrogates, the surrogates, and the <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> A fuel stream made up of a mixture of fuel vapors and nitrogen is injected into a mixing layer from one duct of a counterflow burner. Air is injected from the other duct into the same mixing layer. The strain rate at extinction is measured {{as a function of the}} mass fraction of fuel in the fuel stream. The temperature of the air at autoignition is measured as a function of the strain rate at a fixed value of the mass fraction of fuel in the fuel stream. The measured values of the critical conditions of extinction and autoignition for the surrogates show that they are slightly more reactive than the <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> Numerical calculations {{are carried out}} using a semi-detailed chemical-kinetic mechanism.

40|$|The key {{motivation}} {{for this work}} was {{the potential impact of}} alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> use on emissions that contribute to global climate change. This work focused on one specific aspect in examining the feasibility of using alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> - their life-cycle Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions relative to conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> This involved the quantification of the overall GHG emissions of potential alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuels,</b> from feedstock recovery and transportation, to the production, transportation and utilization of the fuels. The fuels examined in this work included <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> and ultra-low sulfur <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from conventional crude, <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from oil sands and oil shale, Fischer-Tropsch <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from natural gas, coal and biomass, and biojet from soy oil and palm oil. By identifying and varying important input parameters, a range of life-cycle GHG emissions for each fuel pathway was derived. From the analyses in this work, only alternative <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> from biomass offer substantial life-cycle GHG emissions reductions compared to conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> and that is true only if land use change emissions were negligible. Direct or indirect land use changes from the use of biomass feedstocks (particularly food crops) could potentially increase life-cycle GHG emissions to levels several times above that of conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> A scenario analysis was conducted to examine the amount of biofuel needed to displace conventional <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> in 2025 to maintain U. S. aviation GHG emissions at baseline 2006 levels. It was found that the large-scale deployment of biofuels to achieve carbon-neutral U. S. aviation growth through 2025 was limited by feedstock and land availability if current generation biofuels (particularly those made from food crops) were used. Hence, it is important to explore the use of next generation non-food, high yield feedstocks (e. g. algae) that use little land and result in little or no land use change emissions for large-scale biofuel production. by Hsin Min Wong.

Activity was assessed by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis. <b>Jet</b> <b>fuel</b> disappeared much more rapidly from surface soil than it did from subsurface soil.
