40|$|SUMMARY. The rare <b>nickel</b> <b>telluride</b> mineral melonite is {{identified}} from Jaduguda uranium ore, Singhbhum Shear Zone, Bihar, India. Its physical, optical, chemical, and paragenetic characteristics are described. The com-position as obtained by EPMA is NiTel. 66 Bi 0. 06 or approximately Ni 3 (Te,Bi) 5. The association of melonite with molybenite in this ore deposit is unusual, since melonite isgenerally associated with tellurides {{of gold and}} silver. This is the first reported occurrence of melonite from India. DURING {{the course of an}} intensive mineralogi-ca l study of uranium prospects from parts of Singh-bhum Shear Zone, Bihar (Rao, i 977), the rare <b>nickel</b> <b>telluride</b> mineral melonite was identified in a few samples from the Jaduguda uranium mine. Though several telluride minerals have been re-ported from different parts of the Singhbhum Shear Zone, melonite has not previously been reported. This occurrence is also new to India. Occurrence. The mineral which was later identi-fied as melonite has been observed in a few samples of an apatite-magnetite vein from the o-metre l vel as well as in a millerite-rich sample from 165 -metre level in the Jaduguda uranium mine. In the former it is closely associated with molybdenite and occurs as fracture fillings in the form of coarse xenomor-phic grains and flakes in a matrix of apatite, mag-netite, chlorite, and quartz (figs. I and 2). Veinlets traversing cracks and cleavages in molybdenite are also common (fig. 2). In the I 65 -metre level sample it occurs as skeletal particles in chalcopyrite associated with molybdenite, gersdorffite, and millerite. Physical and optical properties.

40|$|Heat {{capacities}} of the <b>nickel</b> <b>tellurides</b> were measured at compositions NiTe 1. 1 and NiTe 2. 0 (near limits of homogeneity of the δ phase) {{and at one}} intermediate composition, NiTe 1. 5, from 5 to 350 °K. Heat capacity values and entropy and enthalpy increments are tabulated. No evidence of order‐disorder transitions, or thermal anomalies, or of contributions to the thermal properties from the anisotropy or phonon scattering by {{the holes in the}} structure on approaching the composition NiTe 2 was observed. Although simple additivity of the heat {{capacities of}} the constituent elements failed to represent that of the solution compositions adequately, a Kopp‐Neumann treatment in terms of the limiting compositions of the δ phase gives good agreement with the experimental heat capacity and entropy of NiTe 1. 5 and hence is useful in interpolating to other intermediate compositions...|$|R

In this study, pure Ni foil was directly bonded to PbTe-based thermoelectric materials using a rapid hot-press. The materials were sintered at 600 and 650 °C, under a pressure of 40 MPa and for various holding times. The resulting interfacial microstructures of the Ni/PbTe joints were investigated. Additionally, the distributions of elements and the phases formed at the Ni/PbTe interface were analyzed. The β_ 2 phase (Ni_(3 ±x) Te_ 2, 38. 8 – 41 at. % Te) was identified at the Ni/PbTe joints bonded at both 600 and 650 °C. A ternary phase with approximate composition Ni_ 5 Pb_ 2 Te_ 3 was found at the Ni/PbTe joints bonded at 650 °C.

As one of the transition metal chalcogenides, <b>nickel</b> <b>telluride,</b> NiTe 2, has been deposited {{in the form of}} thin film onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates to be further developed into thin film solar cell. Though there is no reported literature about the use of NiTe 2 to function as a solar cell, this has the high potential to be the candidate material of a solar cell. The syntheses of telluride thin films involve several techniques such as physical vapour deposition (PVD), metal organic vapour chemical deposition (MOCVD), solvothermal methods, coreduction method (in-situ) and electrodeposition (Peng et al. 2003). The PVD technique is excellent for good-quality film growth but is difficult to scale up (Anand et al. 2013 a). The absorber layers for high-quality devices are typically synthesised via high vacuum deposition processes such as co-evaporation that is costly due to initial cost of equipment and production of vacuum (Ikeda et al. 2011).|$|E

Pt metals average 0. 027 g/ton Pt and 0. 048 g/ton Pd in the ultramafic body. A detailed microscopic, microprabe, and analyti-cal study of the Pt metals and minerals reveals that sperrylite is the only independent Pt mineral. Of the Pd minerals, michenerite and Pd-bearing irarsite, as well as an un-named Bi-bearing <b>nickel</b> <b>telluride</b> resembling melonite, have been recognized and analyzed. The tenor of Ir and Rh is generally below the limit of detection, although homoaxiaI, zonal intergrowths of irarsite, hollingworthite, and nickelfan cobaltite have been encountered in Pt- and Pd-rich samples. An R-mode factor analysis was applied to the analytical data to establish the mutual relationships between the base metals and the metals of the platinum group. The dis-tribution of the platinum metals coincides rather well with that of the sulfides, although in detail platinum is enriched in certain tectonic zones close to sulfide mineralization.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Solar cell {{is one of}} the {{promising}} alternative green energy sources that can provide free electricity when sunlight is converted. The absorbent materials and their synthesis methods are subject of interest mainly due to solar panel installation cost despite of free electricity generated. The well-known silicon solar cells made, either amorphous or polycrystalline are good in conversion efficiency up to 17 %, but their high cost make the researchers to look for alternate materials. Semiconducting materials in thin film form such as InP, SnO 2 and ZnO are being studied as the alternative materials, but are not commercialised due to their poor conversion efficiency. Another group of semiconductor compounds known as transition metal chalcogenides (TMC) have been developed to be used as the absorbent materials. Consisting of transition metals and chalcogenides (S, Se and Te), they show promising solar absorbent properties such as semiconducting band gap, well adhesion to substrate and good conversion with better cost-effective. There are many TMC compounds synthesised, including copper indium selenide (CIS), ZnTe 2, CdSe etc. Nickel, one of the transition metals synthesised with chalcogenides are referred as nickel chalcogenides. There are many possible combinations of nickel chalcogenides such as NiS 2, NiSe, NiSe 2 and Ni 3 Se 2.

Metallic nanostructures were deposited {{by means of an}} electron gun evaporator in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions (10 - 8 Pa) on the freshly cleaved 0001 surface of the crystal Bi 2 Te 3. Measurements were conducted using the commercially available Omicron UHV scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements were performed using current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS), and subsequent calculation of the dI/dV maps. Metallic characteristics were observed on nickel islands since early stages of the growth. CITS and dI/dV maps showed distinct contrast between the substrate and metallic islands. Similar contrast was not observed in the case of titanium, most probably due to an intercalation process. Occurring of such a process was confirmed by the appearance of the superlattice structure.

40|$|Part One: Chemical Modification of Porous Alumina for Nanowire Templating:		A {{modified}} sol-gel {{technique and}} subsequent polymer coating technique {{was used to}} modify the size of nanowires grown via electrodeposition in porous alumina templates. The porous alumina film is initially soaked in a water-containing solution prior to exposure to a different solution of 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane in toluene. The amount {{of water in the}} aqueous solution correlates with the thickness of silane coating observed after exposure to the organic solution. The pH of the aqueous solution influences the coating thickness as well, primarily as a function of film density. Other factors such as silane concentration, silane exposure time, and aqueous co-solvent choice did not influence the coating thickness. 	After coating porous alumina with APTES, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was coupled to amines at the material surface through an aminolysis reaction. No proton-transfer catalyst was necessary for the transformation. Thickness of polymer films were related to initial pore diameter in the modified porous alumina. Dissolution of PMMA-treated porous alumina templates under alkaline conditions yielded no nanostructures, supporting the covalent attachment of the PMMA to the pore wall. Amide-related peaks were also observed using infrared spectroscopy. 	Several nanowire systems were grown in the aforementioned chemically modified, electrode-backed porous alumina templates. <b>Nickel,</b> bismuth <b>telluride,</b> and bismuth antimony nanowires were grown electrochemically using previously established methods. Nanowire diameters were smaller in modified templates in accordance with the coating procedures applied to the porous alumina. 	Part Two: NEXAFS Spectroscopy of Aqueous ATP:	NEXAFS spectroscopy at the nitrogen and carbon K-edges was used to study the hydration of adenosine triphosphate in liquid microjets. Total electron yield spectra were recorded as a function of concentration, pH, and the presence of sodium, magnesium, and copper ions (Na+/Mg 2 +/Cu 2 +). Significant spectral changes were observed upon protonation of the adenine ring, but not under conditions that promote &# 960;-stacking, such as high concentration or presence of Mg 2 +, indicating NEXAFS is insensitive to the phenomenon.

Here, we have successfully bonded bulk PbTe to Ni electrode to generate a diffusion barrier, avoiding continuous reaction of the thermoelectric legs and conducting electrodes at the operating temperature. We have modified the commonly used spark plasma sintering assembly method to join Ni electrode to bulk PbTe by driving the total supplied electrical current through the Ni and PbTe solid interfaces.

The initial investigation involved {{a study of the}} inner surfaces of irradiated stainless steel clad and evidence was obtained to show that fission products, in particular tellerium, were associated with reaction products on these surfaces. An accelerated rate of oxidation was observed on the inner surfaces of a failed A. G. R. fuel pin. It is believed that fission product caesium was responsible for this enhancement. A fundamental study of the reaction between 20 %Cr/ 25 %Ni/niobium stabilised stainless steel and tellerium was then undertaken over the range 350 - 850 degrees C. Reaction occurred with increasing rapidity over this range and long term exposure at ≤ 750 degrees resulted in intergranular attack of the stainless steel and chromium depletion. The reaction on unoxidised steel surfaces involved the formation of an initial iron-nickel-tellerium layer which subsequently transformed to a chromium telluride product during continued exposure.

Chapter 2 explores tuning the properties of contorted hexabenzocoronene (HBC) derivatives to improve photovoltaic performance. First, the interaction between contorted HBC derivatives {{with varying degrees of}} "bowl" character and fullerenes are explored in solution. Association constants were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments with fullerenes C 70, C 60, and Phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). NMR titration experiments mimic fluorescence quenching results that suggest that association in solution increases with shape-complementarity between donor and acceptor. Second, efforts towards the synthesis of azulene HBC, an HBC derivative with red-shifted absorption, are discussed. Calculations of this target molecule and a selected intermediate are compared to those of the parent contorted HBC. Finally, an azulene HBC synthetic intermediate is explored as a potential sensor. Chapter 3 presents a study of the single molecule conductance of cobalt chalcogenide clusters. The synthesis of cobalt chalcogenide clusters decorated with a variety of conjugated molecular connectors was developed.
