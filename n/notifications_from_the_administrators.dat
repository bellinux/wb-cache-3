40|$|Title: Notification {{of animal}} welfare Author: Helen Öhlund The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the {{routines}} of the county administrations in Sweden when it comes to receiving <b>notification</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public about the welfare of animals. According to Jordbruksverket at least 50 % of the screening of animal welfare should be based on routine controls on existing farmers. Today the routine controls only reach a 43 % average for the whole country. A big part of today’s result depends on the amount of time it takes <b>the</b> <b>administrators</b> of animal welfare to process <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public. To examine why <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public take too long time, the county administrations were interviewed through phone and e-mail. The interviews were made to see what routines the county administrations had and if the routines could be made more efficient. Jordbruksverket have developed aid to the county administrations in form of simpler checklists for pets and control cards to ease the burden in notification controls. This study shows that a lot of work can be done when it comes to receiving the notification. When receiving notification <b>the</b> <b>administrators</b> can decide if the notification is severe or not. Too little information makes it difficult to determine the gravity of the notification.   Key words: animal welfare, legislation, county administration, notification, Jordbruksverket...|$|R
