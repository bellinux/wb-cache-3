5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included Gravity Bone as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of the video game medium.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Monomorium {{species is}} {{particularly}} successful. This fact is particularly curious {{because of the}} presence of a very aggressive ant family, Iridomyrmex, which is quite proficient at interference competition. Iridomyrmex ants are able to quickly seek out food sources and prevent other ant species from reaching them. However, unlike other ant species, Monomorium species, despite their unaggressive nature and small size, are able to thrive even in areas where Iridomyrmex dominates. This success can be attributed to their efficient foraging strategy, and their <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of venom alkaloids, repellant chemical signals. With these two behaviors, Monomorium species can rapidly monopolize and defend food sources.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the WorkChoices {{reforms were}} passed by Federal Parliament. There were many {{elements}} in the reforms, including some which elicited political and social controversy and consternation. In a legal sense, perhaps the two most fundamental changes were (1) the purported elimination of State and Territory workplace relations legislation from the federal industrial landscape and (2) the attempt to rely almost completely on the corporations power directly to prescribe minimum terms and conditions of employment regardless {{of the existence of}} an intrastate industrial dispute. This unprecedented (but not <b>novel)</b> <b>use</b> of the corporations power to enact federal industrial legislation was accompanied by claims that 85% of the Australian workforce would be covered by WorkChoices.|$|E

Intrigued by his <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of the unconventional space and keen to demonstrate the creative opportunities available, the London Transport Board gave Lee a hundred bus-sides for a year to use for advertising campaigns. Starting with a dramatic poster for Nikon, featuring Lee's own distinctive gold toothed smile in close up, he used the space to display prominently signed shots for clients including Austin Reed, British Rail and Pringle of Scotland; making headlines when he put a full frontal nude {{on the side of the}} Number 19 buses for French Connection, much to the consternation of campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{may have}} been present even earlier {{in the history of}} life on Earth. The {{nucleotide}} adenosine is present in cofactors that catalyse many basic metabolic reactions such as methyl, acyl, and phosphoryl group transfer, as well as redox reactions. This ubiquitous chemical scaffold has, therefore, been proposed to be a remnant of the RNA world, with early ribozymes evolving to bind a restricted set of nucleotides and related compounds. Adenosine-based cofactors are thought to have acted as interchangeable adaptors that allowed enzymes and ribozymes to bind new cofactors through small modifications in existing adenosine-binding domains, which had originally evolved to bind a different cofactor. This process of adapting a pre-evolved structure for a <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> is known as exaptation.|$|E
25|$|Until his sixties Tal {{appeared}} as a pianist and conductor with various orchestras, but his major contribution to the music world lies in his challenging compositions and his <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of sonority. In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr Shlomo Markel, a research project (Talmark) aimed at {{the development of a}} novel musical notation system in cooperation with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and VolkswagenStiftung. During these years his eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration and it became increasingly difficult for him to continue composing. Using a computer screen to enlarge the music score, he managed to compose short musical works for few instruments, write his third autobiography, and complete his visionary analysis of future music. The complete cycle of his symphonies conducted by Israel Yinon was released on the German label CPO.|$|E

25|$|The Allied victory owed much to Monash's {{detailed}} {{planning and}} to the briefing of all the troops on their objectives. The battle was his first as commander of the Australian Corps. The Allies made <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> {{of a number of}} tactics, such as parachute drops of medical supplies and rifle ammunition in cases, and resupply by tank rather than by troops carrying supplies forward. The supply tanks and aircraft brought stores quickly to the troops as they advanced. The carrying power of the tanks equated to about 1,200 troops doing the same job. Signals were sent largely by cable and telephone, but new methods of signalling were also trialled, including the use of rockets which were used by some battalion headquarters to pass urgent messages to the rear, although this proved largely ineffective. Other techniques were more effective {{such as the use of}} pigeons, Lucas lamps, and for the first time, wirelesses were used by officers to send messages from captured objectives.|$|E
25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943. The Macintosh blade remains {{to this day}} {{the most widely used}} laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation. In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is an {{important}} species for commercial and subsistence fisheries throughout its range. Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher catches. These statistics only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, bag net, purse seines or ring nets, and push nets. The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8–13cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, {{researchers}} addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the <b>novel</b> <b>use</b> of a surfactant that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax. Hertel also developed the first fluorocarbon product and the first spring-time wax that repels and makes the running surface slick for spring time alpine ski and snowboard. This technology was introduced to the market in 1986 by Hertel Wax. [...] In 1990, Hertel filed for a U.S. patent on a [...] "ski wax for use with sintered-base snow skis", containing paraffin, a hardener wax, roughly 1% per-fluoroether diol, and 2% SDS surfactant. In the 1990s, Swix chief chemist Leif Torgersen found a glide wax additive to repel pollen and other snow impurities—a problem with soft grip waxes during distance races—in the form of a fluorocarbon that could be ironed into the ski base. The solution was based on the work of Enrico Traverso at , who had developed a fluorocarbon powder with a melting temperature just a few degrees below that of sintered polyethylene, patented in Italy as a [...] "ski lubricant comprising paraffinic wax and hydrocarbon compounds containing a perfluorocarbon segment".|$|E
