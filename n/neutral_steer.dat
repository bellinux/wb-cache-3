These constant values indicate steady state cornering or not changing its motion character over time.

As presented {{we can see the}} vehicle cornering, and it’s offset from the neutral driven vehicle. The vehicle is driving trough corner with greater radius.

40|$|The Forze Hydrogen Racing team in Delft is {{developing}} the Forze VI; a hydrogen powered racing vehicle. To improve the vehicle dynamics for the Forze VI a torque vectoring approach is roposed. Torque vectoring provides vehicle stability control, for both vehicle accelerating and decelerating conditions by transmitting vectoring torque between {{the left and}} right wheels without deteriorating the longitudinal performance of the vehicle. In this thesis two di?erent torque vectoring control algorithms will be presented. The ?rst control algorithm is a PID and LP controller based upon a linear single-track model. The second controller is a LP controller based upon a two-track model. Both controllers are yaw rate tracking controllers. In this thesis it is assumed that a <b>neutral</b> <b>steered</b> vehicle model provides the desired yaw rate. This <b>neutral</b> <b>steered</b> yaw rate is then imposed on the Forze VI by both controllers. The dynamics of a vehicle can be very complex. The vehicle dynamics depend upon various parameters and non-linear models. For the ?rst controller a linear single-track model is used. This is a simpli?ed model of the vehicle where both the front and rear tires are assumed to be one lumped mass. With this linear model a PID controller is constructed. The LP provides {{the left and right}} rear wheel torques, from the yaw moment of the controller. The LP also takes into account the friction and engine limitations. This control algorithm is only compatible with a rear wheel drive vehicle. The second controller is based upon a non-linear two-track model. In this model each wheel is separately modeled. This means that the model is more accurate but more knowledge of the vehicle parameters is needed. With this two-track model it is possible to determine the torques for all four wheels. This means that this controller will be compatible with a four wheel drive vehicle. The LP controller is a combination of the PID and LP from the previous controller. The LP controller uses the equation of motions of the two-track model to determine the torques for the left and right rear wheels, with respect to the friction and engine limits. Both controllers show improvement of the lateral vehicle dynamics, compared to the dynamics of a vehicle with no torque vectoring. With torque vectoring the lateral acceleration is higher and therefore the velocity through corners is higher. These higher velocities through corners will translate to faster lap-times, which is the goal of this thesis. The second controller shows similar results with the ?rst controller, but seems to have a slight more aggressive control output. Both controllers determine only the left and right rear wheel torques. The potential of four wheel drive for the second controller is not simulated, as the Forze VI is only rear wheel drive. The LP controller can in the future use it's fully potential when Forze decides to build a four wheel drive vehicle.

40|$|Future {{automotive}} safety functions, such as lanekeeping and collision avoidance, {{link the}} vehicle dynamically to its environment. As a result, {{a combination of}} the mechanical system dynamics and the virtual link to the roadway or obstacles determines the vehicle motion. This paper looks at the combined influence of decoupling lateral and yaw modes, preview distance, and controller damping on the stability and performance of lateral controllers. The effects of these characteristics are studied using an intuitive ‘virtual ’ forces analogy where the control inputs are viewed as a single force acting on the vehicle. With the ability to influence the coupling between lateral and yaw modes, the ‘virtual ’ control force can be shifted {{along the length of the}} vehicle. For stability, this force must be applied in front of the <b>neutral</b> <b>steer</b> point. In addition, shifting this control force can give satisfactory system behavior with a minimal preview distance. The benefits of lookahead are also explored under this framework, giving well behaved responses without the addition of controller damping. The combination of lookahead and damping on the velocity states allows complete freedom in designing the system response. ...|$|E

The particles are steered {{by creating a}} fluid flow that carries all the particles from where they are to {{where they should be}} at each time step. Our control loop comprises sensing, computation, and actuation to steer particles along user-input trajectories. Particle locations are identified in real-time by an optical system and transferred to a control algorithm that then determines the electrode voltages necessary to create a flow field to carry all the particles to their next desired locations. The process repeats at the next time instant. Our method achieves inexpensive steering of particles by using conventional electroosmotic actuation in microfluidic channels. This type of particle steering does not require optical traps and can noninvasively <b>steer</b> <b>neutral</b> or charged particles and objects that cannot be captured by laser tweezers. (Laser tweezers cannot steer reflective particles, or particles where the index of refraction is lower than (or for more sophisticated optical vortex holographic tweezers does not differ substantially from) that of the surrounding medium.)

40|$|Ground vehicles, both {{on roads}} or on rail, are {{sensitive}} to crosswinds and the handling, travelling speeds or in some cases, safety can be affected. Full modelling of the crosswind stability of a vehicle is a demanding task as {{the nature of the}} disturbance, the wind gust, is complex and the aerodynamics, vehicle dynamics and driver reactions interact with each other.   One of the objectives of this thesis, is to assess the aerodynamic response of simplified ground vehicles under sudden strong crosswind disturbances by using an advanced turbulence model. In the aerodynamic simulations, time-dependant boundary data have been used to introduce a deterministic wind gust model into the computational domain.   This thesis covers the implementation of such gust models into Detached-Eddy Simulations (DES) and assesses the overall accuracy. Different type of grids, numerical setups and refinements are considered. Although the overall use of DES is seen suitable, further investigations can be foreseen on more challenging geometries.   Two families of vehicle models have been studied. The first one, a box-like geometry, has been used to characterize the influence of the radius of curvature and benefited from unsteady experimental data for comparison. The second one, the Windsor model, has been used to understand the impact of the different rear designs. Noticeably, the different geometries tested have exhibited strong transients in the loads that {{can not be represented in}} pure steady crosswind conditions. The static coupling between aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics simulations enhances the comparisons of the aerodynamic designs. Also, it shows that the motion of the centre of pressure with respect the locations of the centre of gravity and the <b>neutral</b> <b>steer</b> point, is of prime interest to design vehicles that are less crosswind sensitive.

40|$|The {{suspension}} system {{of a vehicle}} is conventionally designed such that the spring-damper element is configured in the vertical direction, and the longitudinal connection between the vehicle chassis and wheels is always very stiff compared to the vertical one. This mechanism can isolate vibrations and absorb shocks efficiently in the vertical direction but cannot attenuate the longitudinal impacts caused by road obstacles. In order to overcome such a limitation, a planar {{suspension system}} (PSS) is proposed. This novel vehicle suspension system has a longitudinal spring-damper strut between the vehicle chassis and wheel. The dynamic performance, including ride comfort, pitch dynamics, handling characteristics and total dynamic behaviour, of a mid-size passenger vehicle equipped with such planar suspension systems is thoroughly investigated and {{compared with those of}} a conventional vehicle. To facilitate this investigation, various number of vehicle models are developed considering the relative longitudinal motions of wheels with respect to the chassis. A 4 -DOF quarter-car model is used to conduct a preliminary study of the ride quality, and a pitch plane half-car model is employed to investigate the pitch dynamics in both the frequency and time domain. A 5 -DOF yaw plane single-track half-car model along with a pitch plane half-car model is proposed to carry out the handling performance study, and also an 18 -DOF full-car model is used to perform total dynamics study. In addition to these mathematical models, virtual full-car models are constructed in Adams/car to validate the proposed mathematical models. For the sake of prediction of the tire-ground interaction force, a radial-spring tire model is modified by adding the tire damping to generate the road excitation forces due to road disturbances in the vertical and longitudinal directions. A dynamic 2 D tire friction model based on the LuGre friction theory is modified to simulate the dynamic frictional interaction in the tire-ground contact pitch. The ride quality of a PSS vehicle is evaluated in accordance with the ISO 2631 and compared with that of a conventional vehicle. It is shown that the PSS system exhibits good potential to attenuate the impact and isolate the vibration due to road excitations in both the vertical and longitudinal directions, resulting in improved vehicles’ ride and comfort quality. The relatively soft longitudinal strut can absorb the longitudinal impact and, therefore, can protect the components. The investigation of handling performance including the steady-state handling characteristics, transient and frequency responses in various scenarios demonstrates that the PSS vehicle is directionally stable and generally has comparable handling behaviour to a similar conventional vehicle. The application of PSS in vehicles can enhance the understeer trend, i. e. the understeer becomes more understeer, <b>neutral</b> <b>steer</b> becomes slightly understeer, and oversteer becomes less oversteer. The total dynamic behaviour combining the bounce, pitch, roll and the longitudinal dynamics under various scenarios such as differential brake-in-turn and asymmetric obstacle traversing was thoroughly investigated. Simulation results illustrate that the PSS vehicle has a relatively small roll angle in a turning manoeuvre. In some cases such as passing road potholes, the PSS vehicle has a better directional stability...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{developments}} in road vehicles {{over the last}} two decades have received considerable attention towards pushing the safe performance limits to their ultimate levels. Towards this goal, Active Front Steering (AFS) and Direct Yaw-moment Control (DYC) systems have been widely investigated. AFS systems introduce corrective steering angles to the conventional system in order to realize a target handling response for a given speed and steering input. An AFS system, however, may yield limited performance under severe steering maneuvers involving substantial lateral load shift and saturation of the inside tire-road adhesion. The adhesion available at the outer tire, on the other hand, would remain under-utilized. This dissertation explores effectiveness of an Active Independent Front Steering (AIFS) system that could introduce a corrective measure at each wheel in an independent manner. The effectiveness of the AIFS system was investigated firstly through simulation of a yaw-plane model of a passenger car. The preliminary simulation results with AIFS system revealed superior potential compared to the AFS particularly in the presence of greater lateral load shift during a high-g maneuver. The proposed concept was thus expected to be far more beneficial for enhancement of handling properties of heavy vehicles, which invariably undergo large lateral load shift due to their high center of mass and roll motion. A nonlinear yaw-plane model of a two-axle single-unit truck, fully and partially loaded with solid and liquid cargo, with limited roll degree-of-freedom (DOF) was thus developed to study the performance potentials of AIFS under a range of steering maneuvers. A simple PI controller was synthesized to track the reference yaw rate response of a <b>neutral</b> <b>steer</b> vehicle. The steering corrections, however, were limited such that none of the tires approach saturation. For this purpose, a tire saturation zone was identified considering the normalized cornering stiffness property of the tire. The controller strategy was formulated so as to limit the work-load magnitude at a pre-determined level to ensure sufficient tire-road adhesion reserve to meet the braking demand, when exists. Simulation results were obtained for a truck model integrating AFS and AIFS systems subjected to a range of steering maneuvers, namely: a J-turn maneuver on uniform as well as split-μ road conditions, and path change and obstacle avoidance maneuvers. The simulation results showed that both AFS and AIFS can effectively track the target yaw rate of the vehicle, while the AIFS helped limit saturation of the inside tire and permitted maximum utilization of the available tire-road adhesion of the outside tire. The results thus suggested that the performance of an AIFS system would be promising under severe maneuvers involving simultaneous braking and steering, since it permitted a desired adhesion reserve at each wheel to meet a braking demand during the steering maneuver. Accordingly, the vehicle model was extended to study the dynamic braking characteristics under braking-in-turn maneuvers. The simulation results revealed the most meritorious feature of the AIFS in enhancing the braking characteristics of the vehicle and reducing the stopping time during such maneuvers. The robustness of the proposed control synthesis was subsequently studied with respect to parameter variations and external disturbance. This investigation also explores designs of fail-safe independently controllable front wheels steering system for implementation of the AIFS concept. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Vehicle behaviour near the limit of adhesion is studied using linear optimal. control techniques and relatively simple vehicle models. Both time-invariant and time-varying approaches are used. Controllability is applied as a post-processing tool to analyse the resultant vehicle behaviour. First, a 4 WS controller is developed using a linear time-invariant method, with a reference model control structure. Two handling objectives are defined, which are thought to provide predictable dynamics. Advantages of using a reference model control are clearly shown. With a developed control structure, it is shown that the prescribed target dynamics is achieved, provided tyre forces are available. It is {{also found that the}} controller is robust to small changes in the various vehicle parameter values. As a next step, time-varying modelling approach was used in order to better represent the vehicle operating conditions through the various dynamic range, including the limit of adhesion. An iterative vehicle path optimisation problem is formulated using a linear time-varying control approach. The validity of the optimisation method is studied against the steady-state simulation result at the limit of adhesion. It is shown that the method is capable of finding a trajectory {{in the vicinity of the}} friction limit, where the front tyres are used fully whilst retaining some margin at the rears. However, a couple of Issues are discovered. First, due to the quadratic nature of the road geometry cost function, the trajectory could get locked if the vehicle runs very close to the edge of the road. Hence, the. optimisation needs to be formulated such that the level of "optimality" on the trajectory remains consistent throughout the manoeuvre at each iteration. Secondly, it is found that inappropriate control demands are produced if the system matrix becomes poorly conditioned near the limit. This results in optimisation failure. In order to understand the mechanism of this failure, controllability of linear timevarying system was analysed and its properties were discussed in detail. First, the calculation methods of the controllability gramian matrix are investigated and some practical limitations are found. The gramian matrix is then used to define an open loop control sequence. It is found that the damping of the system has a significant influence on the control strategy. Subsequently, "the moving controllability window of a fixed time period" is found to provide the most relevant information of changing dynamics through the time. The study showed that the failure of the optimisation in the vicinity of the friction limit was indeed due to lack of controllability and the optimisation method itself was functioning correctly. The vehicle path optimisation problem is then extended to include longitudinal dynamics, enabling simulation of more general manoeuvres. The single corner simulation showed that the optimisation converges to an "out-in-out" path, with iterative solution improving continuously in a first order manner. Simulations with various controller settings showed that the strategy is reasonably robust provided that the changes in parameter settings are kept within a reasonable magnitude. It is also confirmed that the optimisation is able to drive a vehicle close to the limit under different types of operations required, i. e. braking, cornering and acceleration. The study was then performed with slightly more complex road geometry in order to investigate if the· optimisation is capable of prioritising certain· part of the manoeuvre in order to achieve better overall result. Unfortunately, this problem could not be solved successfully. The optimisation concentrated on the latter part of the manoeuvre as it had higher sensitivity to the final cost. This resulted in clearly sub-optimal overall performance. Finally, relatively simple study is conducted to investigate the correlation between various vehicle settings and optimisation results. Using the path optimisation problem formulation, iris found that the more oversteer vehicles are able to achieve better· result with more margin left in rear tyre force capacity. The handling objective functions used for the 4 WS controller is also calculated for the resultant trajectories. It is found that the <b>neutral</b> <b>steer</b> cost had a strong correlation, whereas the linearity cost showed no noticeable correlation. The controllability analysis was applied on the various vehicle settings using step steer simulation. It showed that more understeering vehicle retains higher controllability throughout the dynamics range. It is also found that higher inertia gives better controllability near the limit, however, it gives less controllability at more moderate operating conditions...|$|E
