50|$|Num Lock or Numeric Lock (⇭) {{is a key}} on the numeric keypad of most {{computer}} keyboards. It is a lock key, like Caps Lock and Scroll Lock. Its state (on or off) {{affects the}} function {{of some of the}} keys, and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.The <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have cursor control or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had separate number keys and cursor control keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to choose between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.|$|E
5000|$|A Clear key, {{instead of}} a <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>key,</b> on models with full numeric keypads, as these are {{dedicated}} to numeric input and not generally used for cursor control. In Unicode, the Clear key is represented by , defined as [...] "clear key".|$|E
50|$|It is to {{be noted}} that numeric {{sections}} on usual keyboards for personal computers do not comply to the standard, as they usually have a <b>Num</b> <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> in the upper left corner where the standard requires the “+” key, and therefore also show a different arrangement of the other arithmetic keys (usually lacking an “=” key; see the second picture). By this, the standard {{in its present form}} (ISO/IEC 9995-4:2009) can be considered outdated.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being mapped to standard keyboard <b>keys</b> like Scroll <b>Lock</b> and <b>Num</b> <b>Lock,</b> the Fn <b>key</b> combinations may also be mapped to control system interfaces to change the LCD brightness, VGA output, or speaker volume on most laptop computers.|$|R
5000|$|Numeric keypads usually {{operate in}} two modes. When <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> is off, <b>keys</b> , , , and [...] act like arrow/navigation keys up, right, down, and left; and , , , and [...] act like , , , and , respectively. When [...] is on, digit keys produce the {{corresponding}} digit. On Apple Macintosh computers, which lack a [...] key, the numeric keypad always produces only numbers; the [...] key {{is replaced by}} the [...]|$|R
25|$|Numeric {{keyboards}} contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} function keys. They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow <b>keys,</b> Navigation <b>keys,</b> <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> and Enter <b>key.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Emacs {{offers an}} EDT {{emulator}} package [...] which supports {{both physical and}} virtual VT100-style terminals. There is a slight complication for virtual (xterm-style) terminals which run {{on top of a}} host PC operating system, in that the <b>Num</b> <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> cannot be remapped to the Gold key at the level of Emacs; instead, it is remapped {{at the level of the}} X server (instructions provided). As of the latest stable release of Emacs (2013), EDT and Gold key support is a current feature.|$|E
5000|$|In Microsoft Windows, {{holding down}} the Alt key while typing in numbers (often {{referred}} to as Alt codes) on the numeric keypad allows the user to type special characters not normally available on the keyboard. For example, holding down Alt while typing 0225 (...) on the numeric keypad will result in á, the character at 225 in the codepage. These extended keyboard characters are useful for persons using foreign languages, mathematics, currency symbols, business use, etc. Some computers work the same if the <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is on.|$|E
50|$|Since {{most modern}} desktop {{computers}} have a full-size keyboard {{with both a}} numeric pad and separate arrow keys, Num Lock is rarely used (always on) for its original purpose, and ends up confusing the user if it has for some reason been turned off without the user being aware of this. This can be more of an issue on most laptop computers, since activating the Num Lock function typically requires use of the Fn key and if a user accidentally switches it on they may {{have no idea how}} to switch it off. If a full-size keyboard is plugged into a laptop, then the Num Lock function is normally on (as expected) for the external keyboard, and the user would not have to activate the Num Lock function to use the numeric keypad for numeric entry. Since Apple keyboards never had a combination of arrow keys and numeric keypad (but some lacked arrow keys, function keys and a numeric keypad altogether), Apple has keyboards with a separate numeric keypad but no functional <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>key.</b> Instead, these keyboards include a Clear key.|$|E

25|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>keys</b> <b>lock</b> {{part of a}} keyboard, {{depending}} on the settings selected. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> include Scroll <b>lock,</b> <b>Num</b> <b>lock</b> (which allows {{the use of the}} numeric keypad), and Caps lock.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} source of mode errors {{may be the}} Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key.</b> Other common modes {{available}} in PC keyboards are Insert and the other <b>lock</b> <b>keys,</b> <b>Num</b> <b>lock</b> and Scroll <b>lock.</b> Dead <b>keys</b> for diacritics also create a short-term mode, at least if they don't provide visual feedback that the next typed character will be modified.|$|R
5000|$|In a word processor, {{the status}} bar often shows cursor position, {{the number of}} pages in the document, {{and the state of}} the caps <b>lock,</b> <b>num</b> <b>lock,</b> and scroll <b>lock</b> <b>keys.</b> Additionally, many word {{processors}} assign the insert key a behavior similar to that of these three, to allow toggling the insertion modethe state of that is also displayed in the status bar.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] key {{was meant}} to lock all {{scrolling}} techniques, and is a remnant from the original IBM PC keyboard. In the original design, [...] was intended to modify {{the behavior of the}} arrow keys. When the [...] mode was on, the arrow keys would scroll the contents of a text window instead of moving the cursor. In this usage, [...] is a toggling <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> like <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> or Caps Lock, which have a state that persists after the key is released.|$|R
50|$|In June 2007, Microsoft {{introduced}} the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 7000. This keyboard {{has the same}} key layout as the older Natural Ergonomic 4000. The biggest {{difference between the two}} is that the Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard is wireless. Besides the color palette, the other difference is that the Natural Ergonomic 4000 includes light indicators that signal when the <b>Num</b> <b>Lock,</b> Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and F <b>Lock</b> <b>keys</b> have been depressed and active. In their place, on the Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard, resides the battery indicator light.|$|R
5000|$|SHIFTSTATE (PTS-DOS only) : Specifies {{the state}} of the {{keyboard}} modifiers like Shift <b>Lock,</b> <b>Num</b> <b>Lock,</b> Scroll Lock or Insert mode.|$|R
5000|$|Pin input is {{possible}} with numeric keypad even when <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> is off.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the flag}} is not set and 30 minutes passes, the cursor is {{changed to a}} block. After one hour, Caps <b>Lock,</b> <b>Nums</b> <b>Lock,</b> and Scroll Lock are {{switched}} to [...] "Off".|$|R
5000|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move the cursor to {{different}} positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor {{to the beginning of}} the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop.The Insert key is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The Backspace key deletes the preceding character.Lock <b>keys</b> <b>lock</b> part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> include Scroll <b>lock,</b> <b>Num</b> <b>lock</b> (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and Caps lock.|$|R
5000|$|Number Lock [...] - [...] <b>Num</b> <b>Lock.</b> Allows {{the user}} to type numbers by {{pressing}} the keys on the number pad, rather than having them act as up, down, left, right, page up, end, and so forth. Usually located in the upper left corner of the number pad.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} had 82 keys, some {{of which}} were designed for word processing, especially with the bundled Locoscript software - for example to cut, copy, and paste. Non-English characters such as Greek could be typed by holding down the ALT or EXTRA key, along with the SHIFT key if capitals were required. Other special key combinations activated caps <b>lock,</b> <b>num</b> <b>lock</b> and reboot.|$|R
2500|$|To make a {{lowercase}} ñ in the Microsoft Windows operating system, {{hold down}} the Alt key and type the number 164 or 0241 on the numeric keypad (with <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> turned on). To make an uppercase Ñ, press Alt-165 or Alt-0209. Character Map in Windows identifies the letter as [...] "Latin Small/Capital Letter N With Tilde". A soft (not physical) Spanish-language keyboard is easily installed in Windows.|$|R
50|$|Keyboards {{often include}} a small LED to {{indicate}} that Caps Lock is active, either on the key itself or in a row with Scroll <b>lock</b> and <b>Num</b> <b>lock</b> indicators. While on the original IBM PC keyboard this LED was controlled by the keyboard itself, it is under software control of the computer since {{the introduction of the}} IBM AT. Some new laptop and wireless desktop keyboards lack the LED, instead providing software that gives an on-screen indicator.|$|R
50|$|The {{left-hand}} {{side of the}} status bar shows running processes. The leftmost one will be visible on the screen; the others (if any) are running in the background. The right-hand side shows the keyboard layout in use (UK8 in the above example), the printer port assignment, the keyboard caps <b>lock</b> and <b>num</b> <b>lock</b> status, and the current time. If a DOS program is running, the status line is not shown. DOS programs cannot be run in the background.|$|R
5000|$|Alphanumeric (eisū) toggles {{alphanumeric}} characters. In the Japanese 106/109-key layout, it {{is located}} on the Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key.</b> Pressing Alphanumeric/Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> alone actually means alphanumeric function, a user has to press [...] key to get caps lock function.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the SHIFT <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT <b>key,</b> the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|R
5000|$|C2T works {{thanks to}} a chip in each server that emulates a KVM switch. To take control of a certain xSeries server in the rack, user needs to press <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> twice, [...] "nn" [...] (where [...] "nn" [...] {{is the number of}} the server) and then press Enter, or could also {{manually}} press the button {{on the front of the}} desired xSeries server. The theory behind C2T is to reduce clutter and save money as no KVM switch is required.|$|R
5000|$|The AnyKey has {{a fourth}} {{indicator}} light labeled [...] "Program," [...] located {{to the right}} of the <b>Num</b> <b>Lock,</b> Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock lights. Revisions of its design that predate the advent of the “Windows” keyboard have an asterisk (*), backslash (\), or hash (#) in the windows key locations, depending on the intended locale. Since the design of the AnyKey predates the [...] "multimedia PC," [...] it lacks the additional multimedia keys (play, pause, volume) present on many modern keyboards.|$|R

2500|$|In Microsoft Windows {{running on}} a {{computer}} whose keyboard includes a numeric keypad, an en or em dash may be typed into most text areas by using their respective Alt code by holding down the Alt key and pressing either [...] for the en dash or [...] for the em dash. The numbers must be typed on the numeric keypad with <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> enabled. In addition, the Character Map utility included with MS Windows {{can be used to}} copy and paste en and em dash characters into most applications.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent a}} {{screensaver}} from starting, xine sends a scroll <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> {{signal to the}} environment to pretend keyboard interaction took place. This can often lead to issues with other programs running as they receive the scroll <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> as normal input. One example is the Konsole terminal emulator, which changes the behaviour of the arrow <b>keys</b> when scroll <b>lock</b> is used.|$|R
50|$|Typing case-sensitive {{passwords}} {{that are}} not displayed verbatim on the screen may cause mistakes when Caps Lock is on. Help guides, tech support materials, and sometimes the interface itself may include advice on checking Caps Lock before typing a password. In Windows login screens, a warning that Caps Lock is on is shown in a balloon near the field. In Mac OS X, when Caps Lock is on, a Caps Lock symbol (⇪) is displayed inside a password field. Operating systems may also provide audible notifications when Caps <b>Lock,</b> <b>Num</b> <b>lock,</b> or Scroll lock buttons are toggled.|$|R

5000|$|In 2004, Microsoft {{introduced}} the restyled Natural MultiMedia Keyboard, which reworked {{the row of}} multimedia buttons and included the controversial F Lock feature, originally debuted in the Microsoft Office Keyboard. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with the Insert key moved to the [...] "PrtScn/SysRq" [...] key, and del key expanded. On the Natural Multimedia Keyboard, the status indicator lights for <b>Num</b> <b>lock,</b> Scroll lock, and Caps lock were moved from between the banks of alphanumeric keys to a more traditional location above {{and to the right}} of the backspace key. The Natural Multimedia Keyboard was manufactured in at least three different color schemes, including white with blue accents, black with silver accents, and white with black accents.|$|R
