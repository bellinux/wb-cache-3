5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{represented}} as emerald green in colour. While Ucchishta-Matangini carries a <b>noose,</b> sword, goad, and club, her other well-known form, Raja-Matangi, plays the veena {{and is often}} pictured with a parrot.|$|E
5|$|The Dhyana mantras in the Purashcharyarnava and the Tantrasara {{describe}} Matangi as blue in colour. The {{crescent moon}} adorns her forehead. She has three {{eyes and a}} smiling face. She wears jewellery and is seated on a jewelled throne. In her four arms, she carries a <b>noose,</b> a sword, a goad, and a club. Her waist is slim and her breasts well-developed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} morning, {{students and}} staff discovered rope <b>nooses</b> hanging from the tree; reports differ as to whether there were two or three <b>nooses.</b> A black teacher described seeing both white and black students [...] "playing with <b>nooses,</b> pulling on them, jump-swinging from them, and putting their heads through them" [...] that same day. Craig Franklin, assistant editor of The Jena Times, said the <b>nooses</b> were hung as a prank by three students directed at white members of the school rodeo team. The school's investigating committee had concluded that [...] "the three young teens had no knowledge that <b>nooses</b> symbolize the terrible legacy of the lynchings of countless blacks in American history." [...] The names of those who hung the <b>nooses</b> were not publicly disclosed.|$|R
5000|$|Birds that walk on {{the ground}} can be {{captured}} using an array of mono-filament <b>nooses.</b> These are usually placed along favoured feeding, roosting or nest sites. Some raptors are trapped using live-bait and <b>nooses</b> on the cage holding the bait. This trap, {{also known as a}} bal-chatri, has also been adapted to capture other birds such as shrikes. A [...] "noose carpet" [...] is another variant that consists of a number of tiny <b>nooses</b> on a mat.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary traps {{are made}} of more modern materials, such as wire mesh cages with <b>nooses</b> made of nylon monofilament. The traps vary from 25-50 cm in {{diameter}} or length, with the <b>nooses</b> 4-12 cm in diameter. They are normally weighted {{to prevent them from}} being carried away by ensnared birds. [...] The live lure, or bait, animals used for the trap are usually rodents such as house mice. [...] The cage may have a double wall, or a removable roof or inner compartment, both to protect the bait animals from the raptors, and to prevent them damaging the <b>nooses</b> by chewing them.|$|R
5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly. The Dhyana Mantra {{describes}} {{her to be}} four-armed, with a dark emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a crescent moon on her forehead. She carries a <b>noose,</b> a goad, a sugarcane bow and flower arrows, which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often described to hold. She is also described to love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song.|$|E
5|$|In the Sritattvanidhi, the {{depiction}} prescribed for Sharabeshwaramurti is of thirty arms; {{arms on the}} right are to hold thunderbolt, mushti, abhaya, chakra (discus), sakti, staff, goad, sword, Khatvanga, axe, akshamala, a bone, bow, musala, and fire; and the left hands to display <b>noose,</b> varada, mace, arrow, flag, and another type of sword, a snake, a lotus flower, skull-cup, pustaka, plough, and mrudanga with one hand encircling Durga in a hug. This form is extolled to usher good luck, cure all diseases and destroy all enemies.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnudharmottara Purana {{describes}} a six-armed Varahi, holding a danda (staff of punishment), khetaka (shield), khadga (sword) and pasha (<b>noose)</b> in four {{hands and the}} two remaining hands being held in Abhaya and Varada Mudra ("blessing gesture"). She also holds a shakti and hala (plough). Such a Varahi sculpture is found at Abanesi, depicted with the dancing Shiva. She may also be depicted holding a child sitting on her lap, like Matrikas are often depicted.|$|E

5|$|After the kidnapping, {{the couple}} were beaten. Babli's brother Suresh forced her to consume pesticide, while four other family members pushed Manoj to the ground, her uncle Rajinder pulling a <b>noose</b> around Manoj's neck and {{strangling}} {{him in front of}} Babli. They wrapped the bodies in gunny sacks and dumped them in Barwala Link Canal in Hisar district. On 23 June, nine days later, their mutilated bodies, hands and feet tied, were fished out of the canal by Kheri Chowki police. After autopsy, police preserved Manoj's shirt and Babli's anklet and cremated the bodies as unclaimed on 24 June. On 1 July the family identified them by the remnants of their clothing. The accused were subsequently arrested.|$|E
5|$|At the gallows, Beauchamp {{assured the}} {{assembled}} clergy {{that he had}} a salvation experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the <b>noose</b> was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the <b>noose</b> was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E
50|$|Then the mahout {{with the}} {{assistance}} of a helper prodded the wild elephant with an iron rod to lift its one leg so that it could be <b>noosed</b> with ropes. Using the same procedure, the other three legs and the neck of the elephant were <b>noosed,</b> and wild elephants subject to the discomfort and being immobilized would become easier to control. Once tamed they were trained.|$|R
60|$|Ffoulkes now {{went to the}} horse, {{detached}} the nose-bag, and {{undid the}} <b>nooses</b> of the hobble and of the tether.|$|R
50|$|Members of the Legion marched {{with rubber}} hoses and gas pipes. The {{postmaster}} {{and a local}} minister were seen carrying <b>nooses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a <b>noose.</b> This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} April 1947, Hordern {{accepted}} the small part of Captain Hoyle in Richard Llewellyn's comic drama film <b>Noose.</b> Two other roles occurred that year: as Maxim de Winter in a television adaption of Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca, followed by {{the part of a}} detective in Good-Time Girl, alongside Dennis Price and Jean Kent. The following year he took part in three plays: Peter Ustinov's The Indifferent Shepherd, which appeared at the newly opened Q Theatre in Brentford, West London; Ibsen's Ghosts; and an adaptation of The Wind in the Willows at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in which he portrayed the part of the blustery, eccentric Mr Toad.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in New York, Mary finds that Jacqueline sold her cosmetics business eight months earlier. Jacqueline's {{close friend and}} former employee, Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell), claims to have seen Jacqueline the week before, and suggests that Mary visit Dante's, an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. Mary locates the restaurant, and discovers that Jacqueline has rented a room above the store, without having moved in. Mary convinces the owners to let her see the room, which she finds empty aside from a wooden chair and above it a <b>noose</b> hanging from the ceiling. This makes Mary more anxious and determined to find her sister.|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} stunner (e-stunner) {{is commonly used}} to handle Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) on commercial farms in South Africa, but while it seems to improve handling and safety for the keepers, no information regarding physiological reactions to e-stunning is currently available. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to compare various physiological parameters in farmed Nile crocodiles captured either manually (<b>noosing)</b> or by using an e-stunner. A total of 45 crocodiles were captured at a South African farm by either e-stunning or <b>noosing,</b> and blood samples were taken immediately as well as four hours after capture. Parameters monitored were serum corticosterone, lactate, glucose, as well as alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase. Lactate concentrations were significantly higher in <b>noosed</b> compared to e-stunned animals (P < 0. 001). No other blood parameter differed significantly between the two capture methods. In addition, recorded capture time confirmed that <b>noosing</b> takes significantly longer compared to e-stunning (P < 0. 001), overall indicating that e-stunning seems the better option for restraint of especially large numbers of crocodiles in a commercial setup because it is quicker, safer, and did not cause a significant increase in any of the parameters measured.

6000|$|... "When {{we enter}} the houses," [...] {{he said to the}} two other lackeys, [...] "you will remain without with Pierre, and will take charge of the first four prisoners we bring out. Put the <b>nooses</b> round their necks, and draw them tight enough to let the men feel that they are there. Fasten the other ends to your saddles, and warn them, if they put up their hands to throw off the <b>nooses,</b> you will spur your horses into a gallop. That threat will keep them quiet enough." ...|$|R

5|$|Varahi may be two, four, or six-armed. The Matsya Purana, the Purva-karnagama and the Rupamandana {{mention a}} four-armed form. The Rupamandana says she carries a ghanta (bell), a chamara (a yak's tail), a chakra (discus) and a gada (mace). The Matsya Purana omits the ghanta {{and does not}} mention the fourth weapon. The Purva-Karanagama {{mentions}} that she holds the Sharanga (the bow of Vishnu), the hala (plough) and the musula (pestle). The fourth hand is held in the Abhaya ("protection gesture") or the Varada Mudra ("blessing gesture"). The Devi Purana mentions her attributes as being sword, iron club and <b>noose.</b> Another description says her hair is adorned with a garland with red flowers. She holds a staff and drinking skull-cup (kapala). The Varahini-nigrahastaka-stotra describes her attributes as a plough, a pestle, a skull-cup and the abhaya mudra. The Vamana Purana describes her seated on Shesha while holding a chakra and a mace. The Agni Purana describes her holding the gada, shankha, sword and ankusha (goad). The Mantramahodadhi mentions she carries a sword, shield, <b>noose</b> and goad. In Vaishnava images, since she is associated with Vishnu, Varahi may be depicted holding all four attributes of Vishnu — Shankha (conch), chakra, Gada and Padma (lotus). The Aparajitapriccha describes her holding a rosary, a khatvanga (a club with a skull), a bell, and a kamandalu (water-pot).|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a <b>noose</b> around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1139, rumours were current that the family was going to defect to Stephen's rival for the throne, the Empress Matilda. These rumours {{appear to have been}} started by a group of nobles led by twin {{brothers}} Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, with Alan of Brittany. Whether Roger and his family really intended to switch their support to Matilda is unclear, but unlikely. In late June, a fight broke out between some of the retainers of Alan and men in the service of Roger's family. This fight was the excuse for the king moving against Roger's family. Both the elder and younger Roger were arrested, along with Alexander, but Nigel escaped. Matilda of Ramsbury, who held out in Devizes Castle against the king, was persuaded to surrender the castle to Stephen when the king threatened to hang the younger Roger if she did not yield. The younger Roger was restrained with chains and put on a high platform in view of the castle with a <b>noose</b> around his neck.|$|E

5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the <b>noose</b> placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a disabled state at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in imitation of the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a <b>noose</b> around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the Batavian Republic Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors. Lucas did not survive to see {{the conclusion of the}} trial, dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797, but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a decade}} from the {{outbreak}} of the revolt in 869, the Zanj had seized most of lower Iraq, including the cities of Basra and Wasit, and expanded into Khuzistan as well. In 879 the death of the founder of the Saffarid state, Ya'qub al-Saffar, allowed the Abbasid government to fully concentrate its attention against the Zanj rebellion, and Abu'l-Abbas' appointment to command in December 879 at the head of 10,000 troops marks the turning point of the war. In the long and hard struggle that followed, which involved amphibious operations in the Mesopotamian Marshes, Abu'l-Abbas and his own military slaves (ghilmān)—of which the long-serving Zirak al-Turki was the chief—played the major role: although the Abbasid armies eventually swelled with reinforcements, volunteers, and Zanj defectors, it was the few but elite ghilmān who formed the army's backbone, filling its leadership positions and bearing the brunt of the battle, often under the personal command of Abu'l-Abbas. After years of gradually tightening the <b>noose</b> around the Zanj, in August 883 the Abbasid troops stormed their capital of al-Mukhtara, putting an end to the rebellion. A detailed account of the war, written by a former Zanj rebel and preserved in the history of al-Tabari, stresses the role of al-Muwaffaq and Abu'l-Abbas as the heroes who, in defence of the embattled Muslim state, suppressed the rebellion; the successful campaign would become a major tool in their propaganda effort to legitimize their de facto usurpation of the Caliph's power.|$|E
