5000|$|A {{change of}} {{emphasis}} in the research remit of MRE led to his resignation and in 1963 he was Appointed Assistant Director of the Agricultural Research Council's newly formed multidisciplinary Unit of Nitrogen Fixation (UNF), with the chemist Professor Joseph Chatt FRS as Director. Postgate's job was to plan and direct its biological research programme. The Unit settled at the University of Sussex in late 1964, and in 1965 the University appointed Postgate Professor of Microbiology {{in addition to his}} UNF position, with only postgraduate teaching duties. [...] The Unit's biological research was restricted to free-living nitrogen fixers, chosen as more amenable material for its research than those requiring a plant symbiosis. Its approach ranged from biochemical enzymology to microbial physiology and general microbiology, and in due course it introduced the genetics, and was genuinely collaborative, with everyone, including Postgate, working at the bench. Almost all its research publications were multi-authored and Postgate's name appeared only on those original papers to which he had actively contributed - though he prescribed and oversaw all his staff's research directions. Outstanding papers were: a series deducing mode of action of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the initial attack of nitrogen, which is an oxygen-sensitive complex of two proteins, iron and molybdenum, which requires energy in the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to function and which releases hydrogen from water while fixing nitrogen; the elucidation of oxygen-screening processes in an oxygen-tolerant species of nitrogen fixer and the discovery in that microbe of a second nitrogenase containing vanadium in place of molybdenum alongside the regular one; the elucidation of a cluster of some 21 genes which code for the whole <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system,</b> the creation of mobile genetic elements carrying that cluster and the transfer therewith of the ability to fix nitrogen to wholly new bacteria by genetic manipulation. [...] One of the Unit's plasmids came into worldwide use to study the genetics of nitrogen fixation. The Unit's reputation prospered as a world centre for basic research on the subject.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ecosystems {{with high}} rates of {{nitrogen}} fixation often have high loss rates through leaching or possibly denitrification. However, there is no formal theoretical context to examine why this should be the case nor of how nitrogen accumulates in such open systems. Here, we propose a simple model coupling nitrogen inputs and losses to carbon inputs and losses. The nitrogen balance of this model system depends on plant (nitrogen fixer) growth rate, its carrying capacity, N fixed/C fixed, residence time of nitrogen and carbon in biomass, litter decay rate, litter NIC, and fractional loss rate of mineralized nitrogen. The model predicts the requirements for equilibrium in a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system,</b> and the conditions on nitrogen fixation and losses {{in order for the}} system to accumulate nitrogen and carbon. In particular, the accumulation of nitrogen and carbon in a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system</b> depend on an interaction between residence time in vegetation and litter decay rate in soil. To reflect a possible increased uptake of soil nitrogen and decreased respiratory cost of symbiotic nitrogen fixers, the model was then modified so that fixation rate decreased and growth rate increased as nitrogen capital accumulated. These modifications had only small effects on carbon and nitrogen accumula-tion. This suggests that switching from uptake of atmospheric nitrogen to mineral soil nitrogen as nitrogen capital accumulates simply results in a trade-off between energetic limitations and soil nitrogen limitations to carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Experimental tests of the model are suggested...|$|E
30|$|Plants of the legume {{family are}} able to form {{symbiotic}} systems with nitrogen-fixing rhizosphere microorganisms. Formation of legume-rhizobial symbiosis includes a number of successive stages from adsorption of bacterial cells {{on the surface of}} root hairs and infection to the formation of special symbiotic forms, bacteroides, where the complex enzyme complex, nitrogenase, is synthesized. It catalyzes the reduction of molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere [11]. This complex consists of two enzymes: the actual nitrogenase (so-called MoFe protein or dinitrogenase) and dehydrogenase (Fe protein) [17]. The MoFe protein cofactor consists of two atoms of molybdenum, which determines the relevance of a given study of influence of colloidal solution of nanoparticles of molybdenum on nodulation - central link of legume - and rhizobial symbiosis, providing the necessary conditions for the formation and functioning of the enzyme complex and <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system</b> [11, 18].|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of the few}} known molecular <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>systems,</b> including nitrogenase enzymes, are of much interest but are not fully understood. We recently reported that Fe–N_ 2 complexes of tetradentate P_ 3 ^E ligands (E = B, C) generate catalytic yields of NH_ 3 under an atmosphere of N_ 2 with acid and reductant at low temperatures. Here we show that these Fe catalysts are unexpectedly robust and retain activity after multiple reloadings. Nearly {{an order of magnitude}} improvement in yield of NH_ 3 for each Fe catalyst has been realized (up to 64 equiv of NH_ 3 produced per Fe for P_ 3 ^B and up to 47 equiv for P_ 3 ^C) by increasing acid/reductant loading with highly purified acid. Cyclic voltammetry shows the apparent onset of catalysis at the P_ 3 ^BFe–N_ 2 /P_ 3 ^BFe–N_ 2 – couple and controlled-potential electrolysis of P_ 3 ^BFe^+ at − 45 °C demonstrates that electrolytic N_ 2 reduction to NH_ 3 is feasible. Kinetic studies reveal first-order rate dependence on Fe catalyst concentration (P_ 3 ^B), consistent with a single-site catalyst model. An isostructural system (P_ 3 ^(Si)) is shown to be appreciably more selective for hydrogen evolution. In situ freeze-quench Mössbauer spectroscopy during turnover reveals an iron–borohydrido–hydride complex as a likely resting state of the P_ 3 ^BFe catalyst system. We postulate that hydrogen-evolving reaction activity may prevent iron hydride formation from poisoning the P_ 3 ^BFe system. This idea may be important to consider in the design of synthetic nitrogenases and may also have broader significance given that intermediate metal hydrides and hydrogen evolution may {{play a key role in}} biological nitrogen fixation...|$|R
40|$|Legume hemoglobin- {{leghemoglobin}} (Lb) - {{was discovered}} by Kubo [1] in root nodules of leguminous plants. These nodules are a natu-ral <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system</b> which {{is a result of}} the symbiosis of high plants with the bacteria Rhysobium. Lb does not directly take part in nitrogen fi-xation. Possessing very high affinity for oxygen (Pso = 0. 05 torr), Lb has a high combination rate constant k = 118 tM-'- sec ' and a comparatively fast dissociation rate constant k = 4. 4 sec ' [2]. These properties mean that Lb may, on the one hand, maintain proper tension of oxygen in nodules and, on the other hand, provide transport of oxygen. In many respects (magnetic susceptibility data, spectroscopic data, etc.) Lb resembles animal hemoglobins and myoglobins. Its molecular weight is about 17000. Lb has the same type of polypeptide chain folding as other hemoglobins. Lb consists of 7 a-helices and a porphyrine group- the heme group (figure 1).

40|$|Metleghemoglobin reductases from nodules {{of yellow}} and blue lupines and garden pea were {{obtained}} in homogeneous state, some of their properties were studied. Presence of two isoforms of enzyme in nodules of both lupine species was shown. The comparison of properties of studied metleghemoglobin reductases from different legume plants was made. Possible mechanisms of their functioning in nodules are discussing. For normal run of nitrogen fixation process optimal oxygen conditions in nodules of legume plants are necessary. One {{of the most important}} parts of system regulating these conditions is special plant hemoprotein—leghemoglobin. It is possible to bind oxygen and to form oxygenated LbO 2 form only in physiologically active reduced state. Two ways of supporting leghemoglobin in reduced state are known: enzymatic (reducing by metleghemoglobin reductase) and non-enzymatic (reducing by indolyl-acetic acid [1], reduced flavins [2], cysteine, ascorbic acid and low molecular weight component B [3]). Thanks to presence of several enzymatic and non-enzymatic reductants in nodule cytosol the considerable removal of Lb 3 + ⇄ Lb 2 + balance to formation of reduced hemoprotein is observing, norm of physiological reaction of symbiotic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system</b> is extending, and optimal regime for nitrogen fixation are supporting at widely changing conditions.

40|$|I ELECTRON DONATION TO NITROGENASEPaper I {{shows that}} the hypothesis, that a high ratio of (NADH + NADPH) / (NAD + + NADP +) {{is the source of}} {{reducing}} power for nitrogenase in intact A. vinelandii, is invalid. On the contrary, with a decreasing ratio of reduced to oxidized pyridine nucleotides, the nitrogenase activity of whole cells increases. The experiments described in paper I, indicate that the reducing power necessary for nitrogen fixation in A. vinelandii is generated within the cytoplasmic membrane. It is demonstrated that transport of reducing equivalents to the nitrogenase requires a high energy level of the cytoplasmic membrane. The energy level of the cytoplasmic membrane was measured by the intracellular Alp concentration and by using 9 -amino acridine as a fluorescent probe. Other regulating factors of the nitrogenase activity in A. vinelandii are shown to be the intracellular ATP/ ADP ratio and the presence of oxygen. Paper III shows that toluene makes A. vinelandii cells permeable for small molecules but not for enzymes. In toluene-treated cells, enzyme activities can be measured by adding the appropriate cofactors and substrates. It is possible to restore the oxidation of organic substrates but no concomitant nitrogenase activity can be observed. We suggest that an observed lack of energization of the cytoplasmic membranes is the missing link between oxidation and generation of the reducing equivalents for nitrogen fixation. In paper III and IV we show that the endogenous low potential electron carriers in toluene-treated cells are not reduced. In paper IV a membrane-bound NAD(P) H-flavodoxin oxidoreductase is demonstrated and a proposal is given in which NADH is the electron donor for nitrogenase. The electron carrier flavodoxin is reduced by the membrane-bound NADH-flavodoxin oxidoreductase at a low pH, that is developed in an energy-linked process. II OXYGEN PROTECTION OF NITROGENASEIn paper II the source of respiration protection is investigated. Experiments with radioactive pyruvate and sucrose show that the rate of sucrose oxidation by A. vinelandii is associated with the sucrose translocator activity. We show that the respiration protection of the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system</b> in A. vinelandii is dependent of the oxygen input during growth. The oxidation capacity intrinsically depends on the type of substrate and can be partly adapted. Membranes rich in cytochromes c 4 + c 5 and o and with phosphorylation between NADH and c 4 + c 5 and oxygen and cytochrome c 4 + c 5 and oxygen, can be isolated from A. vinelandii grown O 2 -limited. Cytochromes b and d can be detected in addition when A. vinelandii cells are grown N 2 limited. The activity of the NADH oxidase system is increased in such cells and phosphorylation is only observed between CoQ and oxygen. Under saturating oxygen concentrations the type of respiratory membranes was not observed to influence the intracellular energy charge. In paper III and IV the mechanism of the conformational protection of nitrogenase was investigated. It is shown that nitrogenase can be isolated as an oxygen-stable complex form A. vinelandii independent of the cell rupture method. Also no influence of the cell rupture method on the rate of sedimentation of the nitrogenase can be observed. The rate of sedimentation of the nitrogenase is found to be concentration and pH dependent. At pH= 7. 4 the rate of sedimentation of the nitrogenase complex is comparable with that of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. No evidence was found for a particulate nitrogenase, it is demonstrated that the oxygen stability of nitrogenase in crude extracts is caused by complexation. of the nitrogenase components with an Fe-S protein. An alternative proposal for the switch-on switch-off phenomenon in whole Azotobacter cells is given. Nitrogenase is present in vivo as an active and oxygen tolerent complex but nitrogen fixation in whole cells is inhibited by the oxidation of flavodoxin hydroquinone. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNitrogen is {{a primary}} {{limitation}} to plant productivity, a major energy and economic input in agroecosystems, and a primary source of environmental pollution via gaseous and leaching losses. The success of the Green Revolution was largely due to breeding of superior plant varieties and the massive use of fertilizers, especially synthetic N-fertilizers, to fulfil the higher yield potential of the new varieties. Today, agriculture uses over 100 million metric tons of fertilizer-N each year, which has doubled the flux of N through the terrestrial N-cycle. Production of fertilizer-N, via the Haber-Bosch process, consumes {{an enormous amount of}} fossil fuel, and produces a matching amount of CO 2. Likewise, distribution and mechanical application of fertilizer to fields consume fossil fuels and add to atmospheric CO 2. About a half of the fertilizer-N applied to fields is captured and used by the target crop, while the rest is lost to the environment. A small percentage is converted to the potent greenhouse gas, N 2 O, which contributes substantially to the total greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Current high-input agricultural systems are not sustainable, in part because they rely on finite fossil fuels and in part because of their negative effects on environmental systems. Several approaches are being taken to reduce the use and environmental impacts of fertilizer-N, while maintaining or even increasing plant productivity, including greater use of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes, use and improvement of associative nitrogen fixation in non-legumes, and the development of synthetic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>systems</b> for key crop species. Plant breeding approaches to improve nitrogen use efficiency in crop species and management strategies to reduce nitrogen losses from fields are also underway and have met with some success. Basic research is still required to fully understand nitrogen dynamics in the complex and varied agroecosystems, which are affected by interactions between plants, soil, microbes, climate and other environmental variables. Understanding nitrogen dynamics and transformations in agroecosystems will help us to manage better the nitrogen resources in these systems, which will increase agricultural sustainability and reduce its impact on the environment and climate...|$|R
40|$|The {{projected}} {{exponential growth}} of the human population necessitates a concomitant increase in food supplies, and by implication an increase in fixed nitrogen for crops and pastures. This can {{to a large extent}} be supplied by biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). However, to achieve this goal improved effectivity of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis is required, implicating improvement in the macro- as well as the micro symbiont. Therefore the search for more effective microsymbionts is a sine qua non to provide better matching and tolerance to stress conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the range of rhizobia associated with the exotic Australian Acacia species (A. meamsii, A. dealbata and A. decurrens) in South Africa and to determine whether these species could be useful to provide rhizobial strains for application in the South African inoculant industry in order to improve local existing biological <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>systems.</b> Although these Acacia species are geographically widespread throughout South Africa, their root nodule bacteria have never been investigated in depth. Their widespread occurrence and presumed promiscuity suggested that they might form nitrogen-fixing symbioses with a wide range of indigenous rhizobial strains with different ecological adaptations. In this study nodulated plants of the three Acacia spp. were collected from diverse geographic areas with diverse climatic conditions and different soil pH's. Isolates were obtained from root nodules, purified and the putative rhizobial isolates characterized with sodium dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), supplemented at the genomic level with 16 S rDNA sequence data of selected isolates. The majority of the isolates investigated were members of the genus Bradyrhizobium, whilst some isolates showed close relationships to the genera Agrobacterium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium. As a result of their predominant association with the slow-growing strains of the genus Bradyrhizobium, the legume spp. A. meamsii, A. dealbata and A. decurrens as trap plants would not playa significant role as a source of diverse rhizobia for application in the South African inoculant industry.

40|$|Fixed {{nitrogen}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} limiting factors for plant growth. One of the most important <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>systems</b> is the rhizobium root nodule symbiosis. In this Thesis I have studied the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, starting from the idea that part of pre-existing signalling pathways have been co-opted during evolution of this mutualistic interaction. Gene duplications -of which a whole genome duplication (WGD) is the most dramatic variant- are known as important driving forces in evolution of new traits. 56 to 65 million years ago an ancestral legume species within the Papilionoidae subfamily (Papilionoids) experienced a WGD event and subsequently gave rise to several major phylogenetic crowns. I hypothesize that among the orthologous gene pairs maintained are genes that are essential for nodulation. I adopted a phylogenetic strategy to identify new candidate genes involved in the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis In a targeted approach, we focussed on the cytokinin phosphorelay pathway. This resulted in the identification of one gene pair encoding type-A Response Regulators (RRs) with a positive regulatory role for these proteins in root nodule formation. Yet the illustrated role for MtRR 9 and MtRR 11 in rhizobial symbiosis provides a proof of principle of this method to identify gene pairs involved in legume specific characters. An unbiased search for paralogous gene pairs revealed two conserved gene duplications in the NADPH oxidases gene family. NADPH oxidases are reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing enzymes. We identified two sets of duplicated genes that have been maintained after the Papilionoid specific WGD and we show that MtRBOHA and MtRBOHG are redundant, yet essential during symbiosis. Moreover, although it is commonly believed that exclusively pericycle cells give rise to the lateral root primordium, similar as seen in Arabidopsis thaliana, we provide morphological evidence that in the studied legume species this is not the case. In both, Lotus and Medicago, also root cortical cell divisions occur during lateral root formation. Furthermore, we found a striking correlation in the cell layers that are recruited during lateral root and nodule primordium formation. This supports the hypothesis that at least parts of the lateral root developmental program have been recruited during evolution of symbiotic root nodules.  ...|$|R
40|$|Aspects of the edaphic {{adaptation}} of gorse (Ulex europaeus L.) were investigated using field and glasshouse experiments. Variables compared included P and N supply, soil pH, frequency of cutting and stage of soil development. Particular emphasis {{was placed on}} soil chemical properties of most importance. to legumes growing on low fertility soils in New Zealand (available P arid acidity) and on the ability of gorse to fix nitrogen and thus thrive under conditions of low available soil N. Gorse was contrasted with the high soil fertility demanding pasture legume, white clover (Trifolium repens L.). Under dryland conditions in Canterbury unfertilized gorse in its second growth season, grown on a soil with very low available P and cut frequently (twice yearly) had similar annual dry matter production (50 S 3 kg ha⁻¹) to pasture (5870 kg ha⁻¹) fertilized with 250 kg ha ⁻¹ year ⁻¹ superphosphate. Infrequently cut, unfertilized gorse or gorse which was P-fertilized (and either frequently or infrequently cut) produced more than 18500 kg dry matter ha ⁻¹. On a river terrace sequence in North Westland, established gorse grown on unfertilized soils with very low to low available P concentrations, and some of which had physical constraints to root growth, produced similar amounts of dry matter (7210 to 14 600 kg ha ⁻¹ year ⁻¹) as pasture (10920 kg ha ⁻¹ year ⁻¹) fertilized with 1000 kg ha ⁻¹ year⁻¹ of 33 % potassic, cobaltised, lime reverted superphosphate (giving about 42 kg P ha⁻¹, 165 kg K ha⁻¹ and 56 kg S ha⁻¹). Gorse gave dry matter responses to applied P, but was less responsive than white clover, both in the field (where the two species were grown together) and in pots (where the two species were grown separately). Gorse was able to take up more P than did white clover from soils with very low available P concentration both in pots and in the field. The P response curves for gorse were quadratic in shape, suggesting a tendency for decline in yield at high rates of P, whereas those for white clover were exponential in shape with increases in dry matter yield diminishing at the greatest rates of P used but showing no tendency for decline. Shoot P concentrations of field grown gorse were less than those of white clover at all rates of applied P (except for the nil rate at one sampling time) and the critical shoot P concentration for gorse (0. 19 %) appeared to be less than that for white clover (0. 35 %), indicating that gorse used P more efficiently in the processes of growth than white clover. In the field infrequently cut gorse (at the end of 2 years growth) produced about twice as much dry matter as frequently cut gorse (cut twice yearly), but the total P contents of the two cutting treatments were similar, indicating similar capacities for P uptake. Critical P concentrations in young tissue were also similar for both cutting treatments. The ability of infrequently cut gorse to out-yield frequently cut gorse appeared to result from the greater potential for P transfer from old to young tissue in infrequently cut plants combined with their greater leaf area index. The P contained in harvested shoots was lost to the frequently cut plants, whereas infrequently cut plants appeared to make more efficient use of the P taken up by transferring it from old to new tissue. Gorse grown in pots was less sensitive to soil acidity (0. 02 mol 1 ⁻¹ CaCl₂-extractable Al in particular) than was white clover and was also less responsive to applied lime. Nitrogenfixing (acetylene reducing) activity {{did not appear to be}} any more sensitive to soil acidity than host plant growth, for either gorse or white clover. Gorse did not have a noticeable soil acidifying effect when grown in pots, but white clover did. Gorse grown in sand culture was responsive to increasing nutrient solution nitrate concentration within the range found in natural and agricultural soils (0 - 10 mmol 1 ⁻¹). In terms of dry matter production, gorse was not significantly less responsive to increasing nitrate concentration than white clover, but was less responsive than white clover in terms of total N content. Gorse reached 90 % maximum dry matter yield at a lower solution nitrate concentration (1. 2 mmol 1 ⁻¹) than white clover (2. 9 mmol 1 ⁻¹). Unlike white clover, gorse growth and N accumulation were depressed at the greatest nutrient solution nitrate concentration used (20 mmol 1 ⁻¹) which is about the top of the range which can temporarily occur in highly fertilized soils. Similarly to white clover, gorse was able to use available mineral N by increasing its nitrate reductase activity of its roots and shoots. N concentration of gorse tissue was less than that of white clover tissue at all solution nitrate concentrations and the critical N concentration for gorse (2. 79 %) was less than that for white clover (4. 62 %), indicating that gorse used N more efficiently in dry matter production than white clover did. The symbiotic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>system</b> of gorse appeared to be able to meet the needs of the plant in the field where the application of 200 kg N ha⁻¹ gave no dry matter response. In sand culture the reduction in nodule weight and nitrogen-fixing activity with increasing nutrient solution nitrate concentration was less for gorse than white clover. This suggests that the N₂-fixing system of gorse may be able to recover more readily than that of white clover following depression by applied N. Dry matter yield of established gorse on a river terrace soil sequence in North Westland was not clearly linked with soil fertility but appeared to be more affected by physical factors affecting rooting volume and rooting depth. It was confirmed that gorse is relatively tolerant of low soil fertility conditions, hence its significance as a pest in low input pastoral agriculture (low fertilizer inputs and low stocking rates). Under conditions of high soil fertility, it should be possible to control gorse at the seedling stage when its growth is slow relative to high fertility-demanding pasture species. However, when it is mature, gorse has the potential to grow very rapidly and responds to applications of P and N within the range normally given to pastures. High forage yields of gorse compared with pasture are possible under conditions of low soil fertility. However, yields were greatest from uncut plants. Therefore, if gorse is used as forage it will be important to achieve an appropriate balance between browsing by animals and the maintenance of sufficient photosynthetic tissue to maintain rapid growth...|$|E
