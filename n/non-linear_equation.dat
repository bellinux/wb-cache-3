40|$|Abstract Analyzing non-smooth {{mechanical}} systems requires often {{the solution of}} inclusion problems of nor-mal cone type. These problems arise for example in the event-driven or time-stepping simulation approaches. Such inclusion problems can be written as <b>non-linear</b> <b>equations,</b> which can be solved iteratively. In this paper we discuss three different methods to derive the <b>non-linear</b> <b>equations</b> representing the inclusions arising in the event-driven simulation approach. First, we formulate inclusions describing the individual non-smooth con-straints and solve them successively. Secondly, we interpret the <b>non-linear</b> <b>equations</b> as the conditions for the saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian function. As a third possibility we discuss the exact regularization of set-valued force laws. All three methods lead to the same numerical scheme, but give different insight into the problem. Especially the factor r occurring in the <b>non-linear</b> <b>equations</b> is discussed.
