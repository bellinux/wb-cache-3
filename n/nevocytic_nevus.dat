40|$|Prompted by the {{well-known}} difficulties of reliable and objective histologic differentiation between initial malignant melanoma (MM) and benign nevocytic nevi (NN), ultrastructural high-resolution image and multivariate analyses were evaluated for their diagnostic efficiency. Thirty-seven different features describing morphometry (area, circumference, and shape factor), amount of heterochromatin and euchromatin, chromatin homogeneity, and presence of smaller dark chromatin aggregations {{were determined by}} a MICROVAX 3500 computer in each of 1840 intraepidermal melanocytic nuclei of 17 MM and 20 NN. A strategy for the classification of cases based on the identification of markedly atypical melanocytic cells (MACS) was developed. MACS, selected in multivariate analysis with a linear combination of the eight most important features for cell classification, were found in 39. 4 % of the melanoma cells, but only in 0. 3 % of <b>nevocytic</b> <b>nevus</b> cells. The presence of MACS allowed a clear differentiation between MM and NN. All cases of MM had more than four MACS, whereas 17 cases of nevocytic nevi were MACS negative, and {{in each of the}} remaining three cases only one MAC was present. The percentage of MACS detected within intraepidermal parts of MM by using computerized high-resolution image analysis was found to be a highly efficient diagnostic marker. The new classification strategy has the potential of saving considerable time in subsequent studies, because preselected sampling and the calculation of only a few criteria have proven sufficient for correct classification of malignant melanomas...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} and histologic features of combined nevi of the conjunctiva, {{a type of}} nevus that is not uncommon in the skin but has rarely {{been reported in the}} conjunctiva. METHODS: Conjunctival nevi and melanomas from the files of the University of California, San Francisco, eye pathology laboratory were reviewed from 1984 to 1999 for the presence of features of both standard nevocytic nevi and blue nevi. Clinical histories and, when available, clinical photographs were obtained. RESULTS: Thirty-one combined nevi were discovered during the 15 -year period between 1984 and 1999. One case before 1984 had been incorrectly diagnosed as a junctional nevus. The dendritic and spindle-shaped blue nevus cells had been overlooked because they were not recognized as distinct from the standard <b>nevocytic</b> <b>nevus</b> cells. The recognition of a blue as well as a brown color, a deep as well as a superficial component in the lesion, or a history of pigmentation since birth may help to establish the correct clinical diagnosis and prevent an unnecessarily deep surgical resection. Although growth of the lesion or "satellites" in some patients may favor a clinical diagnosis of melanoma, none of the lesions in this series were malignant. CONCLUSION: Despite a paucity of reports of combined nevi of the conjunctiva in the medical literature, this type of nevus [...] a combination of a nevocytic and a blue nevus [...] is common and has been overlooked in the past...|$|E
