500|$|Ponsford {{simultaneously}} {{retired from}} baseball and cricket in 1934. In his newspaper column, {{he said that}} he liked both sports equally. He felt that baseball gave a player more opportunities to perform: [...] "In cricket you may have the bad luck to get out early; which often means a blank afternoon. It is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> baseball; you are in the game all the time." [...] Joe Clark, the author of History of Australian Baseball, said [...] "Ponsford is {{considered by many to be}} the best baseballer of his time in Australia." [...] The official program for the 1952 Claxton Shield—held in Perth—made a similar claim.|$|E

In one play, Juvenal suggests that for Nero, being put in merely one sack is not good enough. This might, for example, be a reference both {{to the death of}} Nero's mother Agrippina Minor, widely believed to have been murdered on Nero's orders, and also to how Nero murdered his fatherland. Not only Juvenal thought the sack was the standard by which the appropriate punishment for Nero should be measured; the statues of Nero were despoiled and vandalized, and according to the Roman historian Suetonius, one statue was draped in a sack given a placard that said [...] "I have done what I could. But you deserve the sack!".|$|E

500|$|The dramatist John Whiting, {{trying to}} make a name for himself in the theatre after the war, was called by Clunes to take part in a {{theatrical}} competition at the Arts Theatre in London in 1951, for which he entered his play Saints Day. [...] Several other amateur directors also competed for the prize, which was to have their play funded and professionally displayed at the Arts. Having seen him perform the previous year, Whiting hired Hordern for the lead role of Paul Southman, a cantankerous old poet who fights off three rebellious army deserters who threaten the tranquillity of his sleepy country village. The play proved popular with audiences, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> theatrical commentators. Hordern liked the piece, calling it [...] "bitter and interesting", but the press, who extensively reported on the competition throughout each stage, thought differently and condemned it for winning. This infuriated the actors Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud, who wrote letters of complaint to the press.|$|E
500|$|Oregon {{received}} {{an invitation to}} the NCAA Tournament's West Regional, which was held on March 20 and 21 in San Francisco. First, Oregon faced [...] Texas in the first round, in a matchup of teams considered superior to either of their potential opponents in the regional final, according to analysts. The Webfoots scored 10 of the game's first 12 points, led by Dick and Wintermute, and held a three-point halftime advantage. After Texas had closed their deficit to one point multiple times in the second half, Oregon went on a scoring run and eventually opened a 19-point lead. The Webfoots defeated Texas by a final score of 56–41. Wintermute had 14 points in the game, and Dick added 13. In the regional final against Oklahoma, a 10–0 run to close the first half put the Webfoots in front, 21–14. Oregon took advantage of Oklahoma's strategy of attempting to play a fast-paced game and extended their lead in the second half. Dick had 14 points and Gale and Wintermute scored 11 and 10, respectively, as Oregon advanced to the national championship game with a 55–37 victory. All three of the Webfoots' leading scorers in the regional final were selected to the all-Western regional squad, as determined by Kansas head coach Phog Allen. Hobson commented on his team's NCAA Tournament opponents that [...] "We were head and shoulders above , but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> Washington and California." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. <b>Not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{political}} {{songs were}} written by bards under Soviet rule, and the genre varied from acutely political, [...] "anti-Soviet" [...] songs, to witty satire in the best traditions of Aesop. Some of Bulat Okudzhava's songs provide examples of political songs written on these themes. Vladimir Vysotsky was perceived as a political songwriter, but later he gradually made his way into more mainstream culture. It was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> Alexander Galich, who was forced to emigrate—owning a tape with his songs could mean a prison term in the USSR. Before emigration, he suffered from KGB persecution, as did another bard, Yuliy Kim. Others, like Evgeny Kliachkin and Aleksander Dolsky, maintained a balance between outright anti-Soviet and plain romantic material.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Lustiger {{was awarded}} the Nostra Aetate Award for {{advancing}} Catholic-Jewish relations by the Center for Christian-Jewish Understanding, an interfaith group housed {{on the campus of}} Sacred Heart University, a Catholic university at Fairfield, Connecticut in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, protested the award, saying it was [...] "inappropriate" [...] to honor Lustiger, who was born a Jew but left the faith. [...] "It's fine to have him speak at a conference or colloquium," [...] said the league's national director Abraham Foxman. [...] "But I don't think he should be honored because he converted out, which makes him a poor example." [...] In France, however, Lustiger enjoyed good relations with the Jewish community. Théo Klein observed that although conversions usually carry out negative connotations in the Jewish world, it was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> the Cardinal.

2500|$|In {{the values}} of the Squamish culture, respect for each other and {{generosity}} of both the wealth of wisdom and material wealth was key. Wisdom or knowledge was passed on through oral and visual 'teachings'. [...] In many Western concepts of wealth, the poor and those having little formal education may be regarded as having little to offer. [...] This was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> the Squamish. As Andy Paull noted, [...] "It was the duty of the more responsible Indians to see that the history and traditions of our race were properly handed down to posterity. [...] A knowledge of our history and legends was similar as an education is regarded among whitemen. [...] Those who possessed it were regarded as aristocrats. [...] Those who were indifferent, whether adults or children, were rascals. [...] Being without means of transmitting it into writing, much time was spent by the aristocrats in importing this knowledge to the youth. [...] It was the responsible duty of responsible elders." ...|$|E

God came down in cloud and called out to Aaron and Miriam: [...] "When a prophet of the Lord arises among you, I make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. <b>Not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> My servant Moses; he is trusted {{throughout}} My household. With him I speak mouth to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he beholds the likeness of the Lord. How then did you not shrink from speaking against My servant Moses!"

2500|$|Such clay {{has a high}} [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio {{depending}} upon {{the amount of water}} present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly – as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas – and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a spawl. It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely. Moreover, as even a well-tempered vessel dries shrinkage rates vary around the contours of the form and will create strains which will crack an air drying vessel if the drying is not slowed and controlled. A high shrinkage rate probably meant lots of effort lost to broken pots in both the drying and firing stages for inexperienced potters and ineffective technologies. Woodland potters attempted to remedy the high shrinkage by using large amounts (up to 33%) of coarse sand and/or grog temper in their efforts to render the clay usable for vessel construction. Moreover, their vessel shapes were necessarily confined to either a flat or conical-bottomed vessel and a thick walled construction were required in order for the vessel to stand, in an unfired state, without collapsing during the air-drying process in preparation for firing. Non-backswamp clays used {{in many parts of the}} world could use grog and/or sand and create a round-bottomed vessel, favored by the cook, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>with</b> the [...] "gumbo" [...] clays of the Mississippi Valley.|$|E
