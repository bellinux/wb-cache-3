40|$|International audienceThe cross {{injection}} in a {{supersonic flow}} {{is an issue}} encountered in several aerodynamic applications such as fuel injection in scramjet combustor, missile control, drag reduction and thrust vector control. In a recent work, an analytical model has been presented to calculate the fluidic thrust vectoring performance for a supersonic axisymmetric nozzle. The model is able {{to take into account}} both the injected gas thermodynamic properties and the geometrical nozzle characteristics. The analytical model has been successfully validated following the cold air flow experimental analysis, in the case of fluidic thrust vectoring applied to conical nozzle. The aim of this work is to show how far the injected gas thermodynamic properties, {{different from that of the}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>main</b> flow, could influence the fluidic thrust vectorization parameters. In this work, the experimental performance of the fluidic thrust vectoring concept, using numbers of gases as injectant, has been qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Schlieren visualization, force balance and wall pressure measurements were used in the case of a truncated ideal contour nozzle. The experimental results are compared to the numerical and analytical findings. Performance analysis are conducted and basic conclusions are drawn in terms of thermodynamic gas properties effect on the fluidic thrust vector system. The primary effect was related to the gas molecular weight and its specific heat ratio product. It is observed that for fixed injection conditions, the vectoring angle is higher when the injected gas molecular weight and specific heat ratio product is less than that of the primary gas. For a given mission of the launcher, it can be concluded that the mass of the embedded gas, used for the fluidic vectorization system, can be significantly reduced, depending on its molecular weight and specific heat ratio...|$|E
40|$|Issues of {{propellant}} atomizing, {{mixing and}} viscous loss become increasingly more {{important as the}} thrust chamber are reduced in size. Two main components in thrust chamber {{have been identified as}} critical since small differences in its design can result in dramatically different performance. They are injector and nozzle, which have been greatly studied by many researchers experimentally or numerically. Current research examines the performance of two solid cone and one hollow cone swirl injectors and 22 convergent-divergent nozzles for thrust chamber application. The spray characteristics of these injectors were investigated by means of cold flow test and the flow inside the nozzles were numerically analyzed by means of computational model that utilizes Spalart-AUmaras model as turbulence model, which was designed specifically for aerospace applications. In addition, optimization of the nozzle's performance was investigated, where nozzle divergence angle was reduced if flow separation occurs inside <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Main</b> objectives of injector cold flow test lay on the determination of flow discharge coefficients, spray cone angle and spray break up length of each injector at different injection pressure. Results show an approximate direct proportion between Reynolds number and discharge coefficient. However, introducing purely axial stream inside injector's swirl chamber does not necessarily increase the coefficient of discharge. Experiment also indicates that increase in injection pressure increased the spray angle. However, at higher injection pressure, both solid cone injectors experience slight decreases in spray angle as the liquid film at the nozzle outlet contracted. Further investigation leads to general conclusion that breakup length decreased with an increase in injection pressure where hollow cone spray produces the longest liquid film. From nozzles analysis, there was significant improvement in nozzle's performance as a result of optimization is foreseen. It is concluded that in order to operate the thrust chamber efficiently, the nozzle geometry must be contoured to prevent flow separation. Actual testing of thrust chamber was performed by means of combustion test utilizing a specially designed test stand and feed systems. Although the test did not provide quantitative performance data of thrust chamber, the functionality and reliability of the feed system had been proved...|$|E

Further, the weft drag force by the <b>main</b> <b>nozzle</b> has been measured. The results are as follows : (1) The distributions of jet speed in the subsonic flow region are little affected by acceleration tube length of the nozzle (2) In the supersonic flow region, some effects of the tube length are founded. For nozzles with the accerelation tube length L≥ 70 mm, expansion waves are generated at the nozzle exit, on the other hand, for a nozzle with L= 50 mm, compression shock waves occur. (3) In the supersonic flow region, the generation of expansion waves for nozzles withL= 70 mm causes an abrupt increase in jet diameter and a reduction of the flow speed. However for a nozzle with L= 50 mm, significant changes in jet diameter and speed can not be observed owing to the genenration of compression shock waves.

Thrust production and propulsive efficiency are evaluated for different nozzle spacings using a new force estimation technique based on the fluorescence data. This analysis reveals that, compared to non-interacting jets, the efficiency and thrust generated by the pair of interacting jets can fall {{by as much as}} 10 % when the jets are brought into close proximity.
