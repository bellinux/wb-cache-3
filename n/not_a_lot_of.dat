So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dancing—it's more personal.|$|E

Christopher Schneider, a sociologist from the University of British Columbia says that there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> evidence to support that theory. Also important to note {{is that it can}} be difficult to discern sarcasm from honest, real intentions online. Social media did, however, play a large role during and after the riot.|$|E

Otherwise, {{if you give them}} a lot of film 'the committee' takes over. They start juggling scenes around and taking out this and putting in that. They can't do it with my pictures.

25|$|The {{neighborhood}} has been historically relatively safe. During the 1970s and 1980s, when crime in New York City {{was at an}} all-time high, the Mafia allegedly prevented crime from happening. Although {{there have been several}} burglaries and grand larceny autos in recent years, there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> violent crime. , the 104th Precinct (including Middle Village, plus the neighboring areas of Glendale, Ridgewood, and Maspeth) reported 3 murders (5 in 2001), 18 rapes (15 in 2001), 180 robberies (359 in 2001), 215 felonious assaults (262 in 2001), 292 burglaries (790 in 2001), 575 grand larcenies (551 in 2001), and 227 grand larceny auto (892 in 2001).|$|E
25|$|In Curonia, the Livonian {{language}} and culture also came under heavy pressure, but here it retained a last foothold on the outermost tip of the Curonian Peninsula. Several factors made sure that in this area, known as Līvõd rānda, the Livonian Coast, Latvian culture {{was too weak to}} assimilate the Livonians. For one thing, the society of the Livonians living in this area was exclusively sea-oriented and based on fishing, while that of the Latvians in the interior was exclusively land-oriented and mostly agricultural. This meant there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interaction between the two groups. Also, the Livonian Coast was separated from the interior of Curonia by dense forests and impassable marshlands, which made regular interaction even less likely. The people of the Livonian Coast had much closer ties to the inhabitants of the Estonian island of Saaremaa, across the Gulf of Riga to the north. In their isolated fishing villages, these Livonians kept to themselves for centuries. It was not until the 20th century that the outside world intruded on their quiet existence.|$|E
25|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is {{structured}} much like other three previous {{games in the}} series with some major twists. There are lots of improvements in gameplay overall compared to others. It {{is more of a}} quest-like adventure than a traditional hidden object game, a mixing of adventure and puzzle game. Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, unscrambling messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene other than the one they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them. All objects that players are able to pick up will serve a purpose, whether they are used in that scene or <b>not.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times in this game the pieces players pick up may only be used as they get to the next scene. Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E

The group's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film, [...] " [...] a great film that <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people know about...It amazes me that a film that is so readily available can be so lost." [...] In 1997, the Janus company released a model kit based on the Murder Legendre character.|$|E

Charles' secret weapon {{turned out to be}} not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded {{for all the world like}} a Pixies song.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{production}} {{began in}} early 2011, with director Sam Qualiana having created the film's title, poster, and a teaser trailer before finalizing its script. Qualiana has stated [...] "I always {{have had a}} fear of sharks. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things scare me, but sharks terrify and fascinate me at the same time". Qualiana viewed the film as a mixture of the 1975 thriller film Jaws and the 1982 science-fiction horror film The Thing. The film began shooting in Buffalo, New York, partially supported by an Indiegogo campaign launched by Qualiana with a fundraising goal of $3,000. Production was met with minor weather-related difficulties, including overcoming cold temperatures and the task of preventing snow from gathering on {{the lens of the}} film camera.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford's Cavendish Laboratory was {{carrying}} {{out some of}} the most advanced research into nuclear physics in the world at the time. Oliphant was invited to afternoon tea by Rutherford and Lady Rutherford. He soon got to meet other researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory, including Patrick Blackett, Edward Bullard, James Chadwick, John Cockcroft, Charles Ellis, Peter Kapitza, Philip Moon and Ernest Walton. There were two fellow Australians: Harrie Massey and John Keith Roberts. Oliphant would become especially close friends with Cockcroft. The laboratory had considerable talent but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money to spare, and tended to use a [...] "string and sealing wax" [...] approach to experimental equipment. Oliphant had to buy his own equipment, at one point spending £24 (...) of his allowance on a vacuum pump.|$|E

500|$|It also {{incorporates}} a Queen-referencing chorus: [...] "I {{want you to}} rock me, yeah, I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care." [...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> overt machismo in the song". [...] "I approached it like high school," [...] said [...] Hollander: [...] "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, {{and the world is}} theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture".|$|E
500|$|... "The Thing You Love Most" [...] is {{the first}} episode to feature Mary Margaret's loft, which is filmed on a small sound stage in Vancouver; most of the first season's {{interior}} shots are also filmed in the city, while many exterior shots are of nearby Steveston, British Columbia. The production team led by set decorator Mark Lane and production designer Michael Joy designed the residence to seem [...] "locked in time a little bit, so there's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> new stuff." [...] They included working class antiques such as a Hoosier cabinet, an old gas stove, and a Bakelite radio. The loft {{was meant to be}} located above a store and near a lumber mill and water, so the crew also designed it to feel like a fish cannery.|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face... there were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people who stood behind me."
