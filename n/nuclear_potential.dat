2500|$|Classically, the {{particle}} {{is confined to}} the nucleus {{because of the high}} energy requirement to escape the very strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>potential</b> well.

Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles a relationship between the half-life of the alpha-decay event process and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically and was known as the Geiger–Nuttall law. Some years later, the name Gamow factor or Gamow–Sommerfeld factor was applied to the probability of incoming nuclear particles tunnelling through the electrostatic Coulomb barrier and undergoing nuclear reactions.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of the Hartree-Fock approaches, the trouble is not to find the {{mathematical}} function which describes best the <b>nuclear</b> <b>potential,</b> but that which describes best the nucleon-nucleon interaction.
