60|$|The long dry summer came. As each fierce day burned {{itself out}} in little whiffs of pearl-gray smoke on the {{mountain}} summits, and the upspringing breeze scattered its red embers over the landscape, the green wave which in early spring upheaved above Smith's grave grew sere and dry and hard. In those days the master, strolling in the little churchyard of a Sabbath afternoon, was sometimes surprised to find a few wild flowers plucked from the damp pine forests scattered there, and oftener rude wreaths hung upon the little pine cross. Most of these wreaths were formed of a sweet-scented grass, which the children loved to keep in their desks, intertwined with the plumes of the buckeye, the syringa, and the wood anemone, and here and there the master noticed the dark-blue cowl of the monkshood, or deadly aconite. There {{was something in the}} odd association of this <b>noxious</b> <b>plant</b> with these memorials which occasioned a painful sensation to the master deeper than his esthetic sense. One day, during a long walk, in crossing a wooded ridge he came upon Mliss {{in the heart of the}} forest, perched upon a prostrate pine on a fantastic throne formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches, her lap full of grasses and pine burrs, and crooning to herself one of the Negro melodies of her younger life. Recognizing him at a distance, she made room for him on her elevated throne, and with a grave assumption of hospitality and patronage that would have been ridiculous had it not been so terribly earnest, she fed him with pine nuts and crab apples. The master took that opportunity to point out to her the noxious and deadly qualities of the monkshood, whose dark blossoms he saw in her lap, and extorted from her a promise not to meddle with it as long as she remained his pupil. This done--as the master had tested her integrity before--he rested satisfied, and the strange feeling which had overcome him on seeing them died away.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) is a naturalised {{tree that}} is {{classified}} as a <b>noxious</b> <b>plant</b> in several counties in the eastern South Island. It is locally abundant in lowland forest remnants, and with the indigenous spiny shrub matagouri (Discaria toumatou), on grazing land in Canterbury. Two scrub sites near Porters Pass, where the original hawthorn trees still existed, and a forest site near Kowai Bush were sampled by measuring stem diameters and counting growth rings, to determine the age structure and dynamics of hawthorn. Matagouri was sampled similarly {{at one of the}} sites. There is a close positive relationship between age, stem diameter and plant height for both hawthorn and the slower growing matagouri. Hawthorn growth is impeded by grazing, but it is spreading near Porters Pass in clumps of matagouri and in pastures that are only lightly grazed. If existing management continues, hawthorn is predicted to increase as more of the bushes reach fruiting age. In the forest site, less hawthorn is establishing now than when the forest was more disturbed, whereas seedlings and saplings of native trees are abundant. Hawthorn is predicted to decrease here. The management of hawthorn should recognise these different situations...|$|E

To understand the mechanism by which this <b>noxious</b> <b>plant</b> spreads, a laboratory experiment was conducted to assess its allelopathic potential to the germination of some range plants. Leachates were prepared from fresh and dry foliage of R. stricta. Seeds were germinated in petri dishes moistened with either leachates or tap water. Leachates inhibited germination with fresh foliage leachate being most severe. Complete germination inhibition was observed in Farsetia aegyptia and Pennisetum divisum. Haloxylon salicornicum and Lasiurus scindicus were the least affected. Rate of germination was also significantly reduced. H. salicornicum was the least affected (56 and 25 % in presence of dry and fresh leachates respectively), while other species were drastically reduced. Washing and regermination of the remaining non-germinated seeds indicated that seed viability of F. aegyptia and P. divisum may have been lost in presence of leachates. Osmotic effects of leachates {{may have contributed to}} germination inhibition in Atriplex halimus, Achillea fragrantissima, L. scindicus and R. stricta.

40|$|Background: Insects evolved ingenious {{adaptations to}} use {{extraordinary}} food sources. Particularly, the diet of herbivores enriched with <b>noxious</b> <b>plant</b> secondary metabolites requires detoxification mechanisms. Sequestration, which involves the uptake, transfer, and concentration of occasionally modified phytochemicals into specialized tissues or hemolymph, {{is one of}} the most successful detoxification strategies found in most insect orders. Due to the ability of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) carriers to transport a wide range of molecules including phytochemicals and xenobiotics, it is highly likely that they play a role in this sequestration process. To shed light on the role of ABC proteins in sequestration, we describe an inventory of putative ABC transporters in various tissues in the sequestering juvenile poplar leaf beetle, Chrysomela populi. Results: In the transcriptome of C. populi, we predicted 65 ABC transporters. To link the proteins with a possible function, we performed comparative phylogenetic analyses with ABC transporters of other insects and of humans. While tissue-specific profiling of each ABC transporter subfamily suggests that ABCB, C and G influence the plant metabolite absorption in the gut, ABCC with 14 members is the preferred subfamily responsible for the excretion of these metabolites via Malpighian tubules. Moreover, salicin, which is sequestered from poplar plants, is translocated into the defensive glands for further deterrent production. In these glands and among all identified ABC transporters, an exceptionally high transcript level was observed only for Cpabc 35 (Cpmrp). RNAi revealed the deficiency of other ABC pumps to compensate the functio...|$|E
40|$|Common {{or short}} ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is an annual herb {{belonging}} to the Asteraceae family that was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 18 th century. It is a noxious invasive species that is an important weed in agriculture {{and a source of}} highly allergenic pollen. The importance placed on A. artemisiifolia is reflected by the number of international projects that have now been launched by the European Commission and the increasing number of publications being produced on this topic. This review paper examines existing knowledge about ragweed ecology, distribution and flowering phenology and the environmental health risk that this <b>noxious</b> <b>plant</b> poses in Europe. The paper also examines control measures used in the fight against it and state of the art methods for modelling atmospheric concentrations of this important aeroallergen. Common ragweed is an environmental health threat, not only in its native North America but also {{in many parts of the}} world where it has been introduced. In Europe, where the plant has now become naturalised and frequently forms part of the flora, the threat posed by ragweed has been identified and steps are being taken to reduce further geographical expansion and limit increases in population densities of the plant in order to protect the allergic population. This is particularly important when one considers possible range shifts, changes in flowering phenology and increases in the amount of pollen and allergenic potency that could be brought about by changes in climate...|$|E
