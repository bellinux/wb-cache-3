5|$|In late November 2009, Zardari ceded to Prime Minister Gillani the {{chairmanship}} of the National Command Authority, Pakistan's <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal</b> oversight agency.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal.</b>|$|E
5|$|During his 2008 candidacy, Gravel {{called for}} a cut in {{military}} spending, variously reported to be 15 percent or 50 percent. He called for the savings to boost public education spending. To spur international nuclear nonproliferation efforts, Gravel called for unilateral reductions in the U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal.</b>|$|E

50|$|Richland, Washington was {{the first}} city {{established}} to support plutonium production at the nearby Hanford nuclear site, to power the American <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>arsenals.</b> Ozersk, Russia supported plutonium production to power the Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> at the Mayak nuclear plant. These were the first two cities {{in the world to}} produce plutonium for use in cold war atomic bombs.|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, {{the project}} {{expanded}} to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium {{for most of the}} more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal.</b> Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of radioactive materials into the air and the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear war, or {{at least}} {{deployed}} nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In Player Piano, the computer EPICAC is given control of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal,</b> and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In Cat's Cradle, John's original purpose in setting pen to paper is to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal,</b> and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E

50|$|In 1983, {{the nations}} of the world agreed to the Oslo Disarmament, {{severely}} limiting the size of <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals.</b> However, this led to a proliferation of biological and chemical weapons.|$|R
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal,</b> but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal</b> by 50percent. A second summit, was held in October 1986, Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500kilometers (300 to 3,400miles) and their infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{emigrated to}} the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the Manhattan Project, charged with {{developing}} the first atomic bomb. During this time he made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after World War II. After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos Laboratory superior J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal,</b> and a vigorous nuclear testing program. He was a co-founder of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.|$|E
50|$|Phase 3 (2019-2023) Negotiate {{a global}} zero accord, signed by all nuclear capable countries, for the phased, verified, {{proportional}} reduction of all <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> to zero total warheads by 2030.|$|R
5000|$|... (2009-2010) Resolved: The United States Federal Government should {{substantially}} {{reduce the}} size of its <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>arsenal,</b> and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>arsenal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under the Nuclear Command Authority, its secretariat, Strategic Plans Division (SPD), is {{responsible}} for the physical protection and to ensure security of all aspects of country's <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> and maintains dedicated force for this purpose. The SPD functions under the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee at the Joint Headquarters (JS HQ) and reports directly to the Prime Minister. The comprehensive nuclear force planning is integrated with conventional war planning at the National Security Council (NSC). According to the officials of Pakistan's military science circles, it is the high-profile civic-military committee consisting the Cabinet ministers, President, Prime minister and the four services chiefs, all of whom who reserves the right to order the deployment and the operational use of the nuclear weapons. The final and executive political decisions on <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> deployments, operational use, and nuclear weapons politics are made during the sessions of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which is chaired by the Prime minister. It is this DCC Council where the final political guideles, discussions and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> operational deployments are approved by the Prime minister. The DCC reaffirmed its policies on development of <b>nuclear</b> energy and <b>arsenals</b> through the country's media.|$|R

50|$|A September 2007 survey {{conducted}} by the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland showed that:63 percent of Russians favor eliminating all nuclear weapons, 59 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 53 percent support cutting the Russian and U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> to 400 <b>nuclear</b> weapons each. In the United States, 73 percent of the public favors eliminating all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing Russian and U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> to 400 weapons each. Eighty percent of Russians and Americans want their countries to participate in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.|$|R
50|$|At this meeting, a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} drastically reduce <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals,</b> and other issues involving the Kashmir dispute, and cross-border terrorism. However, the negotiations broke down and the process was collapsed so the Agra treaty was never signed.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. is advocating that Iran and North Korea {{should not}} develop nuclear weapons, while the U.S., {{the only country}} to have used nuclear weapons in warfare, {{maintains}} a <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal</b> of 5,113 warheads. However, this double-standard is legitimated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to which Iran is a party.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{transfer of power}} from Chirac to Sarkozy took place on 16 May at 11:00am (9:00 UTC) at the Élysée Palace, where {{he was given the}} authorization codes of the French <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal.</b> In the afternoon, the new President flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Lebanese {{government has}} several {{agreements with the}} Iranian government, which includes energy cooperation. The foreign ministers of Iraq, Lebanon and Syria supported Iran's nuclear work, calling for Israel to be stripped off its <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal.</b> Israel {{is believed to have}} the Middle East's only nuclear weapons arsenal.

40|$|The Cold War {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union entailed {{building}} up <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> with delivery systems and then negotiating treaties of disarmament and non-proliferation. Simply put both sides realised that the weapons once deployed couldn’t be used even to deter or win proxy wars and therefore their existence was {{more dangerous than}} any benefits that could be gained from their being. Mutually assured destruction (MAD) was the most likely result of any conflict escalation so at best the <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> and their delivery systems gave their owners a feeling of security that they couldn’t be directly attack. This was providing {{that the other side}} was rational to comprehend the consequences of nuclear annihilation. ...|$|R
25|$|Kahn {{rested his}} theory upon two premises, one obvious, one highly controversial. First, nuclear war was {{obviously}} feasible, since the United States and the Soviet Union currently had massive <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> aimed at each other. Second, {{like any other}} war, it was winnable.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. President is {{considered}} to be the world's most powerful political figure, {{as the leader of the}} only contemporary global superpower. The role includes being responsible of the world's most expensive military with the second largest <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal</b> and leading the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP. The presidency holds significant hard and soft power both domestically and abroad.|$|E
25|$|Another issue {{concerned}} the three areas {{of foreign policy}} that President Bush had been focusing on during the final months of his term: Iran's nuclear development, North Korea's <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal,</b> and the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. In all three cases, a diplomatic structure had already been established, {{although some of the}} Bush Administration's goals might differ from those Obama would adopt as president.|$|E
25|$|The other American piston bombers of the day, the B-29 and B-50, {{were also}} too limited in range and <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenal.</b> Intercontinental {{ballistic}} missiles (ICBMs) {{did not become}} sufficiently reliable until the early 1960s. Until the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress became operational in 1955, the B-36, as the only truly intercontinental bomber, continued {{to be the primary}} nuclear weapons delivery vehicle of the Strategic Air Command (SAC).|$|E
25|$|Pure fission weapons {{historically}} {{have been the}} first type to be built by a nation state. Large industrial states with well-developed <b>nuclear</b> <b>arsenals</b> have two-stage thermonuclear weapons, which are the most compact, scalable, and cost effective option once the necessary industrial infrastructure is built.|$|R
40|$|Though {{national}} and regional conflicts and international terrorism remain rife, since 1945 the world has not been subjected to truly pan-regional or trans-continental war.
