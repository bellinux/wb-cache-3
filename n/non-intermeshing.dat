40|$|Monsanto has {{developed}} and patented {{a process to}} recycle all the components of a nylon face fiber carpet. Using compatibilizers, fillers, and/or additives, post consumer carpets can be extruded into thermoplastic pellets which {{have a variety of}} properties useful for injection molding. Research was carried out on a 20 mm and 2 " counter rotating, <b>non-intermeshing</b> (CRNI) twin screw extruders. Optimization of the formulation {{led to the development of}} several polymers having a wide variety of material properties. The approach developed here offers a low cost method to recycle nylon carpets. The technology reported is applicable to carpets made from nylon 6 and 6, 6 face fiber, polypropylene backing, and SBR latex filled with CaC 03. additional work was done with polyester and polypropylene carpets with similar success. The objective is to use the complete carpet to minimize processing costs. No fiber separation or latex removal steps are required however preparation to feed to the extruder results in some removal. Reactive extrusion and compatibilization offers a way to alloy these different components into useful products for injection molding...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} depolymerization/pyrolysis of nylon 6 and 66 {{were investigated}} {{with the prospect}} of helping to curb the amount of carpet landfilled. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine which catalysts (and their nylon/catalyst ratio) were most suited for the depolymerization. By adding bases, the onset of degradation for some bases was 100 aC lower than that of the pure nylons. Potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide were found to be the most effective catalysts at a catalyst ratio of 100 : 1 of nylon 6 and nylon 66 to catalyst, respectively. After determining the most efficient catalyst, kinetic models/parameters from the TGA data were determined. These parameters were used in a reactive extrusion model for depolymerizing nylon 6 in carpet. Data from the model was then used to do cost analysis for the process. It was found that to get a Present Value Ratio greater than 1, the flow rate has to be {{greater than or equal to}} 500 lb/hr. At even higher flow rates up to the model¡¦s limit (1500 lb/hr), the Net Present Value shows that this process is economically viable. Extrusion of a 100 : 1 ratio of pure N 6 and KOH was done in a 30 mm counter-rotating <b>non-intermeshing</b> twin screw extruder. The material collected from the vents of the extruder was tested with a gas chromatograph- mass spectrum (GC-MS) in tandem. There was only one significant peak from the GC and the primary molecular weight on the MS was 113, the molecular weight of caprolactam. This shows that the process could be profitable and require little purification if done industrially. Ph. D.
