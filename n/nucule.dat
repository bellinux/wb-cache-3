Vegetative {{reproduction}} {{takes place}} by tubers, amylum stars and secondary protonema.The fructifications for sexual reproduction are globule or antheridium (male) and <b>nucule</b> or archegonium (female). The sex organs are multicellular and jacketed. The antheridia and archegonia may occur on separate plants (dioecy), {{together on the}} same plant (conjoined monoecy) or separately on the same plant (sejoined monoecy). After fertilization, the zygote develops into an oospore.|$|E

40|$|Parietaria pensvlvanica Mühlenb ex. Willd is {{a species}} native to North America, whose {{occurrence}} in Poland was first reported in Bydgoszcz in 1991. Its biology and ecology {{has been researched}} since 1996. The present paper discusses measurements and phenological observations carried out on four selected populations during the vegetation season in 1997. The {{aim of the research}} was to determine potentialities of the migration of P. pensylvanica from park habitats to segetal communities, {{on the basis of a}} defined life strategy of the examined populations. The analysis focused on the dynamics of density and biomass as well as on the weight of 1000 <b>nucules,</b> against the habitat conditions. The findings demonstrated that the investigated species was characterised by a set of life strategy properties referred to as C-S-R or S-R, and was subject to the "r"-type selection. P. pensylvanica has become an integral part of the Bydgoszcz flora and is likely to expand into segetal communities of agricultural and vegetable crops...|$|R

Arguing by analogy, Elster suggests that [...] "Molecular comes from molecule, and particular comes from particle, but there is no <b>nucule</b> to support nucular." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of fossils of this family have been {{recorded}} from the Lower Cretaceous (98-113 million years ago, Platanocarpus), the examples from that time had very small pollen (8-10 μm) and a developed perianth and they lacked hairs {{at the base of}} the <b>nucule.</b> It is thought to have had entomophilous pollination. During the mid Cretaceous, the fossilized forms with platanoid leaves became mixed with pinnate leaves (Sapindopsis) or pedatisect leaves (Debeya, Dewalquea), and these forms lasted until the Eocene. The leaves with typical stipules belonging to the sub-genus Platanus are very common in Palaeocene formations (60 M years ago). It is thought that the only modern genus, Platanus, is a relict that can be considered a living fossil. It must have been polyploidy, during its evolution judging by the size of its stomata.|$|E
