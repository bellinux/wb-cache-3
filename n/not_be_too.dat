5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E

25|$|Should {{a company}} decide to adopt this {{approach}} to the market, it is advisable to look for products and services that have both domestic demand as well as regional export potential.

25|$|The {{band had}} alluded to {{releases}} beyond their first release and touring cycle. A DVD release, containing studio {{footage of the}} group recording their debut album, was planned, but ultimately never released, in 2007. Patrick, shortly before the first album, anticipated that a second album would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> far off. Dean DeLeo would also say that he wanted listeners to wait and judge the band's songs once the band had released their fifth record.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} found in June 1926 and the Ministry of Defence {{immediately}} began planning a salvage operation. S2 was lying upside down {{at a depth of}} only 15 meters (50 feet) and it was believed that the lifting operation would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> difficult. The salvagers first tried to lift the ship by pumping air into the hull. This lifted the fore section to the surface, but the aft section was securely stuck in the bottom mud. They tried to loosen it by aiming high-pressure streams of water against the mud, but to no avail.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourteenth}} century there were several visitations. There is no notice of any by Bishop Dalderby; but he {{commissioned}} the prior of Dunstable in 1315 to visit the nuns of St. Giles-in-the-Wood in his name. Bishop Burghersh in 1322 wrote to order the prior and convent to take back a brother {{who had been on}} a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and asserted that he did so with the permission of his superior; and a little later the prior was cited for refusing to obey this injunction. In 1359 Bishop Gynwell, passing by the priory, noticed 'certain insolences and unlawful wanderings' of the canons, and wrote to reinforce the rule that none should go beyond the precincts of the monastery without reasonable cause, nor without the permission of the prior; and ordered further that such permission should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> frequently given. He also reminded them of the rule that none should eat or drink outside the monastery, or talk with seculars without permission.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E

60|$|One {{sentence}} {{near the}} end caused a considerable sensation, and opened their eyes to a fact which they might have guessed if they had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> much taken up with the spelling out of the faded pencilling {{to think of it}} at first.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
25|$|Like others before, Poincaré (1900) {{discovered}} a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying {{the conflict between}} the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.|$|E
