50|$|The <b>Nursing</b> <b>Outcomes</b> <b>Classification</b> (NOC) is a {{classification}} system which describes patient outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention. The NOC {{is a system}} to evaluate the effects of nursing care {{as a part of}} the nursing process. The NOC contains 330 outcomes, and each with a label, a definition, and a set of indicators and measures to determine achievement of the nursing outcome and are included The terminology is an American Nurses' Association-recognized terminology, is included in the UMLS, and is HL7 registered.|$|E
50|$|In {{agreement}} with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome. A common method of formulating the expected outcomes {{is to use the}} evidence-based <b>Nursing</b> <b>Outcomes</b> <b>Classification</b> to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures. The interventions used in the Nursing Interventions Classification again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a nursing care plan.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the state of}} the science for the five standardized nursing terminology sets in terms of level of evidence and study focus. DesignSystematic review. Data sourcesKeyword search of PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases from 1960 s to March 19, 2012 revealed 1257 publications. Review methodsFrom abstract review we removed duplicate articles, those not in English or with no identifiable standardized nursing terminology, and those with a low-level of evidence. From full text review of the remaining 312 articles, eight trained raters used a coding system to record standardized nursing terminology names, publication year, country, and study focus. Inter-rater reliability confirmed the level of evidence. We analyzed coded results. ResultsOn average there were 4 studies per year between 1985 and 1995. The yearly number increased to 14 for the decade between 1996 and 2005, 21 between 2006 and 2010, and 25 in 2011. Investigators conducted the research in 27 countries. By evidence level for the 312 studies 72. 4 % were descriptive, 18. 9 % were observational, and 8. 7 % were intervention studies. Of the 312 reports, 72. 1 % focused on North American Nursing Diagnosis-International, <b>Nursing</b> Interventions <b>Classification,</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Outcome</b> <b>Classification,</b> or some combination of those three standardized nursing terminologies; 9. 6 % on Omaha System; 7. 1 % on International Classification for Nursing Practice; 1. 6 % on Clinical Care Classification/Home Health Care Classification; 1. 6 % on Perioperative Nursing Data Set; and 8. 0 % on two or more standardized nursing terminology sets. There were studies in all 10 foci categories including those focused on concept analysis/classification infrastructure (n= 43), the identification of the standardized nursing terminology concepts applicable to a health setting from registered nurses’ documentation (n= 54), mapping one terminology to another (n= 58), implementation of standardized nursing terminologies into electronic health records (n= 12), and secondary use of electronic health record data (n= 19). ConclusionsFindings reveal that the number of standardized nursing terminology publications increased primarily since 2000 with most focusing on North American Nursing Diagnosis-International, Nursing Interventions <b>Classification,</b> and <b>Nursing</b> <b>Outcome</b> <b>Classification.</b> The majority of the studies were descriptive, qualitative, or correlational designs that provide a strong base for understanding the validity and reliability of the concepts underlying the standardized nursing terminologies. There is evidence supporting the successful integration and use in electronic health records for two standardized nursing terminology sets: (1) the North American Nursing Diagnosis-International, Nursing Interventions <b>Classification,</b> and <b>Nursing</b> <b>Outcome</b> <b>Classification</b> set; and (2) the Omaha System set.

40|$|Background In {{the era of}} {{evidenced}} based healthcare, {{nursing is}} required to demonstrate that care provided by nurses is associated with optimal patient outcomes, and {{a high degree of}} quality and safety. The use of standardized nursing terminologies and classification systems are a way that nursing documentation can be leveraged to generate evidence related to nursing practice. Several widely-reported nursing specific terminologies and classifications systems currently exist including the Clinical Care Classification System, International Classification for Nursing Practice®, <b>Nursing</b> Intervention <b>Classification,</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Outcome</b> <b>Classification,</b> Omaha System, Perioperative Nursing Data Set and NANDA International. However, the influence of these systems on demonstrating the value of nursing and the professions’ impact on quality, safety and patient outcomes in published research is relatively unknown. Purpose This paper seeks to understand the use of standardized nursing terminology and classification systems in published research, using the International Classification for Nursing Practice® as a case study. Methods A systematic review of international published empirical studies on, or using, the International Classification for Nursing Practice® were completed using Medline and the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Results Since 2006, 38 studies have been published on the International Classification for Nursing Practice®. The main objectives of the published studies have been to validate the appropriateness of the classification system for particular care areas or populations, further develop the classification system, or utilize it to support the generation of new nursing knowledge. To date, most studies have focused on the classification system itself, and a lesser number of studies have used the system to generate information about the <b>outcomes</b> of <b>nursing</b> practice. Conclusions Based on the published literature that features the International Classification for Nursing Practice, standardized nursing terminology and classification systems appear to be well developed for various populations, settings and to harmonize with other health-related terminology systems. However, the use of the systems to generate new nursing knowledge, and to validate nursing practice is still in its infancy. There is an opportunity now to utilize the well-developed systems in their current state to further what is know about nursing practice, and how best to demonstrate improvements in patient <b>outcomes</b> through <b>nursing</b> care...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Nursing</b> {{sensitive}} <b>outcomes</b> are adverse patient {{health outcomes}} {{that have been}} shown to be associated with nursing care. Researchers have developed specific algorithms to identify <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcomes</b> using administrative data sources, although contention still surrounds the ability to adjust for pre-existing conditions. Existing <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcome</b> detection methods could be improved by using look-back periods that incorporate relevant health information from patient’s previous hospitalisations. Design and setting: Retrospective cohort study at three tertiary metropolitan hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. Objectives: The objective of this research was to explore the effect of using linked hospitalisation data on estimated incidence rates of eleven adverse <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcomes</b> by retrospectively extending the timeframe during which relevant patient disease information may be identified. The research also explored whether patient demographics and/or the characteristics of their hospitalisations were associated with <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcomes.</b> Results: During the 5 year study period there were 356, 948 hospitalisation episodes involving 189, 240 patients for a total of 2, 493, 654 inpatient days at the three tertiary metropolitan hospitals. There was a reduction in estimated rates for all <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcomes</b> when a look-back period was applied to identify relevant health information from earlier hospitalisations within the preceding 2 years. Survival analysis demonstrates that the majority of relevant patient disease information is identified within approximately 2 years of the baseline <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcomes</b> hospitalisation. Compared to patients without, patients with <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcomes</b> were significantly more likely to be older (70 versus 58 years), female, have Charleson comorbidities, be direct transfers from another hospital, have a longer inpatient stay and spend time in intensive care units (p 0. 001). Conclusions: The results of this research suggest that <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcome</b> rates maybe over-estimated using current detection methods. Linked hospitalisation data enables the use of look-back periods to identify clinically relevant diagnosis codes recorded prior to the hospitalisation in which a <b>nursing</b> sensitive <b>outcome</b> is detected.
