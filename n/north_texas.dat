5|$|Charles Edward Greene {{was born}} September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school {{football}} at Dunbar High School in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, {{and he was not}} heavily recruited by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at <b>North</b> <b>Texas</b> State University (now University of <b>North</b> <b>Texas),</b> where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23–5–1 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, <b>North</b> <b>Texas</b> State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection.|$|E
5|$|In {{his junior}} season Greene married Agnes Craft, also {{a student at}} <b>North</b> <b>Texas</b> State and the {{daughter}} of a Dallas businessman. Tight on money, they were wed at Craft's sister's house in Dallas. Chuck Beatty, Greene's teammate at <b>North</b> <b>Texas</b> and later again in the NFL with the Steelers, served as best man.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in <b>North</b> <b>Texas,</b> Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in <b>North</b> <b>Texas,</b> beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E

In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. <b>North</b> <b>Texas</b> got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again.
