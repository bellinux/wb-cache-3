2500|$|In an {{interview}} in The Scotsman in 2002, Rowling described Elizabeth Goudge's The Little White Horse as having, [...] "perhaps {{more than any other}} book [...] [...] [...] a direct influence on the Harry Potter books. The author always included details of what her characters were eating and I remember liking that. You may have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> always list the food being eaten at Hogwarts." [...] Rowling said in O that [...] "Goudge was the only [...] whose influence I was conscious of. She always described exactly what the children were eating, and I really liked knowing what they had in their sandwiches." ...|$|E
2500|$|The world's fastest {{sprinter}} and runner Usain Bolt, {{who is from}} Jamaica (in the West Indies), once replied {{while being}} asked about who were his heroes {{when he was a}} child: [...] "When I was really small I loved the Pakistan cricket team. Waqar Younis {{was one of the greatest}} bowlers ever, and I was a bowler so I really enjoyed watching him. I was a big Pakistan fan until I got older, when I <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should actually support my home team." [...] When asked what if there was a match between Pakistan and Windies, Bolt remarked [...] "I would still have supported Pakistan, that’s what I’m saying – when I was little, it was all about Pakistan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Electronic Gaming Monthly's November 2006 edition's [...] "The Rest of the Crap" [...] section, {{written by}} critic Seanbaby, {{described}} Seanbaby's own involvement. Boll {{was going to}} appear on G4's Attack of the Show! to promote this fight by sparring {{with one of the}} hosts. Seanbaby stated that, [...] "Again, he's a matchmaking genius, because everyone on TV is three feet tall. If you were watching Attack of the Show during the time I cohosted, you might have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could have leaned over and eaten host Kevin Pereira." [...] A producer of the show then asked if Seanbaby would come and spar in the host's place for the event. Seanbaby said that he trains in muay thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, stating that [...] "boxing is to fighting what Hungry Hungry Hippos is to fighting", but that he was eager to fight Boll nonetheless. When Uwe heard of this, he wanted to know Seanbaby's age, height, weight and fighting experience since he [...] "learned he wasn't fighting a midget." [...] Seanbaby stated he sent said information to Boll, after which Boll chose not to appear on the program. Boll similarly declined to fight Canadian comedian Ron Sparks.|$|E

60|$|He drank his drink, {{and went}} on. He didn't seem to <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't jumping about the room, yapping with joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{the minute}} he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw him he hurried out of sight around the corner. I {{followed}} to the corner, but when I got there he had gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think of}} him," [...] said Olive; [...] "he's nothing to me." [...] Then she added, suddenly, [...] "Have you <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am afraid to face what I don't like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah you HAVE <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't asked before? However," [...] Van {{promptly}} added, [...] "I {{know well}} enough what you notice. Nanda hasn't mentioned to you whether or no she has heard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Did you <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{tipped the}} waiter a shilling? We can cross Lady Ulwight off the list; {{she would have}} died rather than do that.” ...|$|R
6000|$|CAESAR. Are {{you sure}} it is the {{moonlight}} that makes me look whiter than an Egyptian? (Grimly) Do you <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a rather long nose? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Unfortunate, perhaps, but not poor,” {{corrected}} Vasco; “if {{you read}} the list carefully you’ll <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven’t troubled to include anyone whose financial standing isn’t above question.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] he said; [...] "THEY {{carried it}} like it was heavy, that day at the ha'nted house. I <b>noticed</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> reckon I was right to think of {{fetching}} the little bags along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Get well? Why, {{certainly}} they will. They {{are not in}} any danger. I know how to hit and where to hit. You <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not hit them under the jaw. That would have killed them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right ho, Jeeves. So {{much for}} that, then. Now here's {{something}} else: You <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said I {{was going to}} put this project through tomorrow, and no doubt you wondered why I said tomorrow. Why did I, Jeeves?" ...|$|E
60|$|After supper, Uncle brewed some whisky-punch. I did {{justice to}} that also; Uncle John himself said so. He {{said he was}} glad to <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> liked it.|$|R
60|$|I went blindly {{through the}} tangle of undergrowth, {{stumbling}} at every step and scarce <b>noticing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stumbled; and in this fashion I came presently back to my mule.|$|R

6000|$|... "I believe so, too, Chetwode," [...] Mr. Weatherley declared. [...] "I {{am going}} to trust you now with a {{somewhat}} peculiar commission. You may have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have been asked to}} speak privately upon the telephone several times this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would, long ago," [...] said Nevada. [...] "And I'm rather {{stuck on the}} {{snow-storm}} idea, myself. I surely would hate one of these flowery church noon-weddings. Gilbert, I didn't know you had grit enough to propose it this way. Let's shock 'em--it's our funeral, ain't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sudden change}} in his companion's {{expression}} had its significance, and Jimmy smiled suggestively. [...] "Now {{you were a little}} astonished to see me turn up just when I was wanted, and you have probably <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been on your trail lately? Well, supposing we put the two together, {{what do you make of}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{give you}} <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall try {{hard to get}} her, if Mr. Crabbe will only let us be as we were before. Do {{you think there is}} any hope for us?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Whatever a man's age may be, he {{can reduce}} it several years {{by putting a}} bright-colored flower in his button-hole. <b>I</b> have often <b>noticed</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> your sex's reason for wearing a boutonniere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes! I {{know what}} you mean," [...] said Dan, and he gave way in a {{sputtering}} laugh. [...] "But they wouldn't understand. They'd only think we were spoons on each other; and if they <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cooled off toward people I'd liked, and warmed up toward those you liked, they'd say you made me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother," [...] {{said the}} young man, [...] "always made me eat {{one for a}} cold. Pardon my {{referring}} to a physical infirmity; but you may have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a very, very severe cold. I was going to eat the onion and go to bed. I wonder why I am standing here and apologizing to you for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Altrurian {{must have}} {{perceived}} {{that we were}} joking, though the Camps all remained soberly silent. [...] "I hope it isn't so bad as that," [...] he said, [...] "though I have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> seem to affect you all {{with a kind of}} misgiving.

6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] I returned, [...] "why should they? My arm {{has stopped}} bleeding, and they won't find out. If they <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't use it--well, I can just say I had a knock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very probably; I shall {{like him}} to think it," [...] said Ralph, smiling; [...] "and, {{to carry out the}} idea, <b>I</b> give you <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall be very sharp, quite horrid and strange, with you." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled and}} nodded, and then, <b>noticing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had unlashed the bed roll, she {{indicated}} {{the end of}} the cabin where I might spread it. Her own bunk, I noticed, was made up at the opposite end.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] he said, {{when she}} had finished; [...] "but I did not tell Luud--you <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not tell Luud about it.

6000|$|... "It {{shows what}} a rush our life is," [...] I philosophized, with the {{implication}} that Hasketh and I had been old friends, and I ought to have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not met him {{during the time of}} his absence. The fact was we had never come so near intimacy as when we exchanged confidences concerning the severity of Tedham's sentence in coming out of the court-room together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, just so," [...] {{admitted}} the Czarover. [...] "They really look that way, don't they? But you must never trust to appearances, {{which have a}} way of fooling one. Perhaps you <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> prevented you from meeting any of my people. I protected you with my giants while you were on the way from the gates to my palace so that not a Herku got near you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great God, Prendick!" [...] he said, not <b>noticing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was hurt, [...] "that brute's loose! Tore the fetter {{out of the}} wall! Have {{you seen}} them?" [...] Then sharply, seeing I gripped my arm, [...] "What's the matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Staveley {{waited to}} speak to me till the rest of them had left us together. I had {{expected}} her to <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> looked dull and dismal. No! her cleverness got at my secret in quite another way.|$|R
50|$|Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones fired me {{just before}} the last two shows of our 35th anniversary tour. I'm both happy and sad over the whole thing. I always loved the work onstage—but I just couldn't handle the {{backstage}} problems. I'd given them 30 days <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was leaving so my position is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> resigned first and then they dropped me. Thank God I don't need the Monkees anymore...I'm a recovering alcoholic and haven't had a drink in several years. I'm not against people drinking—just when they get mean and abusive. I went on the anniversary tour with the agreement <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{have to put up}} with drinking and difficult behavior offstage. When things weren't getting better, I gave the guys <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was leaving in 30 days for good.|$|R
