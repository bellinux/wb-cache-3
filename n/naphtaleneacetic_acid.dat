Two standard macrosalt formulations (Margara N 30 K and Murashige and Skoog), {{a range of}} benzyladenine and sucrose concentrations were tested for their effect on shoot multiplication. The cytokinin concentration {{was the most important}} factor affecting shoot multiplication. The highest shoot multiplication rate was obtained from single-node explants cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 4. 4 mu M benzyladenine. Cytokinin concentration and an interaction of macrosalts and benzyladenine influenced shoot length on the multiplication stage: best shoot growth was observed on MS medium containing 1. 1 mu M benzyladenine. In addition, sucrose concentrations of 87. 6 - 146. 0 mM gave the highest multiplication rates and improved shoot growth. Following a shoot ellongation stage, single shoots were rooted on media containing <b>naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (1. 3 - 5. 4 mu M).

Zygotic embryos of the Tunisian cultivar D’hirat cultured in vitro develop adventitious buds. The best results for bud induction were obtained in Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with 6 -benzylaminopurine (5 mg/l) and <b>naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (1 mg/l). Important effect of 6 -benzylaminopurine in adventitious bud formation was demonstrated. Shoot bud development was {{enhanced by the}} addition of gibberellic acid to the medium. Plants were rooted in Murashige and Skoog medium at half strength and transferred into pots, containing loam. To test the stability of the regenerants, characters related to the fertility, fruit quality, leaf and flower were measured. Regenerants and their progeny were compared to control plants derived from seeds. Variance analysis and CANDISC were used in our investigation.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of different AVG (aminoethoxyvinylglycine) treatments on pre-harvest fruit drop rates and ripening levels of ‘Jonagold’ apples. A total of 225 mg L- 1 AVG dose was applied at once in a single application at different times or divided into doses and applied different times. Compared to control treatment, entire AVG treatments increased fruit removal force and significantly decreased the pre-harvest drop rates. AVG treatments applied at once (225 mg L- 1) 8 or 4 weeks before the anticipated harvest time {{were found to be}} more effective than the divided treatments. AVG treatments inhibited ethylene biosynthesis and such an inhibition was more distinctive in single 225 mg L- 1 treatments. AVG treatments decreased flesh softening, starch degradation rates and consequently retarded fruit ripening. The 225 mg L- 1 AVG treatment applied 4 weeks before the harvest significantly increased L* value and hue angle both in the year 2010 and 2011. NAA (<b>naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> at 10 mg L- 1 sprayed 4 and 2 weeks before anticipated harvest was found to be insignificant in control of pre-harvest fruit drops.

40|$|Although {{brassinosteroids}} (BRs) {{are known}} to regulate shoot growth, {{their role in the}} regulation of root growth is less clear. We show that low concentrations of BRs such as 24 -epicastasterone and 24 -epibrassinolide promote root elongation in Arabidopsis wild-type plants up to 50 % and in BR-deficient mutants such as dwf 1 - 6 (cbb 1) and cbb 3 (which is allelic to cpd) up to 150 %. The growth-stimulating effect of exogenous BRs is not reduced by the auxin transport inhibitor 2, 3, 5 -triidobenzoic acid. BR-deficient mutants show normal gravitropism, and 2, 3, 5 -triidobenzoic acid or higher concentrations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and <b>naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibit root growth in the mutants to the same extent as in wild-type plants. Simultaneous administration of 24 -epibrassinolide and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid results in largely additive effects. Exogenous gibberellins do not promote root elongation in the BR-deficient mutants, and the sensitivity to the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid is not altered. Thus, the root growth-stimulating effect of BRs appears to be largely independent of auxin and gibberellin action. Furthermore, we analyzed BR interactions with other phytohormones on the gene expression level. Only a limited set of auxin- and ethylene-related genes showed altered expression levels. Genes related to other phytohormones barely showed changes, providing further evidence for an autonomous stimulatory effect of BR on root growth. [References: 54] 5...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{selection}} of Foeniculum vulgare for salt tolerance was {{undertaken by the}} use of somaclonal variation. In this idea, explants of root, hypocotyl and cotyledon of sterilized seedling were transferred to callus and regeneration media with concentrations of 0, 50, 100 and 150 mM of NaCl. After 4 weeks, calli induction, regeneration frequency and calli fresh and dry weights, in both control and stress conditions, were measured. The results showed that salinity caused a significant decrease in the callus induction and shoot regeneration of fennel. However, in the presence of 100 and 150 mM NaCl, the highest frequency of callus induction in hypocotyl and cotyledon explants was recorded on the media supplemented with 1 mg l- 1 IAA (Indol- 3 -Acetic Acid) plus 1 mg l- 1 2, 4 -D (2, 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 2 mg l- 1 kinetin. Among different growth regulator treatments, the combination of 2 mg l- 1 NAA (<b>Naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> and 0. 5 mg l- 1 kinetin was found to be the most effective for shoot regeneration under stress condition. The highest dose of NaCl (150 mM) inhibited callus induction and shoot regeneration compared to control with 41 % and 96 % respectively. The calli fresh and dry weights of all explants were decreased with the increas of NaCl concentration.

To investigate the regulation of tomato SlGA 20 ox 1 expression a genomic clone was isolated, its promoter transcriptionally fused to the GUS reporter gene and the construct used to transform Arabidopsis. Expression was found in diverse vegetative (leaves and roots) and reproductive (flowers) organs. GUS staining was also localized in the columella of secondary roots. GA negative feed-back regulation of SlGA 20 ox 1 :GUS was shown to be active both in tomato and in transformed Arabidopsis. Auxin (indol- 3 -acetic acid, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and <b>naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid),</b> triiodobenzoic acid (an inhibitor of auxin transport) and benzyladenine (a cytokinin) treatment induced SlGA 20 ox 1 :GUS expression associated with increased auxin content and/or signalling, detected using DR 5 :GUS expression as a marker. Interestingly, SlGA 20 ox:GUS expression was induced by auxin and root excision in the hypocotyl, an organ not showing GUS staining in control seedlings. In etiolated seedlings, SlGA 20 ox 1 :GUS expression occurred in the elongating hypocotyl region of etiolated seedlings and was down-regulated upon transfer to light associated with decrease of growth rate elongation. Our results show that feed-back, auxin and light regulation of SlGA 20 ox 1 expression depends on DNA elements contained within the first 834 bp of the 5 ´upstream promoter region. Putative DNA regulatory sequences involved in negative feed-back regulation and auxin response were identified in that promoter.

40|$|Introduction: Miniature rose (Rosa hybrida) {{are well}} {{known as one of}} the world’s most popular {{ornamental}} plants cultivated worldwide as potted and/or bed plants. Nowadays, more than 100 million pots of miniature roses are propagated by stem cutting in the commercial greenhouses of European countries such as Denmark and Germany. Some treatments such as application of plant growth regulators and suitable rooting medium could be required for accelerating root formation in rose cuttings. Using plant growth regulators like natural or synthetic auxin is a pre-requirement for the initiation of adventitious root in some stem cuttings and it has been reported that the division of the first initiator cells of root depends on internal or synthetic auxin. Methods of application of these chemicals and suitable concentration could be related to several factors, importantly the plant varieties, type of cuttings and the time of cutting preparation. Various kinds of media such as soil, peat moss, perlite and vermiculite are used as bed substrate according to required ratio. Rooting media must provide appropriate moisture and air ventilation for cuttings establishment, which highly affect the cuttings root formation. Appropriate procedure for using wastes materials as culture bed, especially those materials that produced locally, is main aim of some studies to find an alternative medium in ornamental pot plant production. In this regards, evaluation of agricultural wastes to be used to culture bed and introducing suitable materials could be considered. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of two types of plant growth regulators and bed combinations on rooting percentage of semi-hardwood cuttings in miniature rose. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA) and <b>naphtaleneacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA), and two media with different composition on root formation of miniature rose stem cutting, this research was carried out as a factorial on the basis of randomized complete design (RCD) with three replications. Plant growth regulators including IBA at concentrations of 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mgl- 1, concentrations of NAA at 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mgl- 1 were applied together with two types of rooting media. Media including mixing volume of perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2, and perlite, peat and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 were mixed and applied in this experiment. Using SAS software, data was analyzed based on a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis and tested by least significant difference (LSD) at (P-value< 0. 05). Results and Discussion: Results showed that the highest rooting percentage of cuttings was obtained with 2000 mgl- 1 of IBA, while no significant effect of NAA treatment and different rooting media on percentage of rooting was revealed. The two-fold and three-fold interaction of treatments on other measured traits such as primary and secondary root number and root diameter were significant. The two-fold interaction of NAA treatments and rooting media on the trait of primary root number were no significant. The highest root number and root diameter measured in medium containing perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 for cutting received combined plant growth regulators. Conclusions: Compost, the final product of organic residues degradation, improves soil physical characteristics such as soil aggregate formation and stability, water penetration, porosity, compressing resistance and nutrients availability. As well, it improves soil biological characteristics and in result, integration of compost with soil can increase growth, yield and quality of crop. There are also some evidences that in contrast of peat, compost contains plant growth regulators improved plant growth and development. Totally, considering our obtained results, in order to accelerate rooting formation in miniature rose cuttings, treatment of cuttings with synthetic plant growth regulators in medium containing perlite: tea wastes compost: sand (2 : 2 : 1) under alternate mist system is recommended. Organic materials activate root area as well as improving fertility of soil. They also play a role in supplying and releasing absorbable nutrients, root establishment, enhancing field capacity, reducing evaporation from soil surface and reducing expenses. Therefore, we emphasize on appropriate using of these components in order to obtain better productivity...|$|E
