50|$|<b>Norclostebol</b> (INN; {{brand name}} Lentabol; former {{developmental}} code names SKF-6611, CP-73) is a synthetic anabolic steroid that {{is derived from}} nandrolone. It was described in the literature in 1957. <b>Norclostebol</b> is also used as an ester, <b>norclostebol</b> acetate (brand name Anabol 4-19).|$|E
50|$|<b>Norclostebol</b> acetate (brand name Anabol 4-19), or norchlorotestosterone acetate (NClTA), {{also known}} as 4-chloro-19-nortestosterone 17β-acetate or as 4-chloroestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, {{injectable}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and derivative of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone). It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17β acetate ester of <b>norclostebol</b> (4-chloro-19-nortestosterone).|$|E
50|$|<b>Norclostebol</b> is a 4-chloro {{derivative}} of testosterone. It {{works out to}} be significantly stronger than pure testosterone. It is approximately 6.6 times as anabolic while only 40% as androgenic. This {{may not be a}} particularly fair or valid comparison however. It is more appropriate to compare <b>norclostebol</b> to testosterone propionate due to the use of an ester. In this case they are fairly even in anabolic potency at 112% but only 20-25% as androgenic. In practice this means <b>norclostebol</b> is a potent anabolic compound with minimal tendency towards side effects.|$|E
