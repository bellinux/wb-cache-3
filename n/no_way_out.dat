5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> is a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced by WWE, {{a professional}} wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 1998 as an In Your House event in February of that year and in 2000 was made an annual pay-per-view event for WWE. After the brand extension, the event was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand in 2004, being produced every February. In April 2007, following WrestleMania 23, brand-exclusive pay-per-view events ceased being held, {{with the last of}} which being the SmackDown-exclusive <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> 2007. After the event included two Elimination Chamber matches in 2008 and 2009, <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> was replaced by WWE Elimination Chamber the following year. The name was revived for the June 2012 pay-per-view event.|$|E
5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Out.</b> In the weeks preceding <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Out,</b> Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Out,</b> earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E

Lesnar interfered in the Royal Rumble match, a 30-man battle royal, attacking and eliminating Goldberg from the match. On the week of January 26, 2004, Lesnar and Goldberg conducted promotional in-ring segments on respective episodes of Raw and SmackDown!, in which they insulted each other.
