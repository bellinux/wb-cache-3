5|$|<b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again is a 1983 James Bond spy film {{starring}} Sean Connery, {{directed by}} Irvin Kershner, produced by Jack Schwartzman, and written by Lorenzo Semple Jr. with uncredited additional co-writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, from {{a story by}} Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming. It is the second adaptation of Fleming's Thunderball, which was previously adapted as the 1965 film of the same name. Unlike the majority of James Bond films, <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again was not produced by Eon Productions, but by an independent production company, one of whose members was Kevin McClory, {{one of the original}} writers of the Thunderball story, who retained the filming rights of the novel following a legal dispute over them.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December 1997, MGM {{announced}} {{that the company had}} purchased the rights to <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again from Schwartzman's company Taliafilm. The company has since handled the release of both the DVD and Blu-ray editions of the film.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 Casino Royale {{was adapted}} into a parody Bond film {{starring}} David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's {{preference for the}} role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, {{was not part of the}} Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again from Taliafilm. As of 2015, Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E
5|$|Independently of the Eon series, {{there have}} been three {{additional}} productions with the character of James Bond: a 1954 American television adaptation, Casino Royale, produced by CBS; a 1967 spoof, Casino Royale, produced by Charles K.

5|$|<b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again was {{released}} by Warner Bros. in October 1983, opening to positive reviews and was a commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although less overall than the Eon-produced Octopussy released in the same year.

5|$|Although other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two actors have played the part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey {{in one of the}} non-Eon films, <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again.|$|E

Fox's M is also younger {{than any of the}} previous incarnations. The media historian James Chapman notes that whilst M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.|$|E

5|$|In 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} the 1967 film Casino Royale from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $10million in the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit. The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production of <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again in 1983. In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Leiter also {{appeared}} in novels by continuation authors, as well as ten films and one television programme, Casino Royale, where the character became a British agent, Clarence Leiter, played by Michael Pate.
