5|$|The 2007 National League wild-card tie-breaker {{game was}} a one-game {{extension}} to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2007 regular season, played between the San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies of the National League's (<b>NL)</b> <b>West</b> Division {{to determine the}} NL wild card. It was played at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, on October 1, 2007. The Rockies won the game 9–8 in thirteen innings on a controversial play at home plate.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals did {{finish in}} last place of the NL East in 1990. However, the Atlanta Braves of the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> had a worse record. The next longest streak is by the Cincinnati Reds, who most {{recently}} finished {{in last place}} of the NL in 1982. The similar streak in the American League is held by the Boston Red Sox, who last finished in last place of the AL in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros hired Virdon {{as their}} manager on August 20, 1975, {{succeeding}} Preston Gómez. Tal Smith, {{who had served}} as {{executive vice president for}} the Yankees, had become the Astros' general manager on August 7. Virdon led the Astros to third-place finishes in 1976 and 1977, but the Astros slipped to fifth place in 1978. The 1979 Astros fell one game short of winning the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> division championship. The Astros tied the Los Angeles Dodgers for the division championship in 1980, and defeated them in the 1980 <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> tie-breaker game. The Astros played the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 NLCS, losing the series in five games. He again won the Manager of the Year Award in 1980. Due to the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, the 1981 season was split into halves with each half's winner appearing in the 1981 NL Division Series. The Dodgers won the first half, while the Astros won the second. In the Division Series, the Dodgers defeated the Astros in five games. During the 1982 season, the Astros fell to fifth place. Virdon was fired during the season and replaced by Bob Lillis.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Padres are a {{professional}} baseball franchise based in San Diego, California. They are {{a member of}} the National League (<b>NL)</b> <b>West</b> in Major League Baseball (MLB). The team joined MLB in 1969 as an expansion team and have won two NL Championships in 1984 and 1998. The team played their home games at Qualcomm Stadium (formerly known as San Diego Stadium and Jack Murphy Stadium) from 1969 to 2003. Starting with the 2004 season, they moved to PETCO Park, where they have played since. The team is owned by Ron Fowler, and Josh Byrnes is their general manager.|$|E
5|$|Hershiser {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to pitch against the NL-leading New York Mets (80–54) on Sunday, September 4, but a rainout delayed his performance. The Dodgers entered the game with a 77–57 record and a 5-game lead in the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> over the Astros, while the Atlanta Braves were 31 games back in sixth place in the division with a 46–88 record entering the game. With the September 5 win, the Dodgers retained their 5-game lead. Hershiser struck out Dale Murphy four times, once resorting to a rare sidearm curveball to do so, to the dismay of pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who worried about injuries caused by sidearm pitching. According to ESPN's Mark Simon, this was the only game of Murphy's 2,180-game career in which a single pitcher struck him out four times. After a two-out walk to Dion James in the third inning, Hershiser allowed no baserunners until the ninth inning. With his fourth straight complete game, Hershiser raised his record to 19–8, making him 3–1 with a 1.00 ERA in those games.|$|E
5|$|López {{reached the}} playoffs as the Giants won the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> {{for the first}} time since 2003. He made two {{appearances}} in the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves to face Jason Heyward, whom he struck out both times. The Giants won the series in four games. Against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS, he made five appearances, all scoreless except for Game 4, in which he allowed a run. In the deciding Game 6, he pitched a scoreless seventh inning and was awarded with a win after Juan Uribe hit a game-winning home run against Ryan Madson in the eighth inning. López made two appearances against the Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, striking out the two batters he faced. In Game 2, he struck out Josh Hamilton to end the top of the eighth inning with a runner on second and preserve a 2–0 lead, although the Giants went on to win 9–0. He won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{made his}} next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, {{who would later}} finish the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to Pete Rose {{in the first inning}} and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard {{struggled}} in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two wild pitches in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with a 76–54 record and a 6.5-game lead in the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> over the Houston Astros, while the Montreal Expos were 11 games back in third place in the NL East with a 66–64 record {{entering}} the game. With the August 30 win, the Dodgers retained their 6.5-game lead. The win marked the Dodgers' fifth consecutive win and twelfth out of 15. Hershiser contributed a two-run double in the second inning to help the Dodgers build a 3–0 lead. After Hershiser gave up two runs in the fifth, no baserunners reached second base against him in the final four innings, thus marking the first four scoreless innings of his streak. The game marked Hershiser's third consecutive and tenth complete game of the season. Following the game, his 2.84 ERA ranked third on the team behind Tim Leary (2.44) and John Tudor (2.37).|$|E
5|$|During Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits. Drysdale {{maintained}} {{the record for}} consecutive shutouts (6) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted 16 innings. Hershiser's record was overshadowed because the 1988 Summer Olympics {{and the start of}} the 1988 National Football League season occurred at the same time. Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time (Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders). Additionally, baseball fans were more concerned with pennant races. Furthermore, four of the final five games in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone, limiting the games' visibility {{to the rest of the}} country. Controversially, KTTV did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> or the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record. Instead, it showed Friday the 13th and The Funhouse on September 26 and 28, respectively. The record-setting game drew an attendance of 22,596.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman saved a 3–1 {{win over}} the Diamondbacks on September 30 as the Padres to {{clinched}} a playoff berth. The next day in the last regular season game, two home runs were hit off Hoffman before he saved a 7–6 {{win over the}} Diamondbacks, earning the Padres their second consecutive <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> title. He was named MLB Delivery Man of the Month for September after being 10for11 in save opportunities and striking out 13 batters over 12.0 innings and allowing only seven hits. Hoffman saved 46 of 51 save chances on the year, and led the NL in saves {{for the second time}}. His 11th 30-save season set an MLB record, while his eighth 40-save season extended his record. His season save total was the second highest in his career. Hoffman won the Rolaids Relief Award {{for the second time in}} his career, was awarded The Sporting News NL Reliever of the Year for the third time, and finished as the runner-up for the Cy Young Award for the second time. In the playoffs, the Padres faced the Cardinals in the NLDS again. Down 2–0 in the series, Hoffman saved Game 3 in a 3–1 win to avoid elimination. However, the Padres lost the series 3–1 as their offense managed only six runs in the four games against the eventual 2006 World Series champions.|$|E
25|$|Since their debut, the Diamondbacks {{have won}} five <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> {{division}} titles, one NL pennant, and the 2001 World Series.|$|E
25|$|No-Hitters: Marlins {{pitchers}} have pitched six no-hitters in team regular-season history, five coming against {{teams in}} the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> and one against a team from the American League (AL).|$|E
25|$|On September 28, the Giants were officially {{eliminated}} from the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> race after losing to the division champion San Diego Padres, finishing a distant third at 75–87, their worst, and first losing, season since 1996. Despite the disappointing finish, the Giants extended manager Felípe Alou's contract for another year.|$|E
25|$|Remaining {{with the}} Reds as a non-playing manager after {{retiring}} as a player, Rose {{led the team}} from August 15, 1984 until August 24, 1989. With a career record as a manager of 426–388, Rose ranks fifth in Reds history for managerial wins. During Rose's four full seasons at the helm (1985–1988), the Reds posted four second-place finishes in the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> division.|$|E
25|$|During the off season, the Giants {{strengthened}} their {{pitching staff}} by acquiring veteran starting pitcher Randy Johnson and relievers Bobby Howry and Jeremy Affeldt. The Giants also signed infielders Édgar Rentería and Juan Uribe. Despite questions lingering about the team's struggling offense, the team compiled a 49–39 record by the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, {{good enough for}} {{second place in the}} <b>NL</b> <b>West.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2014 Los Angeles Dodgers {{season was}} the 125th for the {{franchise}} in Major League Baseball, and their 57th season in Los Angeles. On April 30, the Dodgers picked up their 10,000th win {{since joining the}} National League in 1890. They proceeded to win their second straight <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> championship but lost in four games to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Division Series.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{won their}} third {{straight}} <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> Championship in 2015, marking {{the first time}} in franchise history they had made the playoffs three years in a row. The season ended when they lost to the New York Mets in the Division Series. The Dodgers set a major league record this season when they became the first team in history to have a payroll in excess of $300 million.|$|E
25|$|In the 1985 {{season he}} led the National League (NL) in winning percentage, {{compiling}} a 19–3 record with a 2.03 ERA. The Dodgers won the <b>NL</b> <b>West,</b> and Hershiser finished third in Cy Young Award voting. He also saw his first post-season action, pitching in two games in the 1985 National League Championship Series. In the 1986 season, Hershiser went 14–14 with a 3.85 ERA. The next season he was selected to his first All-Star Game while compiling a 16–16 record with a 3.06 ERA.|$|E
25|$|The Colorado Rockies are an American {{professional}} baseball team based in Denver, Colorado. The Rockies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{as a member}} club of the National League (<b>NL)</b> <b>West</b> division. The team's home venue is Coors Field, located in the Lower Downtown area of Denver. The Rockies won their only National League championship in 2007, after having won 14 of their final 15 games {{in order to secure}} a Wild Card position. In the World Series they were swept by the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox in four games.|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Diamondbacks, often {{shortened}} as the D-backs, are an American {{professional baseball}} franchise based in Phoenix, Arizona. The club competes in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{as a member}} of the National League (<b>NL)</b> <b>West</b> division. Since the team's inception in 1998, the franchise has played home games at Chase Field, formerly known as Bank One Ballpark. The Diamondbacks have won one World Series championship (in 2001), becoming the fastest expansion team in the Major Leagues to win a championship, doing it in only the fourth season since the franchise's inception in the 1998 Major League Baseball season.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{had many}} highlights. After the Astrodome hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in July, the Astros {{went on a}} streak with five {{straight}} come-from-behind wins (two against the Mets and three against the Montreal Expos). In {{a game against the}} Dodgers, pitcher Jim Deshaies (who came from the Yankees in exchange for Joe Niekro) started the game with eight straight strikeouts. On September 25, Mike Scott helped his team clinch the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> by no-hitting the San Francisco Giants. This was the only time in MLB history that any division was clinched via a no-hitter. Scott would finish the season with an 1810 record and a Cy Young Award to go along with it.|$|E
25|$|Ended L.A.'s 15-game road win streak. The {{home game}} win on August 6 against their ace Clayton Kershaw (10–6, 1.87), {{highlighted}} by four double plays (fourth {{time in a}} 2013 game), ended the L.A. Dodgers fourth-best in MLB history's 15-game road winning streak. The 1912 Washington Senators had 16, and the record of 17 stays with the 1916 New York Giants, later tied by the 1984 Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals 134 double plays turned lead all of MLB, including an NL-leading 12 by reliever Seth Maness who has turned them in only 39.1 IP. The team (66–46) stayed two games behind the NL Central leading Pirates, while the Dodgers (62–50) continue leading the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> over Arizona by five games.|$|E
25|$|Boston took {{an early}} 2–0 lead against the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> leading Giants but {{surrendered}} three {{runs in the}} fourth and fifth inning. In the seventh inning, the Red Sox tied the game and it went into extra innings. With the bases loaded and one out, two runs scored on a Xander Bogaerts bloop single {{in the top of the}} tenth which was the difference in the game. In game two, David Price pitched a complete game, allowing two runs on three hits. The only run for the Red Sox came off the bat of Chris Young with a solo shot in the fourth. Boston lost or split four series in a row for the first time since July/August 2014, when they dropped five consecutive series against the Blue Jays twice, Rays, Yankees and Cardinals.|$|E
25|$|Despite inaugural game festivities {{at the new}} ballpark, those pesky Dodgers spoiled the 2000 {{season opener}} with an {{unexpected}} three-HR outburst by little-known, light-hitting shortstop Kevin Elster. But the Giants rebounded after losing their first six games in their new home with a solid effort all season long, culminating with not only the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> Division title but {{the best record in}} the major leagues. Kent paced the attack with clutch hits (33 HR, 125 RBI) en route to being elected MVP over runner-up Bonds with 49 HR & 106 RBI. The pitching staff was not great but certainly decent, five starters earning at least ten wins: Liván Hernández (17–11, 3.75), Russ Ortíz (14–12, 5.01), Kirk Rueter (11–9, 3.96), Shawn Estes (15–6, 4.26) and Mark Gardner (11–7, 4.05). Closer Robb Nen was nearly perfect, with 41 saves and a minute 1.50 ERA.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers {{would not}} make the playoffs again until 2011, when they won the AL Central title {{for the first time}} with their last {{division}} title being the 1987 AL East crown. The Tigers would win the AL Central in 2012 again and would return to the World Series in 2012 after winning the 2012 American League pennant where they would be swept by the San Francisco Giants in four games. The Cardinals' would later make the playoffs in 2009, when the NL Central champions were swept by the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> champions Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2009 NLDS. The Cardinals also made it to the playoffs as the Wildcard entry in 2011, winning the 2011 National League pennant and going on to beat Texas Rangers in the 2011 World Series, but failing to defend that title in the 2012 NLCS losing to the Giants in seven games.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{fourth in}} 1985, the Astros fired general manager Al Rosen and manager Bob Lillis. The former was supplanted by Dick Wagner, {{the man whose}} Reds defeated the Astros to win the 1979 <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> title. The latter was replaced by Hal Lanier who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, Whitey Herzog, had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as Whiteyball, took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, {{both of which were}} characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start, winning 13 of their first 19 contests.|$|E
25|$|From 1991 to 2005, the Braves {{were one}} of the most {{successful}} teams in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions), and producing the greatest pitching rotation in the history of baseball. The Braves won the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010. The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 17 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 Los Angeles Dodgers {{season was}} the 124th for the {{franchise}} in Major League Baseball, and their 56th season in Los Angeles. The Dodgers {{dealt with a}} series of injuries to key players {{during the first half of}} the season and on June 21 were 31-42, 9 1/2 games back in last place in the <b>NL</b> <b>West.</b> Beginning with a 6-1 win over the San Diego Padres on June 22, the return of the injured players, and the emergence of rookie Yasiel Puig, they went 46-10 through August 23 as the rest of the division collapsed. On September 19, they clinched the Western Division title. This was the earliest the Dodgers had ever clinched a title and the largest deficit they had ever overcome to win the division. They opened the playoffs by defeating the Atlanta Braves in the Division Series and advanced to the NL Championship Series. In the NLCS, they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in six games.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 season {{marked the}} first year that Barry Bonds was {{not a member of}} the team since first signing with them in 1992 and the 50th season in San Francisco. The Giants signed former Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Aaron Rowand to a 5-year, $60 million contract. Barry Zito once again got off to a poor start, losing his first eight decisions. However, the team found hope in pitcher Tim Lincecum. After going 7–5 in his first stint in 2007 with the Giants, he {{exploded}} onto the scene this year winning four straight before losing his 1st game of the year on April 29, 2008, to the Colorado Rockies. Lincecum was selected to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium but was unable to pitch due to being hospitalized with flu-like symptoms. He went on to win the 2008 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 18–5. He was the first Giant to do so since Mike McCormick won it in 1967. The Giants finished the season in fourth place in the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> with a record of 72–90.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to San Diego {{for a series}} with the division-leading Padres. In the opener, Andre Ethier's two-run pinch hit single gave the Dodgers a 2–0 victory. The Dodgers offense continued to sputter the next day as they fell 6–1 to the Padres. In an effort to bolster the sagging offensive production, the Dodgers on July 28 acquired outfielder Scott Podsednik from the Kansas City Royals for two minor leaguers. However, the new addition went 0 for 3 in his debut and the Padres won a pitching duel 3–2 on a walk-off hit by Scott Hairston {{in the bottom of}} the ninth. The loss dropped the Dodgers seven games behind the Padres in the <b>NL</b> <b>West.</b> The Dodgers {{traveled to}} San Francisco for a series against the Giants. Despite a three-run rally in the ninth inning, the Dodgers lost the opener 6–5. In the second game, Chad Billingsley was again superb, pitching 6 scoreless innings, extending his scoreless innings streak to 21. However, the Dodger offense was again anemic and Jonathan Broxton suffered his fourth blown save of the season, allowing a two-run homer to Pat Burrell as the Dodgers lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{continued}} their winning streak {{when they returned}} home for a brief series with the Houston Astros. John Ely again pitched well in his fourth career start, allowing one run on five hits and striking out eight in seven innings as the Dodgers won 6–2. On May 18, the Dodgers placed Ethier on the 15-day disabled list, but {{continued their}} winning streak by beating the Astros 7–3 to pull to within one game of the division leading Padres. The streak was stopped at nine as the visiting Padres pounded the Dodgers 10–5 on May 19. Ortiz and Troncoso combined to allow five runs in the fourth inning. The Dodgers returned to the winning ways the following day with a 4–1 victory. Kershaw pitched 7 innings, allowing the one run, in his third straight terrific start. The Dodgers opened interleague play by welcoming the Detroit Tigers to Dodger Stadium on May 21. Billingsley turned in another solid start, allowing one run in seven innings and Dontrelle Willis was wild in the fourth inning as the Dodgers won 4–1 {{to move into a}} tie for first place in the <b>NL</b> <b>West.</b> John Ely won his third start of the season the following day, as Kemp and Blake both hit home runs and Jonathan Broxton picked up his tenth save of the season in the 6–4 victory. The Tigers avoided the sweep by beating the Dodgers 6–2 in the series finale, thanks to a two-run first inning homer by Miguel Cabrera.|$|E
500|$|As {{his turn}} in the {{rotation}} approached, Hershiser joked that he would skip a start and rest for the playoffs rather than pursue the record. The Dodgers had clinched the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> on September 26. [...] Thus, {{the focus of the}} game on the 28th was on Hershiser's need to get nine scoreless innings to tie Drysdale, which was Hershiser's hope. On September 27, Lasorda announced the Dodger starting pitchers for games one (Hershiser) and game two (Tudor) of the NL Championship series, which would begin the following Tuesday, October 4. The Dodgers entered the game with a 92–65 record and a seven-game lead in the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> over the Cincinnati Reds, while the San Diego Padres were 13 games back in fifth place in the division with a 79–78 record entering the game. With the September 28 loss, the Dodgers retained a seven-game lead over the Reds. In the off days leading up to Hershiser's last start, Frank Viola had tied Jackson and Hershiser at 23 wins for the MLB lead.|$|E
500|$|Among {{all major}} leaguers, Ramirez {{finished}} 2008 third in batting average, second in slugging percentage, {{and third in}} OPS. With Ramirez in the lineup, the Dodgers won the <b>NL</b> <b>West,</b> then swept the Chicago Cubs in the Division Series before losing in the NLCS to the eventual World Series winning Philadelphia Phillies in five games. During the playoffs, Ramirez hit an astounding [...]520 with 4 home runs, 2 doubles, 11 walks and 10 RBIs.|$|E
500|$|On September 21, Posey hit an eighth-inning {{home run}} against Andrew Cashner of the Chicago Cubs {{to win the}} game, 1-0. He hit another eighth-inning home run against Luke Gregerson of the San Diego Padres in {{the final game of}} the year on October 3 as Giants secured the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> Division {{championship}} by defeating the Padres 3-0. In 108 games, Posey batted [...]305 with 58 runs scored, 124 hits, 23 doubles, 18 home runs, and 67 RBI.|$|E
500|$|On August 21, 2010, Ross {{was awarded}} to the San Francisco Giants on a waiver claim, partly {{to prevent him from}} being {{acquired}} by the San Diego Padres. He appeared in 33 regular season games for the Giants, batting [...]288 with three home runs. In 153 games combined with Florida and San Francisco (525 at bats), he batted [...]269 with 141 hits, 28 doubles, 14 home runs, and 65 RBI. The Giants went on to overtake the Padres late in the season to win the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> Division title.|$|E
500|$|On May 6, 2005, Hoffman saved a 6–5 {{win over}} the St. Louis Cardinals as the Padres won two {{straight}} in St. Louis {{for the first time}} since 1977. It was Hoffman's 400th save, and he became the third pitcher in MLB history to reach the milestone, following John Franco (424) and Lee Smith (478). Hoffman was named both the NL Pitcher of the Month and Delivery Man of the Month in May after a perfect 12 for 12 in save opportunities while posting a 0.82ERA (1ER/11.0IP) in 12games as the Padres went 22–6 for their best month in franchise history. On August 24, Hoffman converted his 29th consecutive save opportunity in a 7–4 {{win over the}} Houston Astros. He passed Franco for second place on the all-time saves list with his 425th save, and the Padres maintained a six-game lead in the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> with a 63–63 record. The Padres won the <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> with an 82–80 record, and Hoffman finished the season 43 for 46 in save opportunities, [...] the second most saves in the NL. The Padres were swept 3–0 in the playoffs by the Cardinals, who had a majors-best 100–62 record in the regular season. Hoffman did not get into any save situations as the Padres never led through any of the 27 innings in the series.|$|E
