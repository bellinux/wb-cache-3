5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> disrepair.|$|E
5|$|The British commander, Captain George Martin, {{succeeded in}} chasing the Spanish vessels into the rocky Conil Bay, where they {{surrendered}} {{after a brief}} engagement in which the Spanish suffered significantly higher casualties than the British. One of the Spanish ships, the Santa Elena, was subsequently wrecked on the shore, while the other, the Ninfa, was captured and later recommissioned into the Royal Navy. The treasure carried on board the frigates, however, had been removed by a Spanish fishing boat before the battle and so did <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> British hands.|$|E

5|$|The only test {{in battle}} for Dunkerque {{came in the}} attack on Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July. The British Force H, {{commanded}} by Admiral Somerville and centered on HMS Hood and the battleships , and , arrived off Mers-el-Kébir to coerce the French battleship squadron to join the British cause or scuttle their ships. The French Navy refused, as complying with the demand would have violated the Armistice signed with Germany. To ensure the ships would <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> Axis hands, the British warships opened fire. Dunkerque was tied alongside the mole with her stern facing the sea, so she could not return fire.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission {{for it to}} be used over land. It proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp in 1944. The use of a version fired from howitzers against ground targets was authorized in response to the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that the Congo should <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because, after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the Congolese franc.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, she ferried Captain Cedric Holland, the {{emissary}} of Admiral James Somerville, commander of Force H, to meet with Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul, commander of the Vichy French forces at Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria. Holland was to deliver an ultimatum regarding the disposition of the French ships there {{to ensure that they}} could <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the Germans. Gensoul initially refused to meet with such a low-ranking envoy, but later relented and negotiations were underway that afternoon to disarm the French ships in place when the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered the talks terminated to forestall the impending arrival of French reinforcements. The British opened fire a half-hour later, including Foxhound. A month later the ship escorted Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August. Shortly afterwards, she escorted Hood back home and began a refit at Sheerness that lasted until October.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Wang Anshi's reforms {{outlined}} in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers, putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the hands of enemies), and aggressive military policy towards Song's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties. A few years after Song Dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan'an, Shaanxi province). During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song Dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia. The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor. However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory. The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as {{the forces of the}} arrogant officer were decimated; Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000. Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.|$|E
