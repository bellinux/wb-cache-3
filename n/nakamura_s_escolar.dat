In prior communications we described alterations in E-cadherin assembly in cultured cystic epithelial cells (Charron AJ, <b>Nakamura</b> <b>S,</b> Bacallao R, Wandinger-Ness A. J Cell Biol 149 : 111 – 124, 2000). Using the same cell line we assayed cadherin expression by RT-PCR using primer pairs that anneal to highly conserved sequences of cadherin genes but flank informative regions of cadherins. Using this approach we found that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cells express cadherin 8, a neuronal cadherin with limited expression in the kidney. Immunohistochemistry confirmed cadherin 8 expression in cystic epithelia. To test the functional significance of cadherin 8 expression in renal epithelial cells, we adapted a three-dimensional collagen culture method in which HK- 2 cells form tubule structures and microinjected adenovirus into the matrix space surrounding tubule structures. Adenovirus expressing cadherin 8 under the control of a tet promoter caused cyst structures to grow out of the tubules when coinjected with adenovirus expressing a tet transactivator. Microinjection of single adenovirus expressing either tet transactivator or cadherin 8 failed to cause cyst formation. When doxycycline was added to the culture, following coinjection of adenovirus, there was a dose-response reduction in cadherin 8 expression and cyst formation. Similarly, HK- 2 cells transfected with Flag-tagged cadherin 8 form cysts in addition to tubular structures. HK- 2 cells transfected with Flag-tagged N-cadherin do not form cysts. These data suggest that ectopic expression of cadherin 8 in renal epithelial cells is sufficient to cause the morphogenic pattern of cyst formation...|$|R

Maekawa, <b>S.</b> <b>Nakamura,</b> and <b>S.</b> Hattori, J. Biol. Chem. 268 : 22948 - 22952, 1993). On {{the basis of the}} partial amino acid sequence, we have obtained a cDNA which encodes the novel Ras GAP. The predicted protein consists of 847 amino acids whose calculated molecular mass, 96, 369 Da, is close to the apparent molecular mass of the novel Ras GAP, 100 kDa. The amino acid sequence shows a high degree of similarity to the entire sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster Gap 1 gene. When the catalytic domain of the novel GAP was compared with that of Drosophila Gap 1, p 120 GAP, and neurofibromin, the highest degree of similarity was again observed with Gap 1. Thus, we designated this gene Gap 1 m, a mammalian counterpart of the Drosophila Gap 1 gene. Expression of Gap 1 m was relatively high in brain, placenta, and kidney tissues, and it was expressed at low levels in other tissues. A recombinant protein consisting of glutathione-S-transferase and the GAP-related domain of Gap 1 m stimulated GTPase of normal Ras but not that of Ras having valine at the 12 th residue. Expression of the same region in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suppressed the ira 2 - phenotype. In addition to the GAP catalytic domain, Gap 1 m has two domains with sequence closely related to those of the phospholipid-binding domain of synaptotagmin and a region with similarity to the unique domain of Btk tyrosine kinase.

40|$|One of {{the major}} unsolved {{problems}} in polymer chemistry {{is represented by the}} synthesis of functionalized polyolefines, that are currently produced through radical processes, a technology that suffers from high energy consumption, low cost efficiency and poor control over the macromolecule structure. 1 The direct, controlled, homogeneously catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl monomers represents a sustainable technology to overcome these limits. The main catalytic systems reported in the literature are based on Pd(II) compounds with either -diimines or phosphino-sulfonate ligands. 2 Their productivity is thus far low from the values required for an industrial application, and better performing catalysts are strongly needed. With this aim we are studying Pd(II) complexes with new nonsymmetric -diimines (Ar,Ar'-BIAN) featured by an acenaphthene skeleton and one aryl ring substituted in meta positions with electron-withdrawing groups, while the other ring bears electron-releasing substituents on the ortho positions (Figure up). The related monocationic complexes, [Pd(CH 3) (Ar,Ar'-BIAN) (L) ][PF 6], that include both acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide derivatives, have been applied as precatalysts in the ethylene/methyl acrylate copolymerization under mild conditions of temperature and pressure showing a remarkably different catalytic behaviour depending {{on the nature of the}} L ligand (Figure below). 3 While the catalyst originated from the acetonitrile precursor was found to be less active than the dmso counterpart and to deactivate within 16 h of reaction, that obtained from the dmso derivative was still active after 48 h achieving a productivity of 350 g P/g Pd. The catalysts with the nonsymmetric Ar,Ar'-BIAN showed a productivity twice as high as that of the catalysts with the corresponding symmetric ligands together with a higher incorporation of the polar monomer into the catalytic product. The latter is a mixture of ethylene oligomers and ethylene/methyl acrylate cooligomers, having the polar monomer at the end of the branches. Detailed investigation on the studied catalytic system will be presented. 1 A. <b>Nakamura,</b> <b>S.</b> Ito and K. Nozaki, Chem. Rev., 2009, 109, 5215. 2 a) L. K. Johnson, S. Mecking and M.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating X-linked muscle disorder characterized by muscle wasting which is caused by mutations in the DMD gene. The DMD gene encodes the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin, and loss of dystrophin causes muscle degeneration and necrosis. Thus far, therapies for this disorder are unavailable. However, various therapeutic trials based on gene therapy, exon skipping, cell therapy, read through therapy, or pharmaceutical agents have been conducted extensively. In the development of therapy as well as elucidation of pathogenesis in DMD, appropriate animal models are needed.

Flash memory is a type of nonvolatile memory that can be erased and programmed by data called blocks. Flash memory is used to store system control codes in various applications. A recent representative example is Solid State Drive (SSD). A SSD is a type of computer storage that is composed of a number of flash memories. SSDs store data electronically unlike hard disk drives, which store data magnetically. The advantages of a solid-state drive are: no mechanical parts, less power and weight than hard disk drives. This thesis investigates existing technologies, markets, emerging technologies, and applications in the solid state memory market. It analyzes the current solid state memory industry structure using market data and frameworks. The emerging technologies and applications are researched in order to deliver technological innovations to the semiconductor memory market. It also studies and suggests how strategies of firms might influence technologies, value chains, and future evolutions using system dynamics models. The system dynamics models are based on a conventional commodity market model because of similarity between the semiconductor memory market and the commodity market.

One {{of the most}} impressive examples of such a process is transdifferentiation of pigmented epithelial cells (PECs) to lens cells during lens regeneration in newts. However, very little is known of the molecular events that allow newt cells to transdifferentiate. Histone B 4 is an oocyte-type linker histone that replaces the somatic-type linker histone H 1 during reprogramming mediated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). We found that B 4 is expressed and required during transdifferentiation of PECs. Knocking down of B 4 decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, which resulted in considerable smaller lens. Furthermore, B 4 knockdown altered gene expression of key genes of lens differentiation and nearly abolished expression of γ-crystallin. These data are the first to show expression of oocyte-type linker histone in somatic cells and its requirement in newt lens transdifferentiation and suggest that transdifferentiation in newts might share common strategies with reprogramming after SCNT. —Maki, N., Suetsugu-Maki, R., Sano, <b>S.,</b> <b>Nakamura,</b> K., Nishimura, O., Tarui, H., Del Rio-Tsonis, K., Ohsumi, K., Agata, K., Tsonis, P.

Although precast concrete technology is an offshoot of reinforced concrete technology, its structural nature and construction process is not the same: its identification {{with the concept of}} industrialization makes this technology quite different from cast-in-place concrete.

40|$|AbstractMutations in the ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter 1 (ABCA 1) gene {{have been}} recently {{identified as the}} molecular defect in Tangier disease (TD) and familial high density lipoprotein deficiency (FHA). We here report novel mutations in the ABCA 1 gene in two sisters from a Japanese family with TD who have been described previously (S. Ohtaki, H. Nakagawa, N. Kida, H. <b>Nakamura,</b> K. Tsuda, <b>S.</b> Yokoyama, T. Yamamura, S. Tajima, A. Yamamoto, Atherosclerosis 49 (1983)) and a family with FHA. Both probands of TD and FHA developed coronary heart disease. Sequence analysis of the ABCA 1 gene from the patients with TD revealed a homozygous G to A transition at nucleotide 3805 of the cDNA resulting in the substitution of Asp 1229 with Asn in exon 27, and a C to T at nucleotide 6181 resulting in the substitution of Arg 2021 with Trp in exon 47. Sequence analysis of the ABCA 1 gene from the FHA patient revealed a homozygous 4 bp CGCC deletion from nucleotide 3787 to 3790 resulting in premature termination by frameshift at codon 1224. These mutations were confirmed by restriction digestion analysis, and were not found in 141 control subjects. Our findings indicate that mutations in the ABCA 1 gene are associated with TD as well as FHA...|$|R

Hashimoto, <b>S.</b> Hattori, <b>S.</b> <b>Nakamura,</b> M. Shibuya, K. Matuoka, T. Takenawa, T. Kurata, K. Nagashima, and M. Matsuda, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 : 3443 - 3447, 1994). The substrate specificity of C 3 G was examined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. C 3 G markedly stimulated dissociation of bound GDP from Rap 1 B but marginally affected the same reaction of other Ras family proteins (Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and RalA). C 3 G also stimulated binding of GTP-gamma S [guanosine 5 '- 3 -O-(thio) triphosphate] to Rap 1 B. When C 3 G and Rap 1 A were expressed in COS 7 cells, marked accumulation of the active GTP-bound form of Rap 1 A was observed, while Sos was not effective in the activation of Rap 1 A. These results clearly show that C 3 G is an activator for Rap 1. Furthermore, expression of C 3 G with a membrane localization signal in a v-Ki-ras transformant, DT, induced a reversion of the cells to the flat form, possibly through the activation of endogenous Rap 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain, Pseudomonas sp. strain NK 87, {{that can}} use 6 -aminohexanoate-cyclic dimer {{as the sole}} source of carbon and nitrogen was newly isolated from wastewater of a factory which produces nylon- 6. Two responsible enzymes, 6 -aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase (P-EI) and 6 -aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase (P-EII), {{were found in the}} NK 87 strain, {{as is the case with}} Flavobacterium sp. strain KI 72, another 6 -aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer-metabolizing bacterium (H. Okada, S. Negoro, H. Kimura, and <b>S.</b> <b>Nakamura,</b> Nature [London] 306 : 203 - 206, 1983). The P-EI enzyme is immunologically identical to the 6 -aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase of KI 72 (F-EI). However, antiserum against the 6 -aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase purified from KI 72 (F-EII) did not react with cell extracts of NK 87, indicating that the F-EII and P-EII enzymes are immunologically different. Restriction endonuclease analyses show that the NK 87 strain harbors at least six plasmids ranging in size from 20 to 80 kilobase pairs (kbp). The P-EI and P-EII genes were cloned in Escherichia coli. Both the P-EI and F-EI probes strongly hybridized with a 23 -kbp plasmid in Southern hybridization analyses. The P-EII probe hybridized specifically with an 80 -kbp plasmid, but the F-EII probe hybridized with none of the plasmids harbored in NK 87. These results indicate that the P-EI gene and P-EII gene are encoded on the 23 -kbp and 80 -kbp plasmids, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Lithium (Li+) {{affects the}} {{physiology}} of cells {{from a broad}} range of organisms including plants and both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Although its effects result presumably from changes in gene expression elicited by its interaction with intracellular signal transduction pathways, the molecular mechanisms of Li+ action are not well understood. The biflagellate green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an ideal genetic model for the integration of the effects on Li+ on signal transduction, gene expression, and aspects of flagellar biogenesis. Li+ causes C. reinhardtii flagella to elongate to ∼ 1. 4 times their normal length and blocks flagellar motility (<b>S.</b> <b>Nakamura,</b> H. Tabino, and M. K. Kojima, Cell Struct. Funct. 12 : 369 - 374, 1987). We report here that Li+ treatment increases the abundance of several flagellar mRNAs, including α- and β-tubulin and pcf 3 - 21. Li+-induced flagellar gene expression occurs in cells pretreated with cycloheximide, suggesting that the abundance change is a response that does not require new protein synthesis. Deletion analysis of the flagellar α 1 -tubulin gene promoter showed that sequences necessary for Li+-induced expression differed from those for acid shock induction and contain a consensus binding site for CREB/ATF and AP- 1 transcription factors. These studies suggest potential promoter elements, candidate factors, and signal transduction pathways that may coordinate the C. reinhardtii cellular response to Li+...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP/abasic) {{sites were}} more frequent in regions of DNA replication in cells and whether their number increased during oxidative stress. DNA fiber spreading and fluorescent immunostaining {{were used to}} detect areas of DNA replication and sites of AP lesions in extended DNA fibers. The distribution of AP sites was determined in DNA fibers from vertebrate cells maintained under normal culture conditions or stressed with exogenous H 2 O 2. AP lesions per unit length were enumerated in bulk DNA or at replication sites. The background density of AP sites in DNA fibers was 5. 4 AP sites/ 106 nt, while newly replicated DNA contained 12. 9 AP sites/ 106 nt. In cells exposed to 20 μM H 2 O 2, AP sites in newly replicated DNA increased to 20. 8 / 106 nt. Determinations of AP site density in bulk DNA by fiber analysis or standard slot blot assays agreed to within 10 %. Our findings show that the fiber assay not only accurately determines the frequency of AP sites but also shows their distribution. They also reveal that there is increased susceptibility to oxidative damage in DNA regions undergoing replication, which may explain the previously observed clustering of AP sites. —Chastain II, P.

Tabata, Complete Genome Structure of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, a cyanobacterium that lacks thylakoids. DNA Research 10 (2003) 137 – 145]. Phycobilisomes of G. violaceus were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by N-terminal sequencing. Three rod-linker subunits (CpeC, CpeD and CpeE) were identified as predicted from the genome sequence. The cpcC 1 and cpcC 2 genes at order locus named (OLN) glr 0950 and gll 3219 encoding phycocyanin-associated linker proteins from G. violaceus are 56 and 55 amino acids longer at the N-terminus than the open reading frame proposed in the genome. The two amino acid extensions showed a 66 % identity to one another. Also, the N-terminal extensions of these sequences were similar to domains in both the rod-capping-linker protein CpcD 2 and to the C-terminus domain of the phycoerythrin-associated linker protein CpeC. These domains are not only unusual in their N-terminal location, but are unusual {{in that they are}} more closely related in sequence similarity to the C-terminus domain of the phycoerythrin-associated linker, CpeC of G. violaceus, than to the C-terminus domain of phycocyanin-associated linker CpcC in other cyanobacteria. These linker proteins with unique special domains are indicators of the unusual structure of the phycobilisomes of G. violaceus...|$|R
