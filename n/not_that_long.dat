2500|$|The {{section of}} Burnley Road {{that runs through}} Broadclough has become an {{accident}} blackspot, where speeding {{is seen as a}} problem on the road, with people into Broadclough from Weir often driving like they're still in open countryside according to local residents whilst Councillor Jimmy Eaton said: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago that a lady was killed not so far away from where this accident took place, and that wasn't the first.

60|$|The {{distinction}} between accent and quantity is clear, and was, no doubt, observed by the ancients in the recitation of verse. But I believe such recitation {{to have been}} always an artificial thing, and that the common conversation was entirely regulated by accent. I {{do not think it}} possible to talk any language without confounding the quantity of syllables with their high or low tones[1]; although you may sing or recitative the difference well enough. Why should the marks of accent have been considered exclusively necessary for teaching the pronunciation to the Asiatic or African Hellenist, if the knowledge of the acuted syllable did not also carry the stress of time with it? If [Greek: **anthropos] was to be pronounced in common conversation with a perceptible distinction of the length of the penultima {{as well as of the}} elevation of the antepenultima, why was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> quantity also marked? It was surely as important an ingredient in the pronunciation as the accent. And although the letter omega might in such a word show the quantity, yet what do you say to such words as [Greek: lelonchasi, tupsasa], and the like--the quantity of the penultima of which is not marked to the eye at all? Besides, can we altogether disregard the practice of the modern Greeks? Their confusion of accent and quantity in verse is of course a barbarism, though a very old one, as the versus politici of John Tzetzes [2] in the twelfth century and the Anacreontics prefixed to Proclus will show; but these very examples prove a fortiori what the common pronunciation in prose then was.|$|E

5000|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago an uptown T-shirt shop had a top selling {{shirt that}} read, [...] "Athens Ohio - {{it is not}} the end of the earth, But you can see it." [...] Athens was not an easy place to get to. Railroad came to the city in the 1850s, with the last {{passenger}} train ending in the early 1980s. That left a few freight trains passing near the city. The first 4-lane road into and out of the city came in the early 1970s. SR 32 from Athens to Cincinnati was completed in the early 80's. Four lanes from Athens to Belpre/Parkersburg was completed in the late 1990s on US-50, SR-32 & 7 hooking up with I-77. In the early 2000s, SR-33 'Super-2' highway was complete, linking Athens to I-77 at Ravenswood, WVa. In October 2013, the last section of the 4-lane highway was completed, bypassing Nelsonville's two lane road on SR-33, linking Athens with Columbus.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2008 {{an eight-year-old}} boy, Miguel Angel Lopez Rocha, died after {{he fell into}} the river. Rocha fell near the El Salto Falls, where <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago {{tourists}} came {{from all over the}} world to see the falls. He died nineteen days after he fell into the river. One autopsy indicated heavy metal poison was the reason for his death. This even brought attention to one of Mexico’s worst environmental disasters. “When Miguel died, an invisible problem became visible” said Maria Gonzalez from the Mexican Institute for Community Development. After the unfortunate incident many locals organized a group called “A Leap of Life”. According to Gonzalez and Hernandez “this made it possible to carry out the Second National Assembly Environmentally Affected by the end of May 2009 in El Salto” (713). Their goal is to join the national movement that brings together communities and organizational. “They are struggling to defend their resources, the right to health and to a healthy environment” (Gonzalez and Hernandez, page 713). Since Gonzalez and Hernandez’s article was published in 2009, they didn’t get to mention that the National Commission for Human Health tried to declare the area of El Salto an Emergency Zone. They failed because the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources refused, he feared it would hurt the economy. Also, in the past decade the National Water Commission has not reported a single fine for illegal discharge of chemical waste into the river. When something of this magnitude happens you expect your government to help or regulate the problem, but instead it is up to the locals to try and convince the government to spend their money to save the river.|$|E
