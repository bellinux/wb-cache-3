As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of <b>normorphine,</b> codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E

The [delta]-selective antagonist ICII 74, 864 (N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH) (where Aib is [alpha]-aminoisobutyric acid) blocked the modulation of morphine antinociception by DPDPE.

40|$|International audienceMorphine {{and several}} other opioids are {{important}} drugs {{for the treatment of}} acute and chronic pain. Opioid-induced analgesia is predominantly mediated by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). When administered to humans, complex metabolic pathways lead to generation of many metabolites, nine of which may be considered major metabolites. While the properties of the two main compounds, morphine- 6 -glucuronide and morphine- 3 -glucuronide, are well described, the activity of other morphine metabolites is largely unknown. Here we performed an extensive pharmacological characterization by comparing efficacies and potencies of morphine and its nine major metabolites for the two main signaling pathways engaged by the human MOR, which occur via G-protein activation and β-arrestins, respectively. We used radioligand binding studies and FRET-based methods to monitor MOR-mediated G-protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment in single intact 293 T cells. This approach identified two major groups of morphine metabolites, which we classified into "strong" and "weak" receptor ligands. Strong partial agonists morphine, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, <b>normorphine,</b> morphine- 6 -sulfate, 6 -acetylmorphine and 3 -acetylmorphine showed efficacies in the nanomolar range, while the weak metabolites morphine-N-oxide, morphine- 3 -sulfate, morphine- 3 -glucuronide and pseudomorphine activated MOR pathways only in the micromolar range. Interestingly, three metabolites, <b>normorphine,</b> 6 -acetylmorphine and morphine- 6 -glucuronide, had lower potencies for Gi-protein activation but higher potencies and efficacies for β-arrestin recruitment than morphine itself, suggesting that they are biased towards β-arrestin pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{actions of}} various opioids were {{examined}} on calcium action potentials {{in the cell}} somata of guinea pig myenteric neurones and on the release of acetylcholine at synapses onto these cells. The opioids morphine, <b>normorphine,</b> and [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met 5 (O) ]enkephalin-ol caused membrane hyperpolarizations resulting from an increase in potassium conductance; opioids that are more selective agonists for the kappa receptor subtype (dynorphin, tifluadom, U 50488 H) did not. Conversely, calcium action potentials were depressed or abolished by the kappa opioids but were not affected by morphine and [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met(O) 5]enkephalin-ol. Both groups of opioids caused presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus, depressing the amplitude of the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential. The presynaptic inhibition caused by [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met(O) 5]enkephalin-ol, morphine, and <b>normorphine,</b> but not that caused by the kappa opioids, was prevented by pretreatment with the selective mu site-directed irreversible antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. Furthermore, the presynaptic inhibitory action of morphine and [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met(O) 5]enkephalin-ol, but not that of the kappa-receptor agonists, was reversibly blocked by barium.

In the guinea-pig ileum, pretreatment with beta-FNA (3 X 10 (- 8) - 3 X 10 (- 6) M) produced a concentration-dependent antagonism of the inhibitory effect produced by the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Gly(ol) 5]enkephalin (DAGO).

Since beta-FNA does not block kappa-opioid receptor-mediated effects, it can be used in the guinea-pig ileum preparation as a selective mu-receptor inhibitor.

Performance characteristics of the FDA-cleared, qualitative, Cozart® RapiScan Opiate Oral Fluid Drug Testing System (Opiate Cozart® RapiScan System or Opiate CRS) were compared to the semi-quantitative Cozart® Microplate EIA Opiate Oral Fluid Kit (Opiate ELISA) and to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The following oral fluid opiate cutoffs were evaluated: the GC/MS limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2. 5 mg/l; 15 μg/l currently used for oral fluid testing in the United Kingdom (UK); 30 μg/l (Opiate CRS cutoff); and 40 μg/l, the proposed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) cutoff. Subjects provided informed consent {{to participate in this}} IRB-approved research and resided on the closed research ward throughout the study. Three oral codeine doses of 60 mg/ 70 kg were administered over a 7 -day period. After a 3 -week break, subjects received three doses of 120 mg/ 70 kg within 7 days. Oral fluid specimens (N= 1273) were analyzed for codeine (COD), norcodeine (NCOD), morphine (MOR) and <b>normorphine</b> (NMOR) by GC/MS with an LOQ of 2. 5 μg/l for all analytes.

Ethylketocyclazocine, dynorphin (1 - 13) and leucine enkephalin produced partial inhibition, their apparent intrinsic activities (alpha) being 0. 57, 0. 75 and 0. 66, respectively. Morphine and <b>normorphine,</b> which are agonists at mu-receptors, did not inhibit {{the response of}} the artery. Naloxone antagonized the actions of opioids and ethylketocyclazocine, and was more effective against methionine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin and [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5] enkephalin than against alpha-neoendorphin, ethylketocyclazocine and dynorphin (1 - 13). The pA 2 values of naloxone against so-called delta-agonists were approx. 8. 5, and against so-called kappa-agonists were approx. 7. 7. The supposed kappa-antagonist, Mr 2266, was more effective than naloxone in antagonizing the actions of alpha-neoendorphin, and the kappa-agonists dynorphin (1 - 13) and ethylketocyclazocine. The pA 2 values of Mr 2266 against kappa-agonists were 8. 5 - 9. 0, and against delta-agonists were 7. 8 or less. The opioid peptides and opioids tested did not cause dilatation of the artery previously contracted with histamine. These results suggest that the opioid peptides and ethylketocyclazocine acted on opioid receptors at adrenergic nerve terminals in the ear artery.

40|$|Treatment of the {{isolated}} mouse vas deferens with the enzyme arylsulfatase (E. C. 3. 1. 6. 1) {{had an effect}} on the ability of this tissue to response to various opiates. It increased the IC 50 values and slopes of their dose-response curve for enkephalins and their analogs, and shifted to the right the curves for FK 33824, levorphanol and <b>normorphine.</b> There was no effect on the action of etorphine, ß-endorphin or dynorphin. With morphine there was a biphasic effect, IC 50 values increasing at low enzyme concentrations and decreasing at high enzyme concentrations. A further comparison of arylsulfatase effects on morphine and on D-Ala- 2 -D-Leu 5 -enkephalin indicated that the morphine effect, unlike the D-Ala 2 -D-Leu 5 -enkephalin effect, could not be reversed by washing and that morphine, unlike D-Ala 2 -D-Leu 5 -enkephalin, became much less sensitive to naloxone antagonism. The observed modifications {{in the shape of the}} dose-response curves indicate that the effect of the opiates in the mouse vas deferens is more complex than that expected through the occupation of a simple receptor. There is either more than one type of functional receptor for each agonist or only one receptor, which can interact with every drug in different ways; this complexity is discussed in terms of various possibilities, including fractional occupancy, positive cooperativity and multiple sites.

40|$|The dose-related {{inhibition}} of the twitch {{responses of the}} myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparation of the guinea-pig small intestine by cannabinoid (CB) agonists, (+) -WIN 55212 and CP 55940 during stimulation at 0. 1 [*]Hz with supramaximal voltage was confirmed. These agonists inhibited acetylcholine (ACh) release {{in the presence of}} physostigmine (7. 7 [*]μM) thus indicating a prejunctional site of action. Inhibition of twitch responses and ACh release by CB agonists was reversed by the CB 1 -selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist, SR 141716 A. Dose-response curves to (+) -WIN 55212 and CP 55940 were shifted to the right, with no reduction of maximal response, by pretreatment with SR 141716 A (31. 6 – 1000 [*]nM), but not its vehicle, Tween 80 (1 [*]μM). However, at very high concentrations (25 – 400 [*]μM), Tween 80 itself caused a dose-related {{inhibition of}} the twitch response which was significantly reduced in the presence of SR 141716 A (1 [*]μM). The opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (1 [*]μM) had no significant effect on the inhibition by CP 55940 of the twitch response. (+) -WIN 55212, CP 55940 and Tween 80 (50 [*]μM) had no effect on responses to exogenous ACh, confirming that their actions were prejunctional. SR 141716 A (1 [*]μM) did not increase the sensitivity of the longitudinal muscle to either ACh or histamine, but inhibited the responses to high doses of ACh. The (−) -enantiomer of WIN 55212, was approximately 300 times less active than the (+) enantiomer in inhibiting the twitch response, had no CB 1 antagonist activity against the active isomer and did not inhibit the release of ACh in the presence of physostigmine. The dissociation constant (KD) values for SR 141716 A against the inhibitory effect of (+) -WIN 55212 and CP 55940 on the twitch response were 12. 07 [*]nM (95 % confidence intervals 8. 55 and 20. 83) and 6. 44 [*]nM (95 % confidence intervals 4. 70 and 10. 24), respectively. In experiments in which the release of ACh was inhibited by (+) -WIN 55212, the KD values were 9. 21 [*]nM and 10. 53 [*]nM at SR 141716 A concentrations of 31. 6 [*]nM and 100 [*]nM, respectively. The KD values for the antagonism by naloxone of the inhibition of the twitch responses and the inhibition of ACh release by <b>normorphine</b> in this preparation were found to be 2. 38 ± 0. 69 [*]nM and 2. 00 ± 0. 9 [*]nM, respectively. During maximal inhibition of ACh release by (+) -WIN 55212, the addition of <b>normorphine</b> (400 [*]nM) caused a further significant decrease in ACh output. SR 141716 A alone produced a significant increase in ACh release in both the absence and presence of exogenous cannabinoid drugs, hence we conclude that it has a presynaptic site of action. We also conclude that SR 141716 A acts either by antagonizing the effect of an endogenous CB 1 receptor agonist or by having an inverse agonist effect at these receptors...|$|E
40|$|Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) (1 [*]μM) {{significantly}} attenuated {{the ability}} of WIN 55, 212 - 2, CP 55, 940, (−) -Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), nabilone and (R) -(+) -arachidonoyl- 1 ′-hydroxy- 2 ′-propylamide (methanandamide) to inhibit electrically-evoked isometric contractions of the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparation of guinea-pig small intestine. The sizes of the maximal responses to WIN 55, 212 - 2 and CP 55, 940 decreased significantly {{in the presence of}} 1 [*]μM MAFP. MAFP (1 [*]μM) essentially abolished the inhibitory effects on the twitch response of the highest concentration of methanandamide used (3. 162 [*]μM). The dextral shift it induced in the log concentration-response curve of nabilone was non-parallel. In contrast, the dextral shift in the log concentration-response curve of THC produced by MAFP did not deviate significantly from parallelism and was relatively small with a mean value of 3. 45 and 95 % confidence limits of 1. 19 and 13. 08. MAFP (1 [*]μM) did not attenuate the effects of <b>normorphine</b> or clonidine on the twitch response of the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparation or affect the contractile response of this preparation to acetylcholine. When administered by itself at concentrations of 1 to 1000 [*]nM, MAFP had no detectable effect on the twitch response of the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparation. These results support the hypothesis that MAFP is an irreversible cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist that possesses some degree of selectivity...|$|E
40|$|Electrical field {{stimulation}} of the mouse vas deferens (TO and C 57 /BL strains) caused the release of noradrenaline into the bathing medium. 2 Phenoxybenzamine (30 muM) or phentolamine (36 muM) plus cocaine (13 muM) caused a considerable increase in the noradrenaline output. 3 In the vasa deferentia from TO mice the output per pulse of noradrenaline was constant at frequencies of stimulation from 0. 5 to 15 Hz whereas in the vasa deferentia from C 57 /BL mice the output per pulse of noradrenaline increased two-fold from 1. 5 to 15 Hz. 4 Morphine (2 muM) inhibited the contractions of the vasa deferentia from TO mice. This effect was greater at low (0. 1 - 1 Hz) than at high (10 Hz) frequencies of stimulation. Morphine (2 muM) did not inhibit {{the response of the}} tissue to exogenous noradrenaline. 5 Morphine (1 muM) reduced the noradrenaline output from the vasa deferentia of TO mice stimulated at 1. 5 Hz but did not reduce the noradrenaline output at 15 Hz. At 1. 5 Hz the reduction of noradrenaline output was reversed by naloxone (0. 05 muM). 6 Morphine (5 muM) did not inhibit the uptake of [3 H]-noradrenaline into the vasa deferentia from TO mice. 7 Only in high concentrations (ID 50 30. 88 muM) did morphine inhibit the contractions of the vasa deferentia from C 57 /BL mice. 8 <b>Normorphine</b> (100 muM) did not reduce the noradrenaline output from vasa deferentia of C 57 /BL mice...|$|E
30|$|Hydromorphone and {{oxymorphone}} {{were detected}} in patients I, III, and IV who were prescribed medications containing morphine and/or oxycodone. Evidence for morphine metabolism to hydromorphone in pain patients chronically treated with morphine has extensively been confirmed (Cone et al. 2006; Hughes et al. 2012). Likewise, the metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone in pain patients {{has also been}} demonstrated (Yee et al. 2012). However, the occurrence of this transformation in stored urine samples has not been previously demonstrated. After ingestion, morphine is metabolized in the liver into morphine- 3 -glucuronide and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (Kilpatrick and Smith 2005). It may also be metabolized into <b>normorphine,</b> codeine, and hydromorphone, but the metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state, {{and the use of}} other medications. In humans, oxycodone is primarily metabolized in the liver to α and β oxycodol and oxymorphone (Moore et al. 2003). Some patients are fast metabolizers of oxycodone, resulting in reduced analgesic effect but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolizers resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia (Gasche et al. 2004). The concentrations of the metabolites hydromorphone and oxymorphone in urine samples after 30  days of storage were very high compared to the initial concentration at day 1 and independently to patients. This trend once more supports the evidence that parent compounds may be converted into corresponding metabolites in urine samples stored at 4 °C. The metabolite concentration levels depend on the concentration of the parent compounds. These two metabolites can still be analyzed in patient urine samples stored at 4 °C for 30  days, when patients have been prescribed medications containing the main compounds.|$|E
40|$|Oral fluid {{specimens}} (N = 1406) {{were collected}} from 19 subjects prior to and up to 72 h following controlled administration of oral codeine. Volunteers provided informed consent {{to participate in this}} National Institute on Drug Abuse Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. A modification of Cozart Microplate Opiate EIA Oral Fluid Kit (Opiate ELISA), employing codeine calibrators, was used for semiquantitative analysis of opiates, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the confirmation and quantitation of codeine, norcodeine, morphine, and <b>normorphine</b> in oral fluid. GC-MS limits of detection and quantitation were 2. 5 microg/L for all analytes. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has proposed a 40 -microg/L opiate screening and a 40 -microg/L morphine or codeine confirmation cutoff for the detection of opiate use. Oral fluid opiate screening and confirmation cutoffs of 30 micro g/L are in use in the U. K. Utilizing 2. 5 -, 20 -, 30 -, and 40 -microg/L GC-MS cutoffs, 26 %, 20 %, 19 %, and 18 % of the oral fluid specimens were positive for codeine or one of its metabolites. Six Opiate ELISA/confirmation cutoff criteria (2. 5 / 2. 5, 10 / 2. 5, 20 / 20, 30 / 20, 30 / 30, and 40 / 40 microg/L) were evaluated. Calculations for Opiate ELISA sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency were determined from the number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative results at each screening/confirmation cutoff. Sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency for the lowest cutoff were 91. 5 %, 88. 6 %, and 89. 3 %. Application of the cutoff currently used in the U. K. yielded sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency results of 79. 7 %, 99. 0 %, and 95. 4 % and similar results of 76. 7 %, 99. 1 %, and 95. 1 % when applying the SAMHSA criteria. These data indicate that the Opiate ELISA efficiently detects oral codeine use. In addition, the data, collected following controlled oral codeine administration, may aid in the interpretation of opiate oral fluid test results and in the selection of appropriate oral fluid screening and confirmation cutoffs...|$|E
40|$|Excitatory {{junction}} potentials (e. j. p. s) {{evoked by}} nerve stimulation were recorded from muscle {{cells of the}} rabbit isolated mesenteric artery. At 0. 03 Hz the e. j. p. amplitudes were stable. When a train of fifteen pulses was applied at 0. 25 Hz or at higher frequencies (0. 5, 1 and 2 Hz), e. j. p. s showed an initial facilitation followed by depression. [Met 5]enkephalin 0. 1 and 1 mumol/l, [D-Ala 2,D-Leu 5]enkephalin 0. 1 and 1, but not 0. 01 mumol/l, and [D-Pen 2, L-Pen 5]enkephalin 3 mumol/l all depressed the e. j. p. s evoked by trains of fifteen pulses at 1 Hz. When more than one concentration was used ([Met 5]enkephalin, [D-Ala 2,D-Leu 5]enkephalin), the inhibition was concentration dependent. It was always greater {{for the first few}} e. j. p. s than for the later ones in a train. [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l reduced the first e. j. p. at 1 Hz and the e. j. p. s evoked by 0. 03 Hz to a similar extent. The inhibitory effect of [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l on e. j. p. s persisted in the presence of yohimbine 0. 3 mumol/l. Naloxone 1 mumol/l did not interfere with the effect of [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l. Naloxone 10 mumol/l depressed some e. j. p. s and prevented the inhibition by [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l. Neither ICI 154129 10 mumol/l nor ICI 174864 0. 3 mumol/l had any effect of their own and both compounds antagonized the action of [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l. <b>Normorphine</b> 10 mumol/l, fentanyl 1 mumol/l, ethylketocyclazocine 0. 1 mumol/l, and dynorphin A(1 - 13) 1 mumol/l were all ineffective. Ethylketocyclazocine 1 mumol/l did not change the e. j. p. s either, but antagonized [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l. [Met 5]enkephalin 1 mumol/l failed to influence both the resting membrane potential of the muscle cells and the depolarizing effect of noradrenaline 3 and 30 mumol/l. We suggest that the axon terminals of post-ganglionic sympathetic neurones in the rabbit mesenteric artery possess opioid delta-, but not mu- or kappa-receptors. The activation of presynaptic delta-receptors inhibits the release of the neuroeffector transmitter.
