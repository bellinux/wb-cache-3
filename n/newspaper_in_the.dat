5|$|A countywide {{chapter of}} the Labour Party was {{established}} in Hedmark in mid-November 1904. After the countywide party convention in Stange in 1906, the convention summary had to be printed in the Kristiania-based newspaper Social-Demokraten, as it lacked its own local newspaper.

There was a growing notion that the party needed its own <b>newspaper.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year, the labour movement in Solør (south of Hedmark) bought the paper Solungen, which had existed since 1904. The takeover came into effect on 1 January 1907, and publishing began the following year. Solungen pretended to be the labour movement organ {{for the whole of}} Hedmark, and outside of Solør it was published as Hedemarkens Amts Socialdemokrat (Solungen).
