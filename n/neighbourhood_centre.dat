40|$|<b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> {{are places}} of {{interactions}} for {{residents of a}} neighbourhood. The diversity of uses and building functions may affect the pattern of interactions occurring in <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres.</b> In spite {{of the advantages of}} mixed land use developments, which have been repeatedly mentioned in the planning literature, few studies have investigated the effect of diversity of uses on the patterns of activity and vitality in <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres.</b> This paper utilises a qualitative approach to the study of land uses in suburban <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> in Geelong, Australia. The primary methodology used in this research is recording and mapping users&# 039; activities through behavioural observation. This study aims to evaluate the complexities of the pattern of activities occurring in <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> in regard to building functions and uses. The method of inquiry in this research investigates how the arrangements and diversity of uses in <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> can promote, affect or mitigate the social life of neighbourhoods, generate a sociable atmosphere, attract a diversity of users and create a nightlife. A better understanding of how neighbourhood environments influence the social life of neighbourhoods can provide academics and professionals in planning and urban design with sound evidence on which to base future research and design...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} set of design criteria to direct the enhancement of residential proximity, retail convenience and urban amenity within <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres.</b> <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> {{are an important part}} of a city's infrastructure. They can provide service amenities for local residents, foster social interaction, create economic platforms for smaller businesses, provide nearby places of work and contribute to the local identity of their surrounding <b>neighbourhoods.</b> <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> create layers of intensity within our suburban fabric. Traditionally, <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> served their local market catchment. Today, by contrast, there are many retail alternatives easily accessible to our mobile society. In New Zealand, these centres are often located in low density suburbs; if they are to maintain a level of patronage, they must compete to hold their local customers. In this study, three aspects of the retail experience – proximity, convenience and urban amenity – were identified as fundamental considerations in the selection of a retail environment. A literature survey was carried out to create an initial set of design criteria which outline the key priorities for these three research themes. Comparative analysis of three <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> in Christchurch, and detailed analysis of one of these centres, informed a number of subsequent refinements to these criteria, making them more specific to the residential, retail convenience and urban characteristics of these centres. The Christchurch centre of Woolston was chosen as the site for a design case study, where the amended set of criteria directed the design of both a master plan and an individual building. Finally, the design outcomes were used to formulate a number of strategies which can be used to retrofit other centres, responding to their existing built fabric and suburban structure. These strategies include parking lanes, central orientation spaces, anchor structures, secondary streets and retail zones. These strategies ensure that <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> can provide both residential proximity and retail convenience in such a way that enhances their urban amenity. Ultimately, this research provides strategies to develop <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> as distinct, convenient and enjoyable places to work, live and visit...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper examines {{the potential of}} <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> to generate and enhance social capital through their programs, activities, membership associations and community engagement. Social capital is a complex concept involving elements of norms, networks, and trust and is generally seen as enhancing community cohesion {{and the ability to}} attain common goals (outlined in more detail in Section 3). The aim of this research project is to describe the nature of social capital formation in terms of development and change in norms, networks and trust {{within the context of the}} operations of <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> in three Queensland locations (i. e., Sherwood, Kingston/Slacks Creek, and Maleny). The study was prompted by surprisingly little research into how <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> and their clients contribute to the development of social capital. Considering the large volume of research on the role of community organisations in building social capital, it is remarkable that perhaps the most obvious organisation with 'social capitalist' intentions has received so little attention (apart from Bullen and Onyx, 2005). Indeed, ostensibly, <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centres</b> are all about social capital...|$|R

25|$|Dunfermline is the {{principal}} shopping centre serving the western area of Fife and is the region's second largest town centre by floorspace. Retailing accounts for 18% {{of the total number}} of jobs in the town. A BID (Business Improvement District) scheme for the city centre has been in operation since 2009. The majority of shops and retail services in Dunfermline are concentrated in the town centre along a high street. The Kingsgate Shopping Centre is located on the pedestrianised section of the High Street giving Dunfermline a mix of modern and traditional shops. A major extension of the Kingsgate Shopping Centre was completed in 2008 improving and expanding the retail offer in the town by attracting a major department store brand and range of other smaller retailers. Other retail areas in Dunfermline exist at Carnegie Drive Retail Park to the north of the town centre and Halbeath Retail Park to the east of the town. A large <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>centre</b> with one of the towns major supermarkets was also built as part of the eastern expansion area of Dunfermline. The Fife Leisure Park, constructed in 1999 is adjacent to the M90 at Halbeath on the eastern outskirks of Dunfermline. The leisure park has a large cinema, a health club, bowling alley and a number of restaurants.|$|E
