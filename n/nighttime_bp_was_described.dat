40|$|Numerous studies {{addressed}} the predictive {{value of the}} <b>nighttime</b> blood pressure (<b>BP)</b> as captured by ambulatory monitoring. However, arbitrary cutoff limits in dichotomized analyses of continuous variables, data dredging across selected subgroups, extrapolation of cross-sectional studies to prospective outcomes, and lack of comprehensive adjustments for confounders make interpretation of the literature difficult. We reviewed prospective studies with total mortality or a composite cardiovascular end point as an outcome {{in relation to the}} level and the circadian profile of systolic BP. We analyzed studies in hypertensive patients (n= 23 856) separately from those in individuals randomly recruited from populations (n= 9641). We pooled summary statistics and individual subject data, respectively. In both patients and populations, in analyses in which <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> <b>was</b> additionally adjusted for daytime BP and vice versa, <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> <b>was</b> a stronger predictor than daytime BP. With adjustment for the 24 -hour BP, both the night-to-day BP ratio and dipping status remained significant predictors of outcome but added little prognostic value over and beyond the 24 -hour BP level. In the absence of conclusive evidence proving that nondipping is a reversible risk factor, the option whether or not to restore the diurnal blood pressure profile to a normal pattern should be left to the clinical judgment of doctors and should be individualized for each patient. Current guidelines on the interpretation of ambulatory BP recording need to be updated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{prognostic}} significance of nighttime and daytime blood pressure (BP), their ratio and the nighttime dipping pattern for mortality and recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events {{in patients with}} CV disease at baseline. Background The prognostic value of ambulatory <b>BP</b> has not <b>been</b> reported in hypertensive patients {{with a history of}} CV disease. Methods We performed a meta-analysis on individual data of 302 patients with hypertension and CV disease from three prospective studies performed in Europe. Results Age of the patients averaged 69 +/- 9 years; 50 % were men and 62 % were under anti hypertensive treatment at the time of ambulatory BP monitoring. Office, daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> averaged 161 +/- 20 / 86 12, 144 +/- 16 / 83 +/- 11 and 132 +/- 18 / 72 12 mmHg. Total follow-up time amounted to 2049 patient - years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP,</b> but not daytime BP significantly predicted CV mortality (P <= 0. 05) and major CV events (P <= 0. 01) after adjustment for office BP and other confounders. When both <b>nighttime</b> and daytime <b>BP</b> <b>were</b> entered into the models, the predictive power of <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> remained significant (P <= 0. 05); daytime BP did not add prognostic precision to <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP.</b> The systolic nightday BP ratio predicted all outcomes, and outcome was significantly worse in reverse dippers and nondippers than in dippers, both before and after adjustment for 24 -h BP (P <= 0. 05).

A total of 130 subjects (mean age 46 years) not taking cardiac drugs were studied by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography and ambulatory BP recording. Subjects (excluding those with coronary artery or valvular heart disease, heart failure, or diabetes) were classified into two groups: 25 normotensives and 105 hypertensives (history of antihypertensive treatment and office diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg). The two groups were comparable in terms of sex, age, and heart rate, whereas body mass index, (P <. 01), office BP, average 24 -h BP, and average daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> (all P <. 00001) were higher in hypertensives. Hypertensives also had increased left atrial dimension, left atrial dimension/aortic root ratio (both P <. 001), and left ventricular mass (LV) indexed for height (P <. 0001). Positive correlations of left atrial dimension were found with office BP, average 24 -h, average daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BP, LV mass index, and Doppler-derived E/A ratio. In a multivariate model that included potentially confounding factors, only body mass index (standardized beta coefficient = 0. 41, P <. 00001), average <b>nighttime</b> diastolic <b>BP</b> (beta = 0. 33, P <. 00001), and male sex (beta = 0. 18, P <. 01) were independent predictors of left atrial size in the pooled population.

During a course of 11. 2 years (median), 1245 participants died, 472 of cardiovascular causes. The number of fatal combined with nonfatal events was 1080, 525, and 458 for cardiovascular and cardiac events and for stroke, respectively.

40|$|Blood {{pressure}} (BP) {{in healthy}} individuals exhibits a diurnal variation, with a nighttime dip of 10 %- 20 %. A persistently high <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> <b>is</b> {{associated with increased}} cardiovascular morbidity. The effects of diurnal BP variations on the neurologic deficit in acute stroke at presentation {{and in the first}} few weeks poststroke are unclear. We hypothesized that persistently elevated BP results in poor outcome. Patients with an acute ischemic stroke presenting within 48 hours of onset underwent 24 -hour ambulatory monitoring of systolic, diastolic, and mean <b>BP.</b> There <b>were</b> a total of 35 patients (16 males; mean age, 74 ± 14 years). The percentage change between mean day and night BP classified patients into dippers (> 10 % change), nondippers (0 - 10 % change), or reverse-dippers (< 0 % change). The Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were assessed on admission, at week 1, and at week 3. The relationship between neurologic score and dipping classification was analyzed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance, with age and baseline score as covariates. Based on both the SSS and NIHSS, the reverse-dippers had the lowest neurologic scores at baseline, week 1, and week 3, followed by the nondippers. The dippers performed the best in comparison. No significant differences in demographics and/or other BP characteristics among the groups that could account for these differences in outcome were noted.

To synthesize the current literature on ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in HIV+ individuals, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed. Medical databases were searched through November 11, 2015 for studies that reported ABPM results in HIV+ individuals. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers and pooled differences between HIV+ and HIV-negative (HIV-) individuals in clinic BP and ABPM measures were calculated using random-effects inverse variance weighted models. Of 597 abstracts reviewed, 8 studies with HIV+ cohorts met the inclusion criteria. The 420 HIV+ and 714 HIV- individuals in 7 studies with HIV- comparison groups were pooled for analyses. The pooled absolute nocturnal systolic and diastolic <b>BP</b> declines <b>were</b> 3. 16 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 13 %, 5. 20 %) and 2. 92 % (95 % CI: 1. 64 %, 4. 19 %) less, respectively, in HIV+ versus HIV- individuals.

40|$|This {{population}} {{study included}} 399 subjects, of whom 370 (93 %) {{showed a significant}} diurnal blood pressure (BP) rhythm. The nocturnal <b>BP</b> fall <b>was</b> normally distributed and averaged 16 +/- 9 mm Hg systolic and 14 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic (mean +/- SD). The amplitude of the diurnal BP curve followed a positively skewed distribution, {{with a mean of}} 16 +/- 5 mm Hg for systolic BP and 14 +/- 4 mm Hg for diastolic BP. The daily BP maximum occurred at 15 : 54 +/- 4 : 47 for systolic BP and at 15 : 11 +/- 4 : 20 for diastolic <b>BP.</b> Thirty-four subjects <b>were</b> reexamined after a median interval of 350 days.

40|$|Ambulatory BP studies {{indicate}} that even small increases in <b>BP,</b> particularly <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> levels, <b>are</b> associated with significant increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Likewise, sleep disruption attributable to restless legs syndrome increases the likelihood of having hypertension. Observational studies demonstrate a strong correlation between the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the risk and severity of hypertension, whereas prospective studies of patients with OSA demonstrate a positive relationship between OSA and risk of incident hypertension. Intervention trials with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) indicate a modest, but inconsistent effect on BP in patients with severe OSA and a greater likelihood of benefit in patients with most CPAP adherence. Additional prospective studies are needed to reconcile observational studies suggesting that OSA is a strong risk factor for hypertension with the modest antihypertensive effects of CPAP observed in intervention studies...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{whether the}} 24 h blood pressure (BP) pattern per se {{might affect the}} left ventricular structure independently of the pressure level. One hundred subjects with abnormally high office BP readings who had never received any antihypertensive treatment were submitted to 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring and left ventricular echocardiographic assessment. They were classified into two groups, as follows: dippers (group l), consisting of 46 subjects whose mean <b>nighttime</b> systolic <b>BP</b> <b>was</b> reduced by at least 10 % {{in comparison to the}} corresponding daytime value, and nondippers (group 21, consisting of 34 subjects whose <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> did not drop or was reduced by < 10 %. Left ventricular mass and end-diastolic volume values, both normalized for body surface area, were significantly higher in nondippers (r = 3. 12, P <. 003, and r = 7. 46, P <. OOl, respectively). The two groups did not differ in diastolic thickness of either intraventricular septum or left ventricular posterior wall (both values normalized for body surface area), in mean 24 h systolic or diastolic or average blood pressure, or in age. In conclusion, i-t untreated essential hypertension diagnosed on the basis of abnormal office BP readings, the higher incidence of left ventricular mass increase in subjects unable to reduce their blood pressure during the night was more due to left ventricular dilatation than to myocardial wall thickening. The effect nf the 24 h BP profile on left ventricular vnlume appears to be independent of both the BP level and age. 0 1997 American Journal o...|$|R

MethodsRepeated interdialytic ABP monitoring was performed for up to one year in 28 chronic hemodialysis patients with cardiac disease who were randomized to achieve and maintain normal hct levels (42 ± 3 %, group A) or anemic hct levels (30 ± 3 %, group B) with epoetin. Routine BP measurements obtained at dialysis treatments were also evaluated. ResultsMean hct levels were 30. 7 ± 0. 7 % in group A and 30. 6 ± 0. 7 % in group B at baseline, then 39. 3 ± 1. 2 % (group A) and 33. 5 ± 0. 6 % (group B) at four months, and 42. 0 ± 1. 1 % (group A) and 30. 4 ± 1. 0 % (group B) at 12 months. Baseline ABP and routine dialysis unit <b>BP</b> levels <b>were</b> not different between the groups. At 2, 4, 8, and 12 months of follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences in any BP parameters between groups or increases in any BP parameters in either group A or group B patients compared with baseline. At 12 months, the mean <b>nighttime</b> diastolic <b>BP</b> (DBP) in group A patients was slightly but significantly lower than the mean daytime DBP (daytime DBP 76. 6 ± 1. 9 mm Hg vs. nighttime DBP 72. 9 ± 2. 1 mm Hg, P < 0. 05).

40|$|The main aim {{of cardiac}} {{screening}} in athletes {{is to reduce}} the prevalence of sudden cardiac death. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a diagnostic tool to detect athletes at increased risk, but “abnormal” ECG findings related to training are common in athletes, and a challenge to distinguish from pathological ECG findings. Blood pressure (<b>BP)</b> <b>is</b> recorded during screening examinations, and high BP accounts for the highest prevalence of abnormal findings. This has neither been emphasized as an isolated finding, nor in association to other cardiovascular risk factors. In 2008, 595 professional soccer players in Norway underwent cardiac screening. By applying the new Seattle criteria for abnormality, the prevalence of abnormal ECGs was reduced to 11 %. Abnormal ECG findings were more common after computer-based vs visual measurements both according to the ESC recommendations (51 % vs 29 %), and the Seattle criteria (22 % vs 11 %). Every fourth player had high normal <b>BP,</b> and there <b>was</b> a significant association between increasing BP, and subclinical organ damages. High daytime ambulatory <b>BP</b> <b>was</b> estimated in every third player and high <b>nighttime</b> ambulatory <b>BP</b> in every second player. Echocardiography alone did not detect important abnormality. All players, except two with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, got medical clearance. The Seattle criteria for interpreting ECG in athletes reduced the need for follow-up investigations, and based on echocardiographic evaluations this reduction increased the specificity of the Seattle criteria, without increasing the number of false negative ECGs. We experienced several difficulties when trying to decide the prevalence of abnormal ECGs in athletes, and revealed a need for new definitions of “standard” methodology. The novel findings of masked hypertension and high <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> <b>are</b> surprising, and the associations between BP and hypertensive subclinical organ damages emphasize the need for closer focus on BP measurements.

Furthermore, an upstream element, collagen element I (- 370 /- 344), which shares homology with the LAP binding cis-element of the albumin promoter (9 of 13 <b>bp)</b> <b>is</b> <b>described.</b> This collagen element I stimulates transcription in both orientations and when placed in front of either a homologous or a heterologous chimeric report construct. These experiments suggest that LAP may be important in the expression of collagen in differentiated hepatocytes through both the promoter and a newly described upstream element...|$|R

40|$|Micromagnetic {{studies of}} the {{reversal}} of stripe domains in elements of different geometries are reported. Various 2 D and 3 D codes are used {{in order to allow}} comparison between an infinite slab, nanowires and dots. Starting from a saturated state the establishment of stripe domains through the sample is first studied. Contrary to the thin film case, the nucleation of this pattern is not uniform and is very different to the geometry of a wire or an isolated dot. Special attention is paid to the reversal of the core of the vortex (the remnants of inner walls between up and down domains) which requires the insertion of point singularities called Bloch points (BP) either at surfaces or created in a pair depending on the length allowed for the stripe in the corresponding element. The magnetization distribution around the core of the various <b>BP</b> <b>is</b> <b>described</b> in detail as well as the key characteristics of their motion. Finally, some experiments are suggested predicting the behaviour of stripe domains under an applied field. Copyright EDP Sciences/Società Italiana di Fisica/Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES : <b>Nighttime</b> blood {{pressure}} (<b>BP)</b> has <b>been</b> {{shown to be}} superior to daytime BP in predicting hypertension related target organ damage and cardiac mortality. In our Georgia Cardiovascular Twin Study, we showed that apart from the genes that also influence daytime BP, specific genetic determinants explained 44 % and 67 % of the <b>nighttime</b> systolic <b>BP</b> (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) heritabilities, respectively. Here, we determined whether these results could be confirmed in a much larger twin cohort of young adults with 24 -hour ambulatory BP measurements. METHODS : Ambulatory <b>BP</b> <b>was</b> available in 703 white twins (308 pairs and 87 singletons, aged 18 - 34 years, 50 % males) from the Prenatal Programming Twin Study. A bivariate quantitative genetic twin model was used to analyze daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP.</b> We conducted a meta-analysis to compare and integrate results from the 2 twin cohorts. RESULTS : Model fitting showed no sex differences {{for any of the}} measures. Heritabilities were 0. 60 and 0. 51 for SBP and 0. 54 and 0. 46 for DBP at daytime and nighttime. The specific heritability due to novel genetic effects emerging during the nighttime was 0. 21 for SBP and 0. 26 for DBP, which comprised 41 % and 57 % of the total nighttime heritability for SBP and DBP, respectively. Meta-analysis confirmed absence of cohort differences with very similar combined results. CONCLUSIONS : In addition to genes that influence both daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP,</b> {{a large part of the}} heritability is explained by genes that specifically influence BP at night...|$|R

40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} 24 h ambulatory {{blood pressure}} (BP) monitoring (ABPM) study by de la Sierra et al. reported 37. 5 % incidence of isolated-office (“white-coat“) resistant hypertension (RH), defined as clinic BP ≥ 140 / 90 mmHg plus 24 h BP mean 3 medications/daily is true RH, regardless of BP values; accordingly, inclusion of RH patients treated with ≥ 4 medications would decrease {{the prevalence of}} white-coat RH to 24. 6 %; (ii) RH is characterized by high prevalence of nocturnal hypertension and abnormal non-dipper BP pattern; current guidelines designate separate diagnostic thresholds for daytime and nighttime ABPM means; mean <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> ≥ 120 / 70 mmHg should be considered hypertensive, regardless of mean daytime or clinic BP. The investigator-promoted, government-funded Hygia Project, designed to prospectively evaluate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in primary care centers of Northwest Spain using highly reproducible 48 h ABPM, substantiates elevated sleep-time <b>BP</b> <b>is</b> highly prevalent in diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and RH, and significantly more frequent than elevated daytime BP. Furthermore, prevalence of isolated-office hypertension was up to three times higher when defined only by the daytime BP mean, than jointly by the daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> means. Despite current recommendations, use of the 24 h BP mean to diagnose isolated-office hypertension, as done by de la Sierra et al., is inadequate; a “normal” 24 h <b>BP</b> mean <b>is</b> not a guarantee of a normal <b>nighttime</b> <b>BP</b> mean. Subjects with the same 24 h BP mean might have a BP pattern ranging from extreme-dipping to rising (asleep BP mean > awake BP mean), with potentially markedly different CVD risk. Elevated sleep-time <b>BP</b> <b>is</b> a better predictor of CVD risk than awake or 24 h BP means, and treatment-induced reduction of sleep-time BP in hypertension has been prospectively shown {{to be the most}} significant independent predictor of event-free survival. In conclusion, de la Sierra et al. cannot challenge findings from randomized, prospective clinical trials consistently reporting that bedtime ingestion of hypertension medications improves BP control and increases CVD event-free survival of RH patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{predictive}} value of ambulatory blood pressure (BP) vs office BP for cardiovascular events during a 5. 8 -year follow-up period in the obese and nonobese participants of the Ambulatory Blood Pressure-International Study (n= 10, 817). Both ambulatory BP and office <b>BP</b> considered separately <b>were</b> predictive of cardiovascular events. However, in Cox models including both pressures, only ambulatory <b>BP</b> <b>was</b> associated with outcome. Among obese patients, the hazard ratios for a 10 -mm Hg increase in 24 -hour and office systolic <b>BPs</b> <b>were</b> 1. 37 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 20 - 1. 53) and 0. 91 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 76 - 1. 07), respectively. Among nonobese patients, the corresponding hazard ratios were 1. 39 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 31 - 1. 47) and 0. 94 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 88 - 1. 00) (P=not significant vs obese). Similar results were obtained for diastolic BP and for daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>BPs.</b> Ambulatory BP has similar predictive capacity in obese and nonobese patients, suggesting that ambulatory <b>BP</b> monitoring <b>is</b> a useful diagnostic tool for the assessment of obese individuals...|$|R
