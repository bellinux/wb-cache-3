5|$|Wildlife is {{the second}} studio album by American post-hardcore band La Dispute, {{released}} October 4, 2011, on independent label <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> Records. Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. The band members took control {{of all of the}} production duties alongside the album's recording engineers, Andrew Everding and Joseph Pedulla. Wildlife was their last release on <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> Records before forming their own record label, Better Living.|$|E
5|$|Breaking Benjamin {{began working}} on a fourth album, titled Dear Agony, in 2009. It was the first album Burnley wrote while {{completely}} sober. In 2007, Burnley experienced fatigue and phosphenes following three consecutive days of <b>no</b> <b>sleep</b> and heavy drinking, after which he decided to remain sober. Burnley acknowledged an improved clarity and coherence within Dear Agony due to his sobriety. The album cover features Burnley's brain scan, representing the recurrent themes on Dear Agony related to the singer's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the NWOBHM {{had broken}} into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a {{significant}} influence on metal's development. In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> 'til Hammersmith.|$|E

5|$|The band {{embarked}} on a world tour in 1997 to promote the album, which included dates in Europe, the US and Australia. On May 30, 1998, they performed at the Dynamo Open Air festival in Eindhoven, Netherlands, then continued touring the next month in Europe. In June 1998, the group released <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> 'till Bedtime, a live album containing songs performed at a 1997 performance at the HiFi Bar and Ballroom in Melbourne, Australia. Century Media was not initially interested in releasing a live record, but impressed with Townsend's production, the label agreed to release it. The band closed the year playing a few more dates in Japan and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or <b>no</b> <b>sleep</b> and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

5000|$|Fiction {{was less}} gloomy than the Comsats' {{previous}} album, <b>Sleep</b> <b>No</b> More. Frontman Stephen Fellows {{said of the}} change: [...] "I certainly didn't want to make another record as intense as <b>Sleep</b> <b>No</b> More — at least not immediately. <b>Sleep</b> <b>No</b> More was so dark that I felt it skewed things a bit — possibly even mentally for me. I just felt if we carried on in that direction it'd lead to madness or maybe even something worse".|$|R

25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to {{how difficult it}} is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had <b>no</b> <b>sleep</b> problems.|$|E
500|$|La Dispute's {{record label}} <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> {{produced}} 5,000 copies for Wildlife's first pressing, adamant {{that they would}} all sell.

500|$|The band's humorous {{approach}} was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled [...] "Far Beyond Metal", {{a parody of}} classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used [...] "Blame Canada", a comedic anti-Canada song from [...] as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.|$|E

500|$|On June 23, 2008, it was {{announced}} Solo would be the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In a reversal of roles from the 2004 Olympics, Briana Scurry {{did not make the}} team, though she was an alternate. On August 21, the U.S. women's team won the gold medal by defeating Brazil 1–0 in extra time, in no small measure due to Solo's performance as she stopped an energetic Brazilian attack, making save after save. After the team won gold, Solo appeared on NBC Today Show, and she stated in a 2012 article appearing in ESPN The Magazine that she was drunk while on air. [...] "When we were done partying, we got out of our dresses, got back into our stadium coats and, at 7 a.m. with <b>no</b> <b>sleep,</b> went on the Today show drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} <b>no</b> <b>sleep.</b> Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|During their dawn to dusk fight, the 15 {{remaining}} {{men of the}} I&R platoon {{plus the}} four men of the 371st Artillery Forward Observation Team repeatedly engaged elements of the 1st Battalion, 9th Fallschirmjäger [...] Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjäger Division of about 500 men. The Germans reported 16 killed, 63 wounded, and 13 missing in action. Other reports say the Americans inflicted between 60 and five hundred casualties on the Germans. Only one American, forward artillery observer Billy Queen, was killed; in Bouck's platoon, 14 out of 18 men were wounded. The small American force had seriously disrupted the scheduled advance of the entire 6th Panzer Army's drive for Antwerp along the critical northern edge of the offensive. After virtually <b>no</b> <b>sleep</b> during the preceding night and {{a full day of}} almost non-stop combat, with only a few rounds of ammunition remaining, flanked by a superior enemy force, the platoon and artillery observers were captured.|$|E

500|$|Although MacFarlane enjoyed {{working at}} Hanna-Barbera, {{he felt his}} real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor. He first pitched Family Guy to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A {{development}} executive for Hanna-Barbera, {{who was trying to}} get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of King of the Hill in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million). Recalling the experience in an interview with The New York Times, MacFarlane stated, [...] "I spent about six months with <b>no</b> <b>sleep</b> and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot".|$|E
500|$|The band Motörhead {{was founded}} in 1975 by already {{experienced}} musicians. Their leader Ian [...] "Lemmy" [...] Kilmister was {{a former member of}} the space rock band Hawkwind, Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies, and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions program and the first to reach No.1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album <b>No</b> <b>Sleep</b> 'til Hammersmith in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, [...] "the NWOBHM... didn't do us much good", because Motörhead [...] "came along a bit too early for it".|$|E
500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday. Only five games {{remained in the}} regular season, with the Warriors (46–29) in second place—eleven games behind the Boston Celtics—and the Knicks in last place. Chamberlain {{had spent the night}} before the game in New York City, partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6am With <b>no</b> <b>sleep</b> and suffering from a hangover, he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8am, met several friends at the Philadelphia train station, and had a long lunch with them, thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey. The other players were similarly bored. Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my life was to see that. There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ... The town of Hershey was built around a huge chocolate factory; everything there became permeated with the smell of chocolate. It was practically impossible to stay indoors; people felt sick. I was just dreaming to leave the place as fast as I could." ...|$|E
