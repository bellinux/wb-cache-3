50|$|The glass {{industry}} has been converting to oxy-fuel since the early 1990s because glass furnaces require a temperature of approximately 2800 degrees F, which is not attainable at adiabatic flame temperatures for air-fuel combustion unless heat is regenerated between the flue stream and the incoming air stream. Historically, glass furnace regenerators were large and expensive high temperature brick ducts filled with brick arranged in a checkerboard pattern to capture heat as flue gas exits the furnace. When the flue duct is thoroughly heated, air flow is reversed and the flue duct becomes the air inlet, releasing its heat into the incoming air, and allowing for higher furnace temperatures than can be attained with air-fuel only. Two sets of regenerative flue ducts allowed for the air flow to be reversed at regular intervals, and thus maintain a high temperature in the incoming air. By allowing new furnaces to be built without the expense of regenerators, and especially with {{the added benefit of}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>reduction,</b> which allows glass plants to meet emission restrictions, oxy-fuel is cost effective without the need to reduce CO2 emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion also reduces CO2 release at the glass plant location, although this may be offset by CO2 production due to electric power generation which is necessary to produce oxygen for the combustion process.|$|E

40|$|Competition for {{electrons}} {{among different}} steps of denitrification {{has previously been}} shown to occur, and {{to play an important}} role in the accumulation and emission of N 2 O in wastewater treatment. However, this electron competition is not recognized in the current denitrification models, limiting their ability to predict N 2 O accumulation during denitrification. In this work, a new denitrification model is developed for wastewater treatment processes. It describes electron competition among the four steps of denitrification, through modeling the carbon oxidation and nitrogen reduction processes separately, in contrast to the existing models that directly couple these two types of processes. Electron carriers are introduced to link carbon oxidation, which donates electrons to carriers, and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>reduction,</b> which receives electrons from these carriers. The relative ability of each denitrification step to compete for electrons is modeled through the use of different affinity constants with reduced carriers. Model calibration and validation results demonstrate that the developed model is able to reasonably describe the nitrate, nitrite, and N 2 O reduction rates of a methanol-utilizing denitrifying culture under various carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> supplying conditions.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{some aspects}} of the {{pyrolysis}} and combustion of biomass. The emphasis of the work is on the formation of nitrogen-containing species under pyrolysis. Since the low nitrogen concentrations in biomass make identification of nitrogen-containing gases from biomass difficult, proteins have been used as model compounds for the nitrogen in wood. Apart from HCN and NH 3, HNCO has also been observed to be a pyrolysis product from wood bark as well as from all protein model compounds used. The temperature was found to have a marked impact on the distribution between the nitrogen-containing species. The temperature influence on the selectivity between HNCO and HCN was similar for the proteins and for cyclic amides, which are believed to be intermediate pyrolysis products from proteins. The results in this work indicate that the proteins in biomass pyrolyse without interaction with the other constituents of biomass. Hence, experiments with model compound proteins with amino acid compositions similar to that found in the biomass of interest will give the same pyrolysis products as the biomass itself. The advantage of model compounds over biomass is that the pyrolysis products are easily quantified with high accuracy.

This is the principle behind NQO 1 anti-tumor drugs. Compounds of the quinone family such as mitomycin C are efficiently bioactivated by NQO 1, a cytosolic two-electron reductase. This enzyme activates anti-tumor pro-drugs and is thus a necessary agent for their anti-tumor activity (Begleiter et al. 1997).

This work analyses the impact of several mobility strategies on urban emissions in the coastal city of Barcelona, Spain, when the High Elective Resolution Modelling Emission System (HERMES) is applied {{at a very high}} resolution (1 km × 1 km and 1 h). The analysis was conducted by projecting the emissions data obtained from a base case scenario in 2004 onto three future scenarios set in 2015, where each future scenario represented a set of traffic mobility management measures. Specific developments were considered per emission sector, including power generation, industrial activities, domestic– commercial, solvents, on–road traffic, biogenic emissions, ports and airports, to best compare the present base case scenario with the future mobility scenarios generated for 2015. These emission scenarios for 2015 take into account the population projections and the variations in port and airport activities among other factors, while the main focus is on the on–road traffic sector, the types of vehicles used, such as technologically improved buses and hybrid vehicles, as well as the types of fuels used, including natural gas and biofuels. The results of the emission model indicate that the mobility management strategies, the technological improvements and the use of alternative fuels reduce the emissions from on–road traffic by approximately 75 % (in terms of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission <b>reductions</b> in the city centre of Barcelona). This decrease leads to a 35 % <b>reduction</b> in overall <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emissions, even if some sectors individually experience increases based on their specific projections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> (NOx) emission <b>reduction</b> from a diesel engine using the Miller cycle was carried out. A Lister–Petter diesel engine, type TS 2, {{was used for}} the experiments. Three versions of Miller cycles were designed and realized on a diesel engine. A series of tests were carried out on the test rig to compare the performances and emissions of the original engine (standard dual cycle) with those of the three versions of Miller cycles. The test results from the standard dual cycle and from the three versions of Miller cycles showed that applying Miller cycle to the diesel engine could reduce the NOx emis-sion from the diesel engine. The reduction ratios of NOx for the Miller cycles are from 4. 4 to 17. 5 per cent. The best reduction effect is Miller cycle 1 and the reduction rates of NOx are from 11. 0 to 17. 5 per cent...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, the U. S. {{consumed}} over 18 {{million barrels}} per day of refined petroleum products and biofuels; almost 22 % of global petroleum consumption. This includes oil used for transportation, electricity, and production of consumer products. More than half of this oil was imported from foreign countries, and in his 2006 State of the Union Address President Bush warned that, “We have a serious problem, America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world”. With the need for new energy sources more apparent than ever, serious research is needed to further the advancement of alternative fuels, so that they may become a more practical source of energy. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel to petroleum diesel, and is produced from renewable and/or recycled resources. Biodiesel’s benefits include reduced emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides,</b> plus <b>reduction</b> of greenhouse gas emissions. The process of making biodiesel involves transesterification of triacyl-glycerides in Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO) with methanol, using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst. Research in Dr. Brush’s group has focused on developing an efficient and cost-effective process for converting 50 liter (13 gallon) batches of Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO) from BSU cafeterias into biodiesel fuel for campus use. However, in a detailed analysis of our efficiency in producing biodiesel by this traditional process, we found that this “simple” transesterification reaction is only one small part of a complex, interrelated, and inefficient overall production process...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from {{light-duty}} {{passenger vehicles}} represent {{a significant portion}} of total criteria pollutant emissions in the United States. Since the 1970 s, emissions testing of these vehicles has been required in many major metropolitan areas, including Atlanta, GA, that were designated to be in non-attainment for {{one or more of the}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards. While emissions inspections have successfully reduced emissions by identifying and repairing high emitting vehicles, they have been increasingly inefficient as emissions control systems have become more durable and fewer vehicles are in need of repair. Currently, only about 9 % of Atlanta area vehicles fail emissions inspection, but every vehicle is inspected annually. This research addresses explores ways to create a more efficient emissions testing program while continuing to use existing testing infrastructure. To achieve this objective, on road vehicle emissions data were collected as a part of the Continuous Atlanta Fleet Evaluation program sponsored the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. These remote sensing data were combined with in-program vehicle inspection data from the Atlanta Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program to establish the degree to which on road vehicle remote sensing could be used to enhance program efficiency. Based on this analysis, a multi-parameter model was developed to predict the probability of a particular vehicle failing an emissions inspection. The parameters found to influence the probability of failure include: vehicle characteristics, ownership history, vehicle usage, previous emission test results, and remote sensing emissions readings. This model was the foundation for a proposed emissions testing program that would create variable timing for vehicle retesting with high and low failure probability vehicles being more and less frequently, respectively, than the current annual cycle. Implementation of this program is estimated to reduce fleet emissions of 17 % for carbon monoxide, 11 % for hydrocarbons, and 5 % for <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> in Atlanta. These reductions would be achieved very cost-effectively at an estimated marginal cost of $ 149, $ 7, 576 and $ 2, 436 per-ton-per-year for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emissions <b>reductions</b> respectfully.
