At the beginning stage, {{there were only}} small DC networks within the local boundaries, which were able to cover of industrial plants. An increasing demand on energy, technology changed to be transmitted from DC to AC power and voltage levels. The driving force for the {{development of}} power systems is the increase of electrical power demand. Therefore, power system developed from the regional to national systems. To achieve technical and economic advantages, extend further to large continental systems by applying interconnections to the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper will treat benefits of HVDC and FACTS devices applied in power systems such as increased power transmission capability, improved static and dynamic stability, an increase of a availability and a decrease of transmission losses by using power Electronics techniques...|$|E
40|$|Angular {{distributions}} of elastic scatterings for 19 F + 208 Pb system have been measured at six energies around the Coulomb barrier. It is {{found that the}} real and imaginary potentials show pronounced energy dependence {{in terms of the}} phenomenological optical model analysis. The real parts of potentials extracted from the fusion data are similar to those from the elastic data. A comparison with the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>systems</b> of 16 O + 208 Pb and 16 O + 209 Bi reveals that the 19 F deformations {{play an important role in}} the fusion reaction. Based on the deformed and energy dependent barrier penetration model, the calculated fusion cross sections and mean-square spin distribution agree with the experimental data well. Moreover, it is indicated that the enhancement of fusion cross sections attributes to the dynamic polarization effects around the barrier, and to the static deformation effects further below the barrier. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} {{evidence of a}} coral (Oulastrea crispata) ingesting and assimilating seagrass material.

To investigate whether seagrass nutrient uptake via coral heterotrophy is possible, we conducted a feeding experiment with seagrass particulate and dissolved organic matter. Using gut extractions and stable isotope analyses, we determined that O. crispata ingested 15 N-enriched seagrass particles and assimilated the nitrogen into its tissue at a rate of 0. 75 µg N cm- 2 h- 1. Corals took up nitrogen from dissolved matter at a comparable rate of 0. 98 µg N cm- 2 h- 1. While other ecological connections between seagrass meadows and reef ecosystems are well known, our results suggest a previously unstudied direct nutritional link between seagrasses and corals...|$|E
40|$|Marginal outage {{costs are}} an {{important}} component of electricity spot prices. This paper describes a methodology based on quantitative power system reliability concepts for calculating these costs in electric generating systems. The proposed method involves the calculation of the incremental expected unserved energy at a given operating reserve level and lead time and the multiplication of this value by the average cost of unserved energy of the generating system. An extension of the proposed method is applied to interconnected generating systems in order to calculate the impact of assistance from <b>neighbouring</b> <b>systems</b> on the marginal outage cost profile of the assisted system. This method is based on the equivalent assisting unit approach. The methods discussed in this paper are illustrated by calculating the marginal outage cost profile of a small educational test system and by examining the effect of selected modelling assumptions and parameters to see how simplified representations can be used to approximate the results obtained using more detailed reliability models.

Integration of VSD motor systems (Integral Motor) while partially reducing some of these effects, adds to immunity problem of their embedded systems.

In this paper an integral motor with a unique design is proposed to overcome critical issues such as heat, vibration and electromagnetic interference which are damaging to sensitive electronics without requirement of any additional cooling system. Advantages of the proposed Integral motor are compactness of combo motor and drive system with no external cabling/wiring.

30|$|The {{motivation}} {{to investigate the}} system behaviour on the considered day is the availability of wind power and high load demand {{in a large scale}} wind power integrated power system. The availability of wind allows the WPPs to generate more power than conventional power plants and also positive power exports with <b>neighbouring</b> power <b>systems.</b> The power exports are calculated by subtracting the total export power from total import power with <b>neighbouring</b> power <b>systems.</b> On the specific day in Eastern Denmark, the conventional power plants generated 33.31  GWh of electricity, while WPPs generated 43.2  GWh, i.e. 56.46  % of the total electricity production. The high production from WPPs allows the power exports of 32.75  GWh from Eastern Danish power system, when the load demand was 43.75  GWh. Similarly in Western Denmark, 45.77  GWh is generated from conventional power plants and 59.53  GWh from WPP, i.e. 56.53  %. While, the total load demand and the power exports are 63.98  GWh and 41.27  GWh, respectively. It can also be noted that on specific day, WPP contributed 98.7  % and 93  % of the total load demand in Eastern and Western Danish power system, respectively.|$|R
