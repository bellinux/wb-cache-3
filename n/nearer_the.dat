5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire.

5|$|Conrad rebuilt and {{expanded}} Salzburg Cathedral {{and built the}} cathedral chapter house, and in 1140 he created the cathedral cemetery. He built hospitals for the poor of the city, and commenced construction of St. Peter's monastery where his former residence stood, moving to a new archbishop's residence <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. Conrad founded several monasteries and reformed others, a total of 17 in which {{the rule of the}} Augustinian Canons Regular prevailed. These included St. Zeno, Gurk, Reichersberg, Berchtesgaden, Baumburg, Gars am Inn, Au am Inn, Ranshofen, Höglwörth, Herrenchiemsee, Seckau and Suben. The archbishop supported the Benedictines.|$|E
5|$|Finding its {{locomotive}} {{works at}} Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction {{on a new}} works at Inverurie in 1898, electric lighting being provided in the buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are listed Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> works in 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, lit by electricity generated at the works, and the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club was formed by staff in 1902.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation.

30|$|Other endwall suction schemes {{minimally}} {{influence the}} distribution of exit flow angles. The variations are mainly <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall. The overturning of flow angles <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall decreases because these endwall suction schemes decrease the cross-passage pressure gradient <b>near</b> <b>the</b> end wall, especially between the suction surface and the suction slot.

5|$|On 30 September 1968, Vice Admiral Elmo Zumwalt assumed {{command of}} Naval Forces Vietnam and he {{redirected}} {{the focus of}} interdiction operations conducted by TF115 to areas <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> DMZ {{as a part of}} Operation Sealords (Southeast Asia Lake, Ocean, River, and Delta Strategy). The result was that all but four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft U.S. Navy PCFs that had been used for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E

5|$|The Levels were {{frequently}} flooded {{by the sea}} during high tides, a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20thcentury. In addition, the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the Parrett, {{which is the only}} river in the Levels and Moors that does not have a clyse on it. Discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the Parrett and whether it should be sited at Bridgwater or <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the river date back to 1939, at the start of World War II, and have not been resolved.|$|E
5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved {{too small for the}} football club's needs. They built a new stadium <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily built-up area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street of the same name remains.|$|E

The most low-lying area of the central plain, south of the salt lake, is water-logged in winter; it is vegetated by a dense mat of Sarcocornia quinqueflora (beaded samphire), Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) and Suaeda australis (seablite).|$|E

5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> top of the stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E

5|$|Cricket {{has been}} played in Hadspen, at Entally and grounds <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> town's centre, {{since at least}} the 1860s. The cricket oval at Entally {{was one of the first}} in Australia and was hosting matches before Melbourne's foundation. During his side's 1874 tour of Australia the great English cricketer W. G. Grace played on the ground. Aside from cricket Entally's grounds were often open for picnics and grand annual events. The Hadspen Chieftains cricket club was formed in the 1987–88 season and plays as part of the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association. They won the association's A grade premiership in the 1991–92 and 1993–94 seasons, and the Charltons Cup Premiershipa {{combined}} competition with the North East Cricket Associationin the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the docks}} {{declined}} in use and were finally closed in 1980, {{leading to the}} setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981.

The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted {{to the needs of}} modern container ships in 1968, and so they survived the closure of the inner docks.
