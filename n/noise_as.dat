5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway <b>noise</b> <b>as</b> compared to vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or {{the visually impaired}} consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E

The cast and crew were well received by the locals, as was the director who, along with the cast, was invited by Arvind Singh Mewar, the Maharaja of Udaipur, to attend his lavish Diwali celebrations and firework display, as well as attend a royal wedding held at the Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur.

5|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>as</b> {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that the}} risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E

However, Harold makes some <b>noise.</b> <b>As</b> Merrigan prepares to shoot Harold, the police arrive to arrest Merrigan, but just then, he shoots at Dr. Kroger. Harold intercepts the bullet in his chest and Merrigan is taken away.|$|E

5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing <b>noise</b> <b>as</b> a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a <b>noise</b> <b>as</b> his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a <b>noise</b> <b>as</b> his head hit the ground.|$|E
30|$|Representation of {{wide band}} <b>noises</b> <b>as</b> a {{distributed}} delay of white noises became fruitful {{in order to}} derive Kalman filtering equations for pointwise delayed white <b>noises</b> <b>as</b> well. Such <b>noises</b> arise in real cases when a communication between the observer and the object takes considerable time. For example, in [11, 12] the case when the signal is corrupted by pointwise delayed white noise is suggested {{for the improvement of}} the preciseness of the Global Positioning Systems. A basic tool for derivation of Kalman filtering equations for pointwise delayed white noises, used in [11, 13], is an approximation of a white noise by wide band noises.|$|R

5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated <b>noise</b> <b>as</b> a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E
5|$|The Report to the Minister for Defence on the Collins class {{submarine}} {{and related}} matters (commonly {{referred to as}} the McIntosh-Prescott Report) was compiled in ten weeks, and released on 1 June 1999. This report concluded that the Collins class was incapable of performing at the required level for military operations. Although the report highlighted several elements of the submarine design that performed to or beyond expectations, and acknowledged that many of the publicised problems had been or {{were in the process of}} being fixed, it presented the propulsion system, combat system, and excessive <b>noise</b> <b>as</b> ongoing problems across the class. After identifying the combat system as the central problem, McIntosh and Prescott recommended that it be scrapped entirely and replaced with a system based on commercially available equipment and software. They also claimed that these problems were caused by poor design and manufacture; inappropriate design requirements; deficiencies in the structure of the contract, particularly with regards to modifying the contract to meet changing requirements; and problems between the various parties involved in the construction of the submarines, with a lack of overall direction and conflicts of interest causing avoidable hostility and uncooperativeness. Despite the report being promoted by the government as 'ground-breaking', many people involved with the Collins-class project later claimed that large sections of the report could have been copied from reports previously submitted by the RAN or ASC.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{what happens}} when you hear <b>noises</b> <b>as</b> meaningful speech. The phenomenon is entirely familiar.

You {{have no choice but to}} experience the emitted <b>noises</b> <b>as</b> meaningful speech. But what account should philosophers and linguists give of this phenomenon. Speech sounds, linguists tell us, are not found in the world but in the minds of speakers who attach linguistic significance to particular acoustic signals. Philosophers, on the other hand, tell us that the meanings of words must be publicly available in overt speech behaviour, otherwise they would be private and incommunicable. How can we respect both these views while preserving the phenomenological claim that we hear meaning in people's speech...|$|R
